00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,140
Hello.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,500
I went to the same college as Yu Hao.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,684
Vice President of Goldman Sachs,

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,340
Shen Zhilin.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,040
Hello. I'm Su Kelan.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm in charge of the company's listing preparations.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,960
If you have any ideas or a proposal for cooperation

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,820
feel free to let us know. It'll be a pleasure to work with Goldman Sachs.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,952
I prepared a little gift for everyone.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,260
Beluga's caviar.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,500
They produce less than a hundred of these a year.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,160
Look at this stuff. It is extremely expensive.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,020
Jesus.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,740
Hold this.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,300
Very delectable.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,420
Precious people deserve a precious gift.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,120
Director Su,

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,860
please have a taste.

19
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,240
It is good.

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,980
You can serve them now.

21
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,340
Thank you.

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,960
Thank you.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,800
Aren't you allergic to mangoes?

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,820
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,750
I'm glad you remember.

26
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,140
[Dine with Love]

27
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,484
[Episode 12]
[Caviar: It is expensive, but I don't like it]

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,620
Didn't you just come from the dinner party?

29
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,380
Did Yu Hao not let you eat enough?

30
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,780
You know nothing. In a place where the elites gather, how can I eat openly?

31
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
If you open your mouth too much then the food may fall.

32
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,100
I must stay elegant at all times.

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,200
My dress was in the smallest size.

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,920
If I'd eaten too much, my belly would have bulged.

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,640
And a guy there kept saying, "How do you do?" I wished he'd stop!

36
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,645
Shouldn't they learn some Chinese since they're in China?

37
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,000
Do as the Romans do, okay?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,600
He couldn't even understand, "Have you eaten?"

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,086
But you were so desperate to attend it!

40
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:35,853
Why didn't you just flip the table?

41
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,560
Saying these things behind their back is nothing to be proud of.

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,140
I call it self-restraint.

43
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,120
No matter how annoyed I am,

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,696
I still wouldn't disobey the basics of social etiquette.

45
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,186
Self-restraint?

46
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:48,890
Self-restraint is when you don't say things behind their back either.

47
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,359
You're just two-faced.

48
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,659
Whatever!

49
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,630
The person who never talks behind someone's back is the hypocrite.

50
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm full!

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,720
If you attend similar parties in the future, don't wear such tight dresses anymore.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,120
No one wants to stare at your waist.

53
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,370
That's only you!

54
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,476
Why would they ask me to attend if no one wanted to look at me?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,668
Do you think I don't know?

56
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,712
The whole world only considers me as eye candy.

57
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:24,072
I will just play my role.

58
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:27,908
I went there to work, not to eat dinner.

59
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:37,800
Fine, fine. Anyway,

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,140
your work is over. So just... relax.

61
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,148
But I couldn't even be the eye candy.

62
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:49,400
An attendant was some God man sucks wei pae.

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,960
She even brought some extremely expensive caviar.

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,800
All the people gathered around her.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,620
It was disgusting! It was not even as delicious as this capelin.

66
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,240
Boss, one more share, please!

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,940
God man sucks wei pae?

68
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,340
What does that mean?

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,500
Don't you know?

70
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,660
It is said to be the best investment bank for the Wall Street elites or whatever.

71
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,952
They just came up with a name.

72
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,816
Goldman Sachs...

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,704
Goldman Sachs?

74
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,932
Wei pae... You're talking about VP, aren't you?

75
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:25,460
I think so...

76
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,890
VP of Goldman Sachs?

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,700
Is... Jacqueline, Shen...

78
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,610
Shen Zhilin?

79
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Are you angry?

80
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,740
No.

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,064
I didn't know she was coming.

82
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,640
I know.

83
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,213
I was doing it subconsciously.

84
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,593
And her mango allergy really is serious.

85
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,720
You were together for six years.

86
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,056
It is normal for you to remember things like this.

87
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,300
Why don't you wash up first?

88
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,230
I will handle the packing.

89
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,870
What's the matter?

90
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,740
- Honey.
- Huh?

91
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,390
I'm quite ethical.

92
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,520
Shall we go get a marriage license tomorrow?

93
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,320
Then we can make love under the protection of the law.

94
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm going to take a shower.

95
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,740
During that time,

96
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,080
calm down and think it over well.

97
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:32,140
They say that the VP of Goldman Sachs who attended the dinner party is President Yu's ex-girlfriend.

98
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,188
Damn it!

99
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,320
Meng Meng, don't be too hasty!

100
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,714
Yu Hao's ex-girlfriend is haunting us again. What's going on here?

101
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:43,650
What?

102
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,360
Really?

103
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,700
So dramatic. Bye.

104
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,140
Guess what?

105
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,788
That caviar woman is Yu Hao's ex-girlfriend!

106
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:59,300
She wasn't invited to the dinner, but she attended anyway.

107
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,220
What? Shen Zhilin came back?

108
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:04,595
She wasn't on the list at all.

109
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,432
She went there uninvited.

110
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,540
How shameless!

111
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,630
I bet she thinks she can visit his apartment as well!

112
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,440
Don't worry, Meng Meng. I know Yu Hao.

113
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,468
It was a clean breakup.

114
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:17,640
Since Shen Zhilin came back on behalf of Goldman Sachs

115
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,766
then they will only talk about business.

116
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,313
Maybe they'll just talk about work.

117
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,993
You are too simple-minded.

118
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:27,656
I could tell at a glance what that caviar woman was thinking.

119
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,600
She is trying to get more chances to interact with Yu Hao

120
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,924
under the guise of work and to get back together.

121
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,700
Do you want them to have more opportunities to get back together?

122
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,552
Won't it be fine if they simply don't interact?

123
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:41,593
Besides, you said that Goldman Sachs wasn't on the list, right?

124
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:44,219
This means Yu Hao already knows what he should do. His mind is clear.

125
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,620
He won't cause himself and your best friend any trouble.

126
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,520
No.

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,344
Yu Hao is rational and work-oriented.

128
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,772
Why is he prematurely refusing and avoiding her?

129
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,300
He must have some burden in his mind.

130
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:04,210
Every path is wrong.

131
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,248
Why are women so troublesome?

132
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,300
You won't understand.

133
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,120
What's the matter?

134
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,280
The password to Yu Hao's apartment hasn't been changed.

135
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,400
What do you mean?

136
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,972
He and Shen Zhilin set it together.

137
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:22,920
What?

138
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,596
Even though I don't want to

139
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,500
I still get upset about his ex-girlfriend.

140
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,600
Because even if all traces of her are erased,

141
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,356
she will still live in his memory forever.

142
00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:44,520
I can remove those traces,

143
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,564
but I can't remove someone from another person's mind.

144
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,200
The password is the same as before. Your birthday plus mine.

145
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm here to discuss work, particularly about the underwriting for going public.

146
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,380
"Discuss work"? Is it necessary to break into my house to discuss work?

147
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,208
You know my work style. I never give up easily.

148
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,240
Infringing on a customer's privacy is crossing the line.

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,560
But you've never separated your life and work, right?

150
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,420
When you started your business, Wang Yi and others always came to your place, didn't they?

151
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,240
Or could we say that

152
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,580
you're too sensitive about our relationship?

153
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,640
It is already in the past.

154
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,276
I don't even care. Why do you?

155
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,092
Would a normal partner open the door to

156
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:18,692
a potential customer without consent?

157
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:24,196
If the password to a customer's door was set together with that partner and that password was never changed,

158
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:27,280
I'd guess that you'd probably be willing to let me in.

159
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,820
Please leave.

160
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,200
My husband told me Yu Hao hasn't changed his password for a long time. It is not safe.

161
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,320
Remind him to change it.

162
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,940
Has someone put out any gossip on WeChat?

163
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,760
Don't worry about that. Just change the password.

164
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,223
What's wrong?

165
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:06,130
There's no need. She's already here.

166
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,640
Wow!

167
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,684
Is she crazy?

168
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,708
If I'm truly disturbing you,

169
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,620
I apologize.

170
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,860
I will wait for you downstairs in the coffee shop.

171
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,992
Kick her out right now!

172
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,180
How many people know your apartment password?

173
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,300
Did you hear it all?

174
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,340
Why didn't you come out then?

175
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,979
How? And what could I have said?

176
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,600
She found out at the party that you had a new girlfriend,

177
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,520
but she still broke into your house like this.

178
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,748
Did she really want to discuss work?

179
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,480
How could that be?

180
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,612
She surely knows I'm here

181
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,920
and did it on purpose to let me see.

182
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,120
What could I have done even if I went outside?

183
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,100
If I had shown my anger, that would have been exactly what she wanted. Then I, as a VP, would have

184
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,220
looked unprofessional had I placed private interests ahead of public ones.

185
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,960
But if you'd asked me to be calm,

186
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,476
I'm not an actor. I don't want to act.

187
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,060
If she wants to discuss work,

188
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,760
then let's do it.

189
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,830
At this hour?

190
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:48,800
So do you want to talk outside? Or shall we ask her to come back?

191
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,560
Get dressed. Let's go.

192
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,080
President Yu, it is after work hours, and I've been working all day.

193
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,120
- I'm tired and I need to rest.
- Contacting the underwriters is also within the scope of your work responsibilities.

194
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,320
It'll be done in half an hour. I will pay you overtime.

195
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,820
Okay, then.

196
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,700
If I'm working overtime, it will be as an employee.

197
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,620
Once it is finished, I will go back to my own home.

198
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,820
After that, you may do whatever you want.

199
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,396
Hurry. I will also get ready.

200
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,688
Honey, Yu Hao can handle this himself.

201
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,492
I can see through her.

202
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,600
Kelan is also a VP now.

203
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,632
She can't bully Kelan so she came to meet Yu Hao one-on-one. Disgusting.

204
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,220
I won't let that happen.

205
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,620
Hell no!

206
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,220
- I will simply resign if something goes wrong.
- It won't come to that.

207
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,100
Why did he bring Kelan with him?

208
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,260
- "Because I'm honest and upright."
- Are you crazy?

209
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,933
You've come as well, Director Su.

210
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,807
Why didn't you show up upstairs?

211
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:57,099
If you had, I wouldn't have had to go through the trouble of leaving.

212
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,379
We could have just stayed upstairs and discussed this.

213
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,960
Let go.

214
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,980
Our home is our private space.

215
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,540
It is meant for us to spend time together in, not for other purposes.

216
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,740
Aren't we here to talk about work? Then let's get on with it.

217
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,924
I hate wasting time,

218
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,956
especially when I'm off-duty.

219
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,020
This is our listing proposal.

220
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,240
Director Su, since you're preparing for the listing,

221
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,140
I believe you'll definitely make an objective and reasonable decision.

222
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,393
There is no need for her to read this.

223
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,420
What?

224
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,120
You want your girlfriend to be involved in the company's management

225
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,564
but don't trust her to make good decisions?

226
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,876
Whether she plays the role of my girlfriend or an executive,

227
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:05,460
I have the right to help her make decisions when she's being put in an unfair position.

228
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,440
You've always separated public and private interests well.

229
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,100
Can't we even talk about business after breaking up?

230
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,500
That's right.

231
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,540
Since we broke up, at work or in private,

232
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,480
I don't want to have any kind of contact with you.

233
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,431
So Goldman Sachs isn't being considered for this partnership.

234
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,536
I hope I've made everything very clear.

235
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,680
If there's nothing else,

236
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,820
we're going back upstairs to get some rest.

237
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,560
We're going.

238
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,580
Let's go home.

239
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,020
Yu Hao!

240
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,441
If you really don't care about our past,

241
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,197
then why are you so concerned about working with me?

242
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,910
It is not that I'm concerned, I simply don't want to.

243
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,080
I don't want you to have any illusions

244
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,608
or give my girlfriend any sense of insecurity.

245
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,796
Look! My nephew is rather great, right?

246
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,320
♫  Heartache mixed with sweetness  ♫

247
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,492
That was a sudden rain shower.

248
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:48,220
♫  The distance is both far and near  ♫

249
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,843
You... You clearly could have just called her to make it clear.

250
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:58,203
Why did you take me with you just to annoy her?

251
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:01,600
You had already broken up. Why did you deliberately anger her?

252
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,340
♫  I'm trapped in my hesitation  ♫

253
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,364
Call her?

254
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:10,800
Well, let me ask, should I have called her in front of you or in private?

255
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,620
If I had called her privately, wouldn't you have worried that there was still something between us?

256
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,340
Aren't you satisfied with the way I handled it just now?

257
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,020
♫  And muster up all my courage  ♫

258
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,664
Are you angry?

259
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,960
I remember someone saying that

260
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,560
whoever gets angry first will get punished.

261
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,852
Should I be punished or not?

262
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,120
♫  I won't allow myself to miss out on you  ♫

263
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,260
♫  You are so full of life  ♫

264
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,080
Someone had also said, "Once it is finished, I will go back to my own home."

265
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,424
Then... are you going home or not?

266
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,120
♫  I will abandon reason and do my best to fight for it  ♫

267
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,400
Let's wait for the rain to stop.

268
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,080
I've prepared a gift for you.

269
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,663
A gift?

270
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:35,280
It is at the door.

271
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,860
What gift? Why are you being so mysterious?

272
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,620
Go take a look,

273
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,492
and then you'll know.

274
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,740
Where is the gift?

275
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,120
What are you doing?

276
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,540
Did you change the password?

277
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,476
Guess the new password, and you will get the gift.

278
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,960
Childish.

279
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,676
It is neither your birthday nor mine.

280
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:32,096
Then at least give me a hint.

281
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:34,716
A hint?

282
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:37,272
You can ask questions.

283
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,500
Is it the date of some anniversary?

284
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,020
Yes.

285
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,200
You entered the wrong password twice.

286
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,820
You said it was an anniversary.

287
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,760
It is.

288
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,810
I entered the date you confessed.

289
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,200
That day is indeed important.

290
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,900
Is it not just one anniversary?

291
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,240
Here's a friendly hint.

292
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,760
It is

293
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,852
a combination of two anniversaries.

294
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,480
Who makes that kind of day an anniversary?

295
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,304
Why not?

296
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,120
Don't you remember it quite clearly?

297
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,700
Then... where's my gift?

298
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,656
Gift?

299
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,740
Hurry and get up. We'll be late for work.

300
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,968
It is my company. I make the rules.

301
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Yesterday,

302
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,470
you seemed to have forgotten to ask me about the gift.

303
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,960
Do you like it?

304
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,140
They're a pair?

305
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,560
Yes.

306
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,164
Let me help you put it on.

307
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,770
From now on, this part of you

308
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,340
belongs to me.

309
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,270
Okay.

310
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,307
Don't move.

311
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:17,300
What?

312
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,624
Last night was passionate, wasn't it?

313
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:27,300
I was so worried about you that I even went to your place to fight for you.

314
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,640
Did you come last night?

315
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,240
Yes.

316
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,800
But the hero didn't need my weapons.

317
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,440
Your boyfriend really did a great job.

318
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,312
This smell of love is disgusting.

319
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,490
How dare you laugh at me. Who's the one that remarried quietly?

320
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
I didn't "remarry quietly," okay?

321
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,070
Oh?

322
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,820
You're wearing the ring, but you haven't remarried yet?

323
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,520
Kelan, you were right.

324
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,640
The last time I got married, it was too hasty.

325
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,048
So we ended up having so many fights after we got married.

326
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,444
This time I've decided to be more cautious.

327
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,576
What will you do?

328
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:19,864
I've asked a master to figure out an auspicious day for us.

329
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,080
And he did it. It is the 18th of next month.

330
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,980
You're really uniquely "cautious."

331
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,800
Believe me.

332
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,100
The last time we didn't make these calculations,

333
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,160
so we kept arguing after getting married

334
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm telling you, you and Yu Hao should also look for a master to figure out the right day.

335
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Really.

336
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,560
You really have to do that.

337
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,700
Hello?

338
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,360
You really need to do that.

339
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,812
Director Shen, I think President Yu has made his thoughts concerning our collaboration very clear.

340
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,008
Then why have you still come to meet me?

341
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:33,440
Are you worried that I will be seen by your colleagues if I go upstairs and cause trouble?

342
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,400
I came here because I wanted to know more about the collaboration, you—

343
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,100
When we graduated from college

344
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,696
Yu Hao lost his phone.

345
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,760
He wanted to get these photos back.

346
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,040
But at the time, I didn't have all of them, either.

347
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,560
Some time back I met some schoolmates and they sent me these photos.

348
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,720
Help me share them with Yu Hao.

349
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,140
Why do you want me to share them instead of you doing it yourself?

350
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,000
We've already broken up.

351
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,940
It is not appropriate for me to share these.

352
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,060
Then do you think it is appropriate for me to share them?

353
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,944
Is it not?

354
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,060
Then forget it. Just pretend that I didn't say anything.

355
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,380
I will ask my friend to send them to him instead.

356
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,760
Director Shen, I came to meet you out of rational consideration.

357
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,460
I don't want to miss any potential partners.

358
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,060
If you have any ideas about our collaboration—

359
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,340
If you'd argued with your boyfriend and later wanted to make up,

360
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,100
what would you have done?

361
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,944
If we had broken up, and I was the one who broke it off,

362
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,120
I wouldn't haunt him.

363
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,508
Do you already know that I was the one who broke up with him?

364
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,000
Did he tell you that?

365
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,620
Actually, that's not what I meant.

366
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,360
At the time, I was at Goldman Sachs.

367
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,240
He had decided to return to China to start a business

368
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,440
and wanted me to come back with him.

369
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,432
At the time, I didn't want to come back.

370
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:27,560
I was angry with him because he didn't discuss it with me,

371
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,360
and just decided on his own.

372
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,776
We quarreled and I broke up with him in anger.

373
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,920
So you mean that

374
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,636
you regret it.

375
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,996
Actually, I can understand why he chose you.

376
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,436
I'm dominating, and he's under too much pressure.

377
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,920
He needs someone who is compatible with him.

378
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,272
Do you think he's with me just because of my obedience?

379
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,932
They say you're good at cooking

380
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,920
and taking care of people.

381
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,460
They also say that you used to be in the public relations department.

382
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,520
Before being promoted to the director position, you never wanted to work overtime

383
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,140
because you had to take care of your family.

384
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,060
But now that you and Yu Hao are so busy at work, what about your family?

385
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,352
Can you balance it?

386
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,080
Director Shen, I don't think you're the kind of person who'd have meaningless conversations.

387
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,696
You can call me when you're ready to talk about business.

388
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,380
Let's be efficient and only discuss business.

389
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,832
Everything I'm saying is

390
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:33,660
business related.

391
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,660
If your family needs you, will you abandon your job?

392
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,868
Will you cause any business-related loss?

393
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,044
In our lives we all face trade-offs.

394
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:53,020
I need to know whether my potential partners

395
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,110
consider work as their priority.

396
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,684
President Yu, look.

397
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:04,680
We investigated the background of this company.

398
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,200
These are their financial reports from last year.

399
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,024
This company has had a very difficult year.

400
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,540
Why didn't you inform me before you came? Is this a spot check?

401
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,600
An Jie, please go get Director Su.

402
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,192
There's no rush.

403
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,760
I don't need to see her for now.

404
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,060
Yu Hao,

405
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,080
you're running the company.

406
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,080
So I hope that you'll act responsibly towards your investors.

407
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,700
You have come here intentionally, haven't you?

408
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,140
What's the matter?

409
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,200
You know what I'm talking about.

410
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,040
Since when have you been in a relationship?

411
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,560
Did you promote your girlfriend as the VP?

412
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,330
I didn't appoint her as VP because she's my girlfriend.

413
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,390
Is it because she is capable?

414
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,760
She's quite "capable,"

415
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,936
forcing you through social media?

416
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:19,316
What do you mean?

417
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,620
I wondered why her name sounded so familiar,

418
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,320
turns out it is because a few months back she posted a flirtatious video between the two of you

419
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,520
on her social media and caused quite a stir.

420
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,724
Don't tell me you forgot about that.

421
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,524
Did Shen Zhilin tell you that?

422
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,980
Yu Hao, as an old friend,

423
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,076
I know that you and she ended your relationship unpleasantly.

424
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,812
You're bossy,

425
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:53,016
and I understand that you want to find someone willing to listen to you.

426
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,320
Old Yang,

427
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,860
we're not just business partners but also schoolmates.

428
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,560
In terms of the grade, I should call you Senior.

429
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,920
And you've invested in my company since the angel round.

430
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,820
Do you really think that I have nothing better to do?

431
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,300
But I've no idea what kind of person Director Su is.

432
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,620
I like her not because she obeys me.

433
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,960
In fact, she rarely obeys me.

434
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,730
I like her because she has the care and warmth I don't have.

435
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:44,980
And her warmth helps employees and partners work more efficiently.

436
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,280
Senior,

437
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,520
since you have invested in my company, please trust me

438
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,468
and my personnel.

439
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,820
Director Shen, you said that I'm a good cook.

440
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
In order to cook well, seasoning is very important.

441
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,000
When reconciling various flavors there's no specific rule.

442
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,444
Life is the same.

443
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:20,780
I like cooking and am good at taking care of others.

444
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,080
That's because I can coordinate and create a relaxing atmosphere so that everyone can make progress,

445
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,860
not just because I'm a caretaker.

446
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,860
Yu Hao likes me not because I can bring him warmth,

447
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,412
but because I can make him more coordinative and considerate in his career.

448
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,360
You think he chose me just because he needs someone obedient.

449
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,616
You have totally underestimated me

450
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,310
and him.

451
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:58,532
When we meet next time, I hope we can save each other's time and only talk about business.

452
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,680
President Yang? Sorry I wasn't here earlier.

453
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,500
Your love life and personnel arrangement are all up to you.

454
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,584
I only care about business.

455
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:24,740
This time Shen Zhilin came back to introduce you to Frank from Yun Teng.

456
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,400
If the strategic investment deal gets finalized, it will help the company tremendously.

457
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,460
I will negotiate it myself. There's no need for any referrals.

458
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,460
When you had a hard time with capital, I invested in your company.

459
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,660
At that time, you'd promised me

460
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,119
that if I wanted to withdraw capital from your company, you would redeem it based on the latest valuation.

461
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,780
I remember.

462
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,860
Surely I remember.

463
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,940
If I'm not able to achieve the strategic investments, you can withdraw at any time.

464
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,080
Where did you go?

465
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,460
I went to a business meeting.

466
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,640
For the rest of the working hours, please don't go anywhere on your own.

467
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,280
We'll be very busy.

468
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,880
What? Yu Hao is not coming again?

469
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,360
What's the matter this time?

470
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,380
Sister Han Meng told me

471
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,980
that he's busy securing financers so he won't be available.

472
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,120
Sister Kelan also said so.

473
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,260
Fine. Schedule another guest to take his place.

474
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,920
Is Yu Hao not coming for the time being or permanently—

475
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
I'm leaving.

476
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,300
I'm leaving.

477
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,060
Sister Zhang Bi, when will you visit us again?

478
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,240
As soon as I'm free.

479
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,040
- Zhang Bi?
- Brother Jin Xuan!

480
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,400
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, Brother Jin Xuan!

481
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,580
Hello, hello.

482
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,960
- Go play.
- Go play.

483
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,700
Goodbye, Brother Jin Xuan. Goodbye, Sister Zhang Bi. Bye bye.

484
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,908
Go. Bye.

485
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,324
Why are you here?

486
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:28,344
I feel happier when I watch them play.

487
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,464
Are you still not in a good mood?

488
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,340
Hey, Yu Hao's ex-girlfriend, that "wei pae."
(T/N: VP)

489
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,432
I heard Yu Hao is ignoring her. Why would he be offending her?

490
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,860
He tried to avoid working with his ex.

491
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,140
But he filmed the commercial with me. That proves I'm unique to him.

492
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,320
Good, Zhang Bi. Get back on your feet!

493
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,720
Although Su Kelan helped you, when it comes to competition,

494
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,152
you can never be weak.

495
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:03,960
Sometimes there's no way for you to avoid working together.

496
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,680
For example, you and I are working in the same program.

497
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,780
If I've still got hope, so do you.

498
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,160
I am going back to work. Bye bye!

499
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,396
- I'm not as idle as you.
- Come on!

500
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:20,376
- Director Jin.
- Auntie. Are you here for your dialysis?

501
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,780
I just finished it. I've brought some toys for the children.

502
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,072
See you!

503
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,780
Just a picky guest in the program.

504
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,420
Do you have any other check-ups?

505
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,260
No. I'm going back soon.

506
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,768
Then let me drive you home.

507
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:43,900
- No, thanks. You are too kind.
- That's okay.

508
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,736
We said we would invite you to dinner,

509
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,560
but Kelan has been busy and is not available.

510
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,460
That's okay.

511
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,900
Auntie,

512
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,400
when Kelan is accompanying you for your physical examination,

513
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,880
and I am also visiting the children, shall we treat the children to a meal together?

514
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Sure.

515
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,970
[Mom]

516
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,288
Hello, Mom.

517
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:29,280
Has the takeout arrived yet?

518
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm sorry.

519
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,388
I've been so busy lately.

520
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:37,720
Are you doing a good job looking for investment?

521
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,580
It is going well. Don't worry.

522
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,436
Tell me about yourself.

523
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:44,860
How was the check-up today? Is everything okay?

524
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,024
I bumped into Director Jin at the hospital today.

525
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:50,780
He said that if we ever meet again,

526
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,260
we can have dinner together then.

527
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,060
Do you remember saying that you were going to invite Director Jin to dinner?

528
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,580
I'm sorry, Mom.

529
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,140
The next time you undergo dialysis, I will try to be there.

530
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,580
I'm not blaming you for not having the time to stay with me.

531
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,880
I'm okay by myself.

532
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,360
I'm talking seriously about Director Jin.

533
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
You never invited him to dinner.

534
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,740
Apart from being busy, aren't you feeling embarrassed?

535
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,820
Why don't you bring Yu Hao along?

536
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,490
Forget about it.

537
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,020
Mom, have dinner then.

538
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,620
Well, about treating Director Jin to dinner,

539
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,220
give me some time. I will arrange it.

540
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Okay. Take your time. See you.

541
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,860
Bye.

542
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:51,060
Remember to confirm the contracts with suppliers with Lawyer Shao.

543
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,380
Lawyer Shao replied that he would confirm in a minute.

544
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,790
Okay.

545
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,780
Yu Hao, when we're not too busy, can we have dinner together?

546
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,400
Sure.

547
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,240
I want to...

548
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,410
ask Director Jin to join us.

549
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,400
My mom went to the hospital for dialysis today and met Director Jin there.

550
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,970
He drove my mom home so I'm just thinking

551
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,340
whether I should treat him to dinner.

552
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,280
When we're not so busy, I will accompany auntie for her dialysis.

553
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,900
Okay.

554
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,970
Chuang Ying?

555
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,900
Are you planning to talk to Chairman Shi?

556
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,860
Yes. Replace Yun Teng directly with them.

557
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,360
But it is difficult.

558
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,040
Why?

559
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,300
I was surprised that you were interacting with so many investors

560
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,700
but never considered him.

561
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,560
Actually, when I started my business, I asked for his investment.

562
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,920
But he didn't invest. Later, the company grew.

563
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,660
When asked by the media if I had ever been rejected,

564
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,640
I ended up saying, "Li Shi is an idiot."

565
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,860
After that,

566
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,060
their investment group talked to me again and handed over our information to him

567
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,000
but ended up getting scolded.

568
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,460
So that's why Yang Zhen didn't want me to offend Shen Zhilin.

569
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,020
Because you've already offended all that you could offend.

570
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,280
But this time's different.

571
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,950
How will we know if we don't even try?

572
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,260
Let's get through this as soon as possible...

573
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,560
Then go back to work.

574
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,060
Okay.

575
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,240
Thank you.

576
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,240
- Hello, Director Su.
- Hello.

577
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,190
I'm sorry, Director Su, but Chairman Shi is not here today.

578
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,160
That's okay.

579
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:59,060
♫  Looking at the city lights, I feel the contrast with reality  ♫

580
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:06,400
♫  But I still have to go down this road  ♫

581
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,350
Let me revise it.

582
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,270
♫  In this world full of fireworks, I see unexpected changes  ♫

583
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,140
♫  I feel reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

584
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,724
I'm really sorry, Director Su. The meeting is delayed.

585
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:21,840
We'll make an appointment later.

586
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,150
That's okay.

587
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,380
Look. Is this okay?

588
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,980
Anything else?

589
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,240
This one.

590
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,100
This seafood package is nice.

591
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,560
I know Chairman Shi is a gourmet.

592
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,260
Hopefully, he can try our products.

593
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,280
Director Su, actually Chairman Shi usually doesn't hold grudges.

594
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,600
But President Yu should have had this attitude as well.

595
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,750
True.

596
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,270
♫  Self-reflection will diminish what may come tomorrow  ♫

597
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,240
♫  Let's reconcile with yesterday  ♫

598
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,920
♫  When the raindrops will sigh and cover the glimmer of the starry sky ♫

599
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,890
♫  I will look forward to the sunny days coming soon after  ♫

600
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,320
♫  Let's stop and look up to see if we're still moving forward together  ♫

601
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,700
♫  Is our pace the same as before?  ♫

602
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,180
Chairman Shi, I was too young to be sensible then.

603
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,360
Let's call it a day. Thank you.

604
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,900
Okay, Director Su.

605
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,660
See you, Director Su.

606
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,390
Tomorrow at three p.m., meet Chairman Shi in the company.

607
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,550
Mom, I'm busy today. I may not come home.

608
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,170
That's okay. Just do your things.

609
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,560
I will meet an investor tomorrow.

610
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,090
If it goes well, I may be less busy in the future!

611
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,060
Busy, Director Su?

612
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,550
Are you drinking coffee again? Don't drink it so often. It is bad for your health.

613
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,690
I will meet Chairman Shi tomorrow

614
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,190
so I want to prepare well.

615
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,980
You almost didn't sleep last night.

616
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,780
How about we go back and take a break?

617
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,720
No. Otherwise, my thoughts will get disturbed.

618
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,640
It is lunchtime. Don't you want to have lunch?

619
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,640
Let's order in!

620
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,996
Order in?

621
00:49:30,996 --> 00:49:32,900
No more takeout.

622
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,680
We've already been eating takeout for so many days. I really don't want that.

623
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,870
How about we cook at home tonight?

624
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,040
Who asked me to work with him?

625
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,950
There is no time to cook now. Are you feeling dissatisfied?

626
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Fine. We've been busy for so many days.

627
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,740
A short period off work won't matter. You can take a break in the car.

628
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,830
I don't want to move.

629
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,520
Then I will carry you out if you can't move.

630
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,530
This way, please.

631
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,820
Why are we here?

632
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,440
Get off.

633
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,650
Where are we?

634
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,460
These past few days, you had to work with me while taking care of your mother.

635
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,960
It is hard to run between two places.

636
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,000
So I wanted to ask you and your mother to live with me in my apartment.

637
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,680
But I don't have a kitchen, so it was inconvenient.

638
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,700
So...

639
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,420
I discussed this with Gong Wenxing.

640
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,920
He'll also move in along with Han Meng's parents.

641
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,180
This way, it will be convenient for auntie to play mahjong.

642
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,140
She won't feel lonely or strange.

Let's go to a place.

647
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,560
The view and lighting in this room are the best.

648
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,020
So I redecorated it into a kitchen.

649
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,320
Remember the kitchen utensils we won?

650
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,100
Give away kitchen utensils? That's so funny.

651
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,220
Who would want such a prize for this activity?

652
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,600
- I want it.
- I want it.

653
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,980
Isn't this what you wanted? Fill out the information.

654
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:15,380
I don’t think all these can fit in my kitchen.

655
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,530

00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,380
Mom?

662
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,180
"What to Eat Next" is an eternal theme in social interaction.

663
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,410
As an application,

664
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,480
it is not just a simple fresh food platform selling semi-finished food products.

665
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,040
Instead, it promotes social interaction with food.

666
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,780
Through food, we exchange and share our lives,

667
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,680
and obtain more emotional possibilities.

668
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,560
Functionality, convenience, cost, performance, and algorithm.

669
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,500
The rigid numbers can be imitated or subjected to a price war.

670
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,680
However, what can't be replaced in the short term are a brand's warmth,

671
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,940
its dynamic community, and rich emotional experience.

672
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,084
Emotional experience?

673
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,800
But your founder isn't a person who understands emotional experience very well.

674
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,710
Do you think that such a person can succeed in sharing emotions?

675
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,720
Even though your endorsement is successful,

676
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,608
your fake image

677
00:55:00,608 --> 00:55:02,920
will collapse sooner or later.

678
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,984
My image was fake before,

679
00:55:15,984 --> 00:55:18,080
but it no longer is.

680
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,880
Food isn't just for filling one's stomach or even for taste,

681
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,420
but it is also a kind of emotional link.

682
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,060
When dining, we can slow down and enjoy simple happiness.

683
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,160

- She's been busy.
- I see.

688
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,072
I've had dialysis for so many years.

689
00:55:49,072 --> 00:55:51,120
She doesn't have to accompany me.

690
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,280
But you said that you were dizzy and felt intermittent pain these days.

691
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,648
Why didn't you tell her?

692
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,920
Why worry her

693
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,424
if there isn't anything wrong?

694
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:06,390
Even if there is, it is still useless for her to worry.

[Radiology]

703
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,560
Kelan.

704
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,620
Mom, have you reached home?

705
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,780
Are all your results normal?

706
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,740
Everything is normal, don't worry.

707
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,640
- That's good.
- What about you? Are you in the company?

708
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,880
Are you going on a business trip tomorrow?

709
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,660
Yes, I'm at the company.

710
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,360
And yes, I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

711
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,120
An investor has shown interest

712
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,480
so I will grab this opportunity to go to Shanghai

713
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,952
and meet Yu Hao's partner.

714
00:57:16,952 --> 00:57:20,220
Why don't you come home early today to prepare for it?

715
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,460
I'm afraid I can't be early.

716
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,012
Mom, you know

717
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:30,360
Meng Meng says that my image is very important and insists on dressing me in an outfit

718
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,716
that's both modest and professional.

719
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,708
Meng Meng is quite considerate.

720
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:43,080
How about you send me some pictures so that I can also provide some input?

721
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,260
Sure, I will send them to you.

722
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,080
Su Kelan.

723
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,180
What bad things are you saying about me?

724
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,840
I said nice things.

725
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,236
Does this look nice?

726
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,600
- No.
- This isn't good either?

727
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,200
- It is nice, I think.
- Yeah...

728
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,460
Mom, did you see it?

729
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,560
It is not good.

730
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,740
Right? So I'm still trying.

731
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,660
Okay, then you go home first.

732
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,560
Bye bye.

733
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,240
This will definitely look good on you.

734
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,700
- Xiao Jin.
- Yes.

735
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,280
Please don't tell Kelan about my diagnosis just yet.

736
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,284
But Auntie...

737
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:25,240
It is not a big deal. Just thrombus.

738
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,800
I will follow a better routine and control my blood sugar.

739
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,260
And I will take my medicine on time. It will be fine.

740
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,660
She's been taking care of me for so many years.

741
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,384
Now she finally has her own life.

742
00:58:38,384 --> 00:58:41,040
Why bother her?

743
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,300
Mom, have some water.

744
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,364
He's so great.

745
00:59:08,364 --> 00:59:12,280
Why did you hesitate for such a long time before being with him?

746
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,296
Mom, you didn't think so highly of him before, did you?

747
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,592
I'm not you.

748
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:23,872
How could I have known that he is thoughtful and lovely?

749
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,110
Why do you want to take pictures so suddenly?

750
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,644
I didn't remember until I saw the photos.

751
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:49,240
We haven't taken a photo together for such a long time.

752
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,320
Here. Look at the camera.

753
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,800
Okay.

754
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,044
No, no, no. I closed my eyes.

755
00:59:59,044 --> 01:00:01,380
- One more.
- One more.

756
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,060
I will do it.

757
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,212
One, two, three.

758
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:27,140
Mom, when I'm less busy, let's go on an outdoor photo shoot.

759
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,380
Let's take pictures outside.

760
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,260
Sure.

761
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,000
At that time, tell the photographer to make me look younger by retouching.

762
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,920
Hey.

763
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,900
Mom, in my heart, you will always be the youngest and the most beautiful person.

764
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,288
Hello, Qian Qian?

765
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:04,380
Hello, Sister Kelan, is President Yu back?

766
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,300
Not yet.

767
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,500
There will be an interview tomorrow.

768
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,840
- I am in a hurry and need him to confirm the materials and his outfit.
- What's going on?

769
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,760
He hasn't replied to me yet.

770
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,912
When did he leave the office today?

771
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:16,988
Over an hour ago.

772
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,540
It is okay. I will ask him when he's back.

773
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,212
Bye.

774
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,240
You're back.

775
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,420
Yao Qian said some materials are urgently awaiting your confirmation.

776
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,800
Call her back as soon as possible.

777
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,516
Okay, I will call her later.

778
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,900
I heard that you left the company more than an hour ago.

779
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,120
Where did you go?

780
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,284
I went back and got some clothes.

781
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,560
Are you in a dilemma about what to wear tomorrow?

782
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,760
It is just an interview.

783
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,596
Narcissistic.

784
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,120
I will wear this for tomorrow.

785
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,120
Don't move. Let me do this.

786
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,860
Just wait for a minute. It might hurt you a bit.

787
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,360
Okay.

788
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,380
Untangle it yourself.

789
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,100
Wearing a shirt that's missing a button.

790
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,240
Aren't you embarrassed?

791
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,560
Then you can sew it for me.

792
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,368
Where do I find a button now?

793
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,140
- You don't have it?
- No.

794
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,460
Let me ask you again. Do you really not have it?

795
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,224
I will answer you again. No.

796
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:41,012
What are you doing?

797
01:02:41,012 --> 01:02:43,440
What are you doing?

798
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,540
This...

799
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,270
I knew all along that you had it with you.

800
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,220
I can't see.

801
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,988
Hello?

802
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,580
They say you came back to China.

803
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,080
Why didn't you visit me?

804
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,500
Sorry, Chairman Wu.

805
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,372
I've been so busy lately.

806
01:04:28,372 --> 01:04:30,260
You seldom call me. What's the matter?

807
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,620
What?

808
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,020
I can't call you just to chat?

809
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,820
Just go ahead.

810
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,810
Li Shi told me that he'd invest in Yu Hao's company,

811
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,640
but I don't like Yu Hao.

812
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,300
Since you know him well,

813
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,470
I wanted to ask you if he's reliable.

814
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,168
- Morning.
- Morning.

815
01:05:10,168 --> 01:05:11,400
Are you going on a business trip?

816
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,960
Yes, to Shanghai with Sister Kelan.

817
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,760
If she doesn't have an assistant to go along with, that may make her look too humble.

818
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,800
So I volunteered to be the temporary VP's assistant.

819
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,480
That's very thoughtful of you.

820
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,800
President Yu is coming as well?

821
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,800
It seems like the button you sewed on will fall off in just one day.

822
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,300
I'm not a tailor. Besides, did you let me sew it properly?

823
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,900
President Yu.

824
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,516
President Yu, you're wearing this for the interview later?

825
01:05:32,516 --> 01:05:36,120
The button's going to fall off. Won't it look inappropriate?

826
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,510
You can sew it for me.

827
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:43,070
Here?

828
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,320
- Now?
- Or else?

829
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,900
How can I sew without a sewing kit?

830
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,704
Just go to the store and buy one.

831
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:54,380
Then you take it off.

832
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,584
What a hassle just sew it here.

833
01:05:57,584 --> 01:06:00,620
President Yu, this is the front door of the company.

834
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,080
So what?

835
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,180
Which law bans sewing buttons in front of the company?

836
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,240
An Jie, let's go drop off the luggage.

837
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,740
Okay.

838
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,740
Yu Hao!

839
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,920
Are you feeling shy?

840
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,930
Sister Kelan, time to go!

841
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,340
I'm leaving. Make sure to waste no time

842
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,260
while preparing for the interview.

843
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,440
It makes me unhappy whenever I think of Yang Zhen being difficult with you.

844
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,900
If that's the case

845
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,220
then shall I not meet Yang Zhen today?

846
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,480
I can stand him up and embarrass him, okay?

847
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,400
After all, he keeps giving me a hard time.

848
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,520
Sure, if you think that's okay, Vice President Su.

849
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,420
I will sew your button when I get back.

850
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,840
Okay.

851
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,400
See you.

852
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,670
Su Kelan.

853
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,208
Bye.

854
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,320
After the interview, buy me an air ticket to Shanghai.

855
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,020
Got it, President Yu.

856
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,860
In fact, our application's best feature is that the users' can freely communicate.

857
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:49,300
Users can upload their views and insights on the food in our application.

858
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:55,632
It can further deepen the bond between people and food.

859
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,668
Hi, Meng Meng.

860
01:08:00,668 --> 01:08:02,660
Yes, I'm on my way to the airport.

861
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:03,780
What's the matter?

862
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,276
Your Yu Hao was absent-minded during the entire interview.

863
01:08:08,276 --> 01:08:11,000
Your boss is having an interview, and you as the director of the PR department,

864
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,120
are chatting with me. Is that appropriate?

865
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,700
Chatting?

866
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,400
I'm caring about my boss's working conditions.

867
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,500
You know nothing.

868
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,840
What's wrong?

869
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,300
I've been feeling nauseous recently. I don't know what has happened to me.

870
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,676
Are you pregnant?

871
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,220
Your son-in-law is really good.

872
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:47,560
He treats Kelan so nicely.

873
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,600
He even found you some mahjong partners.

874
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,700
He asked our son-in-law to move in there.

875
01:08:53,700 --> 01:09:00,452
Nowadays, girls are a lot better at finding a good husband than us.

876
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,228
I've actually been living here for so many years.

877
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,996
People should always look forward.

878
01:09:16,996 --> 01:09:18,700
Right.

879
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:22,428
As long as she can find someone as her life partner

880
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,940
I'm relieved.

881
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,620
Yes.

882
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,820
Thank you.

883
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,360
We're almost done here.

884
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,920
We'll visit your new place when it is fully decorated.

885
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,600
Okay. Thank you so much.

886
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,532
Don't thank us. You're welcome.

887
01:09:43,532 --> 01:09:45,600
Bye-bye.

888
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,300
- See you.
 - Okay.

889
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:55,580
Kelan.

890
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,140
Mom, have you reached home?

891
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,340
I'm home.

892
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,608
I'm already half done with the packing.

893
01:10:01,608 --> 01:10:05,360
Then I will call Xiao Yan later and ask him to hire a moving company.

894
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,468
No, thanks.

895
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:10,220
I'd like to stay here for a couple more days

896
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,350
until you return.

897
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,752
Mom, are you not willing to move?

898
01:10:16,752 --> 01:10:18,460
No.

899
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,140
It is just that you and Yu Hao aren't there.

900
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,580
I will feel lonely living in a big house on my own.

901
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:26,900
Then rest well at home for a few days

902
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,080
and practice smiling in front of the mirror.

903
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,900
I've booked a photographer for the photo shoot once I come back.

904
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,160
If you'll not remember the postures you'd like, it'll slow us down.

905
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,100
Who is it?

906
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,830
Mom, perhaps it is the takeout I ordered for you.

907
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:40,320
Yes.

908
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,420
Are you treating me like a child now?

909
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:47,100
Do you think I don't know how to order in?

910
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,940
If you do it yourself, what if you end up ordering food with high sugar and sodium?

911
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:57,360
Attention, please. Our plane is about to take off.

912
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,700
Please fasten your seat belt.

913
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,904
Okay. Let's hang up.

914
01:10:59,904 --> 01:11:01,980
I'm having my meal now.

915
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,620
Mom, have you injected yourself?

916
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,900
Hello, Madam. Our plane is about to take off.

917
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,840
Please set your mobile phone to airplane mode. Thank you for your cooperation.

918
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,760
Okay. Right away.

919
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,080
Mom, have you injected yourself?

920
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,000
- Yes. Don't worry.
- Okay.

921
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,400
Then I will hang up now. The plane is about to take off.

922
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,090
Bye.

923
01:12:55,015 --> 01:13:02,160
♫  Your long hair is softly scattered as you've curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

924
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:09,375
♫  A milky blossom in coffee, melting gently in the palm of your hand  ♫

925
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:16,474
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, the kitchen lit up with light  ♫

926
01:13:16,474 --> 01:13:24,415
♫  Day by day, you're getting used to the warmth of the smoke from the fireplace  ♫

927
01:13:24,415 --> 01:13:28,060
♫  You have short tousled hair  ♫

928
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,680
♫  You're lightly plucking the guitar  ♫

929
01:13:31,682 --> 01:13:39,015
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

930
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:45,882
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, time stands still  ♫

931
01:13:45,882 --> 01:13:52,824
♫  This is the romance you like  ♫

932
01:13:52,824 --> 01:14:00,135
♫  I love your companionship every day  ♫

933
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:03,421
♫  A simple tea and meal  ♫

934
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:07,621
♫  All I wish for is to kiss you goodnight  ♫

935
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,340
♫  Year after year and forever in this lifetime  ♫

936
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,215
♫  From dawn till dusk, through odds and ends  ♫

937
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:19,608
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

938
01:14:19,608 --> 01:14:27,420
♫  I want to kiss you and say goodnight to you every day  ♫
