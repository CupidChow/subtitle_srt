1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,240
Your nephew returned her phone in front of everyone!

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,380
He specially mentioned that it was "under the couch."

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,550
Is this an official announcement of their relationship?

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,830
What's going on?

5
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,160
In a nutshell, someone has a big mouth.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,040
Your nephew not only let Kelan demonstrate her professional capabilities

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,160
in front of everyone,

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,000
he also returned her phone that he had found underneath the couch at his house.

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,890
Did they even mess around under the sofa?

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,230
You missed the point, Man.

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,240
What's there to miss? What else can be said?

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,940
He's obviously announcing their relationship in front of everyone.

13
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,840
What's happening now?

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,230
They are both in the office.

15
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,990
Wow.

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,590
What are you thinking? I think they're just laying their cards on the table.

[Pickled Vegetables: From love to missing the usual]

19
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,740
What do you need? Say it quickly.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,760
President Yu, why did you return my phone in front of everyone

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,280
and emphasize that you found it under the couch?

22
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,740
I found it, so I returned it to you.

23
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,740
What? Should I have given it to you discreetly?

24
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,010
Why did you emphasize that it was under the couch?

25
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,280
Because it was under the couch. Is there a problem?

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,440
Don't you know that it can mislead people?

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,190
Mislead them about what?

28
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,380
What's wrong?

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,900
Do you think President Yu will fire me?

30
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,280
I think you'll be fine.

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,240
If President Yu wanted to fire someone, he would have done it immediately.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,540
When has he ever postponed it?

33
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,500
Then why didn't he fire me just now?

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,860
The way he behaved just now...

35
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,460
Could it be out of respect for Su Kelan?

36
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,360
After all, you belong to her department. By saying anything,

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,500
he would be intervening in the department's affairs.

38
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,680
But then again, we had many supervisors before.

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,660
But he had never shown them any respect.

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,740
You're right.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,320
Does he really care that much about Su Kelan?

42
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,940
Is there anything else? If not, then you can get back to work.

43
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,000
That's it.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,200
I'll organize the meeting with the marketing department,

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,220
and I'll reset the phone you lent me and give it back to you later.

46
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,960
There is no hurry. Don't let it delay your work.

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,570
Wait,

48
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,560
I suggest that you fire Yao Qian.

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Why? Is it because she likes to gossip behind people's backs?

50
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,180
It's not only because of the gossip.

51
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,140
You saw her competence earlier on.

52
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,080
If you're worried that firing her may lead to any rumors or gossip,

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,430
then you can hand it over to HR and wait until next month.

54
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,240
So you didn't fire her immediately

55
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,680
because you were worried that people may gossip about me?

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,860
You are fully aware of the gossip that your actions may cause.

57
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,870
What are you implying now?

58
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,620
Yao Qian,

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,930
let's have a chat outside.

60
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:19,320
What's going on?

61
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,300
Is she... Is she really going to fire her?

62
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,456
If you were me,

63
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,780
would you keep an employee who gossips about her superior's personal life?

64
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,820
Sister Kelan, I'm sorry.

65
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,140
I... I will never speak ill about you behind your back again.

66
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,370
You shouldn't apologize to me.

67
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,570
You should apologize to yourself.

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,134
I'm also aware that there is a way to find a topic and form a bond with people quickly;

69
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:58,440
and that is gossiping about someone with the others.

70
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,440
When we were in school,

71
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,240
usually, the subject were the teachers, the class monitor,

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,820
or the student union president.

73
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,780
When we started working, the subject changed to our superiors or boss.

74
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,510
But can you really

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,680
become friends with them using this method?

76
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,820
What do you think that the people who love to gossip with you about

77
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,200
your superiors are saying about you right now?

78
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,980
They must be saying that it's all because of Yao Qian's big mouth.

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,520
Luckily, they caught her but not us.

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,100
To a group that is established at someone else's expense,

81
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,320
it doesn't matter whether their subject is a person who was beside them.

82
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,790
You will still end up becoming a topic of their gossip,

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,090
and how long can a single topic last?

84
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,740
All of your personal values

85
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,040
will end up becoming a cause for someone's amusement for a few days.

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,420
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

87
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:09,060
Sister Kelan...

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,840
I think a solid bond should always be established upon

89
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,640
the values that you can add to each other. That way, you'll become indispensable.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,210
Therefore, stop making friends that way.

91
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,158
Get back to work.

92
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:33,910
Sister Kelan, you're... Are you not going to fire me?

93
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
President Yu, I want to retain Yao Qian for now.

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,400
Your reason?

95
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,640
Yao Qian likes to observe and communicate with people.

96
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,080
That's why she likes to gossip.

97
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,120
But because of that, she's very sensitive and accurate about public sentiments.

98
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,040
Her shortcomings are also her advantages at work.

99
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,950
As for her habit of gossiping behind people's backs, I believe that she can change.

100
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,880
If this happens again, I will fire you for sure.

101
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:07,660
I hope you can focus on mastering and controlling public sentiments.

102
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,160
Let your gossiping skills help you earn more money

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,990
instead of causing trouble for you, me, and the company.

104
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,220
Everyone, President Yu will attend the meeting with the marketing department this afternoon.

105
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,380
- Please prepare for it.
- Understood, Director Su.

106
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,020
I'll go and confirm the time with Manager Wang.

107
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,530
Okay.

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
- President Yu.
- Take a seat.

109
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,500
This is the optimization proposal for the app. Please take a look.

110
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,020
Okay.

111
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,400
Let's begin.

112
00:09:23,816 --> 00:09:25,000
Sister Kelan, I'm leaving now.

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,040
Okay, bye.

114
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
Sister Kelan and Sister Meng, we're heading out first.

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,230
Bye.

116
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,180
- Sister Kelan, I'm leaving.
- Sister Kelan.

117
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,450
Bye. Thank you for your efforts. See you tomorrow.

118
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,400
Using the phone as an excuse, have you asked everything you wanted to ask?

119
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,540
There is nothing to ask.

120
00:09:56,711 --> 00:10:00,660
Okay, got it. See you in Shanghai tonight.

121
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,780
Bye.

122
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,780
Since he finished editing the program, Director Jin has been acting weirdly.

123
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,180
What do you think is going on in his head?

124
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,520
I don't know, and it's none of my business.

125
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,660
Why does everyone love hot pots?

126
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,500
It's because everyone can find

127
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,760
their favorite ingredients in a hot pot.

128
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,800
A group of people sit around the pot and wait for the soup to boil.

129
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,997
Chopsticks pick up the ingredients and put them into the pot.

130
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:02,640
It takes fifteen to thirty seconds

131
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
for slices of meat or duck intestines to get cooked.

132
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,580
One to three minutes...

133
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,090
Yu Hao would never be able to come up with such elegant phrases on his own.

134
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,660
It seems like Kelan wrote the script and gave him some tips as well,

135
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,030
but she won't answer my calls.

136
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,180
He made so much bitter gourd. Who will eat it?

137
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,340
Maybe I should order takeout.

138
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,340
Should we invite Zhang Bi over to comfort Director Jin?

139
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,092
He's perfect from all 380 degrees.

140
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:41,820
He's handsome and talented. Where can you even find a man like that?

141
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,725
- What should I eat to get him?
- It's 360 degrees.

142
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,480
What's wrong with 380 degrees? So what if there are 20 more degrees?

143
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,000
Can't Yu Hao have 20 degrees more than other people?

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,110
As long as you're happy.

145
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Look at them, they're adults now.

146
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,780
Why are they acting like children in their relationship?

147
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,640
They're so bashful and refuse to be straightforward.

148
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,260
No, even children these days are better than them.

149
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,340
What's wrong with your nephew?

150
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,340
He has already done something as direct as returning her phone in public.

151
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,560
Why can't he just tell her that he likes her?

152
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
Maybe that's how they prefer it.

153
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
Don't be anxious. Yu Hao is going on a business trip soon, right?

154
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,220
It's the perfect opportunity for their relationship to advance.

155
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,280
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

156
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,040
Are you sure?

157
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Will a workaholic like Yu Hao really miss her?

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,747
What if they become even more estranged after this week?

159
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:44,040
No matter how much of a workaholic he is, he can't control his stomach.

160
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,320
The "Magic City" has all kinds of delicious food.
(T/N: A nickname for Shanghai)

161
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,390
Maybe he'll be too delighted to be homesick.

162
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,720
Let's take a 15-minute break and grab something to eat.

163
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:36,600
Once your stomach forms a memory, it affects your brain.

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,680
Even if it's delicious, if it's not what you want,

165
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,880
you'll still yearn for something else.

166
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,854
Simon, what would you like for dinner? My treat.

167
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,051
Oh, it's a nice idea.

168
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:51,014
For dinner, I think crab or something you like, you know.

169
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:53,420
Yes, let's go.

170
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,920
When you can't satisfy the memory of your stomach,

171
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,840
you'll feel hungry even if you're full.

172
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,940
Just like how some people won't feel full unless they eat rice.

173
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,020
For Yu Hao,

174
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,900
Su Kelan's food has already become an indispensable comfort to his stomach.

175
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:39,440
Did you receive the photos?

176
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,060
Which photos?

177
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,460
Photos of the dishes you made.

178
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,320
Did I do a good job?

179
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,500
Why are you sending me pictures of the dishes I made?

180
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,660
Share these photos on your WeChat Moments.

181
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,800
What for?

182
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,280
So that a special someone who's on a business trip

183
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,340
starts yearning for your food.

184
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,920
Then he will be reminded of the beauty who made them.

185
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,020
You're insane.

186
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,810
I'm telling you, it's—

187
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,660
I need to go. The company's administrator is calling me.

188
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,280
- Hello?
- Kelan.

189
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,040
President Yu asked me to send him some braised meat and pickled vegetables from the office.

190
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,260
He can't get used to the food in Shanghai.

191
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,540
Sorry to trouble you.

192
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,260
It's all right. I made a lot today.

193
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,260
I was already planning to bring them to the office for everyone.

194
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,160
That's great. Kelan, you're my savior!

195
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,500
By the way, I noticed that President Yu ate the fish balls that you made for Wan Shun several times.

196
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,640
None of us dared to tell him that they're for the cat.

197
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,880
Don't tell him.

198
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,430
Why haven't you updated your WeChat Moments yet? Hurry!

199
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,310
I'm packing pickled vegetables. I can't chat with you anymore.

200
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,120
Pickled vegetables? That's right.

201
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,640
Yu Hao already ate half of the pickled vegetables that you brought to the office.

202
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,760
He thought that the company administrator had bought them.

203
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,380
Why didn't you tell him that you'd made them?

204
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,550
Why do you always dilly-dally like that?

205
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:56,759
Mom, you scared me to death!

206
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,990
You didn't even do anything wrong so what are you so afraid of?

207
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,760
Does he like to eat our pickled vegetables?

208
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:42,990
Instant noodles with milk.

209
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,780
[Tuesday, June 23, 2020]
[Third day of the fifth Month of the Gengzi Year]

210
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,702
[Su Kelan]

211
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,820
Choose tender and fresh string beans that are hard to the touch.

212
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,220
Wind them in the jar.

213
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,080
Place the radishes on the bottom.

214
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,920
Cut up the Chinese cabbages and air-dry them.

215
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,580
Choose fresh cucumbers with flowers and thorns. These two will ferment faster.

216
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,100
We'll have to eat them first.

217
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,500
Therefore, we'll put them near the opening of the jar.

218
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,160
Mix cold boiled water with pickle salt and soak over the vegetables.

219
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,000
Then put in clean and air-dried cinnamon, aniseed,

220
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,020
bay leaves, and green prickly ash.

221
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,880
The liquor and fermented glutinous rice water will help the fermentation process.

222
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,360
Add 100 grams of sugar for ten kilograms of water

223
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,520
to add a bit of sweetness to the sour pickled vegetables.

224
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,960
Lastly, add a large spoon of old pickle juice to act as a starter.

225
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,920
Every family has a unique flavor when it comes to pickled vegetables.

226
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,720
This old pickle juice has been passed down for at least three generations.

227
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,000
Back then, whenever your dad came to see me, he would ask for my pickled vegetables.

228
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,360
When he proposed, he told me, "If you love someone's pickled vegetables,"

229
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,490
"you can probably become a family."

230
00:19:05,214 --> 00:19:10,580
Pickled vegetables made in this old jar contain the taste of home and the passage of time.

231
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,470
As for the time, it's the longing that ferments inside the jar.

232
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:28,400
If we long for someone, does that mean

233
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,470
we already have feelings for that person?

234
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,290
Am I doing this right?

235
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,310
[Su Kelan]

236
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,060
What's the matter with you?

237
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,140
I have told you repeatedly. Keep your phone on 24 hours a day.

238
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,880
Is your phone just for display? Why don't you answer your phone on time?

239
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,220
President Yu, I also told you.

240
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,800
After work, my time is meant for myself.

241
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,700
It's more important for me to spend time with my mom.

242
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,440
If I always keep my eyes on the phone, it would be disrespectful to my family.

243
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,580
I strongly suggest that you shouldn't stare at your phone all the time, either,

244
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,540
especially during conversations and meals.

245
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,500
Su Kelan, let me remind you,

246
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,600
as the Director of the PR department,

247
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,560
you may encounter a lot of emergencies that will require your immediate attention.

248
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,900
Whether it's during a conversation or a meal,

249
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,060
you cannot ignore any phone calls.

250
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,160
Well, President Yu,

251
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,340
may I ask that if I'm having a conversation with you,

252
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,600
when an important business partner calls me,

253
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,060
shall I

254
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,480
put aside our conversation?

255
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,040
It's up to me to judge the importance of that.

256
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,120
Well, in that case,

257
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,780
what's the emergency at this moment which required a phone call?

258
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,370
Well, right now...

259
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,040
now...

260
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,940
Do we have a theme for the program yet?

261
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,760
Is that an emergency?

262
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,980
First of all,

263
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,260
we're recording the next episode in four days.

264
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,840
Secondly,

265
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,160
even if I tell you the theme of the program right now,

266
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,200
you can't learn to cook the dish while you're in Shanghai.

267
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,540
The theme for the next episode is "Encountering an old friend living away from home."

268
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,880
Make a meal for an old friend that you reunited with who lives away from their home.

269
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,540
It really suits your current situation, President Yu.

270
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,620
Well, which dish will we make?

271
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,300
We can make

272
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,900
pickled cowpeas with minced pork,

273
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,460
pickled cabbage pancakes,

274
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,790
stir-fried shredded pork with pickled ginger,

275
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,040
or—

276
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,620
Wait a minute.

277
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,090
Aren't all these dishes made with pickled vegetables?

278
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,100
That's right.

279
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,380
The thing our friends living away from home miss the most

280
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,200
is the taste of their home.

281
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,220
And the taste of their homes relies on

282
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,420
a spoonful of old pickle juice from the pickle jar

283
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,140
that has been passed down for generations since the era of our grandma's ancestors.

284
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,060
It is a lingering memory on our tongues

285
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,600
and in our stomachs.

286
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,960
When we treat our friends to some homemade pickled vegetables,

287
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,980
it feels like we are sharing the memories of the flavors

288
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,060
of our own family.

289
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,900
If we like someone's homemade pickled vegetables,

290
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,800
maybe that also means

291
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,740
that we like all the memories and longings associated with it.

292
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,020
Maybe,

293
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,860
we can turn from friends

294
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,040
to family.

295
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,220
It sounds very good.

296
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,740
However,

297
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,040
it also seems a little far-fetched.

298
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,400
For example,

299
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,180
if I like the pickled vegetables from our office,

300
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,560
do I also have to like the factory that manufactures those pickled vegetables?

301
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Do you...

302
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,620
really like the pickled vegetables from our office?

303
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,320
Why do you like them?

304
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,600
Is there anything special about them?

305
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm used to them.

306
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,140
Well,

307
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,520
if you start liking another brand's pickled vegetables,

308
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,240
will you get used to their taste as well?

309
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,660
Why would I switch brands?

310
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,360
So it's not that you don't want to change.

311
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,060
You just think that changing it is troublesome.

312
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,700
What if someone changed it for you?

313
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,440
Would you think that it is troublesome to switch it back and just continue with it?

314
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,380
I... I have another call.

315
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,820
I'm hanging up.

316
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,920
Hello?

317
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,020
I simply like the pickled vegetables from our office. What's wrong with that?

318
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,700
Why should I have a reason for it? Why?

319
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,780
Why would I change?

320
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,460
Ridiculous.

321
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,140
Are you just used to it?

322
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,780
[Do you want to eat this? Do you want to come back?]

323
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,880
Would tempting him like this work?

324
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,340
Look, it has been such a long time and he still hasn't replied.

325
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,380
It'll definitely work.

326
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,840
An Jie, have you shipped out the pickled vegetables already?

327
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,800
When will they arrive?

328
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,880
Elder Sister, please give me a break.

329
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,200
What's the point of having an elaborate conversation with him over pickled vegetables?

330
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,720
Just tell him directly.

331
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,460
Ask him whether he likes you or not.

332
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,380
Is it that hard?

333
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,880
Besides, he has not shown any signs that he doesn't like you.

334
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,900
What's the point of liking me if he can change at any time?

335
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,440
Oh, please.

336
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,140
He was talking about pickled vegetables, not you.

337
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,800
Besides, he didn't even know that you were comparing yourself with pickled vegetables.

338
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,140
Yu Hao studied Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania,

339
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,060
not Literary Analysis.

340
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,320
He's the kind of straight guy who does good deeds anonymously.

341
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,860
Unlike Li Xun, who is a sweet-talking player.

342
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,840
You dropped the cream on the floor.

343
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
Where?

344
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,060
You're so annoying.

345
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,180
Hello, Baby.

346
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,480
Yes, I'm shopping with Kelan right now.

347
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
You don't have to pick me up.

348
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,800
We'll be eating out today.

349
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,240
Okay, I'm hanging up. Bye.

350
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,100
Are you already lying to your husband?

351
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,540
Does he not know that you're making a cake for him?

352
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,180
Of course not, otherwise, it won't be a surprise.

353
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,300
Don't spill the beans.

354
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,880
I don't think you're very good at it.

355
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,680
That's because you're not a good teacher.

356
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,620
Look at that. What is it?

357
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,820
Hey, Elder Sister,

358
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,780
I'm not an experienced baker, either. You already know that.

359
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Honestly,

360
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,680
why don't you just buy one for him from a bakery?

361
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,860
Didn't you say that it's the first time your husband is celebrating his birthday in over twenty years,

362
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,520
and he really wants to eat a birthday cake?

363
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,000
If you give him that, he might end up crying.

364
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,270
Even so,

365
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,340
it would be because he's been moved to tears.

366
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,000
I made it myself.

367
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,420
He won't despise it, no matter how ugly it is.

368
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,780
I never expected you

369
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,220
to get married so soon.

370
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,820
It's not that surprising.

371
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,740
I have always planned on getting married before turning 25.

372
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,140
When have I ever

373
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,440
deviated from any of my life plans?

374
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,500
What I meant was,

375
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,640
you were brave enough to marry someone you knew for only a day.

376
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,140
Aren't you afraid that you don't know him well enough?

377
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,180
I think that

378
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,500
time has nothing to do with how well you know a person.

379
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,400
A lot of people have been together

380
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,900
for years

381
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,460
and still don't know each other,

382
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,840
right?

383
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,400
That's true.

384
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,900
You may not understand someone even after many years,

385
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,180
let alone one day.

386
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,760
What do you mean? We had already met each other a decade ago.

387
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,120
It's definitely more than one day.

388
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,320
Even if we count that one time when you were little,

389
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,200
that's still only two days.

390
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,880
Did you agree to a shotgun marriage

391
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,040
because of the joy of your reunion

392
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,220
or the romance of the brief encounter?

393
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,780
Neither.

394
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,540
Then why?

395
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,620
When he woke up that day,

396
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,800
he told me about the Du Du he called for in his dreams.

397
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,940
Du Du?

398
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,300
Once I heard about Du Du, I immediately knew that was me,

399
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,620
but I wanted to tease him

400
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,820
so I didn't tell him.

401
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,940
I just asked him seriously.

402
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,880
I asked him,

403
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,480
"Now that you're with me,"

404
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,640
"if your puppy love, Du Du, suddenly shows up"

405
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
"and tells you that she likes you."

406
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,320
"What will you do?"

407
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,560
I thought he would certainly be like,

408
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,500
"You're the one I care about the most."

409
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,420
"That so-called Du Du isn't my puppy love at all."

410
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,500
But guess what he said?

411
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,360
What did he say?

412
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,600
He cried.

413
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,120
He told me

414
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,820
he couldn't lie to me.

415
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,020
Du Du certainly has a place in his heart,

416
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,240
but he doesn't want to lose me, either.

417
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,720
He was really sad

418
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,600
and that's why he cried.

419
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,520
After that, he said

420
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,720
it was so embarrassing that he was crying like this in front of me.

421
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,440
I would surely break up with him.

422
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,660
Then he started crying even harder.

423
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
That was the moment when

424
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,300
I decided to marry him.

425
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,460
I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

426
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,840
Kelan,

427
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,080
when you meet the right person,

428
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,040
you just need that one moment.

429
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,760
Think about it,

430
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,040
even if it ends up being wrong,

431
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,020
at least you'll be happy in that moment.

432
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,920
It's better than missing out,

433
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,460
right?

434
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,940
Is Gong Wenxing's birthday

435
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,180
the same day as Yu Hao's birthday?

436
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,760
Yes.

437
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,900
Are you getting any ideas?

438
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,640
What's your idea?

439
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,280
May you live a long and happy life!

440
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,220
[May you live a long and happy life!]

441
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
President Yu, you should have some snacks.

442
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,680
Your flight won't land until 7:30 p.m.

443
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,800
That's all right. Save it for yourself.

444
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,460
Manager, I'm leaving.

445
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,920
Boss, are you leaving early today?

446
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,100
I have a private event today.

447
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,040
It's his birthday today.

448
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,580
What the hell?

449
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,940
Not even a "Happy Birthday"?

450
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,720
Hello, Meng Meng.

451
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,100
My mom isn't feeling well. I'm going back home to take care of her.

452
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,400
I can't come to see you today.

453
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,960
Is it serious? Should I come over to see her?

454
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,280
Don't come over.

455
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,980
I'm not feeling well, either.

456
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,420
Maybe I got infected by my mom.

457
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm a bit dizzy from the medicine and I am going to sleep for a bit.

458
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm just letting you know.

459
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,300
All right, but if you don't feel well later, call me right away.

460
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,400
Bye.

461
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,300
Where are you? Do you want to have a drink with your uncle?

462
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,400
Are you joking?

463
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,840
I just paid the electricity bill.

464
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,010
[Happy Birthday]

465
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,160
Surprise!

466
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,860
Happy Birthday, Honey!

467
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,720
At 1:55 a.m.

468
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,140
on December 9

469
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,940
twenty-eight years ago,

470
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,300
you came into this world.

471
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,140
After a year of eating, drinking, peeing, pooping, and sleeping,

472
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,360
congratulations,

473
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,580
you finally started to upgrade from baby talk

474
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,580
to Chinese.

475
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,280
This is the present that I prepared for your first birthday.

476
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,360
Open it now.

477
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,420
Do you see it?

478
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,660
This is a collection of short stories that I recorded for you.

479
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,280
I hope that in the future, my stories can accompany you every night.

480
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,520
The one-year-old you,

481
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,560
better make sure that you learn Chinese well.

482
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,460
Another year has passed,

483
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,000
and you're older by an year.

484
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,100
You should know how to crawl by age two.

485
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,940
No, you should know how to walk by age two.

486
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,120
That's right.

487
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
At this age, you must have been very naughty.

488
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,000
Therefore, I prepared this

489
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,400
to exercise your brain.

490
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,620
You were probably very naughty when you were two years old.

491
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,680
But remember,

492
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,600
don't put this in your mouth.

493
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,860
Honey, although I can't

494
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,360
be a part of your past

495
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,560
and grow up with you,

496
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,760
I prepared these with care.

497
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,420
I hope you'll like them.

498
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,940
I'm using them to fill the gaps in your past

499
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,240
when I wasn't by your side.

500
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,280
I love you.

501
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,180
Happy Birthday!

502
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,880
Are you surprised?

503
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,120
Honey,

504
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,820
do you like it?

505
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,540
Honey,

506
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,920
your family never celebrated

507
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,260
your birthdays in the past.

508
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,120
So this time,

509
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,940
I prepared presents for your last

510
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,040
28 birthdays.

511
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,440
From now on, I will make

512
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,560
a birthday cake for you every year.

513
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,640
I promise

514
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,100
I will never ever

515
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,460
let you feel lonely again.

516
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,254
♫  After all the storms, I'm even more convinced  ♫

517
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:45,094
♫  I won't allow myself to miss out on you  ♫

518
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:50,905
♫  You are so full of life  ♫

519
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:56,860
♫  We are reading each other's mind  ♫

520
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,300
Look,

521
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,300
does it look nice?

522
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,440
Thank you.

523
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,880
[May you live a long and happy life!]

524
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,420
Are you free on the evening you are coming back?

525
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,360
I'll teach you how to cook.

526
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,800
Okay, I'll send my flight information to you.

527
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,620
You'd better prepare everything in advance.

528
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,160
Don't waste my time.

Yu Hao is your nephew. That makes him my family as well.

I have the right to know what happened.

Besides, this concerns Su Kelan, my best friend for over ten years!

When it concerns someone else's privacy,

why do I have to tell you?

688
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,340
Because you left me here all by myself!

689
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,060
For two hours. You didn't answer your phone or send an explanation.

690
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,040
Yu Hao was in a bad state.

691
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,280
What's wrong with me having a few drinks with him?

692
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,680
If I kept messing around on my phone,

693
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,440
wouldn't that have upset him even more?

694
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,200
Did you even consider that I might be unhappy as well?

695
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,100
I went through a lot of trouble decorating this place to celebrate your birthday,

696
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,820
but you suddenly said that you had to go. And what for?

697
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,660
To have a drink with someone else; cheer up someone else.

698
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,740
Now that you are back, you keep on blabbering some nonsense and refuse to tell me the truth!

699
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,000
I told you it's not important.

700
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,380
Not important?

701
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,460
So in your mind,

702
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,260
my mood and efforts are not important, and I don't deserve to be comforted.

703
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,780
If we don't even have the most basic level of trust and honesty between us,

704
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,460
then why did you marry me?

705
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,540
How will we spend the rest of our lives together?

706
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,060
I don't want to talk about Yu Hao's private affairs.

707
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,920
If you care so much about him,

708
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,340
then you can spend the rest of your days with him.

709
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,980
Wait...

710
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,920
Honey...

711
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,600
Who do you think you are?

712
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,040
Why should I tell you?

713
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,220
Are you going to eat it?

714
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,800
Of course,

715
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,580
I put a lot of thought into it.

716
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,560
If he doesn't have the good fortune to appreciate it, that's his loss.

717
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,680
No matter how much thought you put into it,

718
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,380
it still didn't melt his heart.

719
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:39,180
Aren't you angry or upset?

720
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,500
My point is that that jerk is so ungrateful.

721
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,380
He won't even tell you the reason. If it were me, I would have forced him to tell me.

722
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,680
If he had refused to tell me, I would have cursed at him.

723
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,640
You have the right to yell at your husband, but what right do I have?

724
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,640
I don't even have to right to celebrate his birthday.

725
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,560
Here.

726
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,980
Why must she get to the bottom of this?

727
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,680
Why does she have to make such a big deal out of this?

728
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,800
How can keeping just a tiny bit of personal space mean that I don't love her or care about her?

729
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,520
Why is that woman so cruel?

730
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,000
Actually, later on, I went back to his house.

731
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,620
I just wanted him to give me a hug.

732
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,820
She deliberately

733
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,200
came back just to toss away the cake in front of me.

734
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,420
Even if he hadn't told me what was going on,

735
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,320
I would have still been okay if he had just hugged me and said something nice.

736
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,740
But you know what?

737
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,600
Even after I tossed the cake onto the floor,

738
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,220
he didn't say anything.

739
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,460
It was such a nice cake.

740
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,300
It must've taken her a long time to make it.

741
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,320
I spent so much time learning how to make it.

742
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,840
My parents gained three pounds just from eating my practice cakes,

743
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,000
and it ended up getting tossed to the floor.

744
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,960
She made it herself

745
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,620
and then, just threw it away so cruelly.

746
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,000
I didn't even get to eat a single bite of it.

747
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,180
Stop drinking. Stop drinking.

748
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,640
When your efforts fail to enter the other person's heart.

749
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,120
They ferment and turn into depression.

750
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,420
You think that you can drown your sorrows with drinks,

751
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,840
but it just causes an even deeper depression.

752
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,020
I want to eat the cake.

753
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,580
If you have anything on your mind, it's best to just speak up.

754
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,800
Why do I have to speak about it?

755
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,100
Can't you just stay with me for a little while?

756
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,200
Sure, I'll stay with you.

757
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,700
Mom,

758
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,440
Meng Meng and her husband had a little fight.

759
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,780
She doesn't want her parents to know so she's going to stay with me tonight.

760
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,840
Were you drinking as well?

761
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,420
Just a little to keep her company.

762
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,960
Don't worry. Don't you have dialysis tomorrow? Get some sleep. Don't worry about us.

763
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,660
Bye bye.

764
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:59,320
Here, put this on.

765
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,980
That day when you left and came back and wouldn't stop drinking,

766
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,820
was it because you were also trying to drown out something that you couldn't put into words?

767
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,880
You wanted to drown it out.

768
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,960
And then it became another thing to worry about?

769
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,040
Who do you think you are?

770
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,280
Why should I tell you?

771
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,240
What should I do now?

772
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,940
What do you mean?

773
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,280
Meng Meng hasn't called me all night!

774
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,180
Is she really angry enough to leave me?

775
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,600
She's...

776
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,260
just like that cake.

777
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,580
She's ignoring me right now. What should I do?

778
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,160
Why is she still ignoring me?

779
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,080
Why is she ignoring me?

780
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,600
It's been a whole night.

781
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,660
Is she really ignoring me? She's really something else.

782
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,860
Well... Teach me how to cook after work today.

783
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,120
I don't have any objections to the theme of this episode.

784
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,260
I'll pay you extra for the lesson and overtime.

785
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,820
Are you feeling bad for what you did last night and looking for an excuse to talk to her?

786
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,000
Mind your own business.

787
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,620
I asked for a day off today.

788
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,640
[Internal Medicine Clinic - Room 6]

789
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,740
Doctor Wang, my mom's creatinine index increased by 3.7.

790
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,800
Is that going to be a problem?

791
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,360
It's all right. It'll come down after dialysis.

792
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,420
Thank you, Doctor Wang.

793
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:08,480
Kelan is really attentive.

794
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,060
Go and get the dialysis done first.

795
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,740
Okay, wait for me, Mom. I'll go pay the fees.

796
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:18,180
By the way, here.

797
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,620
What is it this time?

798
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:23,280
Strawberry Jam, your granddaughter's favorite.

799
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,740
She really loves this.

800
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,920
She has eaten so much that she has cavities now.

801
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,360
One appointment is only ¥800.

802
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,280
Ma'am, judging by your outfit, you must have just returned from abroad.

803
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,380
It's okay if you don't know me, but you must go to Dr. Li for the Thermage Treatment.
(T/N: Thermage is a skin tightening treatment.)

804
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,160
It's really difficult to get an appointment. I'm quite sure that they don't have any slots available for this week.

805
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,140
Well,

806
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,400
what should I do then?

807
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,280
Look, so many people are lining up over there.

808
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,460
If you line up like them, you may not be able to get one.

809
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,020
Instead, you can just pay ¥800 to save your time and effort.

810
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,880
Ma'am, it's not expensive at all.

811
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,520
Just ¥800,

812
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,180
- buy it from me.
- Fine.

813
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:05,100
- Come on, buy one.
- Auntie,

814
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,800
the Cosmetology Department's appointments aren't hard to get.

815
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,760
Just follow the official account of this hospital.

816
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,080
Look, you can book an appointment right here.

817
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,820
Miss, Thank you so much.

818
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,520
I almost got scammed by him.

819
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,880
You're welcome.

820
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,580
Kelan!

821
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,700
Kelan!

822
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,780
- Hello?
- Mom, are you back?

823
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,480
Why didn't you let me pick you up?

824
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,000
It's okay. I'll be home soon.

825
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,400
Call Yu Hao and ask him to come over for dinner.

826
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,840
Kelan! Kelan, don't go! Kelan!

827
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,080
Don't touch it.

828
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,020
Kelan, don't overthink it.

829
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,660
My mom and I came here to see your mom today.

830
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,840
Didn't I always accompany your mom for dialysis before?

831
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,560
Three times.

832
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,320
My mom gets dialysis done twice a week.

833
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,210
We were together for five years. That's 520 times. You only came three times.

834
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,140
We already broke up. Don't you ever get tired of putting on a show?

835
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,100
Kelan,

836
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,520
I know that I didn't do well in the past.

837
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,240
It's all my fault. I won't make any excuses.

838
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:35,280
I deserve to be dumped and fired.

839
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,880
But I've really been thinking about you all this time.

840
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,940
I can't get over you.

841
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:44,180
I really regret not being there for you and your mom.

842
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,740
Then be there for your mom, your current girlfriend, and your future girlfriends.

843
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,180
- Don't regret it again.
- Kelan, I've realized that I was wrong.

844
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,700
I know that you won't forgive me.

845
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,620
I'm not asking that we get back together.

846
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,920
But we've been together for so many years.

847
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,580
Even if we break up, can't we just be friends?

848
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,740
Why should I be friends with you?

849
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,960
You know that I don't like to drag things out.

850
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,520
I'll live my own life, and so should you.

851
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,440
One last word of advice.

852
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,840
Be more sincere and loyal.

853
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,200
Otherwise, you will end up with nothing.

854
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,800
Kelan,

855
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,200
I still have feelings for you.

856
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,200
Some people can't appreciate your good intentions.

857
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,620
Let's go. Let's go.

858
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,540
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I did.

859
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,040
The passcode is still the same.

860
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,260
Stand there. Don't move. Let me adjust this.

861
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,110
I'm making scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

862
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,120
I'm recording it so that you can review it later on.

♫  The uncertain suspense of this world  ♫

878
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,094
♫  Who has never cried their eyes out before?  ♫

879
01:12:51,094 --> 01:12:54,634
♫  Self-reflection will diminish what may come tomorrow  ♫

880
01:12:54,634 --> 01:12:56,534
♫  Let's reconcile with yesterday  ♫

881
01:12:56,534 --> 01:12:59,354
♫  When the raindrops will sigh and cover the glimmer of the starry sky ♫

882
01:12:59,354 --> 01:13:02,254
♫  I will look forward to the sunny days coming soon after  ♫

883
01:13:02,254 --> 01:13:04,414
♫  Let's stop and look up to see if we're still moving forward together  ♫

884
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:08,694
♫  Is our pace the same as before?  ♫
