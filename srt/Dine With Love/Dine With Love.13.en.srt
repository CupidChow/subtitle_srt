00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,640
We can use a conservative treatment like Thrombolysis. It's less harmful.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,160
But it doesn't necessarily cure the disease completely.

And there's a risk of thrombus detachment.

Surgery can cure angioneurosis,

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,280
but since your health condition is not ideal,

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,000

159
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,920
- But Director Jin prepared way too little.
- Just one dish?

I'll drive Kelan's mother to the hospital for the examination. You don't have to come.

But I need to continue to be your mastermind.

00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,020
I can't be with Hao Hao,

163
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,120
but Su Kelan's mother likes you!

164
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,160
She even asked you to take her to the hospital.

165
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,460
That proves that she prefers you to be her son-in-law.

166
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,180
Besides, Su Kelan cares so much about her mother.

167
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,310
Her mother's opinions are important for sure.

168
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,820
So your odds are still high.

169
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,920

She's out?

173
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,120
The door is unlocked.

174
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,620

What's wrong with auntie?

179
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,400
- Let's help her up.  - Don't touch her. She can't be moved.

180
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,020
Call Su Kelan.

181
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,740

But all day long you've been unavailable.

If you really wish Su Kelan's well, stop and listen to what I have to say.

Su Kelan's mother is critically ill. Everyone is sympathetic.

442
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,160
But the issue with Li Shi's investment really is because she couldn't handle it at the right time and it went bad.

443
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,560
If you don't settle the issue, she'll be responsible for the losses of the company.

How can she get along with your partners and with you in the future?

445

If you go to Su Kelan now, it won't do any good for her mother.

536
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,120
Kelan.

537
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,780
- Give me that.
- No, thanks.

538
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,040
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

539
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,400
It's okay.

540
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,156
You just take good care of auntie. Leave work matters to me.

541
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,320
Yu Hao,

542
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,460
hire a new person for the vice president position.

543
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,640
I know you're tired these days.

544
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,720
How about you take some time off? When you are ready, you can return, okay?

545
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,900
I don't want to go back.

546
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,120
I can't imagine this

547
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,620
happening again.

548
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:35,840
Okay. For now, you can do nothing but take care of your mother. All right?

549
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,620
I'm sorry.

550
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,100
I overestimated my ability.

551
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,490
I accepted such an important job but keep troubling everyone.

552
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,800
I troubled my mother, Jin Xuan, Zhang Bi,

553
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,760
and you.

554
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,980
- I'll go up with you.
- No, thanks.

555
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,370
I think...

556
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:11,280
we should take a break.

557
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,320
What do you mean?

558
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,900
Yu Hao,

559
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,060
I don't want to neglect my mom again because of my love for you.

560
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,300
But I also don't want you

561
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,460
to focus on me too much

562
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,900
and get distracted from your career.

563
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,660
I think we should

564
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,520
reconsider our relationship.

565
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,840
What do you mean

566
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,320
by saying "reconsider our relationship"?

567
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,040
I don't think we can keep pace with each other.

568
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,300
Kelan,

569
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,020
where am I not good enough? Just tell me.

570
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,680
You're perfect.

571
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,040
It's just that we're different.

572
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,580
I have a job.

573
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,719
But when something happened, I can only take care of my mother.

574
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:28,150
I know you care about me.

575
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,660
But after you found out what happened to my mother,

576
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,220
you chose to work with Shen Zhilin.

577
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,640
You've been to the company?

578
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,120
I did it for you.

579
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,880
I don't want you to be embarrassed facing Yang Zhen in the future.

580
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,680
And I don't want people at the company to think it's you who caused the loss.

581
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,540
This is what you think matters.

582
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,380
But for me, it doesn't matter at all.

583
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,320
Have you ever thought about what I need?

584
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,759
What matters most to me

585
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:23,600
is my mother.

586
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,119
For you, it's your career.

587
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,140
By nature, we're different.

588
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,900
Even if we manage to hold on now, we will still...

589
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,950
What kind of person am I?

590
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,710
Before,

591
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,380
I've been afraid to accept your love.

592
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,980
Because I was afraid of letting you down.

593
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,500
It's you who

594
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,740
encouraged me to take the first step.

595
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,540
I didn't know how to take care of people before,

596
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,580
but now I do.

597
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,730
I didn't know how to communicate before,

598
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,100
but now I can chat with your mother.

599
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,370
But you're telling me

600
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,000
we're different.

601
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,240
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

602
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,500
I underestimated the difficulty of a relationship.

603
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,860
What difficulty?

604
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,000
Kelan, auntie's illness is an accident.

605
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,560
There are inevitable events in life, but they don't happen every day.

606
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,140
Yu Hao, why do you like me?

607
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,580
You like me not because I can cook and take care of you,

608
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,480
but that I can help you in your career.

609
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,580
You like the Su Kelan who can handle everything.

610
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:01,080
I used to think I could do it, but I was wrong. I can't do it at all.

611
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,980
Love can't stand the test at all.

612
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,700
I don't want to see that day in the future when you'll blame me for not being able to do all this.

613
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,340
Because it's simply not who I am at all.

614
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,540
I'm sorry.

615
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,940
I'm sorry.

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,450

From now on, this part of you

624
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,540
belongs only to me.

625
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,220

642
00:56:47,793 --> 00:56:49,680
Your mother is out of danger now,

643
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,880
but she still needs care.

644
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,720
My friend got in touch with Professor Sun from Union Hospital.

645
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,120
We can consult him at any time if necessary.

646
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,040
Thank you, Director Jin.

647
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,060
You've been busy all night because of my mom.

648
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,019
It's okay.

649
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,059
Don't think about anything.

650
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:07,679
Auntie will definitely get better.

651
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,700
Have you ever thought about what I need?

652
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,240
By nature, we're different.

653
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,260
How's auntie?

654
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,760
She woke up once.

655
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,040
The doctor came to see her.

656
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,820
She's all right.

657
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,160
You're blaming him for not coming to you immediately?

658
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,760
An Jie told me.

659
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,400
- That's because...
- I know.

660
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,260
I don't blame him.

661
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,680
Then why are you like this?

662
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,480
We're not suited for each other.

663
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,160
There is someone more suitable for him.

664
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,940
I told you,

665
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,256
he didn't want you to take the blame so he and Shen Zhilin...

666
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:50,000
His love is work.

667
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,440
He dated me at first not because I loved my family

668
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,316
but because of my competence and clear logic at work, right?

669
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,700
But now

670
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,060
I can't work, nor can I be logical.

671
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,420
It's only temporary.

672
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,720
Even if time passes,

673
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,226
I don't want to be with him anymore.

674
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:26,040
Why not?

675
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,400
My mother

676
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,400
was diagnosed with a thrombus a while ago.

677
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,820
But she didn't tell me.

678
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,040
I should have accompanied her to the dialysis.

679
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,520
Kelan,

680
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,360
don't think too much.

681
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,100
You were busy then.

682
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,360
With what?

683
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,740
I was just busy dating.

684
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,160
My mother didn't tell me

685
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,880
because she didn't want to affect our relationship.

686
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,660
Stop ruminating, okay?

687
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,460
It's just an accident.

688
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,380
Auntie is out of danger and is fine now.

689
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,540
It's not an accident.

690
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,140
It's because I only focused on Yu Hao

691
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,860
that I neglected my mother and let this happen.

692
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,500
Just now,

693
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,460
just now when he appeared in front of me,

694
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:50,240
all I could think about were the times we spent together.

695
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,890
But...

696
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,620
but eclipsing those thoughts

697
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,720
was my mother being seriously ill.

698
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,420
I even imagined if my mother were not saved,

699
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,980
I...

700
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,400
I've no idea what I should do.

701
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,180
I only thought that

702
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,360
I must break up with him

703
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,420
so my mother can get better.

704
01:01:44,813 --> 01:01:46,513
Coming!

705
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,180
- Let me get you a glass of water.
- Gong Wenxing,

706
01:02:02,813 --> 01:02:05,453
am I really wrong?

707
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,580
I'm wrong.

708
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,320
But why am I wrong?

709
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,980
Am I really wrong?

710
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:28,159
Hello, Meng Meng.

711
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:29,800
I'm worried about Kelan

712
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,720
and want to accompany her.

713
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,020
I won't go back tonight.

714
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,920
Okay. I know.

715
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,506
Bye.

716
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,020
When I was a kid,

717
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,900
my mom always complained my dad

718
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,459
was busy with work, not accompanying her.

719
01:02:48,466 --> 01:02:51,426
I thought it was all my dad's fault.

720
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,740
When I grew up

721
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,779
and started to work,

722
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,720
I thought my mother was too sensitive then.

723
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,820
Now I'm thinking,

724
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,920
they were actually both wrong.

725
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,900
If you knew you were different by nature,

726
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,060
why did you have to be together in the first place?

727
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:23,806
An Jie.

728
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:25,600
Director Wang.

729
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,493
When President Yu comes, ask him to sign this document.

730
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,360
Okay.

731
01:04:49,433 --> 01:04:51,033
An Jie,

732
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:55,380
President Yu, Sister Kelan, and Sister Meng are all absent.

733
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,080
And they didn't say whether it was a business trip or leave.

734
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,120
Do you know what's going on?

735
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:03,430
There was an emergency in Director Su's family.

736
01:05:05,385 --> 01:05:07,413
She hasn't shown up for many days.

737
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:09,350
It must be serious, right?

738
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,740
He ate nothing?

739
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,200
Eat something.

740
01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:16,530
I'll cook something myself.

741
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,300
What's going on with Su Kelan?

742
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,166
What's she mean that they aren't the same type of people?

743
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,940
Isn't this deliberately trying to make trouble?

744
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:41,856
Who forced Yu Hao to rush to work with Shen Zhilin as soon as he came back?

745
01:06:41,856 --> 01:06:45,610
- That's because...
- It's because his career is his top priority.

746
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:48,000
He doesn't approve of those who don't think the same way.

747
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,380
But for Kelan, her mother matters most.

748
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,960
Her mother is ill in hospital.

749
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,420
Yu Hao didn't go to the hospital, but went on a business trip.

750
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,876
Even if Yu Hao had visited her mother, it wouldn't have improved her condition.

751
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:03,360
Besides, it's not Yu Hao's fault that her mother got sick.

752
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,320
Does breaking up make her get better?

753
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,020
Why does Kelan have to do this? Does she have to torture him like this?

754
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,820
What do you mean by that?

755
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,766
So, it's all Kelan's fault?

756
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:13,913
And since Yu Hao was taking up all Kelan's time,

757
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:16,940
how could Auntie have dared say anything to Kelan?

758
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:19,520
She was just afraid of affecting their romance.

759
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,756
So you say Yu Hao has no responsibility at all for the situation?

760
01:07:22,756 --> 01:07:25,026
But he's not so guilty that the relationship has to die, right?

761
01:07:25,026 --> 01:07:27,220
Isn't it good enough that they consider how to take care of auntie together from now on?

762
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,480
Why break up?

763
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,290
Can't she see how Yu Hao has changed recently?

764
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:32,620
[Yao Qian]

765
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,000
Hello?

766
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,920
I'll be there tomorrow.

767
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,460
President Yu isn't there today?

768
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,020
Fried rice uses

769
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:12,196
only ingredients that seem very simple and can be readily obtained.

770
01:08:12,196 --> 01:08:13,920
Just stir-fry it in a pan

771
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,440
and It's delicious and filling.

772
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,080
It's the easiest way to find your happiness.

773
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,360
It might be simple,

774
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:24,660
but it is often the taste you miss the most. It's the taste of fireworks in the world.

775
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,940
This dish is in everyone's memory.

776
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,700
But the taste in everyone's memory, is all different.

777
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,720
How did the egg taste in your memory?

778
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,340
What kind of riped tomatoes?

779
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,760
Did you put sugar or not?

780
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,880
Did you put vinegar or not? Soy sauce? Spring onions?

781
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,060
After I tasted this dish at a restaurant, I've realized that

782
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,980
it is not as delicious as the home-made one.

783
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:55,020
Then I understand this simple dish can be very unique.

784
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,820
I didn't know the way you like your eggs cooked,

785
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:13,700
Do you like a hard yolk?

786
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,100
or a soft yolk?

787
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,220
Minced meat stir-fried with cowpeas?

788
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,060
Or if you like a particular family's pickled vegetables,

789
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,860
you'll could change from friends to family.

790
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:25,140
If you have a kitchen, you'll find more pleasant surprises like this.

791
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,460
The theme of this program is the taste of parting.

792
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,000
The taste of parting is I miss you.

793
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,880
- Hello?
- Have you seen Yu Hao lately?

794
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,860
I can't get in touch with him.

795
01:09:46,093 --> 01:09:48,630
You can't reach Yu Hao?

796
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,520
Yu Hao!

797
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,750
Yu Hao, are you in there?

798
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,520
Hello, is this property management?

799
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,500
My friend locked himself in the house.

800
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,070
Could you please open the door?

801
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,580
Thank you.

802
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,030
Yu Hao?

803
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,680
Yu Hao?

804
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,460
Yu Hao?

805
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,260
Why are you here?

806
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,520
Everyone is looking for him.

807
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,270
He ate that much?

808
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,800
Wake up.

809
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,620
Why did you eat so much alone?

810
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,460
Yu Hao?

811
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,300
- Yu Hao?
- Yu Hao!

812
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,160
Yu Hao! Yu Hao! Yu Hao!

813
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,660
Ambulance.

814
01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:13,311
♫  Your long hair is softly scattered as you're curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

815
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:20,898
♫  A milky blossom in coffee, melting gently in the palm of your hand  ♫

♫  You're lightly plucking the guitar  ♫

820
01:12:43,011 --> 01:12:47,111
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

821
01:12:47,111 --> 01:12:50,078
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

822
