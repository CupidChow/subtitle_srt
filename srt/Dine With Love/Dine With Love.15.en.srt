But my mom never allowed me to eat sweet food.

118
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,890
She was afraid I'd be like her.

119
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,740
And I know that eating too much sugar is not good.

120
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,600
There was a time my mouth was full of cavities.

And I'll still think about it

127
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,560

Yes.

130
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,680
Since then,

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,220
I've always felt so guilty.

132
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,180
I was under a lot of pressure then.

133
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,640
I even had a fight with Yu Hao.

134
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
Then later,

135
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,120
I apologized to you for that,

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,220
and I finally felt a little better.

137
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,960
So,

138
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,060
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,900
Trying to spend more time with someone is not a trick.

140
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,840
And I know that you haven't let go of Yu Hao.

141
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,830
I can't face Yu Hao.

142
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,180
That's because every time I see him

143
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,420
it reminds me

144
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,500
that I didn't take good care of my mom because I put all my focus on our relationship.

145
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,380
But I can't face you either,

146
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,220
I wouldn't have met you either,

147
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,360

148
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,270
Whenever I see you,

149
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,120
I'd think of him.

Director Jin has just left.

Why don't you go after him?

159
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
You were never this cowardly when you went after Yu Hao.

160
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
I don't know.

161
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,560
Maybe I've been reflecting on the mistakes I made when I went after Yu Hao.

162
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,540
Once I'd told Yu Hao I was going to pursue him, he avoided me.

163
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,160
I'm afraid that Jin Xuan would do the same.

164
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
If he doesn't know I like him, at least we can still be buddies.

165
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,140
Go out for some barbecue, have some drinks together.

166
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,920
But if I tell him,

167
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,220
he might avoid me, too,

168
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,760
and we couldn't even stay friends anymore.

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,920
But you have to tell him at some point.

170
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,140
If you don't, what if he meets someone else and leaves you?

171
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,420
But I can't tell him until I'm 100% sure he'll say yes.

172
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,340
Doesn't he like you?

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,100

If I try just a little harder,

176
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,020
and learn other things from you... that won't be a waste of my energy.

177
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,620
Why do you have to be like me?

178
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,800
Have you ever thought that if you stay true to yourself in front of him,

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,080
he may just like the way you even more?

180
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,280
No, I can't.

181
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,500
He really dislikes me.

182
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,100
Because you always pretend to be someone else.

183
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Your usual appearance is really cute.

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,100
No one else could ever learn to be so cute.

185
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,680
Why do you want to be someone else?

186
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,900
Something's bothering you?

187
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,880
Auntie, you know what?

188
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,080
The night when I first met Kelan,

189
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,580
she came to looking for me to talk about work.

190
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,120
Back then...

191
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,420
Everybody, thank you for your hard work.

192
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm Su Kelan, the new Director of PR Department for "What To Eat Next?"

193
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,780
It's late.

194
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,180
I have a car; I'll give you a ride.

195
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,240
Thank you, Director Jin, but that's not necessary.

196
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,460
My boyfriend will come to pick me up soon.

197
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,440
I've been thinking

198
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,900
if I had been braver

199
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,780
back then...

200
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,760
Kelan.

201
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,840
Would I have

202
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,700
become the one who's with her now?

203
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,600
If I'd been the one who was beside her,

204
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,620
she wouldn't have had to be so busy...

205
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,660
and perhaps...

206
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,010
perhaps you wouldn't have had such an accident.

207
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,680
If I were her boyfriend,

208
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,600
I'd make her happier.

209
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,840
Doctor Wang

210
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,670
was a classmate of Kelan's father.

211
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,720
Back then the three of us were good friends.

212
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,080
Doctor Wang also had feelings for me...

213
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,100
Since I was in poor health even back then,

214
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,300
my friends all urged me to be with Doctor Wang.

215
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,860
They thought he was the right one for me.

216
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,240
After Kelan's father and I got together,

217
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,100
Doctor Wang was depressed for quite a while.

218
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
He once asked me

219
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,930
what would have happened if he'd met me first.

220
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,820
A year later, he met another girl.

221
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,580
They got married and had two adorable children.

222
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,540
The whole family was very happy.

223
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,090
Missing someone

224
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,720
doesn't mean that person will disappear from your life forever.

225
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,360
Everything you've gone through

226
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,880
may only prepare you

227
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,760
for meeting the right one in the future.

228
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,560
Director Jin!

229
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,720
Come to the set with me to see the food I cooked and see if it's okay.

230
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
What?

231
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,980
Come on.

232
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,980
You were just talking to Zhang Bi?

233
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Yes.

234
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,300
Does she like Director Jin?

235
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,260
You can tell, huh?

236
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,860
Sister Kelan. Sister Kelan.

237
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,560
Xin Xin. What are you doing here again?

238
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,020
I brought you a birthday gift.

239
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,860
You have a gift for me?

240
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,040
- When did you prepare it?
- Just now.

241
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,400
Sister Kelan, look.

242
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,980
What is it?

243
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,580
A seed is buried inside,

244
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,860
and it has just sprouted.

245
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,100
It'll grow bigger and stronger.

246
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,040
Whenever you feel unhappy,

247
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,460
just think that it's slowly growing,

248
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,260
and you'll feel much better.

249
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Thank you, Xin Xin.

250
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,780
What will the seed grow into?

251
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,540
I'm not going to tell you.

252
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,320
Why won't you tell me?

253
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,000
If I don't tell you, you'll wonder every day.

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,700
And that will make every day happy for you.

255
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
Thank you, Xin Xin.

256
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,080
Brother Yu Hao, how did I do?

257
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,260
Hurry and confirm the dish for the next episode.

258
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,760
As busy as I am, do I still have to worry about your program?

259
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm sick, yet I'm still cooking for you.

260
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,860
What are you unhappy about?

261
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,541
I'm trying to comfort you, and you still look unhappy.

262
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,700
What are you mumbling about?

263
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,820
It's nothing...

264
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
Done.

265
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,380
Why did you cook double-cooked pork?

266
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,330
I learned it from the person you like.

267
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,750
What?

268
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,280
Nothing.

269
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,240
Let me get you some chopsticks.

270
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,860
Your usual appearance is very cute.

271
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,580
No one else could ever learn to be so cute.

272
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,180
Why do you try to be someone else?

273
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,900
Don't eat it.

274
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,770
I...

275
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,020
I...

276
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,230
I've come back to life.

277
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,360
Very tasty.

278
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,440
Why have you never cooked this for the program?

279
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,120
Dressed just like that.

280
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,100
- Why pretend?
- I'm not pretending.

281
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,500
My agency says all my fans are male.

282
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,360
Don't all men like you...

283
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,980
like this type of young, energetic girls?

284
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,680
I think

285
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,600
your agency has the wrong idea about men.

286
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,680
I think you are fine, just being who you are.

287
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,340
Do you really think

288
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,660
I'm more likable like this?

289
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,200
You like me better like this?

290
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,920
Absolutely.

291
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,280
- Kelan.
- Yes?

292
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,020
What do you think the seed will grow into?

293
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,960
Anything will do.

294
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,800
You've drunk enough

295
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,400
and gathered enough courage.

296
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,840
It's time to confess your love.

297
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,980
Go for it.

298
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,910
You can do it.

299
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,560
Red?

300
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,180
No, too loud.

301
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,420
Pink?

302
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,590
Is it too pale so he'll say I'm being pretentious again?

303
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Happy birthday!

304
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,480
Wow, this is a rarity. You don't often actually call me.

305
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,500
Thank you for your birthday wishes.

306
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,000
Where's my gift?

307
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,680
Aiya.

308
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,020
I ordered something for you from overseas.

309
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,560
But that guy is so unreliable. It's still on the way.

310
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,140
But I know you don't care about such formalities.

311
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,420
I'll take this misfortune as a way of warding off bad luck.

312
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,840
And I"ll take that good luck and wish all the best for you and your mom.

313
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,000
What's wrong, Meng Meng?

314
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,720
The baby.

315
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,220
The baby is kicking me.

316
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,020
Hubby..

317
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,580
Hubby.

318
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,780
What's wrong? What's wrong?

319
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,380
- Our baby...
- What?

320
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,580
Our baby is kicking me.

321
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,160
Hurry.

322
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,560
- Do you hear that?
- Really. The baby really is moving.

323
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,820
Here. Listen carefully.

324
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
Kelan,

325
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,320
Doctor Wang is calling.

326
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,620
We've got a kidney.

327
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,660
I can have the surgery right away.

328

There are three joys that can be conveyed without words.

338
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,770
Three months ago, Yu Hao, only 29 years old,

339
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,980
successfully took " What To Eat Next?" to the main board of NASDAQ.

340
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,760
And in only three months, the gains on the stock index have jumped by 37%,

341
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,540
and the company's value stands at 12 billion dollars.

342
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,120
President Yu, it's been over a year since I interviewed you last time.

343
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,480
Now that your company has been successfully listed, and the company's value is increasing steadily,

344
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,240
has there been any change in you personally?

345
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,000
My cooking skills are getting better.

346
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,600
You are watching the second season of "Dine with Love",

347
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,880
sponsored by "Whats to Eat Next".

348
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,440
I'm the host Bobo.

Hi, everybody. I'm Tang Lixuan.

00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,860
Hi, guys. I'm Zhang Bi.

352
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,400
Hello, everybody. Long time no see. I'm Yu Hao.

353
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,100
Welcome!

354
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,740
After the first season,

355
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,240
what kind of surprise our guests will bring us in the second season?

356
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,380
We are looking forward to it!

357
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Mom, let's eat.

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,520
Hello, President Yu.

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,600
Which department are you from?

360
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,120
P-P-PR Department.

361
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,930
What do you think of my performance on the program "Dine with Love"?

362
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,340
Very... Very good!

363
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,540
President Yu, you're handsome and charming.

364
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,360
You are perfect to represent our brand.

365
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,620
Participating in this kind of food program can enhance the credibility of our app among our customers.

366
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,680
Do you know how long it takes to film one program?

367
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,220
If you think it's too time-consuming,

368
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,340
the PR Department can help you by drafting the script and picking the dishes.

369
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,460
As for cooking, using a double would be okay.

370
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,560
That could save a lot of time for you.

371
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,820
What do you say?

372
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,400
Okay.

373
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,760
Although it can save a lot of time

374
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,660
if the script and the cooking are done by someone else,

375
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,980
it's an act of cheating per se.

376
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,060
That kind of behavior won't last long, and it'll collapse sooner or later.

377
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,580
And that would cause more damage to our brand.

378
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,880
I think creating a certain image is not the purpose of attending the show,

379
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,620
instead, it's for expressing and communicating President Yu's understanding of food and dining.

380
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,820
So that attracts those people who have the same understanding choose to watch "What To Eat Next?"

381
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,840
Your PR Department's job is to accurately analyze the market

382
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,700
to come up with marketing plans

383
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,220
that maximize our brand value and promote our brand and my personal image.

384
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,140
Yet, judging by the nonsense you just said,

385
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,160
do you think you're right for this job?

386
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,460
Come on in.

387
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,620
If it happens again, you should know what to do.

388
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,860
Sister Meng, Sister Qian, you guys can even laugh at me? I'm under so much pressure right now.

389
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,220
You feel that much pressured now?

390
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,500
In the past, you would've been fired by now.

391
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,440
Exactly.

392
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,250
President Yu is so fierce, but he loves cooking,

393
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,360
even allows us to keep cats in the office.

394
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,680
Is he schizophrenic?

395
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,480
Get back to work.

396
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,140
An Jie's cat knocked over your cup again?

397
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,940
Stop laughing. It's not funny.

398
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,290
What's going on with Yu Hao?

399
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,560
Why are you suddenly talking about him?

400
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,060
Before, he was the one who complained most about those who argued and made a big deal out of cooking.

401
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,460
Now he's the one who has suddenly become so interested in cooking.

402
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,760
Jin Xuan didn't even want to invite him to participate in the second season of "Dine with Love".

403
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,960
Yet for three months, Yu Hao had me negotiating with him.

404
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,920
And he spent a lot of money to replace the other sponsors

405
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,640
so that he could be in the show.

406
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
And now he spends so much time studying cooking for each episode now.

407
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,520
Doesn't your PR plan clearly state that

408
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,520
the more he loves life and cooking, the greater it benefits your brand?

409
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,740
After the second season aired, didn't the company's share price go up again?

410
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,100
Yes.

411
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,660
And this thing about keeping cats.

412
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,800
Didn't he used to say that he loved cats but he was afraid that he couldn't keep them well?

413
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,360
So he never kept any.

414
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,940
How come he suddenly allows employees to keep cats in the office?

415
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,860
What's wrong with that?

416
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,180
With a bunch of cats in the office, it feels cozy and there's no individual responsibility for raising them.

417
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,260
and there's no individual responsibility for raising them.

418
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,480
It's great.

419
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,120
What are you really worried about?

420
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,820
Tell me,

421
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,360
do you think it's because of Kelan

422
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,760
that Yu Hao has changed this much?

423
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,020
There are three phases for breakup.

424
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,670
The first, either eat nothing or overeat.

425
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,260
The second, bury yourself in work to avoid the pain.

426
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,160
And the third, to actively make changes in yourself.

427
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,680
And the change is the key to bringing love back.

428
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,400
So which phrase is he in right now?

429
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,500
The fourth phrase.

430
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,800
Use the change as a front to cover up, his lack of courage of finding love back.

431
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,980
Isn't that just cowardice?

432
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,360
Instead of doing those things, he may as well just go and get Kelan back.

433
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,340
But... But Kelan was the one who broke up with him.

434
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,000
I told you

435
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,900
that Kelan wasn't thinking straight back then.

436
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,340
Haven't you heard of PTSD?

437
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,700
Besides,

438
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,340
the kidney transplant for Kelan's mom was very successful.

439
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,180
She must have recovered by now.

440
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,340
In that case,

441
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,380
why doesn't Su Kelan go and get Yu Hao back?

442
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,520
Why must Yu Hao do it first?

443
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,760
Wifey,

444
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
is it cute?

445
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,020
Gong Wenxing!

446
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,360
Put Gong Xi down.

447
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,500
Okay. All right.

448
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,020
All right, all right.

449
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,960
Baby. Baby.

450
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,540
Yes.

451
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,800
We only recommend the products that have been tested and clearly show their ingredients.

452
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,830
Yes. That way, we can be responsible for the brand.

453
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,660
Okay, let's keep in touch.

454
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,670
Hi.

455
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,700
These are the dishes my daughter cooked today.

456
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,960
Today's main ingredient is bamboo shoot.

457
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,300
So, we have fried bacon with bamboo shoots,

458
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,740
stir-friend bamboo shoots with brown sauce,

459
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,760
and bamboo shoots and spare rib soup.

460
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,480
The bamboo shoots, through immense pressure, burst through the soil,

461
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,400
full of energy and vitality.

462
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,740
Alright, I'll start eating now, or the dishes will get cold.

463
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,480
Thank you, Sunflower Seed, for the big plane!

464
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,920
My dear friends, see you tomorrow.

465
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,100
Mom,

466
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,620
you've only live streamed for three months, and you are already able to support the family through in-stream ads.

467
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,680
Had I known it, I wouldn't have had to find a job.

468
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,080
No, don't be like that.

469
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,640
It's better if you find a job.

470
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,880
You may not want a life for yourself, but I do.

471
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,540
I've fully recovered now.

472
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,120
You don't have to keep me company all the time now.

473
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,200
You should go back to your normal life.

474
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,720
I know. I was just kidding.

475
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,640
I've already started to look for a new job.

476
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,920
The company must've sent someone to bring us the products. I'll go get the door.

477
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,440
All right.

478
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,500
Coming.

479
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
Kelan.

480
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,840
What are you doing here?

481
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Auntie Su.

482
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,990
You are not welcome here.

483
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,840
Kelan, what happened in the past is all my fault.

484
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,960
I've been... living with regret in the past year.

485
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,040
I've always wanted to find a chance and apologize to you,

486
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,420
but I didn't have the courage.

487
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,600
And later,

488
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,700
I heard about auntie's accident...

489
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,820
If there's nothing else, you can go now.

490
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,800
Kelan,

491
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,780
I love you.

492
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,460
You are my one and only love in this world.

493
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,260
I know that everything I did doesn't deserve your forgiveness.

494
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,980
I just want to show you how sorry I am.

495
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,070
If you're done, you can go.

496
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,880
There's one more thing.

497
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,240
You know that I work in the Marketing Department of "Love Fresh Food."

498
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,920
We are trying to promote our brand right now.

499
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,080
I've highly recommended Auntie Su.

500
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,740
Please try our products first.

501
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,860
Although we are no longer in a relationship, I still hope that I can, be of help to you.

502
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,990
Let's keep in touch.

503
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,640
Hello? Director.

504
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,020
You said you could convince that Auntie Su to work for us. Have you?

505
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,340
It's almost done. I know them very well.

506
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
Shall we try it?

507
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,820
Of course. Why not?

508
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,840
He ate us out of house and home for years.

509
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,000
Exactly. It's free anyway.

510
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,820
Let's eat.

511
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,900
Hello?

512
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,580
Miss Su, you recently interviewed with us.

513
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,480
We are sorry to tell you that we don't think you are the right fit.

514
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,070
Thank you.

515
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,356
Looking for a job isn't going well?

516
00:37:57,356 --> 00:38:00,660
No. I just want to find a job close to home.

517
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,880
Mom, go ahead and eat.

518
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,040
After we finish, you can wash up.

519
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,440
This afternoon, I still need to prepare for an interview tomorrow.

520
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,140
- Hi.
- Hi.

521
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,500
I'm Su Kelan. I'm here for my interview appointment.

522
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,540
Please wait over there.

523
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,680
Thanks.

524
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,240
Our company is a professional MCN service provider.

525
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,260
We can help you with the operation of your channel.

526
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,600
Your daughter told us she didn't need any help, so we just...

527
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,400
We can discuss this issue of management.

528
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,120
- I can't rely on my daughter forever.
- Huh?

529
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,980
Nothing.

530
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,980
If you were to help me with the operation, how are you going to do it?

531
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,560
Please come in.

532
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
Hello.

533
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,960
My name is Su Kelan.

534
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,480
I was with "What To Eat Next?" before.

535
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,160
I see that you did very well at that company.

536
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,710
Why did you suddenly stop working for so long?

537
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,800
Because of a family emergency.

538
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,260
Then could such an emergency recur?

539
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,600
Mom, why didn't you wait for me?

540
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,540
I can't cook myself when you are not home?

541
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,940
What did you cook?

542
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,020
Try it.

543
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,280
It's the first time I've cooked four dishes and one soup.

544
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,560
You can try my cooking today.

545
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,240
Here, let's eat, Grandma.

546
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,100
I didn't expect you'd really call me over for dinner every week.

547
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm so tired of it.

548
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,720
Come on, try it.

549
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,040
See if my cooking has gotten better?

550
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,900
Who can compare to my grandson's IQ?

551
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,720
With your cooking skills, if you worked in Chrysanthemum Restaurant,

552
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,840
you'd put all Gong Wenxing's employees out of job.

553
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,460
That's an overstatement.

554
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,020
- So tasty.
- Really?

555
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,600
What a nice boy!

556
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,780
You should already have a girlfriend.

557
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,320
What do you think?

558
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,780
Does it taste good?

559
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,320
Well.

560
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,700
Mom,

561
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,400
why don't you forget about cooking?

562
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,440
Just let me take care of cooking in the future.

563
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,050
That's why I need to practice more.

564
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,940
Kelan.

565
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,000
- I've been doing live-streaming.
- Yeah.

566
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,880
I decided to find an agent for myself.

567
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,880
Why? Isn't it better to let me do it?

568
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,820
Who can be more devoted than your own daughter?

569
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,340
Kelan,

570
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,020
I've been trying to convince you not to revolve around me,

571
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,900
but you wouldn't listen.

572
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,160
But now I suddenly realized

573
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,620
that actually, it was me who's been dependent on you too much.

574
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,260
too much.

575
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,640
I enjoyed so much being taken care by you.

576
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,560
That's why

577
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,220
I've decided to find my own life back.

578
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,880
Mom, you are doing it again.

579
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,020
Don't think too much. Come on, eat.

580
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,520
Have some more.

581
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,760
Today, I found out something when I talked with the agent.

582
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,000
We want to hold a fan meeting for you.

583
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,240
We can invite the most active fans

584
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,140
so that they can be motivated even more.

585
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,340
Such as your fan Sunflower Seed.

586
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,960
I know him.

587
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,680
He's one of my first fans.

588
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,140
Not only does he leave comments,

589
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,140
but he also bought a lot of gifts and participated a lot of the promotions.

590
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,460
Is there a way to get his phone number?

591
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,590
I want...

592
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,660
to thank him in person.

593
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,920
- Hello?
- Hello? This is An Jie.

594
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,940
Hello. I'm Mama Su.

595
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,060
Thank you for your support.

596
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,900
I want to meet you in person. Is that okay?

597
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,130
You should know

598
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,080
who asked An Jie to do that, right?

599
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,940
I think you are still hung up on her.

600
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,900
Then why don't you let her know?

601
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,920
Stop hesitating.

602
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,140
Look at Gong Wenxing. He becomes a father now.

603
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,780
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

604
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,340
Yes, I am.

605
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,160
Yu Hao.

606
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,960
Thank you.

607
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,060
I just learned

608
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,140
that you've been helping us in secret.

609
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,640
I've a question for you.

610
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,750
Do you still care about Kelan, and want to be with her?

611
00:44:48,004 --> 00:44:49,604
I do.

612
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,310
I'm not sure,

613
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,120
how she thinks of me.

614
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,940
I heard

615
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,220
that she's been looking for a new job.

616
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,900
But she didn't come to me.

617
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,980
When our family had an accident,

618
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,570
I was so devastated.

619
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,230
I've always been in poor health.

620
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,560
But why did I get to survive?

621
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,800
To help me pull myself together,

622
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,240
Kelan suddenly acted like an adult.

623
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,540
She wanted to take care of me and everybody around her.

624
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,160
So...

625
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,480
she never shared her stress and sadness with anybody.

626
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,340
But...

627
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,230
how could it be possible for her to carry all the burdens?

628
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:45,260
I feel sorry for Kelan.

629
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,600
I hope she can find someone

630
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,760
who she doesn't need

631
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,020
to pretend to be tough,

632
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,540
and can feel free to let out her stress.

633
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,880
She's actually quite tense when she's with you.

634
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,270
She hopes that she can be perfect in your eyes.

635
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,260
That's why I always thought that you weren't the right man for her.

636
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,700
But later

637
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,340
I found that you actually cared about her a lot.

638
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,640
Maybe I was wrong.

639
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,420
Maybe I was the one who got so used

640
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,080
to being taken care of by my daughter.

641
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,980
I was too dependent on her.

642
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,200
And that's the reason she couldn't let go of me.

643
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,140
- Auntie.
- Yu Hao.

644
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,440
I hope you and I can join hands to help Kelan

645
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,320
and find her own life back.

646
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,800
Of course.

647
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,130
I've decided, to be independent and take care of myself.

648
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,040
You should also get over the past.

649
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,540
Don't miss your own happiness.

650
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,440
All right, let's eat.

651
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,880
If it's not tasty,

652
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,200
you can teach me how to cook.

653
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,080
[Monday, 10/12/2020]

654
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,660
[Monday, 10/12/2020]

655
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

656
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,660
the second season of "Dine with Love" has been aired successfully.

657
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,460
Let's start the party!

658
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,520
Hold on. Hold on a sec.

659
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,220
President Yu is not here yet.

660
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,020
How can we start now?

661
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,700
I bet that deadpan Yu person won't come today.

662
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,340
No need to wait for him. Let's start without him!

663
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,480
Since Yu Hao is not coming,

664
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,270
why don't you go find him, instead of staying here?

665
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,300
Why do I have to find him?

666
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,100
Why don't you go and find him?

667
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,880
Bonehead.

668
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,180
What did you say?

669
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,760
Drink.

670
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,280
Of all the people, you must mention the one who turned me down.

671
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,556
Shouldn't we let him drink a bottle? Shouldn't we?

672
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:18,060
Come on, drink a bottle, Director Jin!

673
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,540
Drink! Drink! Drink!

674
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,080
That's amazing.

675
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,600
That bottle was to punish you for talking about my painful past.

676
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,360
We should let him drink another one, right?

677
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,800
Another one!

678
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,040
Director Jin.

679
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,560
Director Jin is drunk. I've got an idea.

680
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,220
What's going on?

681
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,220
Why did you push me?

682
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,960
How... How did you get on my bed?

683
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,300
Don't... Don't ask me.

684
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,580
You were drunk last night,

685
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,920
and you dragged me in here.

686
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,280
You grabbed my hand

687
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,140
and wouldn't let me go whatsoever.

688
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,040
Goodnight.

689
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,080
Besides, what's the big deal?

690
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,050
It's not the first time, anyway.

691
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,000
What?

692
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,140
If you want me to be responsible for you, I can surely do that.

693
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,400
Just leave.

694
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,610
It'll be bad if people see us.

695
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,860
What's going on?

696
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,700
What happened? They came again.

697
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,280
Yeah. How come they are here again?

698
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,500
Fame comes at a price. The reporters just wouldn't leave me alone.

699
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,900
Anyway, hurry up and think of something to explain to them.

700
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,590
How should we explain to them?

701
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,780
We've used the excuse of talking about the script.

702
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,780
You know what? I feel so dizzy.

703
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,410
Director Jin, just let it be.

704
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,820
Stop! Stop taking pictures!

705
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,590
It's not what you think!

706
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,900
What should I do?

707
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,980
Even if I jump into the Yellow River, I can't clean my name now.

708
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,760
You have an idea?

709
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,400
Then what are you thinking about?

710
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,680
I'm thinking

711
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,980
what you said doesn't make any sense.

712
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,680
The Yellow River is so yellow,

713
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,190
of course, you can't be cleaned.

714
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,320
Jin Xuan is such a straight guy.

715
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,000
At this point he still can't tell that Zhang Bi set him up.

716
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,440
Come on, look.

717
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,800
In all the videos and photos,

718
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,040
Zhang Bi smiled so hard.

719
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,320
Apparently she wasn't worried at all about being caught.

720
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,480
I guess he really has no clue.

721
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,880
It makes Zhang Bi go crazy.

722
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,980
She even asked me, what she should do.

723
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,840
Asked you?

724
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,900
I don't think you are any better than her

725
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,640
when it comes to dealing with relationship.

726
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,360
Baby.

727
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,760
Here.

728
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,260
Take this.

729
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,860
This.

730
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,900
Here. This.

731
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,110
Good.

732
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,240
Sweetie.

733
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,440
Happy birthday!

734
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,000
Thank your Godmother.

735
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,780
I brought my gift. Now I've got to go.

736
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,480
It's my daughter's first birthday.

737
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,000
Gong Wenxing went to pick up his mother, and my parents went grocery shopping.

738
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,030
Are you sure you want to leave?

739
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,880
I'm leaving.

740
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,170
Hold on. Hold it.

741
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,700
What's going on?

742
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,420
Are you afraid that he'd be here?

743
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,540
Come on. Come here. Sit down.

744
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,110
I just don't get it.

745
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,120
You really don't want to meet him?

746
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,860
I had a few job interviews these days,

747
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,840
and they all rejected me once they learned,

748
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,700
about my family situation.

749
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,680
I once thought that I was quite competitive

750
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,520
and competent.

751
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,260
But after my mom's accident, I suddenly realized

752
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,500
that I'm the one with weakness.

753
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,540
Yu Hao,

754
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,260
is really nice to me.

755
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,620
I don't want to become his burden.

756
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,960
I think

757
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,560
I should learn to balance my life

758
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,360
and make sure that I won't

759
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,520
become his burden

760
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,100
- before I can...
- Kelan,

761
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,400
you're too hard on yourself.

762
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,360
And because of the accident happened in your family,

763
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,840
you've been afraid to open up to the others

764
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,060
or let the others share your burden.

765
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,100
Even when it's me,

766
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,400
or your mother.

767
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,360
But you should know that aside from sharing your joy

768
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,460
with your friends, family, and boyfriend,

769
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,240
you can also go to them for comfort

770
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,850
when you are sad or need support.

771
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,660
Yu Hao has changed a lot.

772
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,940
He doesn't fire people for no reason now,

773
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,320
and he even allows us to keep cats in the office.

774
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,320
Keep cats?

775
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,160
But we can't let the cats run wild.

776
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,780
We have certain rules.

777
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,160
The cats are numbered.

778
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,720
If the cats run around

779
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,340
and make a mess in the office because the owners fail to watch them well, the owners will get punished.

780
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,920
I think...

781
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,620
he's trying very hard to become a tolerant person

782
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,180
who's more trustworthy and reliable.

783
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,700
It must be Gong Wenxing and the others.

784
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,900
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

785
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,080
Coming.

786
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,220
Han Meng, long time no see.

787
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,580
What are you doing here?

788
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,640
It's your daughter's first birthday, right? I'm here to visit you

789
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,180
and bring you a gift.

790
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,340
Please take it.

791
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,640
Kelan, you are also here.

792
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,940
I care the one you care.

793
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,630
I'll try my best to come back to your life.

794
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,380
By the way, how does your mother think of the product I brought last time?

795
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,380
If there's a problem, we'll fix it and make it better.

796
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,080
He's harassed you already?

797
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,340
How could it be harassment? I truly care about Kelan and her mother.

798
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,060
Yes, I made a mistake before.

799
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,860
But that gives me more reasons to understand how to cherish things,

800
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,460
and stop me from making mistakes again.

801
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,260
That's enough. You can leave now. You are not welcomed here.

802
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,360
- Just leave.
- Please take it. It's okay.
- I don't want it. Get out!

803
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,340
President Yu.

804
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,820
You are with "Love Fresh Food" now?

805
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,620
I'm not an employee of "What To Eat Next" anymore.

806
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,560
I think I don't have to answer your questions.

807
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,880
In that case, I don't think you are a friend or family to any of us here,

808
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,140
so there's no need for you to stay either.

809
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,600
Or, do you want me to call the police?

810
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:08,200
I can take the chance to press a charge against you for invasion of my privacy.

811
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,280
Kelan, I still have you in my heart.

812
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,950
Don't forget to try that product.

813
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,620
What are you doing? I told you I don't want it. Take it away.

814
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,410
It's disgusting.

815
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,320
Today is my daughter's first birthday.

816
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,080
You should all stay for dinner. None of you is allowed to leave.

817
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,020
I'm here to see you.

818
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,680
It's getting late. I won't keep you guys for dinner.

819
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,280
Please close the door on your way out.

820
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,280
Long time no see.

821
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,620
Long time no see.

822
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,540
How have you been doing?

823
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,900
I've been doing well.

824
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,080
Then your mom...

825
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,560
My mom had the surgery,

826
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,140
and she's much better now.

827
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,920
Good to know.

828
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,340
I heard that you are looking for a job.

829
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,640
There happens to be an opening in my company. It fits you very well.

830
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,040
It's okay.

831
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,360
My income is not bad right now.

832
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,640
Then why are you

833
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,100
still looking for a job?

834
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,380
The interviews didn't go well?

835
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,740
Why did you apply for so many other jobs

836
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,340
instead of coming to me?

837
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,040
I didn't come to you because I care

838
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,840
about the company.

839
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:34,200
I don't want to cause trouble to my colleagues again

840
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,800
because of my family situation.

841
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,320
- What's this?
- Your family situation

842
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,140
won't cause any trouble to this job.

843
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,120
This is the teaching agreement we signed before.

844
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,460
The second season of "Dine with Love"

845
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,460
has kicked off.

846
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,000
But based on the agreement, you still owe me a few classes.

847
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,430
Only...

848
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,480
Only to teach you how to cook?

849
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,800
Or what?

850
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,660
I'll wait for you at 2:00 p.m.

851
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,630
in the office on Saturday.

852
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,560
You asked her to teach you cooking? What's that supposed to mean?

853
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,540
Why don't you just tell her that you want her back?

854
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,020
I won't.

855
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,230
What do you mean? Explain to me

856
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,000
Are you still there?

857
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,640
Just come in, when you get here.

858
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,440
Your face ID is still in the record.

859
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:32,130
[What to Eat Next]

860
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,680
Wanshun?

861
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,820
What are you doing here?

862
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,740
Let me take a look at you.

863
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,760
You are so clean.

864
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,040
We only have three hours left.

865
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,900
What do you want to learn?

866
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,720
Chinese cabbage in supreme broth.

867
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,340
It's a National banquet dish.

868
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,760
It looks quite easy.

869
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,920
It's very time consuming.

870
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
We'll have to cook for a long time.

871
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,760
I don't mind waiting.

872
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,060
Why don't we...

873
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,040
cook steamed pork ribs with fermented black beans?

874
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,810
No. Chinese cabbage in supreme broth it is.

875
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,200
Good things are worth the wait.

876
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,790
That's how life goes, right?

877
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,680
I've prepared the ingredients for you.

01:05:30,277 --> 01:05:35,029
♫  Year after year and forever in this lifetime  ♫

891
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:38,705
♫  From dawn till dusks, through odds and ends  ♫

892
01:05:38,705 --> 01:05:42,325
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

893
01:05:42,325 --> 01:05:51,378
♫  I want to kiss you and say goodnight to you every day  ♫

894
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,860
See, it's right on time.

895
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,020
To cook Chinese cabbage in supreme broth, needs 3 hours.

896
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:21,400
In the meanwhile, you still had time to prepare spare ribs with garlic and a vegetable dish.

897
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,260
Class

898
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,120
is over now.

899
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,920
Why don't you join me for a meal?

900
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,640
I'm sorry. I forgot that you need to go home and cook for your mom.

901
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,240
Sorry.

902
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,640
My mom

903
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:49,000
will do a live-streaming, with Han Meng's mother tonight.

904
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,780
So, let's eat together.

905
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,160
I'll get the bowls and chopsticks.

906
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,460
Wanshun, what's wrong?

907
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,100
Xiao Hei.

908
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,520
What's the matter with Xiao Hei?

909
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,160
It looks like...

910
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,780
she's about to give birth.

911
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,980
Please stay and take care of them.

912
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,600
I have to leave for a while, and I'll be back soon.

913
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,180
Wanshun?

914
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,720
Why did you bring Wanshun home?

915
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,800
I don't want them to separate.

916
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,120
You... kept cats before?

917
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,460
Yeah.

918
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,820
I've always been a cat person.

919
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,180
But..

920
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,900
I wasn't sure if I could keep them well,

921
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,020
so I kept them in the office.

922
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,360
When I witnessed Xiao Hei giving birth just now, it felt really nice.

923
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:21,696
Now that you brought Wanshun home, you should neuter him.

924
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,600
Why?

925
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,460
I won't.

926
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,980
You won't?

927
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,720
Then they'll keep having babies.

928
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,140
What if you get a houseful of cats?

929
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,660
It's okay.

930
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,340
I'll keep them all, no matter how many.

931
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,000
They are also your cats.

932
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
What? You're willing to give birth but don't want to take on the responsibly to feed them?

933
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,500
When did they

934
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,140
become my cats?

935
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,070
I mean

936
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,560
do you have time for them?

937
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,280
You are so busy at work.

938
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,120
Don't you have to work anymore?

939
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,500
My life, is not all about work anyway.

940
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,260
Besides,

941
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,960
people will change.

942
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,300
When did you plant the sunflower?

943
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,360
The date of your birthday.

944
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,360
The pot Xin Xin gave me

945
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,770
was from you?

946
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:48,360
♫  Heartache mixed with sweetness  ♫

947
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,780
Yes.

948
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,240
♫  The distance is both far and near  ♫

949
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:59,200
Someone named Sunflower Seed, supported my mom on the live stream.

950
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,880
Was that also you who asked An Jie to do it?

951
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,910
♫  Feelings are like a game  ♫

952
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:13,860
♫  I'm trapped in my hesitation  ♫

953
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,540
♫  Longing for you to give me a sign  ♫

954
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,140
Why?

955
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:22,560
♫  Maybe I should ask myself  ♫

956
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,360
Because,

957
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,900
sunflower grows from sunflower seed.

958
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,380
♫  To get closer to you  ♫

959
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,680
I'm asking

960
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,770
why you did that?

961
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:43,970
♫  I'll abandon reason and do my best to fight for it  ♫

962
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,380
I hope we can both be happy.

963
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,030
It's late. Let me drive you home.

964
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,320
But you asked me to help you look after the cats.

965
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,870
I saw that cat mom got everything under control.

966
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,096
You wouldn't come over, no matter how many times I invited you.

967
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,140
What? Now you don't want to leave anymore?

968
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:35,269
♫  Who's hiding in a corner of their memories, talking to themselves?  ♫

969
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:40,533
♫  In the void of the night, no one answers.  ♫

970
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:44,853
♫  The moment the wind blows, it awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

971
01:12:44,853 --> 01:12:50,653
♫  Looking at the city lights, I feel the contrast with reality  ♫

972
01:12:50,653 --> 01:12:56,893
♫  But I still have to go down this road  ♫

973
01:12:56,893 --> 01:13:03,033
♫  Upon taking a step further, will my dream develop into something more? ♫

974
01:13:03,033 --> 01:13:05,973
♫  In this world full of fireworks, I see unexpected changes  ♫

975
01:13:05,973 --> 01:13:08,933
♫  In this world full of fireworks, I see unexpected changes  ♫

976
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:12,500
♫  I feel reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

977
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,290
♫  How many more journeys will I undergo before I'm left astounded and speechless?  ♫

978
01:13:14,293 --> 01:13:17,153
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like I'm stranded  ♫

979
01:13:17,153 --> 01:13:20,073
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like I'm stranded  ♫

980
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:23,473
♫  When I see my future self,  ♫

981
01:13:23,473 --> 01:13:26,873
♫  I will still be as stubborn as I've always been  ♫

982
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,453
♫  The uncertain suspense of this world  ♫

983
01:13:39,453 --> 01:13:42,333
♫  Who has never cried their eyes out before?  ♫

984
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:45,973
♫  Self-reflection will diminish what may come tomorrow  ♫

985
01:13:45,973 --> 01:13:47,873
♫  Let's reconcile with yesterday  ♫

986
01:13:47,873 --> 01:13:50,493
♫  When the raindrops will sigh and cover the glimmer of the starry sky ♫

987
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:53,617
♫  I will look forward to the sunny days coming soon after  ♫

988
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:55,653
♫  Let's stop and look up to see if we're still moving forward together  ♫

989
01:13:55,653 --> 01:14:00,233
♫  Is our pace the same as before?  ♫
