1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,440
Dice up the shiitake mushrooms to use later.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,560
Beat three eggs. Then stir the rice.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,820
Add some minced ginger and ground pepper

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,300
to remove the fishy smell and improve the freshness of the dish.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,479
My family's recipe adds salted pickled sprouts and lean minced meat.

6
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,900
Crisp and tender sprouts improve the texture.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,579
It is already salty so no extra salt is needed.

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,059
Using vegetable oil can easily make the lean minced meat overcooked or burned so I use lard.

9
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:47,370
Stir-fry the lean minced meat and the pickled, salted sprouts until fragrant.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,640
Spread out the minced meat in the wok.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,300
Add the shiitake mushrooms and stir-fry until fragrant.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,220
With this big wok of meat mixture,

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,060
whether you add a spoonful to noodles or make fried rice,

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,170
it tastes delicious.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,899
Pour the rice coated in eggs into the wok.

16
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:16,090
Stir-fry all the rice until it looks golden and fragrant.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,980
Turn off the heat, sprinkle a few green onions, and it's ready to be served.

18
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,900
[Dine with Love]

[Episode 2]
[Fried Rice, Scramble Eggs, Reminiscing Ordinary Happiness]

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,840
Boss, have a taste.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,780
Fried rice?

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,490
For such an important interview,

23
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,409
why did you cook something as simple as fried rice?

24
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,890
Fried rice uses only ingredients that

25
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,749
seem very simple and can be readily obtained.

26
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,949
You can stir-fry it in a wok. It's delicious and filling.

27
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:01,950
It's the easiest way to find your happiness. It might be simple,

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,949
but it is often the taste you miss the most.

29
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:07,220
I call this the ordinary taste for the extraordinary.

30
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,740
Simplicity makes it more worthwhile to reminisce. It is the ordinary taste for the extraordinary.

31
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,100
Does anyone else think like this?

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,700
Su Kelan is particularly good in this aspect. She's not materialistic.

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,240
Can being unmaterialistic be eaten as food?

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,940
Her father is gone, and her mother is chronically ill.

35
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,960
Do you want to be dragged down by her your whole life?

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Wan Shun, you can't lie to Xiao Hei

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,670
just because he is willing to believe you.

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,169
If it's simple, it's easy to get. If it is easily obtained,

39
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,510
then it will be taken for granted.

40
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,910
It is easier to be forgotten and abandoned.

41
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,100
Li Xun: Baby, are you done yet?

42
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,649
President Yu, I'm sorry. I need to go home.
[Jin Xuan]

43
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,029
Has Yu Hao turned over a new leaf and learned how to cook yet?

44
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:17,749
Once you're done considering it, you can text me.

45
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:20,770
What does "Yu Hao turned over a new leaf" mean?

46
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,670
I saw you and the program team interacting harmoniously the other day.

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,550
Did you fake my apology message?

48
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,640
"Interacting so harmoniously"?

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,200
You followed me.

50
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,250
It is supervision.

51
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,169
Immediately call the program team. Tell Jin Xuan

52
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,830
that you faked the apology message.

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,789
Mom: When will you be back?

54
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,630
Li Xun and his mom have arrived.

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,549
President Yu, I'm sorry. I need to go home to cook for my mother.

56
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,190
Can't you order takeout?

57
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,500
There are so many dishes on the table. Why can't you order a flash delivery?

58
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,690
I even thought you were a person who took responsibility for their work.

59
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,270
I didn't think you would turn out to be a person full of lies.

60
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,380
Go home and cook.

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,480
President Yu, I'm going home for my own private matters.

62
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,500
Besides, today is not a working day.

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,919
I don't need your supervision to use my own personal time, right?

64
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,019
Moreover, I've been working overtime all day. I have not neglected my responsibilities.

65
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,039
I can assure you that in two hours,

66
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,380
I'll come back and give you an explanation. It won't affect work.

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,179
After you lose your job, there is plenty of time to go home and cook.

68
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,400
Now, I want you to call the program team immediately.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,099
I admit it was indeed inappropriate to fake your messages.

70
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,259
However, this method could resolve the long-held grievances between you and the program team.

71
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,479
I understand that you are angry, but the overall resolution is good!

72
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,340
Are you going to prioritize venting your emotions over the company's interests?

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,450
Call them immediately.

74
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,699
The program crew all say that you're unkind,

75
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,050
and I even spoke up for you.

76
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,030
Only the weak talk about human emotions.

77
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,769
To be strong is to master your career, not the kitchen.

78
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,330
Working is for a better life.

79
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,780
I don't need a working machine to direct my life.

80
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,390
If losing my job is the only way I can have time to go home and cook,

81
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,590
I'm resigning right now.

82
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,550
Did she call me a working machine?

83
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,260
Does she want to throw resignation in my face? She lacks ambition.

84
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,650
She deserves to be cheated on.

85
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,339
- Nine Characters.
- Eight Bamboo.

86
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:52,080
Eight Bamboo?

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Six Circles.

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,980
- Seven Circles.
- Seven Circles.

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,100
- Nine Characters.
- Nine Characters.

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,280
Eight Characters.

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,159
Wait, eight Characters. I've completed it. I win, I win!

92
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,540
Look at it.

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,940
You are being careless.

94
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,259
Can your three Bamboo be used as a four Bamboo tile?

95
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,099
Excuse me, my bad. I saw it incorrectly. I have no glasses on today.

96
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,340
Continue to take some tiles.

97
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,800
- Catch what?
- Forget it, forget it. It's just a joke.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,940
Forget it, forget it.

99
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,340
I'm sorry, my stomach hurts.

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,080
Wait a minute. I will go to the bathroom and then run back again.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,400
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

102
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,940
It's retribution.

103
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,320
Who is in here? Who is it?

104
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,239
It's me, Mom. Wait a minute.

105
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,879
- Oh, it's you.
- Come out quickly, quickly! I almost can't hold it anymore!

106
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,900
Almost.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,480
Li Xun and his mother have diarrhea.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,339
I saw them give a bad review to a restaurant.

109
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,219
They said the pig intestines were unclean.

110
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,020
He said they ate something bad at noon.

111
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,870
It's a lie. He said he started to have diarrhea around midnight last night.

112
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,240
Has the legal department seen this contract?

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,860
Why send it to me if they haven't read it? Do you want me to change it for you?

114
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,740
President Yu, these are the dishes the chefs cooked for you in our back kitchen.

115
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,550
Miss Su asked me to deliver the food and wanted me to say a few words to you.

116
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,430
"Boss, please be reasonable about your work."

117
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,260
[Gong Wenxing]

118
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,610
What's the matter, Bro?

119
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,310
What?

120
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,050
Want me to accompany you? Do you know how much money it costs

121
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,220
for you to delay me by one minute? I'm busy now.

122
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,170
Can you stop messing around? I'm hanging up, I'm busy.

123
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,750
Where are my car keys?

124
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,990
[Su Kelan]

125
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,550
The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

126
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,800
An Jie, ask the HR department to send me Su Kelan's home address.

127
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,400
- Enjoy yourself.
- All right.

128
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,050
Son, it looks like you've lost weight. Eat.

129
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,190
Thank you, Mom.

130
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,129
I say, Kelan is really talented.

131
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,289
She was capable of being promoted to Director within the company.

132
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,810
She can cook well in the kitchen.

133
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,829
It's better to eat at home. It's clean and delicious, isn't it?

134
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:27,789
So was the restaurant you went to last night dirty?

135
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,430
Don't talk about it anymore. The pig intestines were not washed clean.

136
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,509
They're not even embarrassed to give away two boxes for free.

137
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,590
It's disgusting!

138
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,660
Yesterday,

139
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,870
weren't you still in Chengdu and hadn't come back yet?

140
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,710
It was my mother who last night

141
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,230
brought back pig intestines. I had a stomachache around noon today.

142
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,609
I have a comment here. It's interesting, right?

143
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:58,470
"A pair of the best mother and son,"

144
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,230
"the son has a girlfriend but still has a date at the restaurant."

145
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,730
"Took the fat intestines on their own accord."

146
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,330
It's too greedy to eat and not support it, isn't it?

147
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,330
That's because we left a bad review for the restaurant that deliberately banned us.

148
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,329
Deliberately banned?

149
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,350
You can't be that specific, can you?

150
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,710
Besides, I saw you!

151
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,451
Saw what? You have a bad temper. What did you want to see? Why didn't you come up then?

152
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,969
If I knew you were going on a blind date, I'd have slapped you if I came up to you!

153
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,870
I didn't!

154
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,230
Su Kelan is my girlfriend. You're not my girlfriend.

155
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,810
What are you butting in for?

156
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,370
Li Xun, let me tell you. Kelan and I grew up together.

157
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,950
I think of her as my own sister.

158
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,870
Why don't you clear this up for us today?

159
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,470
I won't butt in!

160
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,970
Kelan, tell Han Meng to stop butting in.

161
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,810
She doesn't trust me. Do you still not trust me?

162
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,650
Then show me your

163
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,530
return ticket.

164
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,030
My ticket?

165
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,550
I threw it away.

166
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,269
Your trip here is for work.

167
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,910
The tickets can be reimbursed.

168
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,410
Why did you throw it away?

169
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,629
It's not much money. I didn't care too much.

170
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,169
You're so stingy.

171
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,829
Even your mom comes to Kelan's house for a free meal.

172
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:09,549
Why would you be willing to throw away your ticket?

173
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:11,849
Free meal? What do you mean?

174
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:12,889
Do I eat for free?

175
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,969
There is plenty of delicious food out there.

176
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,429
It's so convenient to order takeout. Just this.

177
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,349
These dishes can't even be served on the table.

178
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:22,449
Do you think I like to eat this? It's only my son's sake.

179
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,749
I wouldn't want to come to eat!

180
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,369
Why do you talk like that?

181
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:26,889
Whether you like to come or not,

182
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,149
who forces you?

183
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,649
- Mom, don't say that. Kelan, she...
- This...

184
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,889
Li Xun,

185
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,449
clarify the situation from last night.

186
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,109
If you can't prove that you were in Chengdu last night,

187
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,670
then I ask you and your mother

188
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,129
not to be condescending and not to come to my house for dinner anymore.

189
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,990
Kelan,

190
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,749
why don't you trust me?

191
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,150
You...

192
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,149
I'm really hurt!

193
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,229
Li Xun, why are you talking nonsense with them?

194
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:05,570
Why should we clarify it?

195
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,649
You rely on medicine to live.

196
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,709
Diabetes and renal failure.

197
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,049
Your life depends on dialysis and money.

198
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:17,069
My son didn't give up on you despite your illnesses. He even dated your daughter for so long.

199
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,549
And you even want us to cooperate and eat with you?

200
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:23,310
You want us to come and make you happy.

201
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,649
We have done so much for you!

202
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:25,829
I haven't asked for a companionship fee yet,

203
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,470
and now you're questioning my son?

204
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,850
- Mom.
- Auntie Su.

205
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,309
Mom, what are you doing?

206
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,190
I'm okay.

207
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,929
You guys leave.

208
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,429
Auntie Su, I'm really sorry.

209
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,010
Just now, my mother was outspoken.

210
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,649
Kelan, I'll take my mom home first.

211
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,490
- When you calm down–
- Calm down?

212
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,729
I'm very calm.

213
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,410
Then don't you believe me?

214
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,870
I want to believe you,

215
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,029
but I'm calm so I don't believe you.

216
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,929
Unless you can show some evidence, I don't believe you.

217
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,610
Can you?

218
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,029
Su Kelan, what do you mean?

219
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,529
Just because your best friend told you a few words of gossip,

220
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,570
you don't trust me, and you question me?

221
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,990
Don't you see how well I treat you?

222
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,389
You're burdened by a sick mother, and if I didn't like you,

223
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,409
why would I want to be with you?

224
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,429
Why do I call every day to sing to you?

225
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:34,769
Why does my mother have to come over and eat dinner with you every day?

226
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,249
I'm exhausted from work every week, and I still have to come and keep you company?

227
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,950
Are your culinary skills excellent, or is your home environment good?

228
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,990
It's neither.

229
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,310
Isn't it just to make you happy?

230
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,690
So...

231
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,530
Are you eating what I cooked,

232
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,250
or do you pity me?

233
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,510
What else?

234
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,609
- You... You...
- Mom!

235
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:58,510
- How dare you pour water on me? I...
- Auntie...

236
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,430
What are you doing?

237
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,190
Are you all right, Mom?

238
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,230
It's killing me, my leg!

239
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,409
- Kelan!
- Are you all right?

240
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,649
Get away! What are you doing?

241
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,709
- I'm not...
- You did it on purpose!

242
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,729
I've always chosen to believe

243
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,270
that what is simple

244
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,130
is most worthy of care and remembrance.

245
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,610
But the happiness that was easily obtained

246
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,690
will really be taken for granted,

247
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,670
and is the easiest to forget

248
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,370
and to be abandoned.

249
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,229
- Are you a man?
- You're still taking the initiative.

250
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:39,690
Stop arguing!

251
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,790
What does it matter to you?

252
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,370
Meng Meng, Meng Meng!

253
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,329
Calm down! Calm down!

254
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:47,329
Enough!

255
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,930
Meng Meng, enough! Enough already!

256
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,090
Calm down, calm down!

257
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,810
- Meng Meng, calm down.
- Why should I?

258
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,890
What does this have to do with you?

259
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,090
President Yu?

260
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,670
Meng Meng, come.

261
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,369
Kelan, get up quickly.

262
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,610
Hello, President Yu.

263
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,429
I am the staff of the marketing department in the Chengdu Branch.

264
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:13,410
My name is Li Xun.

265
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,590
My son, Li Xun, is the Marketing Director at the "What to Eat Next" Chengdu Branch.

266
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,930
He's extremely busy at work.

267
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,290
The marketing director of Chengdu Branch,

268
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,070
is you?

269
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,849
The director role is my goal.

270
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,910
Very good.

271
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,829
The company needs an energetic person like you.

272
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,429
Thank you, President Yu. I will do my best.

273
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,569
That's right.

274
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,889
Which groups of people do the Users in Chengdu come from?

275
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,210
Y-Y-Young people.

276
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,710
What is the proportion of each age group?

277
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,150
This... This depends on the data.

278
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,449
I can't... can't remember exactly.

279
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,529
What's the data for the number of clicks, saves,

280
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,590
and add to shopping cart for this season?

281
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,609
President Yu, please wait a moment. I'll take a look at the report. It's all in the report.

282
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,930
With an accurate analysis of target consumers,

283
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,889
give me the best marketing plan.

284
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,629
Accurate access and effective transformation are the responsibility of your marketing department,

285
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:18,150
but you,

286
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,249
you can't even answer the most basic questions on data.

287
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,190
Do you think you are competent?

288
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,769
President Yu, I... Well...

289
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,210
Go to the HR department tomorrow.

290
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,230
President Yu!

291
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,490
Kelan!

292
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,930
President Yu.

293
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,590
What were you doing at my house?

294
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,849
Is this the way you work?

295
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,350
This is my home.

296
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,269
Do my personal affairs or friends and family have anything to do with you?

297
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,289
Why did your boss come here to fire you?

298
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,690
Is he joking?

299
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,689
How about you...

300
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,849
You catch up with him and ask. Explain, explain.

301
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,789
Mom, can't you leave me alone for a while?

302
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,370
Wait until Kelan comes back.

303
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,069
Why are some people still here and not leaving?

304
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,330
Oh, I know.

305
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,829
You saw that Kelan can talk to President Yu.

306
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,169
You want to wait for her to come back

307
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,190
so she can intercede to help you.

308
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,690
Meng Meng, don't say that.

309
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,609
Kelan was almost crying just now.

310
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,390
How could I leave without her?

311
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,129
You're her best friend.

312
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,270
When she comes back,

313
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,970
let's persuade her together.

314
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,949
Who just said that "my business is none of your business"?

315
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,230
Besides,

316
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,629
Kelan doesn't need your comfort at all.

317
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,929
You don't need to condescend to accompany her for dinner.

318
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,089
There are lots of people who are better, more handsome, and more successful than you

319
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,530
who are chasing Kelan.

320
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,570
See? He even pursued her home.

321
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,610
Meng Meng.

322
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,970
You just said... W-Were you talking about

323
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,209
their boss?

324
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,810
Yes.

325
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,690
He's been pursuing Kelan for a long time.

326
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,910
You still think of him as a friend, don't you?

327
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,589
What? Do you want to apologize for him?

328
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,669
I see when you women fall in love, you're brainless.

329
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,350
So is it not brainless to barge into an ex-employee's house?

330
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,209
You said you were leaving this afternoon because of your personal affairs.

331
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,690
Today is not a workday either.

332
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,150
I don't need to ask about the use of your private time.

333
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,189
Also, I am the boss of the company.

334
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:18,200
I don't need to tell an ex-employee who and why I fired them.

335
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,570
Inexplicable!

336
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,770
Next time you pick a man, have better taste.

337
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,689
What are you talking about? Try and say that again!

338
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,009
So what if I say it again?

339
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,009
- Is Su Kelan cheating?
- Who is cheating?

340
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:48,849
Do you believe it or not?

341
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,369
I'll go to the company to put banners!

342
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,049
I'll let everyone know about

343
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,569
- that dog couple!
- Nonsense!

344
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,450
Why are you such a scoundrel?

345
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,250
Li Xun!

346
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,650
- You...
- Mom.

347
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,709
Mom, enough!

348
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,430
The food is gone.

349
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,810
You don't have to stay at my house anymore.

350
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,529

Actually, I already guessed it.

440
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,550
With Yu Hao's personality,

441
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,930
it's impossible for him to apologize to others.

442
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,310

Add the shiitake mushrooms and stir-fry until fragrant.

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,500
Because you have to respect the teacher.

I can't believe I was worried about her.

The timer has been set.

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,540
Here.

00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,140
What are we cooking?

00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,880
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

727
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,440
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes?

728
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,740
Why?

729
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,279
This show is your first time cooking with your own hands.

730
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:34,319
If the dish is too difficult,

731
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,339
you can't learn it well in such a short time, and you'll be prone to make mistakes.

732
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:38,339
- So I picked a simple one...
- I can do this.

733
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:39,821
Then it's the end of this teaching session.

734
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:43,081
When you get back, you can give me the paperwork.

735
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:45,040
Can you cook this?

736
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,180
You can cook.

737
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,199
Then why were you so awful before and say that cooking is meaningless?

738
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,480
It can be over.

739
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,139
In five minutes,

740
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:40,240
if you still insist, the time before this doesn't count at all.

741
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,380
In the upcoming episode, you'll make scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

742
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,540
It's not just because it's simple.

743
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,980
This dish exists in everyone's memories,

744
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,300
but the taste in everyone's memories varies.

745
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,980
If you add water to the beaten eggs, they'll become tender.

746
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,099
Then you should fry them at a high temperature to make them fluffy.

747
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:08,599
If you cook the tomatoes for too long, they will become saucy.

748
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,419
Add in some sugar and ketchup

749
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:12,519
to intensify the flavor. This tastes perfect when paired with rice.

750
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:15,510
What did the eggs taste like in your memories?

751
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,200
How ripe were the tomatoes?

752
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,560
Did you put in any sugar?

753
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,760
Did you put in a little vinegar?

754
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,060
Did you put in some soy sauce?

755
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,519
Did you add in some spring onions?

756
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,739
After I tasted this dish at a restaurant, I realized that,

757
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:26,559
it was not as delicious as the homemade version.

758
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,299
That's when I realized that this simple dish

759
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:30,780
can be quite unique on its own.

760
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,960
The theme of this episode is "The taste of separation."

761
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,050
The taste of separation is "Missing something."

762
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,799
You miss the taste that you were accustomed to

763
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,340
and the warmth that it provided you.

764
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,019
No matter how unique, it still feels ordinary to me.

765
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,580
I see no difference between this and the fried rice you prepared before.

766
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,760
Do you still believe in the so-called "Simple happiness"?

767
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,320

you can't taste the dish or because you can't meet that person?

That's just how human beings' affection works.

Because it's ordinary, you pay no attention to it.

But once you can't have it anymore, you realize it was extraordinary.

01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,629
That's not necessary. Isn't it a waste of time?

878
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:37,529
Well, there were some misunderstandings earlier

879
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:40,090
and having a meal together can resolve them.

880
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:41,930
Who is that woman?

881
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,249
How come I haven't seen her before?

882
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:45,510
She seems to be quite familiar with the crew.

883
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:49,049
I think she is the new director of Public Relations hired by President Yu.

884
01:03:49,049 --> 01:03:52,050
Director of Public Relations?

885
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,950
She is just a bumpkin.

886
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,530
I heard that she also teaches President Yu how to cook.

887
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:59,289
In addition, this will make everyone happy.

888
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:03,350
If the cameraman and light engineers are happy, they'll make you look better on camera.

889
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:06,249
If the director is happy, he'll edit in more beautiful shots of you.

890
01:04:06,249 --> 01:04:08,110
This is all free advertising for the company.

891
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,810
Furthermore, I already made the reservations

892
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,110
at the Chrysanthemum Restaurant.

893
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,729
Who allowed you to make this decision on your own?

894
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:15,750
The deposit has already been paid.

895
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,070
President Yu is inviting everyone over for dinner.

896
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,809
Thank you, President Yu.

897
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:22,910
Thank you, President Yu.

898
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,750

902
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,749
Don't we typically have dinner together after shooting?

903
01:04:34,749 --> 01:04:36,870
Let's just do it as usual.

904
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,469
Or is it because I didn't...

905
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:43,069
perform well at something?

906
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:44,349
You can tell me, and I will make changes accordingly.

907
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:46,430
No, no, no, no.

908
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:54,709
All right then. Let's go together.

really is lovelorn,

914
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,970
but how come she isn't showing any emotions?

915
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,530

920
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,769
First prize is a complete set of WMF (German Kitchenware Brand).

921
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:41,710
Give away kitchen utensils? That's so funny.

922
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,190
Are they out of their mind?

923
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,329
Who would want such a prize for this activity?

924
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:47,430
I want it.

925
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,550

926
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:54,890
Have you seen the kitchen in the movie "Mr. and Mrs. Smith"?

927

Look.

928
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,329
When I watched this movie, I thought it would be great if I could have this set someday.

929
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,669
A kitchen filled with kitchen utensils just like that.

930
01:06:01,669 --> 01:06:03,329

can only be a pair of men and women?

958
