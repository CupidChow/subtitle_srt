1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,659
I'm coming in.

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,440
Don't come in.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,700
If I don't come in, what are you going to do?

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,399
I told you to not come in. Don't you get it?

5
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:15,359
I also said to go to the hospital, but you didn't listen to me.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,760
- I'm coming in.
- Don't come in.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Close your eyes.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,140
What... What happened to you?

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
Get me the bath towel.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,180
Where is the bath towel?

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,440
Go straight.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,580
Keep going.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,680
Keep going.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,500
You've stepped on my leg!

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,120
S-S-Sorry.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,760
Are you all right?

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,209
Lift your foot. Lift it.

18
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,790
A little more.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,709
Okay. Step down.

20
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,290
Yes.

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,109
- And then?
- Bath towel...

22
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,090
The bath towel is on your...

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,170
left... right...

24
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,250
Right in front of you.

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,949
- Give it to me.
- Here.

26
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:29,590
Turn around!

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,190
Here.

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,010
What are you doing?

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,920
[Dine with Love]

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,990
[Episode 4]
[The Ceremony of Hotpot: Fidgety Expectation]

31
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,210
Why didn't you answer the phone?

32
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,270
Bro, am I your maid?

33
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,009
On-call 24 hours a day to provide you with special services?

34
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,110
Easy, easy now.

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,890
Then again...

36
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,090
Isn't there already someone here?

37
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,150
Kelan.

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,850
Yu Hao, he...

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,670
No way...

40
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,949
She's already seen all of you. Why are you being shy?

41
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,810
Like what?

42
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,810
Like this.

43
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,690
Did you take pictures?

44
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,110
When did you take this?

45
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,030
I was just curious.

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,450
I just said I lost my stuff

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,689
and asked the maids to open the door. I just went in and took a look.

48
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,830
Are you a perv...

49
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,250
pervert?

50
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,930
Don't move, don't move.

51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,150
President Yu.

52
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,690
I contacted an acquaintance at the hospital.

53
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,049
Ice your waist for now.

54
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,410
Then we'll go to the hospital.

55
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm not going.

56
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,269
I'm fine.

57
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,348
It's getting late too.

58
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,290
Why don't you go back first?

59
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:08,530
Okay.

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,090
Then you remember to go to the hospital.

61
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,890
Say, you guys already ate scrambled eggs with tomato on the bed...

62
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,170
What's the point of pretending?

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,630
Scrambled egg with tomato?

64
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,790
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

65
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,329
Didn't you know it was scrambled eggs with tomatoes?

66
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,250
Then what did you think it was?

67
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,789
I... I...

68
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,590
I get it.

69
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,430
You thought it was...

70
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,730
Kelan...

71
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,310
He thought the bed was...

72
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,290
My nephew doesn't have much experience.

73
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,690
He is super shy

74
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,489
so he doesn't know how to face you now.

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,210
We have work to do so we leave first.

76
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,130
Right, right, right. Let's go.

77
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,250
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

78
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,470
Hey, Gong Wenxing...

79
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,650
Are you all right?

80
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,890
Don't move.

81
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,970
Let's go.

82
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,850
Why are you following me?

83
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,070
Director, don't give up on yourself.

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,490
If you keep on eating and drinking like this,

85
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,990
you'll get a beer belly.

86
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,070
If you get a beer belly, how will you pursue Su Kelan?

87
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,090
Why did you hit me?

88
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,230
I think...

89
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,070
it doesn't hurt that much anymore.

90
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,970
Good.

91
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,069
I'll take you to the hospital to get an X-ray.

92
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,390
It's okay, it should be nothing.

93
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,149
You said no in the afternoon and said I scared you.

94
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,850
How did it turn out? You hurt yourself again.

95
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,030
If you refuse to go to the hospital again,

96
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,750
what if you hurt your lumbar spine?

97
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,370
Hurt my lumbar spine?

98
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,870
I can't move right now.

99
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,269
Why are you so stubborn?

100
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,950
Why must you refuse to go to the hospital?

101
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,030
I don't like hospitals.

102
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,110
I'm really fine.

103
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,190
You...

104
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,430
Hurry back and rest.

105
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,070
What if it gets worse when I leave?

106
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,490
I told you I'm fine.

107
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,950
I work out every week. This kind of small injury...

108
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,850
Don't move.

109
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,769
I'm very experienced in taking care of sick people.

110
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,550
If you feel embarrassed,

111
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,890
then just pay me overtime.

112
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,050
You're an adult man. What are you afraid of?

113
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,470
It's not like I'm going to eat you.

114
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,090
You can rest assured.

115
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,170
I'm not interested in innocent boys at all.

116
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,070
Are you hungry?

117
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,190
Haven't eaten yet?

118
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,630
I'll make you something to eat.

119
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,310
Where is your kitchen?

120
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,090
My apartment

121
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,990
doesn't have a kitchen.

122
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,030
No kitchen?

123
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,890
If a kitchen is based on the actual usable space,

124
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,509
used for 40 years,

125
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,890
spread out over 14,600 days,

126
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,249
the fixed cost of accumulative use daily is ¥43.84.

127
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:23,830
Plus, the cost of vegetable oil and gas.

128
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,150
I'm only saving ¥70 per day.

129
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,570
It's better to order takeout.

130
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,410
If a bathroom,

131
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,770
based on the actual usable space,

132
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,690
is used for 40 years,

133
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,810
spread out over 14,600 days,

134
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,030
the fixed cost of accumulative use daily

135
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,850
is ¥21.92.

136
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,610
You don't have to spend a penny for public toilets.

137
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,690
Why do you have a bathroom installed in your home?

138
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,809
That's because it's inconvenient and very unpleasant.

139
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,790
Can you stop confusing logic?

140
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,011
Calculating profitability doesn't represent all problems.

141
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,429
Comfortable, pleasant, and convenient...

142
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,690
These feelings

143
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,490
cannot be accounted for in economic calculations.

144
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,830
Instant noodles are quick to make,

145
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,830
but there are some ways

146
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,830
to make it more nutritious

147
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,809
If you don't have a stove, use the most primitive method.

148
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,010
Cook in boiled water and

149
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,010
rinsing with ice water makes it taste better.

150
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,029
After adding the seasoning packets, mix boiling water and milk one for one.

151
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,169
Having the aroma of milk without its milky smell.

152
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,330
Here... Instant noodles with fragrance of milk.

153
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,230
Instant noodles with the fragrance of milk?

154
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,129
Chefs are human, too. They take a break and make something simple like instant noodles.

155
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,529
Bosses are also human. Sometimes they get hurt and need to rest.

156
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,689
Instant noodles with the fragrance of milk? What kind of evil food is this? Is it edible?

157
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,609
Just try it. Don't you think the purpose of food is to satisfy hunger?

158
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,690
Isn't it actually very good?

159
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,750
How is it? You can't have takeout food like this.

160
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,960
But you didn't need a kitchen.

161
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,749
If there was a kitchen, you could have even more surprises like this.

162
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,310
Why do you like cooking?

163
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,770
My dad always used to cook for our family.

164
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,910
After he passed away,

165
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,010
my mom and I ate takeout for a while

166
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,989
but we felt the taste was different from before.

167
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,509
Scrambled egg with leek was too raw and lacked fragrance.

168
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,850
They were overcooked and not satisfying.

169
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,949
Mapo tofu, sometimes, the numbing taste is not enough.

170
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:53,990
Sometimes, the spiciness is too strong.

171
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,389
Sometimes, I thought the tofu was not tasty enough.

172
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,869
Later I started cooking myself.

173
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,249
Stir fry with tomato, boiled tomatoes.

174
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:38,309
Beef brisket with some tendons, a little chewy without having to bite into it.

175
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,310
My mom and I like it best.

176
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,829
Hand-torn Stir-fry Cabbage, make sure to add a little vinegar on the edge of the pot so it won't be too raw.

177
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,489
Also lotus root, pork bone, and peanut soup.

178
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:51,349
My family likes to put coriander and a pinch of salt in.

179
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,810
Mom.

180
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,189
Little by little, the familiar taste came back.

181
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,269
I told you to eat more meat.

182
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,570
You are still too thin.

183
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,569
Fine, fine. Here, you eat too.

184
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,830
This lotus white is well fried.

185
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,380
It feels like the familiar person

186
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,830
has never left.

187
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,909
Here, I will get you one.

188
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,530
Eat.

189
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,990
Good job. I think that tofu, it's better than Dad's. It's delicious.

190
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,469
Why don't you sleep on the floor tonight?

191
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,870
A soft bed is not good for the waist.

192
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,450
Come.

193
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,530
Easy.

194
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,149
I'll be in the living room. Call me if you need anything.

195
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,630
Go to bed early.

196
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,080
Su Kelan.

197
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,890
Su Kelan.

198
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,770
What's the matter?

199
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,060
Su Kelan.

200
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,870
Don't be late for work tomorrow.

201
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,620
The budget of the PR department has to pass.

202
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,050
An Jie,

203
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,050
prepare the contract.

204
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,590
Su Kelan.

205
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,350
Boss, what documents do you want to rush again this time?

206
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,910
Thank you.

207
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,149
She said she takes care of people but doesn't say a word when she leaves.

208
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,050
Door opened.

209
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,870
Are you all right?

210
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,149
Your waist hasn't healed yet. Why are you moving?

211
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,610
Sit down.

212
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,070
I...

213
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,530
I brought you breakfast.

214
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,810
I bought it downstairs near your house.

215
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,829
Will it be too deliberate and scare him again?

216
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,630
Kelan,

217
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,030
what are you doing so early?

218
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,190
Mom, you scared the hell out of me.

219
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,990
I'm the one who got scared by you.

220
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,730
What time did you come back last night?

221
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,650
Mom, I'm late to work.

222
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,009
I made you breakfast. Help yourself.

223
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm leaving.

224
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,929
I don't know how you like your eggs

225
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,769
so I ordered one well-done

226
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,469
and one over easy.

227
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:48,250
Give it a try.

228
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,030
Not bad. Where did you get them?

229
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,110
Just...

230
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,490
the one at the corner of the street.

231
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,089
But that one does business before six o'clock.

232
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,389
By the way, Xiao Yan asked for a day off today.

233
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,290
Can you call me a cab?

234
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,589
- Where are you going?
- Office.

235
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:33,430
Boss,

236
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,509
with your current condition, do you still want to go to the office?

237
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:37,530
Can't you take some rest at home for a few days?

238
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,930
Wait until your lower back is recovered.

239
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,269
What if the company goes bankrupt?

240
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,990
There is plenty of time to have a good rest.

241
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,350
Don't YOU want to do it? I'll call it myself.

242
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,570
That's my spot.

243
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,070
Get up.

244
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,090
I won't.

245
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,670
- Get up
- I won't.

246
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,649
- Get up
- Kelan asked me to sit here.

247
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,710
What qualifies you to get me out?

248
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,150
When you have had too much of drinks,

249
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,290
a lot of things can happen.

250
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,910
You said you're going back to work.

251
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,449
What if this video clip accidentally circulates in the office chat group...

252
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:22,410
Are you threatening me?

253
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,710
How would I dare?

254
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,270
Let me help you.

255
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,430
Boss,

256
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,650
I'm doing this for your sake.

257
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,029
If you don't want to go to the hospital,

258
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:07,110
you should stay home and recuperate.

259
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,450
Let me cancel your car.

260
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,870
[Shared ride order: Mr. Yu - Canceled]
[Shared ride order: Miss Su - Completed]

261
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,629
Hello, Miss Su.

262
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,149
The person who placed the order wrote in the remarks that I should confirm the destination with you.

263
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,110
What's the matter?

264
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,090
It's already noon and the Great Devil isn't here yet.

265
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,050
That's right.

266
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,850
Good news! Good news!

267
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,350
What's up? What's up?

268
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,370
We don't have to work overtime this week.

269
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,329
- Are you serious?
- What's going on?

270
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:24,469
The Great Devil went on a last-minute business trip.

271
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,309
Bingo!

272
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,189
I overheard An Jie on the phone with him.

273
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:31,130
He'll be gone for the entire week.

274
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,770
Keep your voices down.

275
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,049
Why are you guys so happy when President Yu is on a business trip?

276
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,209
What if someone overheard us?

277
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:40,270
Yu Hao is not on a business trip.

278
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,589
He doesn't want people to know he's not feeling well

279
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,110
and to affect other people's performance.

280
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,570
No, no, no.

281
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,369
This is not the main point. All right?

282
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,930
The car on the other night,

283
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,070
was ordered by him?

284
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,509
In this scenario,

285
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:01,250
foreshadowing with wonderful atmosphere last night,

286
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,870
not only you didn't do anything or say anything,

287
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,849
and you didn't even feel him out like you're strangers to each other.

288
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:08,870
Did you simply return his cellphone?

289
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,190
Here you go.

290
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,350
Are you serious, my dear sister?

291
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,250
What the hell are you thinking?

292
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,910
Please don't tell me you're not interested in Yu Hao.

293
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,930
Even with my 5.0 vision,

294
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,870
and I can see through you.

295
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,549
It's obviously clear to me.

296
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,430
Don't give me excuses.

297
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,889
Don't tell me you're still hung up on your previous relationship.

298
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:58,609
When love comes to you, there are no too fast or too slow.

299
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:03,189
And please don't tell me you don't know Yu Hao is interested in you.

300
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:05,509
He even ordered a cab for you.

301
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,010
If he didn't tell you that,

302
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,410
I can tell

303
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,650
Yu Hao's personality is

304
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,569
a great man who acts without words. Unlike someone we know.

305
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,470
Let me tell you something,

306
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,730
for a man like him,

307
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,510
even if he is not interested in you,

308
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,131
you must lead him to be interested in you.

309
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:27,750
You're in a favorable position,

310
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,190
you must take this opportunity.

311
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,410
I'm done.

312
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,430
It's time to go back to work.

313
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,850
You're already naming yourself "The Great Devil Madam,"

314
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,370
heading back and overseeing the business.

315
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,669
If we can't handle all the situations on time today and enraged the Great Devil,

316
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:48,870
even if his back hurts,

317
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,789
he would suddenly order the entire company to work overtime. Do you believe it?

318
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:53,450
Today?

319
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,350
Today is...

320
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,629
the air day of the program he did in person.

321
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:03,650
The premiere?

322
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,910
My dear sister, you finally remember that.

323
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,970
You don't want to go yet?

324
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,070
I think we should go through our day easily.

325
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,589
There won't be any emergencies associated with President Yu.

326
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,390
Why would you say that?

327
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,830
It's because the main focus

328
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,350
is no longer him.

329
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,810
[Hot search: 2. Zhang Bi's secret relationship]

330
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,630
Zhang Bi has been photographed with the food program director. They appeared to be dating.

331
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,409
Their behavior seems intimate and unusual.

332
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,770
I think you guys made a mistake.

333
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,629
We were discussing the theme of the next program with the director.

334
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:45,270
Really, that's the truth.

335
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,750
Can someone clean up the popup comments?

336
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,670
The focus is completely off track.

337
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,690
This is a cooking show.

338
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,910
It's like entertainment gossip.

339
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,229
Director Jin and Zhang Bi are in a relationship, aren't they?

340
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,150
I have no idea.

341
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,609
That evening at the hotel, you could use the excuse for being drunk,

342
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:22,449
but they went shopping and had BBQ after that.

343
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,470
Why are you calling me?

344
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,449
Why did you ask me to go shopping, buy clothes, and eat BBQ?

345
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:36,210
Don't worry, I'll release a statement. I'm in the process of drafting the script.

346
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,989
Also, if you're pursuing Su Kelan, you shouldn't be so hot-tempered.

347
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:41,269
Nothing good happened to me since I was tagged along with you.

348
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,249

349
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:45,150
don't call me anymore!

00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,489
Hello? Hello?

351
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,803
What are you looking at?

352
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,303
Start the meeting.

353
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:56,430
Why is he not anxious?

354
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,209
I'm the one who came up with the idea, and I'm the one who is handling the reporters.

355
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:02,490
Perhaps you should remain silent.

356
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,029
I wonder if Yu Hao would believe me or not.

357
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:13,229
Don't worry. I'm sure he won't pay attention to your news.

358
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,770
What?

359
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,970
What shall I do?

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,449
How come you didn't input the code for the limit?

363
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:29,450
Who did it?

364
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,889
I'm not in the office, and you guys are making a mess?

365
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,930
If it happens again, you don't need to come to work anymore.

366
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,689
What's the matter, Bro?

367
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,030
Call me Uncle.

368
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,869
I thought you had an injured back and I'm calling to check on you.

369
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,789
Why are you sounding so angry?

370
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,150
Is it because your Public Relations Director is not there?

371
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,350
No one is taking care of you?

372
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,889
Have you had dinner yet? Are you hungry?

373
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:52,150
You're nagging me too much.

374
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,470
Door Opened

375
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,856
President Yu, I'm coming in.

376
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,010
What are you doing here?

377
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,990
Are you feeling better?

378
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,670
What are you bringing all these for?

379
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,270
To cook.

380
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,789
You have nothing here. How can I cook here?

381
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,109
You're the Public Relations Director,

382
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:43,450
don’t you have better things to do?

383
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,269
It's off duty now. It's my own time, I can do whatever I want.

384
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,189
President Yu, I don't think you have any valid reasons to reprimand me.

385
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,489
Besides, you're recording the program this week. You need to learn a new dish.

386
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:01,089
Your current condition doesn’t allow you to go to your old home.

387
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:06,169
I prepare all these learning materials to make better use of our time.

388
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,509
If you insist on having ramen, I can leave right now.

389
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,130
What dish are you going to prepare?

390
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,169
I know you can’t go out so I brought you... food.

391
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,289
Sorry to interrupt. I’ll leave at once.

392
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,150
I'll even close the door for you.

393
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,729
- How is it?
- Your best friend is here.

394
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,890
[Zhang Bi]

395
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,089
Jin Xuan.

396
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:25,789
Hey!

397
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:28,910
- Sister Bi.
- Sister Bi.

398
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,950
Sister Bi.

399
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,010
Jin Xuan.

400
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,849
Hello?

401
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,750
Director Jin.

402
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,130
Hey!

403
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,130
What are you doing here?

404
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,549
What if I get photographed again outside?

405
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:51,389
What's going on? Why didn't you answer my phone call? I came to you as soon as I finished my shooting.

406
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,269
What's going on? I called you so many times. Why didn't you answer? Aren't you worried?

407
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:57,309
When do you think you’ll have solutions for this?

408
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:59,970
How can I handle this without you?

409
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,950
No, wait, how are we going to clarify this mess?

410
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,829
Leave me alone!

411
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,149
Why did you turn off the phone?

412
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,669
Aren’t you anxious?

413
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,010
- Stay away from me.
- Why don’t you pick up my calls?

414
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,149
Lotus Root Gogi Berry Pork Bone Soup. It’s good for health and nourishing.

415
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:28,129
Sweet potato rice. It's good for our energy and strengthen our kidney.

416
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:30,489
It goes well with Preserved Vegetables Fish Soup and will enhance our appetite.

417
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,129
Finally, seasonal greens. It’s refreshing.

418
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:37,069
Dig in. Otherwise, it’ll will be cold.

419
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,570
Are you not joining me?

420
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,769
I won’t. You can enjoy them yourself.

421
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,550
I need to go home and have dinner with my mother.

422
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,010
Are you sure you don't want to eat?

423
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,510
I’m fine.

424
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,269
I think having a meal with the family is like a ritual.

425
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:09,630
It will make a certain time of the day

426
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,450
become a very special time.

427
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,029
When someone has an empty soul, they’ll use rituals to satisfy themselves.

428
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,609
Let me ask you, when NASDAQ went public,

429
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:27,269
they could simply sign documents and issue stocks. Why did they ring the bell?

430
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,330
For the folks who rang the bell,

431
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,190
did they all have an empty soul?

432
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,829
Take your time, I’m going to host my ritual.

433
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,130
It tastes a little sweet lately.

434
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,110
Really?

435
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:40,209
You don’t like the food I prepared today?

436
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,065
I like it as long as you like it.

437
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,930
What is the sense of ritual?

438
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,910
It’s time for lunch.

439
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,910
Door Opened

440
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,569
What’s sense of ritual?

441
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,709
In "The Little Prince," the little fox said to him.

442
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,689
If you say you’ll be here at 4 p.m.

443
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,110
Great.

444
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:58,229
Starting at 3 p.m., I start to feel happy.

445
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:03,029
As it gets closer to the arrival time, I’ll be happier and happier.

446
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:06,869
When the clock strikes at 4 p.m., I’ll start to feel anxious.

447
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:09,610
I discovered the value of happiness.

448
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,649
Every night’s dinner time has become my happiness.

449
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,370
Are you looking forward to this kind of happiness?

450
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,710
Have you decided on the theme for our next recording yet?

451
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,409
We only have two more days to go, right?

452
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,649
Okay, then I'll wait for your update. Thank you.

453
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,109
- I have something to do. I'm heading out first.
- Go ahead.

454
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:50,089
Oh, right. The meeting protocol with the marketing department just now.

455
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:52,109
Please organize it and send it over to the group chat.

456
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,789
Those who finish work earlier can go home for dinner sooner.

457
00:39:54,789 --> 00:39:58,169
- Let's go. See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

458
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,569
She is a two-faced director.

459
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:10,710
When President Yu is not here, she leaves earlier than anybody else.

460
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,330
My sister, are you going to cook for the Great Devil again?

461
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,950
Can you two at least have some actual progress?

462
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,830
You two seem like two middle school students having a relationship.

463
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,070
Be professional. That’s part of my job.

464
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,310
Director, Sister Kelan just called.

465
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,190
She is urging us to come up with the theme for this week.

466
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,649
I told you if it's not work related...

467
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:22,370
Leave me alone.

468
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,909
Who said this call is not work related?

469
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:27,730
We haven’t decided on the theme for the program yet.

470
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,210
I have a proposal.

471
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,190
Next week?

472
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,810
Fine.

473
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,090
See you in Shanghai.

474
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,590
Okay.

475
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,890
Are you coming today?

476
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,910
What took you so long?

477
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,170
President Yu,

478
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,489
cooking for you uses my hours outside of work.

479
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,710
I don't need to clock in, right?

480
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,429
Are you going to teach me?

481
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:13,889
Is the program theme

482
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:15,129
out?

483
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:16,309
Not yet.

484
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,310
But there is a universal response.

485
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,729
When I don't know what to eat, there is a choice that's never wrong.

486
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:34,430
Hotpot.

487
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,689
Enjoy a full table of ingredients

488
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:42,109
that gives satisfaction similar to holding the world in the palm of your hand.

489
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:43,869
A pot of creamy white bone soup.

490
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:45,850
Bright red dipping sauce.

491
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:50,029
Once the ingredients are cooked, everyone awaits the order to reach out their chopsticks

492
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:51,270
and fish them out.

493
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,709
Everyone takes turns contentedly.

494
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:57,809
No matter what you like, hotpot can satisfy you.

495
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:01,409
No matter what the theme is, hotpot can fit it.

496
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:04,489
Bone soup hotpot takes care of friends with lighter tastes.

497
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:08,070
The spiciness can be in the homemade dipping sauce instead.

498
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,970
It's ready. You can stir-fry it.

499
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,949
To oil on medium-high heat, add onion, ginger, prickly ash, and star anise.

500
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:20,129
The taste of spices will diffuse into the oil.

501
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,350
I'll do it.

502
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,869
You can't put in all the oil at once.

503
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,709
Once the oil temperature drops to 60%,

504
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,689
pour one-third of it on top of the chili peppers.

505
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:35,170
Is it fragrant?

506
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,350
Do you really want to eat it?

507
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:43,309
Now, do you still think this is some dull sense of ritual only fit for an empty person?

508
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,290
Are you adding the rest of this oil?

509
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,609
Wait for the oil temperature to drop to 40-50%,

510
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:52,109
then pour it all in.

511
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:55,190
Let it slowly release the fragrance.

512
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,370
It tastes better when you let it simmer.

513
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,130
Here.

514
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,630
Let's eat.

515
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,950
Are we getting together today?

516
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,569
I cooked dinner for my mother before coming here

517
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:16,129
so I was a little late.

518
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:20,329
After all, eating hotpot alone is a bit too lonely.

519
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,450
Mr. Yu, your express delivery is here!

520
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,170
It must be an express delivery.

521
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,890
Surprise! You didn't expect this, right?

522
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,569
What are you guys doing here?

523
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:05,930
To shoot.

524
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,809
Surprise shooting?

525
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:09,669
Then we can go to Yu Hao's home.

526
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:12,169
So that I can interact with him closely.

527
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,409
What about you? You can make excuses to ask Su Kelan to help.

528
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,209
You can also get closer to Su Kelan.

529
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:18,269
When the recording is finished,

530
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:19,709
you can conveniently take her home.

531
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,390
How perfect!

532
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,449
I wanted to do this for a while.

533
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,629
I also brought it up before,

534
00:46:26,629 --> 00:46:28,309
but Yu Hao doesn't agree.

535
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:30,370
He has promised it before.

536
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,849
Who allowed you to come here?

537
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:35,650
- You.
- President Yu,

538
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,269
last time, when we drank at the hotel, you promised.

539
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:39,969
Surprise shooting, right?

540
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:42,089
Yes!

541
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:44,690
- Open the door!
- Here.

542
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,910
I won't get up.

543
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,669
What qualifications do you have to make me—

544
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:51,970
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

545
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,210
Are you okay?

546
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,570
So what if you're the president?

547
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,089
So what if you're strong?

548
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,129
You only know how to bully others.

549
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:06,249
- Who bullied you?
- Then give me your position.

550
00:47:06,249 --> 00:47:07,309
I won't.

551
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:08,569
You won't even give up your position.

552
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:10,269
You don't cooperate with the program either.

553
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,790
Tell me, why are you such a bully?

554
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,410
Other than my position, I don't care if it's anything else.

555
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,769
Then can I do a surprise shooting?

556
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:19,229
Sure, shoot it. Whatever.

557
00:47:19,229 --> 00:47:20,649
Let's shoot!

558
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:21,929
Drink!

559
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:25,849
Open the door. Open the door. Open the door!

560
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,169
If you are a man, you should keep your word. What? Do you want to go back on your word?

561
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:48,009
It's too late to regret it, I tell you. It's too late!

562
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:50,390
Why don't you open the door?

563
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,409
- Open the door!
- Open the door, open the door.

564
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:55,010
It's too late!

565
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,830
It's too late to regret this, I tell you.

566
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,590
Hurry up! Why are you so slow?

567
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,550
Are you a man or not? Hurry—

568
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,529
Was there a noise from inside?

569
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:07,790
Is someone here?

570
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,910
There's a sound!

571
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,750
Let's shoot.

572
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,429
Wow, it's so nice, I like it so much!

573
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,850
Minimalist modern style.

574
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,230
So high-class!

575
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,490
Low-key luxury.

576
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,329
President Yu, eating hot pot alone?

577
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,430
Why are there two bowls?

578
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,090
This... I...

579
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,929
I don't like eating alone.

580
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:38,649
What a coincidence. Me, too!

581
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,129
Do you have an imaginary friend, too?

582
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,829
My friend's name is Tina. What's your friend's name?

583
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:43,849
My friend...

584
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:48,250
President Yu, I didn't expect for you to have this side.

585
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,689
All right, all right, all right.

586
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:51,590
The shooting begins. Let's start.

587
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,590
Okay, come on, come on.

588
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,229
Okay. About the theme of our program,

589
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:58,530
it's to cook a meal to entertain friends who suddenly come to visit.

590
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,069
Using the existing ingredients at home.

591
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:01,570
That's right.

592
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,449
This wardrobe,

593
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:10,690
does he sleep inside it?

594
00:49:33,896 --> 00:49:35,496
It's me.

595
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,229
What happened? Why did the program team come?

596
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,369
I wanted to ask you!

597
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:45,530
Why didn't you stop me that day?

598
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,009
I will never drink so much again.

599
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:49,110
I have done something extreme this time.

600
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,930
What are you doing?

601
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,509
E-Excuse me, President Yu.

602
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:55,110
I...

603
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,329
I'm looking for the toilet.

604
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,170
Looking for the toilet?

605
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,010
It's over there.

606
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,789
President Yu,

607
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,529
who are you talking to?

608
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:05,230
I...

609
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,530
I...

610
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,090
I'm chatting with my imaginary friend.

611
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,310
My friend's been feeling a bit lonely lately.

612
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,349
I knew it! We still have a lot in common.

613
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,089
Can you please leave first? I need to change my clothes.

614
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:22,330
Change your clothes?

615
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,270
Ch-Change your clothes

616
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,510
What should I cook?

617
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,930
Hotpot, I guess.

618
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,570
We just did it and it fits the theme.

619
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:42,170
I just made it!

620
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,330
In order to shoot, don't you have to make it again anyway?

621
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,390
It's not that I can't,

622
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,010
but that dipping sauce is too complicated.

623
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,329
I can't remember very well.

624
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:53,490
Re-edit it and message it to me.

625
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:58,069
And that statement is not enough either. Come up with more.

626
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,770
I...

627
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,870
I just fell.

628
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:05,050
I don't know where my cell phone flew to.

629
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,550
What?

630
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,810
President Yu, are you almost ready?

631
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,410
Almost!

632
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,650
Come on, come on.

633
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,209
What are you doing spacing out?

634
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:26,049
Make excuses quickly. Just say you can ask Su Kelan to come over for Yu Hao.

635
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,209
Presdient Yu, the director will ask Su Kelan to come over for you.

636
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,050
No need.

637
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,869
I don't know where my cell phone flew to.

638
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,080
Hello?

639
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,009
We are about to start filming.

640
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:07,130
Let's talk about it later. I'm sorry.

641
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,860
Let's start.

642
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,950
Why isn't she answering?

643
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,450
Let's get started.

644
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,300
Put an apron on him.

645
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,280
Didn't I tell you to contact her sooner?

646
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,730
The theme of the hot pot is

647
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,390
"Starry Sky."

648
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,810
Isn't it a bit too girly?

649
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,230
Tomatoes?

650
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,690
Does he like tomatoes that much?

651
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,830
Now we cut the tomatoes.

652
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,910
When President Yu cooks, I can't get tired of watching it.

653
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,129
If President Yu is planning to clear the broth hotpot,

654
00:53:45,129 --> 00:53:47,449
then the dipping sauce is the key.

655
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:49,210
That's right.

656
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,060
Can we pause for a moment?

657
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,950
I want to get my cellphone.

658
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,470
Why does he always to his bedroom?

659
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,090
You scared me to death!

660
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,089
Why are you here again?

661
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:16,409
Dipping sauce and the speaking notes.

662
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:18,210
Write them down on my cellphone notes.

663
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,389
Chopsticks pick up the ingredients and put them into the pot.

664
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:33,870
It takes 15 to 30 seconds

665
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,109
for slices of meat

666
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:37,630
or duck intestines.

667
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,609
it will take 1 or 3 minutes to cook bean curd skin,

668
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:44,150
or lotus root slice.

669
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,030
It'll take 10 minutes for

670
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:51,030
meatballs and fat intestines.

671
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,190
What's going on?

672
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,990
President Yu couldn't have fallen asleep, right?

673
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,169
Shall we go and take a look?

674
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:01,670
Let's go! Let's go!

675
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,750
President Yu!

676
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,830
What are you doing?

677
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,070
You cannot film the private spaces.

678
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,190
He wanted to get his cellphone.

679
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,110
Why was it in the closet?

680
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,049
Don't move. Let me do this.

681
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:42,170
Just wait for a minute. It might hurt you a bit.

682
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,570
Untangle it yourself.

683
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:01,410
Where's my cellphone?

684
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,849
Add salt to the peppers.

685
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:43,750
Then add five spiced powder.

686
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,289
Also add few drops of sesame oil.

687
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:48,469
Add few spoonsful of water

688
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:50,330
and cooking oil.

689
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,410
Mix them together.

690
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,569
Add cinnamon sticks and bay leaves.

691
00:57:00,569 --> 00:57:01,610
Heat up the oil to medium high heat.

692
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,569
Add onion and ginger, Sichuan peppercorns, and star anise.

693
00:57:04,569 --> 00:57:07,529
The fragrance of the spices will permeate into the oil.

694
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:09,250
Finally, add cilantros.

695
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:16,089
In this way, all the spices will mix with the oil.

696
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,109
The taste of spices

697
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:21,250
will go into the oil.

698
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,730
Isn't it fragrant?

699
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,950
Don't you want to eat it?

700
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,369
Can you smell the aroma?

701
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:28,109
It smells great!

702
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:29,330
Then you fish out.

703
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:31,660
Fish it all out.

704
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,309
You can't put in all the oil at once.

705
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:38,129
Once the oil temperature drops to 60%,

706
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:40,209
pour one-third of it on top of the chili peppers.

707
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:43,629
Wait for the oil temperature to drop to 40-50%

708
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,210
and pour in the rest.

709
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,789
Then pour it all in.

710
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:53,010
Let it slowly release the fragrance.

711
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,509
The dipping sauce is now done.

712
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,150
It's so particular.

713
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,150
It tastes better when you let it simmer.

714
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,409
It smells so good!

715
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,929
Hotpot can never be a bad choice.

716
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:14,750
How come everyone loves hotpot so much?

717
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,849
It's because everyone can find their favorite

718
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:20,370
their own dish.

719
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,509
Apart from that,

720
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:23,989
a group of people sit around the stove,

721
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:25,429
wait for the water

722
00:58:25,429 --> 00:58:27,070
to boil.

723
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,769
Chopsticks pick up the ingredients and put them into the pot.

724
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:31,569
It takes 15 to 30 seconds

725
00:58:31,569 --> 00:58:33,049
for meat slices

726
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:34,969
and duck intestines.

727
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,169
It takes 1 to 3 minutes for bean curd skin

728
00:58:37,169 --> 00:58:39,490
and lotus root slices.

729
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,750
It takes 10 minutes

730
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,170
to cook meatballs and fat intestines.

731
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,889
For the pork stomach, you dip it in and out of the broth 7 to 8 times.

732
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:48,049
When you count closer to 8,

733
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:50,850
it will release it's aroma.

734
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,649
Happiness and expectations

735
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:54,229
will be gradually submerged.

736
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:55,709
Happiness and expectations

737
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:58,270
will be gradually submerged.

738
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,370
Finally...

739
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,330
Hotpot

740
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:12,690
is the warmest ceremony among friends.

741
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,550
Does it taste good?

742
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,950
Gosh, it is so delicious.

743
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,729
- It's delicious.
- So delicious!

744
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:50,550
President Yu, you should eat more.

745
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,850
Hurry up!

746
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,470
Where is my phone?

747
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,170
Who told you to silenced it?

748
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,109
If it wasn't silenced, then I would be discovered.

749
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:29,630
The problem will even bigger, won't it?

750
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,789
You should be glad that I slienced my phone?

751
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,429
It's getting late.

752
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:39,909
If you don't go back now, your mother will be worried.

753
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:41,990
Wait for a moment.

754
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,169
Use this spare phone for now.

755
01:00:50,169 --> 01:00:54,030
Tomorrow, when the cleaning lady comes, she'll find your phone.

756
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,589
Thank you.

757
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:58,010
I'll come pick it up tomorrow.

758
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,910
No need to bother you tomorrow.

759
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,809
You have been working hard during this time.

760
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:02,869
My back is recovering pretty well.

761
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:04,690
I should be fine now.

762
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,730
I will see you at the office.

763
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,250
Okay.

764
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,930
See you at the office.

765
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,170
That's right.

766
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,789
It's late.

767
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:27,429
Don't take buses.

768
01:01:27,429 --> 01:01:28,689
It's not safe.

769
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:31,429
You... Take a taxi.

770
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:34,250
The company will reimburse you.

771
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,689
As the Public Relations Director,

772
01:01:44,689 --> 01:01:47,190
don't waste your time on the commute.

773
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:49,849
It's not cost-effective.

774
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,150
Got it.

775
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,489
For the pork stomach, you dip it in and out of the broth 7 to 8 times.

776
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:23,049
When you count closer to 8,

777
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:25,880
it will release its aroma.

778
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:31,730
Happiness and expectations will be gradually submerged.

779
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,980
Finally...

780
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,890
President Yu, we're leaving.

781
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,880

President Yu.

808
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:11,960
[Lin Yi Cultural Communication]

809
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,070
He works overtime on his first day?

810
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,430
- He's quite aspiring.
- That's right.

811
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,209
I heard he used to be the marketing director of a large company.

812
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:24,470
He is quite amazing.

813
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:27,190
I heard he was framed by someone and he felt too complicated working at a big company.

814
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,769
- That's the reason why he came to us.
- Let's go.

815
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:31,230
Let's go.

816
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,730
Li Xun, here is the behind the scene footage for "Dine with love."

817
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,490
Can I trouble you to edit a promotional clip tonight?

818
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,370
No problem.

819
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,960
President Yu, are you having hotpot on your own?

820
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:59,240
How come there are two sets of utensils?

821
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,670
Kelan is truly amazing.

822
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,970
She got promoted to be the director at work.

823
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,450
And she can still prepare tasty food in the kitchen.

824
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:12,960
It's always better to eat at home, it's delicious and hygienic.

825
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:22,089
During our group dinner, we came up with this idea

826
01:07:22,089 --> 01:07:26,249
of making an episode with an unannounced visit, isn't it exciting?

827
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:28,010
By the way, I would like to reiterate to you

828
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,929
regarding those out of context news from the medias.

829
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:34,509
Director Jin and I were discussing the script for real.

830
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,549
We were not alone. President Yu and other staffers were there, too.

831
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:38,730
Ask him if you don't believe me.

832
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,970
That's right.

833
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,390
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

834
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,990
Is it this one?

835
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,090
Let's me do it.

836
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:55,380
President Yu, your delivery is here.

837
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:01,290
Surprise!

838
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,330
What are you guys doing here?

839
01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:07,169
President Yu and other staffers were there, too.

840
01:08:07,169 --> 01:08:10,220
- Ask him if you don't believe me.
- They were all at the hotel?

841
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,390
I'm sleepy.

842
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:25,610
My dear sister, I salute you!

843
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,829
You guys have been seeing each other day and night,

844
01:08:26,829 --> 01:08:28,470
you didn't say or do anything.

845
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:32,368
Have you heard that Su Kelan's ex-boyfriend was from the Chengdu branch?

846
01:08:32,368 --> 01:08:33,650
Is that real?

847
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,729
Who told you that?

848
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:37,349
From the folks at the Chengdu Purchasing department. That's not the point.

849
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:40,230
Take a guess at the reason for their breakup?

850
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:42,929
Don't keep us guessing, tell us!

851
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:48,311
It's because Su Kelan has an eye on President Yu. Therefore, she broke up with her college boyfriend.

852
01:08:48,311 --> 01:08:51,270
She even convinced President Yu to fire her ex.

853
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,370
Isn't it jarring?

854
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:56,500
No wonder, she thrived to the top.

855
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,429
I thought she is a nice person in the past.

856
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:03,690
Look how calculating she is.

857
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:08,550
When President Yu went on a business trip, you told us not to get too excited.

858
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,550
Do you know something we don't know?

859
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,670
Let me show you something.

860
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:19,909
President Yu can't be really with her...

861
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:23,529
He can't be serious, I guess he's just fooling around.

862
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:25,730
Su Kelan.

863
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,100
- President Yu.
- What are you doing?

864
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,920
I'm tying my shoelaces.

865
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:45,190
Every department, ready for the meeting.

866
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,670
What's the matter with this last-minute meeting?

867
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:50,030
- I'm no idea.
- Let's go.

868
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,460
Yao Qian of Public Relations.

869
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,909
The owner of Dexing Fishing Ground will visit our office soon.

870
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:17,749
Please coordinate the meeting and see when they are visiting.

871
01:10:17,749 --> 01:10:19,440
Okay.

872
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,400
Also, Su Kelan, the owner of Zhenpin will be here around the same time.

873
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,450
Please coordinate the meeting.

874
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,380
Got it.

875
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,140
What did they say?

876
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,320
They said they will come next week.

877
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,320
Which day of the week?

878
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,800
I... I didn't ask.

879
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,780
How many people are coming?

880
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,920
- I didn't ask.
- How will they come?

881
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,820
How did it go?

882
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,120
Next Wednesday, they are taking the 3 p.m. flight,

883
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,860
arriving around 6 p.m. There will be five people.

884
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,439
I told them we will send a car to pick them up at the airport.

885
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:22,420
They're planning to be here for two days.

886
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,779
As for the itinerary, we can discuss upon their arrival.

887
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:30,000
In order to safe time, I suggest to put them at the international hotel near by the office.

888
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,740
President Yu, if you don't have any other requests or questions,

889
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,950
I'll make the room reservation today.

890
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,680
If you're the boss,

891
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,790
who will you promote?

892
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,850
I found your cellphone, it was underneath the sofa at my house.

893
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:25,870
♫  Who's hiding in a corner of their memories, talking to themselves?  ♫

894
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:31,290
♫  In the void of the night, no one answers.  ♫

895
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:35,480
♫  The moment the wind blows, it awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

896
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:41,390
♫  Looking at the city lights, it's a contrast to reality  ♫

897
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:47,530
♫  But we've got to continue down the road  ♫

898
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:53,830
♫  Taking a step further, will my dream developed into something more  ♫

899
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:56,600
♫  This world of fireworks, there are unexpected changes  ♫

900
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,660
♫  Being reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

901
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:03,160
♫  How many journeys to take before I'm astounded and speechless?  ♫

902
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,020
♫  Experiencing all the heartache  ♫

903
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,930
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like you're stranded  ♫

904
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,730
♫  When I see my future self,  ♫

905
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:17,360
♫  only then can I understand why I'm moving forward  ♫

906
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:30,120
♫  The uncertain suspense of this world  ♫

907
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,060
♫  Who has never cried their eyes out before?  ♫

908
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,700
♫  Self-reflection will diminish what may come tomorrow  ♫

909
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,480
♫  Reconcile with yesterday  ♫

910
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,310
♫  When the raindrops can sigh and cover the glimmer of the starry sky,  ♫

911
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:44,220
♫  I look forward to sunny days coming soon after  ♫

912
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,820
♫  Stop and look up to see if we're moving forward together  ♫

913
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,950
♫  Is our pace the same as before?  ♫
