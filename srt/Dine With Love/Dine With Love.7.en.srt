00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,920
From the moment we met,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,860
I knew that I would never be able to fall in love with someone else.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,310
I love you.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,740
From this moment on, you will be a key.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,000
A key to open the chamber to my heart.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Would you be willing to take care of

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,410
my heart which was locked for a long time?

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,016
Bravo! It's so moving!

9
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:36,090
My mascara is melting off. Let me go and reapply my makeup.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,050
You should look for a screenwriter to rewrite your lines. They are disgusting.

[Confession Script]

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,596
These new lines were written by a screenwriter who charges $100,000 per episode.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,141
They are extremely moving. Tell her now!

14
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,750
To hell with the screenwriter who charges $100,000 per episode. This is a complete mess!

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,540
Su Kelan, I've liked you since the first time

16
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:11,330
I saw you.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,440
Say yes to him!

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,880
Director Jin is so handsome!

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,460
She'll say "yes" for sure.

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,420
He will definitely succeed.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,156
Thank you, Director Jin. Everyone, thank you for this welcoming ceremony.

22
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:35,180
I really like Director Jin and this team as well.

23
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,448
It's my honor to join the programming team and work with all of you.

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,400
From now on, I will work hard and improve myself with everybody's help.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,520
I also hope that everyone can take care of me in the future.

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,580
What a wonderful induction ceremony! It's so moving!

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,620
Welcome, Kelan.

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,700
Thank you, Director Jin.

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,880
Welcome, Sister Kelan!

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,320
Welcome, Sister Kelan.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
- Thank you.
- Well, I ordered drinks and cake for everyone on behalf of President Yu.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,196
Thank you, President Yu.

33
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:19,180
- Thank you, President Yu. 
- All right, all right. Get back to work!

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,056
All right.

35
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,520
Be careful.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,280
Take it easy.

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,940
If he had followed my script, he would've succeeded.

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,490
It's great that he didn't follow her script. I had even prepared a bag for vomit.

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,020
Get back to work already!

[Episode 7]
[Sourness from a Drunken Fish]

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,460
Cowpeas are my favorite thing to eat!

43
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,660
They are black-eyed beans.

44
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,460
However, they are called cowpeas in Shanghai.

45
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,777
These have different names in different regions of our country.

46
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:37,620
The pickled cowpeas Yu Hao is using were taken from our company's refrigerator.

47
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,440
In fact, it doesn't matter whether they are called string beans or cowpeas…

48
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,130
He took all the pickled vegetables and braised meats from the fridge.

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,360
I don't know which little bitch it was, but I guess they were trying to get his attention

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,430
so they made pickled vegetables as well, but he didn't even touch them.

51
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:02,560
We're filming right now, and why are you telling me these things?

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,120
He doesn't want to change the pickled vegetables.

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,620
He's just used to them.

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,796
Fondness is only temporary, but a habit lasts longer.

55
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,260
He's more used to tomatoes.

56
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,960
Tomatoes abandoned him that day.

57
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,680
But he still has that tomato on his key chain, doesn't he?

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,670
Sis...

59
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,520
Stir it like that?

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,160
That director is so vulgar.

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,420
Don't be fooled by his decent facade right now.

62
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,820
You're so amazing!

63
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,540
Come on.

64
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,984
Wow.

65
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,820
President Yu, I'm really curious about something.

66
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,940
Why did you choose to make stir-fried minced meat and pickled cowpeas today?

67
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,660
The pickled vegetables used to stir-fry the minced meat,

68
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,840
bring with them the taste of home that's been passed down for generations.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,740
Treating your friends to dishes made with homemade pickled vegetables,

70
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,360
is like sharing the taste of your family's memories with them.

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,920
Aren't all these dishes made with pickled vegetables?

72
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,700
The thing our friends living away from home miss the most is the taste of their home.

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,020
When we treat our friends to some homemade pickled vegetables,

74
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,600
it feels like we are sharing the memories of the flavors of our own family.

75
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,296
If we like another family's homemade pickled vegetables, it may represent...

76
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:53,340
Maybe that also means that we like all the memories and longings associated with it.

77
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,430
that we like all the related memories and longings as well.

78
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:03,576
President Yu, are these your family's homemade pickled vegetables? Let me try.

79
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,560
I really like them!

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,640
Try it. Try it.

81
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,040
It seems like President Yu has a special attachment to pickled cowpeas.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,110
They're really delicious!

83
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,030
Does he like to eat our pickled vegetables?

84
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,680
"If you love someone's pickled vegetables,"

85
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,540
"you can probably become a family."

86
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,516
Thank you for watching today's show. What will we eat for our next meal?

87

The filming's complete! Thank you, everyone, for all your hard work.

90
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,370
- Thank you!
- You all worked really hard!

91
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,340
You all worked hard.

92
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,450
- Let's go. 
- Kelan.

93
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,260
Let's go over the schedule for the next episode.

94
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,397
Sure. Please take a look.

95
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,600
Do you have any ideas for the theme?

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,572
Don't you think their taste is really familiar?

97
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:57,720
- It is.
- They taste like the pickled vegetables Sister Kelan brought.

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,130
- That's right.
- Sister Kelan, did you give President Yu the pickled vegetables?

99
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,516
Don't just talk there! Kelan has just joined the team today.

100
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,580
She brought pickled vegetables, braised meat, and sausages for us.

101
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,257
They're all in the office. Everyone, go and get some. There's enough for everybody.

102
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,960
- Thank you, Sister Kelan.
- Thank you, Kelan.

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,692
- Thank you, Kelan.
- Thank you for your hard work.

104
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,230
Thank you.

105
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,490
Does everyone get a share of your pickled vegetables?

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,436
Don't let those two talk. Hurry up and go over there.

107
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,336
Aren't they just pickled vegetables? Why can't I share them?

108
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:48,496
Besides, I'm well aware of who I'm giving them to and my relationships with them,

109
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:53,140
unlike someone who even mixed up which person liked tomatoes.

110
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,860
Can't you be more domineering and masculine?

111
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,210
Hurry up!

112
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Say something. Say something.

113
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,010
Gather up, everyone! Meeting in the office.

114
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,890
Su Kelan, wait a minute.

115
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,660
President Yu,

116
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,200
Kelan is a member of the programming team now instead of "What to Eat Next."

117
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,910
In what capacity did you ask her to wait?

118
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
As the sponsor of this show.

119
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Then please discuss the sponsorship affairs with me.

120
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,432
Tell me, what's the matter?

121
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:48,680
President Yu, if you have any official business, just say it here.

122
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,530
We are all listening.

123
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,950
There's nothing to discuss now.

124
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,316
Director Jin, you've cut the chicken too finely today. It's hard to pick them up.

125
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,900
This is a little too sweet.

126
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,120
- That's right.
- Right.

127
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
But with Sister Kelan here, we are being treated better.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,580
There's food to eat even during a meeting!

129
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,780
That's right.

130
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,760
So shall we plan for a freshwater seafood-related theme for the next episode?

131
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,620
It's because you want to eat crabs, right?

132
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,600
But I want to eat a barbecue. Why don't we plan for a late-night snack-based theme instead?

133
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,490
Sister Kelan, what do you think?

134
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,400
If it's a freshwater-seafood theme…

135
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,120
So Sister Kelan, do you support a crab feast as well?

136
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
Sister Kelan wants to eat barbecue.

137
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,180
She said freshwater-seafood theme so, of course, it'll be crabs.

138
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,250
Barbecue tastes better.

139
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,920
If we like someone's homemade pickled vegetables, maybe that also means

140
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,936
that we like all the memories and longings associated with them.

141
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,328
Maybe

142
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:30,332
we can turn from friends

143
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,560
to family.

144
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,120
Wake up.

145
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,200
Time to get up!

146
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,360
Are you getting up or not?

147
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,480
Wake up.

148
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,476
You're so annoying.

149
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,984
What's the point of training like this?

150
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,960
Didn't Li Bai say,
(T/N: A famous poet)

151
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,300
"Put in continuous effort the first time,"

152
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,276
"work harder the second time,"

153
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,500
"and the third time is the charm?"

154
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,300
It is "Beat the drum once to boost morale, but you'll end up exhausted by the third drum beat,"

155
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,220
besides, it has nothing to do with Li Bai.

156
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,070
I'm already running out of steam, depleted and exhausted.

157
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,596
All you need is a boost of fighting spirit.

158
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,700
You're just pursuing a girl…

159
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,980
who recently quit her job due to frustration.

160
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,900
What's so hard about this?

161
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,800
When I was…

162
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,380
When I was new to the entertainment industry,

163
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,000
I just ate when I was lovelorn

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and disappeared for more than six months.

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,160
When my agency ordered me to go on a reality show,

166
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,724
I weighed 218 pounds.

167
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,000
I thought you were chubby when you were on that show,

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,900
but 218 pounds…

169
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,940
Shut up.

170
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,980
You are disrupting my train of thought.

171
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Where was I?

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,100
Two hundred eighteen pounds.

173
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,480
I only had two months before they started filming,

174
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,456
I went on an extreme diet and worked out like crazy every day.

175
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,816
My manager took me along to convince the producers to add me to the cast.

176
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,100
At first, they completely ignored me.

177
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,000
Still, I continued this for two weeks,

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,076
and they ended up noticing that I had really lost a lot of weight.

179
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:36,840
When there was just a month left before shooting began, they suddenly realized that,

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,220
a fat girl like me,

181
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,160
who was determined to lose weight,

182
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,376
can also be a selling point for the show

183
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,560
so they made an exception and put me on the show.

184
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,300
When the show officially began to shoot, I was still 143 pounds.

185
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,000
They were all expecting me to be the laughing stock,

186
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,156
but you already saw the final result of that show.

187
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,070
Therefore, I only believe in one phrase,

188
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,600
"I'm the master of my own destiny."
 (T/N: Famous phrase from "Ne Zha")

189
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,736
Go for it. Go for it.

190
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,244
Keep running.

191
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,960
Go for it!

192
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,980
I can't do it anymore.

193
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,908
Let me take a break first.

194
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,100
[Golden Ladies]

195
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,540
What do you think about this proposal?

196
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,080
I think it's a good thing.

197
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,020
Having seen that show's director confess his feelings, I'm sure Yu Hao would be in a panic.

198
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,780
But what if that director succeeds in winning over Kelan's heart?

199
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,500
Didn't you say he's a loser?

200
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,930
Well, if he cleans up a little,

201
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,190
he can be pretty handsome.

202
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,200
The key is your friend's attitude. If she has decided to work with the programming team,

203
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,820
Isn't it because she still wants to have a chance to be in touch with Yu Hao?

204
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,020
If she argued with Yu Hao over pickled vegetables

205
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,180
and mentioned the tomato thing, then isn't it obvious that she's jealous?

206
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,520
The point is that neither of them is backing down.

207
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,420
What's wrong with your nephew?

208
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,180
He has already broken up with his ex-girlfriend.

209
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,328
Why can't he just throw that damn tomato keychain away?

210
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,992
You…

211
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,376
Are you coming to dinner on Sunday?

212
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,356
I have a plan.

213
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,990
Wait, your mother-in-law is coming over for dinner at your place,

214
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,220
and you're asking me to cook for you?

215
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,300
How does that make sense?

216
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,480
Your mom is coming over to our place for dinner,

217
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,180
and you want my best friend to cook?

218
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,900
Don't you think that's weird?

219
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Besides, Kelan would also think that this is strange.

220
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,700
It's not strange.

221
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,100
You've met my mom before.

222
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,300
She's not a stickler for rules.

223
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,140
Besides, she's really worried about Yu Hao as well.

224
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,380
If we bring her along, she'll be even more anxious than us.

225
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,060
As for Su Kelan, just say this.

226
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,700
Please do me a favor.

227
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,496
My mother-in-law used to own a restaurant. She's very picky.

228
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:38,540
Over the years, she's been traveling abroad.

229
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,320
Now that she's back for her son's wedding,

230
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,740
she's really pining for some good home-cooked meals.

231
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,700
I let her try some of your pickled vegetables the other day,

232
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
and she really loved them.

233
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,160
No, no. She'll definitely say,

234
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,280
"Why don't you go get some from my place?"

235
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,940
Well, then here's what you should say…

236
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,380
That's not enough.

237
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,120
While she was eating, she said,

238
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,780
"This pickled vegetable would taste delicious if we turned it into a stir-fried dish."

239
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,260
So I told her, "Sure, sure. My bestie is an awesome cook."

240
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,180
"I'll ask her to come over."

241
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,580
Will Yu Hao be there as well?

242
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,860
Deny it at all costs, then change the subject.

243
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,641
Tell her that your relationship with your mother-in-law completely relies on her.

244
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,500
Make a scene or act feisty, do everything you can.

245
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,820
Now is the time to show your acting skills.

246
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,980
No.

247
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,276
This marks the crucial beginning of my relationship with my mother-in-law.

248
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,984
I can care less about his stupid nephew.

249
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,980
Or do you think that,

250
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,560
it's too much trouble…

251
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,312
to help your bestie of over ten years?

252
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,880
Take a cab. I'll reimburse you.

253
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,820
Please, please.

254
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,760
I'll reimburse your taxi fare.

255
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,056
Let's go.

256
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,656
Perfect!

257
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,120
Sir, Ma'am, you seem to be more concerned about other people's affairs than your own wedding.

258
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,340
Shall we keep looking at the proposal?

259
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,136
Okay, okay.

260
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
Coming!

261
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,880
You're finally here.

262
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,760
Change your shoes.

263
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,700
What's going on with you?

264
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,040
Why didn't you tell me that President Yu will be here?

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,064
I got the date wrong.

266
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,420
My back is acting up again.

267
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,620
Then I'll give you a massage in the room.

268
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,420
Okay.

269
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,900
Meng Meng,

270
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,300
I have brought all the ingredients for you.

271
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,237
They are easy to make. You should be able to handle it yourself.

272
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,020
I'm heading out now.

273
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,424
Kelan, Kelan.

274
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,220
My mother-in-law is about to arrive.

275
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,828
Now you can't just leave me stranded here.

276
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,100
Mom.

277
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,380
Meng Meng.

278
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,820
Come on in.

279
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,420
Auntie?

280
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,408
It's you.

281
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,980
Mom,

282
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,776
do you know each other?

283
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Are you still mad at me?

284
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,180
All right, all right.

285
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,520
Look at you.

286
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,716
You even helped my mother-in-law at the hospital.

287
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,500
That's so serendipitous, right?

288
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,740
Compared to when I had picked up

289
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,341
Lu Wenxing from the side of the road back then, this is destiny.

290
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:48,596
- Isn't that true?
- What are you talking about?

291
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,420
All right, all right. Come on.

292
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,340
Please punish me harder.

293
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,480
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.

294
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,688
It hurts.

295
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,220
All right, don't be angry at me anymore.

296
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,920
Mom, next time you want a facelift or something, just tell me.

297
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,757
It's not shameful. Why must you keep this a secret?

298
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,880
I didn't get scammed anyway.

299
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,016
Besides, if I didn't go, I wouldn't have met Kelan.

300
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,160
What's wrong with the two of them?

301
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,960
So

302
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,500
Gong Wenxing's mom is Yu Hao's grandma?

303
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,988
That's why Gong Wenxing is Yu Hao's uncle.

304
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:41,672
That's very serendipitous.

305
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,940
I thought they were distant relatives.

306
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,660
It's weird, isn't it?

307
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,120
Here, I'll straighten it out for you.

308
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,460
My mother-in-law gave birth to Yu Hao's mom…

309
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,160
when she was 19 years old.

310
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,480
Nineteen years later, she gave birth to Gong Wenxing at an advanced age.

311
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,140
Therefore, Yu Hao's mom is Gong Wenxing's elder sister.

312
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,940
What's more coincidental is that,

313
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,660
Yu Hao's mom also married at a young age.

314
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,560
The day my mother-in-law gave birth to Gong Wenxing,

315
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,620
Yu Hao's mom gave birth to Yu Hao as well.

316
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,560
Their due date was around the same time.

317
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,816
Both mother and daughter went to the hospital together to have their babies.

318
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:16,996
I heard it was a spectacle at the hospital back then.

319
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,440
So do you know anything about Yu Hao's mother?

320
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,296
Gong Wenxing only told me that she passed away a long time ago.

321
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:39,116
He also asked me not to mention it in front of Yu Hao or his mom.

322
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,340
But later on, Gong Wenxing told me that,

323
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,136
the reason Yu Hao doesn't celebrate his birthday

324
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:50,404
is also because of that.

325
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:52,968
But he didn't tell me

326
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:55,532
any more details.

327
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:57,180
Therefore, I thought,

328
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,260
it isn't right for me to ask him any further when he even…

329
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,450
asked me not to mention it in front of his family.

330
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,196
Why don't you just come back?

331
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:12,296
Come back where?

332
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,780
To the company.

333
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,296
I don't think there are any fundamental problems between you and Yu Hao.

334
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:21,516
You see, once you left, I was the one who

335
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:23,276
had to take over your position as the director.

336
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:25,216
Yu Hao is so hard to deal with.

337
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,028
I really can't do it.

338
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,536
Besides, even if you're in the programming team,

339
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:32,076
you'll still run into Yu Hao quite often.

340
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,600
You might as well come back and be the director again.

341
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,390
Seeing him quite often

342
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,060
is still better than feeling

343
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,270
vexed upon seeing him every day.

344
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,188
Here we go.

345
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,180
Check it out.

346
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,080
Do you want some?

347
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,916
Just tell me if you do.

348
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,648
Don't hold it in.

349
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:17,248
This braised meat is delicious.

350
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,476
A lot of people are eyeing it covetously.

351
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,732
If you don't eat it,

352
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:24,100
someone else will.

353
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,476
Honey, where is our first aid box?

354
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,276
Kelan cut her finger. It's a deep gash.

355
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:31,548
The bleeding won't stop!

356
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,808
Are you okay?

357
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,560
What's wrong?

358
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,060
It's good that you're okay.

359
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
I won't bother you then.

360
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,276
Hey, why is the door locked?

361
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:00,936
What? Oh?

362
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:02,576
What? Oh, no.

363
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,116
The lock seems to be broken.

364
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,600
Gong Wenxing, go and get something

365
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,410
- to fix it.
- Okay, okay.

366
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,764
I'll help you.

367
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,160
Hey,

368
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,476
have you found something to fix it?

369
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,736
This might take a while.

370
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:21,676
Yu Hao, see if you can find anything in the kitchen that could be of any help.

371
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:23,850
Oh, Kelan, why don't you

372
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,890
have a chat with Yu Hao.

373
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,148
Han Meng has been bad-tempered lately.

374
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,548
Isn't she always bad-tempered?

375
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:08,016
Why are they talking about me?

376
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,836
I don't know.

377
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:11,960
She has had several fights with multiple people

378
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,176
ever since she took over your position.

379
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:17,796
She frequently slams the table when she's talking with the Marketing director.

380
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:22,090
She even tossed documents in my face a few times.

381
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,276
I always respect him in public.

382
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:26,376
I only show resentment when no one is around.

383
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,728
I would never embarrass him in front of others.

384
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,877
That's right. At the office,

385
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:33,110
I have never told anyone that I'm his aunt.

386
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,596
I'm the one who is most miserable.

387
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:36,216
I'm stuck between my wife and nephew.

388
00:24:36,216 --> 00:24:38,516
Sometimes, I'm like, "Honey, Yu Hao is your boss after all."

389
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:39,556
"You should show him some respect."

390
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:40,776
"Bear with it next time."

391
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,236
On the other hand, I'm like, "Don't be angry anymore."

392
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:44,056
"You're a man. You should be more tolerant with her."

393
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,600
"She's just a little short-tempered."

394
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,976
Who's short-tempered?

395
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,236
I'm short-tempered.

396
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:51,060
I'm short-tempered.

397
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,781
What I'm trying to say is that if things aren't going well for you

398
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:59,296
in the programming team, you can just come back.

399
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,204
Thank you, President Yu,

400
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,276
but I think that the programming team suits me better.

401
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:13,692
We don't have to work overtime very often. Besides,

402
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:17,136
I don't need to keep my phone on 24/7.

403
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,244
Do you need any help?

404
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,356
We're about to record the show, right?

405
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:39,188
How about we prepare for it now?

406
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,636
We don't even have a theme yet.

407
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:44,760
What's there to prepare?

408
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,176
I can start preparing now.

409
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:47,870
And then, when the theme is disclosed,

410
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,700
I can just apply it to the theme.

411
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,516
Are you making boiled fish with Sichuan pickles?

412
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:57,400
Why?

413
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,296
It's delicious, appetizing, and goes well with rice.

414
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:02,176
Do I need a reason?

415
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,120
Even if I do have a reason,

416
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,840
why do you want to hear it?

417
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,100
Hello, Director Zhao. What's up?

418
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,780
Is there a problem with the contract?

419
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,372
"One of the clauses isn't clear"? Which one?

420
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,520
What?

421
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,416
Okay.

422
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,076
Is it urgent? Okay.

423
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:48,416
Then first discuss it with An Jie.

424
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,548
I'll call him right now.

425
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,530
When we put the vegetables in an airtight jar,

426
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,090
they will ferment and become sour.

427
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,324
I wonder whether this sourness means sorrow,

428
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:11,224
or whether it's the anticipation for the fish. Maybe it's nostalgia?

429
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,076
What's going on?

430
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,148
Does it taste good, Mom?

431
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:47,816
It's delicious, very nice.

432
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:50,788
I told you Kelan is a great cook.

433
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:53,076
- Yes.
- Eat up.

434
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,176
You should have some, too. Try this.

00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:56,540
Okay.

It's okay. Thank you, President Yu.

You like tomatoes,

446
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:10,420

Why can't I share them?

00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:15,836
Besides, I'm well aware of who I'm giving them to

A keepsake is to summon up memories.

When those memories only cause sadness,

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,356

After that, she asked me for treats and said

526
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:49,656
she'd feel happy to be alive as long as there were tasty treats.

527
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:53,236
After we finished the documentary, I started coming here

528
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:55,936
every week to cook with them.

529
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:58,300
At least in that moment,

530
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,932
they can forget about their pain.

531
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,308
Brother Jin Xuan, what are we making today?

532
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:19,040
Lame.

533
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,316
Okay, listen up.

534
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:31,628
I brought a magical dish for all of you today.

535
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:33,100
Here we are.

536
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,616
- Are you ready?
 - We're ready!

537
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,936
- Are you ready?
- We're ready!

538
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:45,500
Here we go!

539
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,108
Wow!

540
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,356
As long as it's made with your heart, the dish will shine.

541
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:57,176
It's the same for people.

542
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:59,856
Each one of you has to believe

543
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:03,156
that you will grow up to be an adult who shines.

544
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,236
- Really?
- Really.

545
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,664
Wow.

546
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,772
It's a small device.

547
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:21,024
There's a kind of mechanism inside.

548
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,496
- So there's a mechanism after all.
- Yes.

549
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:28,476
One of the children just had an amputation and has been listless

550
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:30,996
so I arranged this with the help of the doctors and nurses.

551
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,636
There's a light under the dish.

552
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:34,896
I'm a professional at these kinds of things.

553
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:37,264
You're so caring.

554
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:38,836
Thank you for keeping us company, Director Jin.

555
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,336
I'll see you in the programming team tomorrow.

556
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:44,576
Don't mention it. You're the ones who spent time with the children.

557
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,276
I drove here. Let me take you home.

558
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:50,616
That's all right. Don't bother with it. We'll just call a cab.

559
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:53,656
It's not easy to get a cab at this hour.

560
00:40:53,656 --> 00:40:56,056
Besides, Auntie must be tired by now.

561
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:58,000
It's easier to catch a ride with me.

562
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,800
I am indeed a little bit dizzy.

563
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,280
[Zhang Bi]

564
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,696
Good luck. Get your mother-in-law's approval.

565
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,676
Did you take them home? Make sure you walk them right to the door.

566
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:39,556
Stay for dinner even if you have to be shameless.

567
00:41:39,556 --> 00:41:42,436
There's more. I put the Love Charm in your car.

568
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:45,140
Make sure you keep it on you.

569
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,336
Do you remember the plan?

570
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:48,020
I do.

571
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,396
- Take it easy, Mom.
- Okay.

572
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,896
In a little while, we'll go to your apartment.

573
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:06,668
It's right here.

574
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,136
Dad, Mom, we're home!

575
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:16,756
- Hello, In-laws. Please come in.
- Please have a seat.

576
00:43:16,756 --> 00:43:19,170
After we'll walk in, you'll say…

577
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,730
"Dad, Mom, I'm going to bring something over to Kelan's place."

578
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,652
Of course, I've already convinced my mom to assist us.

579
00:43:28,652 --> 00:43:32,096
Why don't we invite Kelan and her mom over for dinner?

580
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:34,616
- Let's all get to know each other.
- That's right.

581
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:37,180
Of course, I have already made an agreement with my mom as well.

582
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,096
Sure, sure. I haven't seen Kelan for such a long while. I really miss her.

583
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:43,080
This way I can also greet her mom.

584
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Sure.

585
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,572
I'll be on my way then.

586
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:50,717
Come on. Take a seat.

587
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,596
In that case,

588
00:43:54,596 --> 00:43:58,030
Yu Hao and Kelan will have another chance

589
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,130
to spend some time together.

590
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,836
We'll set the couple up. It'll be a complete success!

591
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:10,892
It's critical to shorten their physical distance.

592
00:44:10,892 --> 00:44:12,748
Perfect.

593
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,756
Let's chat first.

594
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:19,616
After that, Meng Meng will mention bringing something over to her.

595
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:22,620
Meng Meng's mom will mention dinner together.

596
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,540
I'll cooperate.

597
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,960
Grandma, what are you mumbling about?

598
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,340
Nothing, nothing.

599
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,196
Director Jin, thank you for driving us home.

600
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:44,336
Come upstairs and have a drink.

601
00:44:44,336 --> 00:44:47,684
Mom, Director Jin is very busy.

602
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,260
I'm not busy.

603
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,412
Mom, be careful.

604
00:44:58,412 --> 00:44:59,780
Kelan,

605
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,740
here's your purse.

606
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,340
Thank you.

607
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,888
Is that plan still—

608
00:45:33,888 --> 00:45:37,776
What plan? It's all ruined!

609
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,820
What are you doing?

610
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,236
Don't worry. What kind of person is Yu Hao?

611
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:56,016
He's a young and promising CEO who returned from overseas.

612
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:58,556
That Jin Xuan can't compare at all.

613
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:02,596
What do you mean he can't compare? Do you even know who he is?

614
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:07,196
He's the director of the programming team. Mom, don't think so highly of him just because he's a director.

615
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:10,240
He's just someone who would eat a boxed meal by the side of the road.

616
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,016
- Come on, have some tea.
- Thank you, Auntie.

617
00:46:18,016 --> 00:46:19,420
Have a seat.

618
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,450
Is it tough to be a director?

619
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,696
It's all right. We're busy when there's a project, but we also have some free time.

620
00:46:28,696 --> 00:46:30,996
No wonder you don't know.

621
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,796
Does he have any other hidden identities?

622
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:35,336
Batman? Iron Man?

623
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,136
He's the youngest son of the owner of Huajin Energy Group.

624
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:42,600
Do you have a steady income?

625
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,052
It's nice when there's a project.

626
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,420
When I don't have a project, it's…

627
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,216
That's all right as long as you have adequate money.

628
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:57,296
You're still young. You have plenty of time to work on that.

629
00:46:57,296 --> 00:46:59,640
It'll get better in the future.

630
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,572
H-H-He's nothing but

631
00:47:06,572 --> 00:47:08,796
a rich second generation.

632
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,980
I'll help you, Auntie.

633
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,075
- Okay.
- Let me.

634
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,710
Auntie,

635
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,436
this Weibo account—

636
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,672
It's my Weibo account.

637
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:41,476
- Do you follow me?
- Yes, I've followed you for a very long time.

638
00:47:41,476 --> 00:47:46,432
I just think that the photos look really warm and appetizing.

639
00:47:46,432 --> 00:47:50,416
Some of the tones from "Dine with Love" used your photos

640
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,896
as reference.

641
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:54,476
What a coincidence!

642
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:56,480
Look,

643
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,156
this one too.

644
00:47:58,156 --> 00:47:59,896
This is…

645
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,824
I-I-It's just my doodle.

646
00:48:03,824 --> 00:48:06,832
Director Jin, do you also know how to draw?

647
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:09,436
He graduated from the California Institute of Arts.

648
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:12,816
Back in the days, a casual doodle of his was

649
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:16,320
good enough to be displayed in the Gagosian Gallery.

650
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,248
It's just a hobby.

651
00:48:26,248 --> 00:48:28,056
The show is on a very tight budget

652
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:31,381
so I just drew some of the illustrations myself.

653
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,296
Auntie, I'm sorry for using your photo as reference

654
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:40,720
without your permission.

655
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,992
That's all right.

656
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:45,237
It looks wonderful. Do you have any more?

657
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:47,156
Yes, yes, yes.

658
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,740
Here.

659
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,552
Director, have a seat.

660
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:04,990
Yes.

661
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,500
Director,

662
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,140
I've always wanted to see what Kelan looks like when she's cooking.

663
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,220
Can you draw her for me?

664
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,580
Draw her?

665
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,316
Are my tools not up to your standards?

666
00:49:41,316 --> 00:49:43,696
No, no. Of course not.

667
00:49:43,696 --> 00:49:45,892
W-Well, thank you.

668
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,812
Well, does he know that his love rival is so outstanding?

669
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,597
In the Kruger National Park in South Africa, two lions are chasing each other and fighting

670
00:50:21,597 --> 00:50:24,720
for the right to mate with a lioness.

671
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,384
Director Jin, I didn't know you can draw.

672
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:42,000
Kelan,

673
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,920
I have something to…

674
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,280
Director Jin,

675
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,988
are you hungry?

676
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:55,316
You can take a break over there.

677
00:51:55,316 --> 00:51:58,176
Dinner will be ready soon. I'll tell you when it's done.

678
00:51:58,176 --> 00:52:02,356
Kelan, why don't you let me cook dinner?

679
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:05,964
This way, you and Auntie can try my food as well.

680
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,088
Sure, let's try your food.

681
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,696
I'll be your assistant then.

682
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,380
Sure.

683
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,180
Let me.

684
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,736
Don't hurt your hand again.

685
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,016
What's the matter?

686
00:52:52,016 --> 00:52:52,960
I'm fine.

687
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,564
Just wait to try my food.

688
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,060
I'll bring you the fish.

689
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,560
Okay.

690
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,496
This is fun. It's interesting.

691
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,740
So funny.

692
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,936
- I'll download one for you later.
- No problem.

693
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:24,796
Mom, did you cut your hand?

694
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:25,860
It's okay. It's okay.

695
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,492
Don't make a fuss about it.

696
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:29,768
Dad, look at you!

697
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,320
You are just sitting there without a care in the world.

698
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,697
- It's okay.
- How can you let Mom

699
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:34,756
do something as dangerous as peeling an apple?

700
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:36,436
It's all right. It's nothing.

701
00:53:36,436 --> 00:53:38,460
Don't make a big fuss.

702
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,461
Hurry up.

703
00:53:39,461 --> 00:53:40,516
Here, I'll do it.

704
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:43,800
- Don't move.
- It's okay. It's just a minor cut.

705
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,736
Mom, dinner is ready.

706
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:19,320
Okay.

707
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,557
Director Jin, you've been following my mom's Weibo account for this long?

708
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,440
It's serendipity.

709
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,568
He also used photos of your dishes to draw.

710
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:32,480
- Draw?
- Yes.

711
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,980
Director Jin,

712
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:42,300
can you send me your drawings so I can keep them?

713
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,480
Send a copy to Kelan while you're at it.

714
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,736
I'm afraid I might lose them later.

715
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:48,520
Sure.

716
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,740
Done.

717
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,240
Director Jin, please eat.

718
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,756
- Director Jin, eat some more.
- Look at how nice the pictures are.

719
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,936
Director Jin, did you learn to draw professionally?

720
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,900
I studied modern art in college.

721
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,997
If you studied art professionally,

722
00:55:18,997 --> 00:55:22,080
why did you become the director of a gourmet food program?

723
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,080
In 2009 when I was studying in the U.S.,

724
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,076
my aunt and uncle took their family on a vacation.

725
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:31,080
I pretended that I had a fever

726
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,020
and skipped school.

727
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,316
Unfortunately, I didn't get to enjoy it for very long…

728
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:37,400
before a flu began to spread in the U.S.

729
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,336
My friends thought I had the flu

730
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,456
so they stopped coming over to hang out with me.

731
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:44,040
Thank you.

732
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,160
Didn't you tell them that you weren't sick?

733
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,900
I was afraid that my dad would beat me up.

734
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,584
As a result, I was stranded in the house.

735
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,676
However, while I was living alone, everything else was fine

736
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,836
except that I had cravings all the time.

737
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:04,636
When I finally fell asleep at night, all I could dream of

738
00:56:04,636 --> 00:56:08,320
were things like pig trotters, pig intestines,

739
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,960
hotpots, etc.

740
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,720
When I woke up the next morning,

741
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,460
I went to my favorite Chinese restaurant.

742
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,116
However,

743
00:56:17,116 --> 00:56:19,500
it had been closed for days.

744
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,480
At that moment, I thought, "Who would come to visit me now?"

745
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,440
Someone who came to our restaurant even during a pandemic

746
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,656
must really be craving the food

747
00:56:42,656 --> 00:56:44,620
so this is our treat.

748
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,240
Please order from our restaurant again once the pandemic is over.

749
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,720
It was

750
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,196
really inexplicable.

751
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,344
I cried so hard at that moment.

752
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,724
I want to spread…

753
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,868
the warmth and emotions…

754
00:57:09,868 --> 00:57:13,864
that food can bring to more people through our show.

755
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,116
Auntie, please eat.

756
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:25,896
I… I think I've said too much.

757
00:57:25,896 --> 00:57:27,036
It's okay.

758
00:57:27,036 --> 00:57:28,800
You didn't.

759
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,992
Mom, start eating.

760
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:32,680
Try it.

761
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,060
Delicious.

762
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,112
Kelan, try some, too.

763
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,620
How is it?

764
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,850
Did you add red wine?

765
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,956
That's the way they made this at that Chinese restaurant.

766
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:02,436
After that, I couldn't stop thinking about the pig trotters

767
00:58:02,436 --> 00:58:05,360
so I asked the restaurant owner how to make it.

768
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,756
He said that he'd been depressed for days

769
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:10,696
because the restaurant was closed, and he'd lost a lot of money.

770
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:13,596
He had been drinking while he cooked.

771
00:58:13,596 --> 00:58:16,256
He accidentally poured red wine into the pig trotters.

772
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:18,088
Unexpectedly,

773
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:19,960
it turned out extremely delicious.

774
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,704
See, doesn't serendipity exist in this world?

775
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,884
If it wasn't for the pandemic,

776
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:32,356
this dish of pork feet in red wine wouldn't exist.

777
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:34,480
If these pork feet didn't exist,

778
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,696
you wouldn't be the director of a food program

779
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:39,828
or have a chance to meet Kelan.

780
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,256
Mom, eat some more.

781
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,296
And I would miss out on such a delicious dish of

782
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:52,456
pig trotters in red wine.

783
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:55,720
That's right. If you put it that way,

784
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,660
it's all very serendipitous.

785
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,600
Serendipity.

786
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,276
No matter what you encounter, which path you choose,

787
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:07,296
or what kind of person you meet,

788
00:59:07,296 --> 00:59:09,196
are all these countless results of serendipity?

789
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:10,696
You have received offers from all major corporations.

790
00:59:10,696 --> 00:59:12,580
Then why are you still looking into a small company like this?

791
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,797
It's closer to home, so it is convenient for me to go home and take care of my mom.

792
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:17,456
I'll go with you then.

793
00:59:17,456 --> 00:59:19,240
Sure.

794
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,080
An Jie,

795
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,276
I have made some braised meat for everyone.

796
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:25,360
Let me, let me.

797
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,888
I'm sorry for not being there during overtime.

798
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:31,316
With food like this, it doesn't matter whether you work overtime or not.

799
00:59:31,316 --> 00:59:32,476
Bring us some more next time.

800
00:59:32,476 --> 00:59:34,656
- I love eating braised chicken feet.
- Okay.

801
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:37,136
I'll put the rest in the fridge for you.

802
00:59:37,136 --> 00:59:38,336
Okay. Thank you, Kelan.

803
00:59:38,336 --> 00:59:40,616
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

804
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,096
I heard this is our boss's favorite.

805
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:49,816
As for the braised meat that you gave to your coworkers as an apology,

806
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:52,216
should we thank you

807
00:59:52,216 --> 00:59:54,416
or thank you even more?

808
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:57,008
Just thank me.

809
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,832
What are you writing?

810
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:09,248
Keywords the boss should use on the show.

811
01:00:09,248 --> 01:00:12,012
He can't do it himself?

812
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:14,580
He doesn't know how to cook.

813
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,924
He's doing fine on the show.

814
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,232
Who wrote the script for the bitter gourds on the show?

815
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:31,944
What kind of chances would lead you to meet someone?

816
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:34,232
Would he stay by your side,

817
01:00:34,232 --> 01:00:35,940
or…

818
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,104
just pass by you?

819
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,880
The pig trotters in red wine were delicious.

820
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,976
Don't you think they were delicious as well?

821
01:00:53,976 --> 01:00:56,110
Didn't you like them a lot?

822
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,272
If you like them, I can make them for you tomorrow.

823
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:10,084
I don't want you to always be the one cooking for other people.

824
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:13,296
I'd like someone who can accompany you in the kitchen

825
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:15,296
and prepare the food he loves to eat.

826
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,952
At the same time, you can love his food as well.

827
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,396
This period of time is like the pandemic that

828
01:01:23,396 --> 01:01:26,580
Director Jin experienced.

829
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,064
The flu may feel awful,

830
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:31,852
but it will eventually pass.

831
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,540
However, the delicious pig trotters in red wine

832
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,100
will be by your side forever.

833
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,240
It's quite good.

834
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,540
Look, look.

835
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,560
Hasn't it improved by a landslide and "at a tumble down pace"

836
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,856
due to my effort?

837
01:01:45,856 --> 01:01:48,904
Do you mean "at a tremendous pace"?

838
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:51,716
You're picking on me again.

839
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:53,400
So what if I got the idiom wrong?

840
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,300
It's fine as long as you can understand.

841
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,340
This one is good.

842
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,880
Really?

843
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,180
Come here.

844
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,130
This is number 1.

845
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:06,560
- Are you sure?
- Of course!

846
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,590
Wait a minute.

847
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,996
Her mom is obviously giving you a chance to show your charm

848
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,592
by letting you go in and draw Su Kelan.

849
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:17,416
What did you do? Why did you present yourself as their cook?

850
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,296
How is that improving at a tremendous pace?

851
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:22,044
You barely made half a meter.

852
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:25,060
What do you mean?

853
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,756
Just because you're lame, stop imagining that her mother will be as lame as you.

854
01:02:28,756 --> 01:02:30,436
Am I lame?

855
01:02:30,436 --> 01:02:34,656
If I hadn't been lame like that, would the child have drawn Auntie Su and Su Kelan to you?

856
01:02:34,656 --> 01:02:36,456
If I hadn't been lame like that,

857
01:02:36,456 --> 01:02:41,330
would you have had a chance to go to her place and have such a close encounter with her?

858
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,160
I'll figure it myself, all right?

859
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,860
Think about it.

860
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,256
If Auntie Su wants to see Su Kelan in a painting,

861
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:52,196
she can simply use the sketch conversion feature in the cellphone filters.

862
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:54,016
Why would she ask you to do it?

863
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:56,810
It was obviously an excuse.

864
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,430
You did it yourself, right?

865
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,590
Have you ever watched the movie Titanic?

866
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:12,256
Jack and Rose fell deeply in love after he made a sketch of her.

867
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:15,004
"You jeep. I jeep."

868
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:18,068
That's the charm of art.

869
01:03:18,068 --> 01:03:20,650
It's "jump."

870
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,470
Come on, let's drink.

871
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,780
The point isn't "jump" or "jeep,"

872
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,356
it's the sketch that shows your charisma.

873
01:03:28,356 --> 01:03:33,696
Her mom gave you such a good opportunity, and you wasted it.

874
01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:35,380
Well…

875
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,288
I'll find another chance later on.

876
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:42,480
It's just some sketches.

877
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,296
Just some sketches?

878
01:03:44,296 --> 01:03:47,760
Seize the opportunity and strike while the iron is hot.

879
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,236
Just tell her that her mom wants to see a sketch of her

880
01:03:50,236 --> 01:03:53,636
and look for a beautiful place to draw it at.

881
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,940
Can you draw?

882
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,460
Don't make it counterproductive.

883
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,088
Can I draw?

884
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:10,088
Galleries would fight to display my work, okay?

885
01:04:10,088 --> 01:04:13,556
Drawing well and making her look beautiful are two different things.

886
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:16,120
Girls only care whether they look beautiful or not.

887
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,836
The front camera on our phones can never compare to the beauty filter.

888
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,380
- Oh, we should go.
- Yes, definitely.

889
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,880
How about this?

890
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,816
I will be a model for you for free.

891
01:04:30,816 --> 01:04:33,756
I'll sacrifice myself to see

892
01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:39,496
if your drawings are in line with contemporary beauty… mainstream… aesthetics...

893
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:42,320
I mean if you can show your charisma.

894
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,316
What are you thinking?

895
01:05:37,316 --> 01:05:38,470
Don't move.

896
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,100
Okay.

897
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:12,496
Dude, even the front camera on our phones will die upon seeing this.

898
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,860
You should stick to sincerity.

899
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,028
Honey.

900
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:32,876
What do you think Yu Hao meant?

901
01:06:32,876 --> 01:06:36,396
The way he ran out like that, he would undoubtedly chase after Kelan,

902
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:38,828
but then he simply came back?

903
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,120
Why is he dragging his feet?

904
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,696
He's just too proud.

905
01:06:42,696 --> 01:06:45,896
Honey, you've been worried about him all day.

906
01:06:45,896 --> 01:06:47,556
Stop thinking about him.

907
01:06:47,556 --> 01:06:49,240
Think about your husband.

908
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,900
Could it be that he still can't forget about Shen Zhilin?

909
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,588
Honey.

910
01:06:56,588 --> 01:06:59,668
Do all men get hung up over their puppy loves?

911
01:06:59,668 --> 01:07:01,744
Is it that meaningful?

912
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,616
Do you know that Yu Hao loves cats?

913
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,720
When he was little,

914
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,300
Yu Hao's mom was allergic to cat fur

915
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,796
so he couldn't keep one.

916
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:33,600
Later on, Yu Hao came to stay with us.

917
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,300
One day…

918
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,236
Look, I found a kitten.

919
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,692
He took the kitten

920
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:46,040
to the vet every morning

921
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,716
and took care of it at night.

922
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,084
He barely slept.

923
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,980
But two weeks later,

924
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,804
he still wasn't able to save that kitten.

925
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,804
Yu Hao is a very affectionate person.

926
01:08:08,804 --> 01:08:12,440
He was really close to his mom but his mom passed away.

927
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,720
He really loved cats.

928
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,200
He didn't sleep for days,

929
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,060
but he still couldn't save that cat.

930
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,000
Later on,

931
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,364
he met Shen Zhilin.

932
01:08:25,364 --> 01:08:29,760
He tried really hard to change himself for her.

933
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,540
But in the end,

934
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,840
they still parted on bad terms.

935
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,428
Some people have happy pasts.

936
01:08:40,428 --> 01:08:44,720
Therefore, they can live free of any inhibitions. Like us.

937
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
But some people…

938
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,376
experienced irreversible separations

939
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:53,136
and because they've been hurt since childhood, they are afraid of pain.

940
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:55,176
They would rather never possess anything.

941
01:08:55,176 --> 01:08:57,160
That way,

942
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,933
at least they won't feel the pain of loss again.

943
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,116
Auntie, you're not feeling well. You don't have to walk me out.

944
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:19,700
All right. Kelan, please see Director Jin out

945
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,460
and take out the trash on your way out as well.

946
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,060
Sure.

947
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,436
- Bye, Auntie.
- Bye.

948
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:27,021
♫  Your long hair are softly scattered as you are curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

949
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:34,321
♫  A beautiful creamy flower is blossoming on your coffee and melting gently in the palm of your hand  ♫

950
01:10:34,321 --> 01:10:41,380
♫  As the sky slowly darkened, the kitchen has lit up  ♫

951
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:48,273
♫  Day by day, you're getting used to the warmth of the smoke from the fireplace  ♫

952
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:53,088
♫ You have short tousled hair ♫

953
01:10:53,088 --> 01:10:56,492
♫  You're lightly plucking the guitar  ♫

954
01:10:56,492 --> 01:11:03,921
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

955
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:10,888
♫  As the sky slowly darkened, time stood still  ♫

956
01:11:10,888 --> 01:11:17,714
♫  Is this is the romance that you liked?  ♫

957
01:11:17,714 --> 01:11:25,041
♫  I love to be by your side every day  ♫

958
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:28,427
♫  A simple tea and meal  ♫

959
01:11:28,427 --> 01:11:32,627
♫  All I wish for is to kiss you goodnight  ♫

960
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:37,355
♫  Year after year and forever in this lifetime  ♫

961
01:11:37,355 --> 01:11:41,139
♫  From dawn till dusk, through odds and ends  ♫

962
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:44,598
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

963
01:11:44,598 --> 01:11:52,790
♫  I want to kiss you and say goodnight to you every day  ♫
