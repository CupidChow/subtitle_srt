1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,580
Otherwise, let Yu Hao and Kelan have more interactions.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,501
Or simply ask Kelan to go out with Jin Xuan and make Yu Hao jealous.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,190
No, no, no. What if that goes too far?

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,260
- Meng Meng—
- When we take wedding photos tomorrow, I'll ask Yu Hao and Kelan to come and join us.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,180
At that time, just leave them alone to take some intimate photos.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,370
- Meng Meng—
- Tell me later. Don't interrupt my chain of thoughts.

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,180
Meng Meng, do you remember you have a husband?

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,240
I know Kelan is your best friend.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,680
You want her to be happy.

10
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,900
But do you notice your care towards her

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,370
has affected our daily life?

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,780
I also hope those two will be happy.

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,480
But the future depends on fate...

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,430
It may not always follow our expectations.

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,880
The person in front of you

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,700
is the one who should be cherished.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,190
Sorry, sorry.

18
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,050
I always think you love me anyway,

19
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:42,280
and you will always stand by my side,

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,980
so I neglected you for a bit.

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,970
When you made mistakes, should you be punished?

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,720
Tell me, what is the punishment?

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,700
This is your punishment.

[Episode 8]
[A Romantic Banquet, the Promise of My Life]

26
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,140
I thought about it.

27
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,660
We should let our relatives and friends

28
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,570
experience such happiness like ours as soon as possible.

29
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,110
We are taking our wedding pictures tomorrow.

30
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:40,510
Heavy Industrial Expo Park. Don't be late.

31
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,240
Wear high heels.

32
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,680
Han Meng is worried Su Kelan might be late if she takes the bus.

33
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,030
Why don't you give her a ride?

34
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,400
Well... A friend of mine happened to give me some healthcare products.

35
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,200
I happened to be nearby and happened to think of you—

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,340
Stop, stop, stop. You're sending your mother-in-law the gifts

37
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,720
not telling the police your alibi.

38
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,500
Then tell me, what should I say?

39
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,780
Don't say so many "happened to."

40
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,050
You are specially going there to give your mother-in-law gifts. So what?

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,380
Oh crap, they're coming down.

42
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,320
Go for it! Don't pull back. Fighting!

43
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,960
Fighting.

44
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
Be careful.

45
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,948
It's okay.

46
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:07,210
You can't wear high heels yet you insisted.

47
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm her bridesmaid. Remember?

48
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,430
Director Jin?

49
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,260
Director Jin? Why are you here?

50
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,970
What a coincidence.

51
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,300
Hello, Auntie.

52
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,980
Stop saying "happened to"!

53
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,280
I happened to drive nearby and my friend happened to

54
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,680
give me some healthcare products.

55
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,280
I happened to see auntie wasn't feeling good yesterday.

56
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,360
I happened to consult a doctor friend of mine who said it was suitable for auntie.

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,150
So, so it happens to...

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,760
Director Jin, you're really considerate.

59
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,100
Kelan, we must invite Director Jin for dinner.

60
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm going to do some grocery shopping.

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
What do you like to eat, Director Jin?

62
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,800
Director Jin, excuse me. Thank you so much,

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,620
but I have to take pictures with my friends today.

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,200
How about this? When you're free,

65
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,420
my mother and I will invite you for dinner.

66
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,810
That's okay. I'm free at any time. Then...

67
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,180
Kelan, where did you say you're going?

68
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,660
It's on my way. I can take you there.

69
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,861
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.

70
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:30,780
She's going to the Heavy Industrial Expo Park. Sorry for the trouble, Xiao Jin.

71
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,760
No trouble, no trouble. It's on my way.

72
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,180
- Mom.
- He said it's on his way.

73
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,440
Come over for dinner sometime!

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,960
Deal, Auntie.

75
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,281
- I'm sorry to trouble you.
- That's nothing.

76
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,660
Thank you.

77
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,370
See you later, Auntie.

78
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,540
I asked you to pick her up, why didn't you go?

79
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,120
Are you avoiding her?

80
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,630
That means you have some intentions.

81
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,100
Look at your hair wax, it looks so greasy that I can use it for stir-fry.

82
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,340
You want to look handsome in front of the person you liked.

83
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,740
I can understand that.

84
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,580
But for your uncle's vision, don't use so many hair products next time.

85
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,916
Are we all here?

86
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,360
If we don't start now, the light in the afternoon may not be suitable for taking pictures.

87
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,060
She'll be here soon. Just a moment, please.

88
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,280
Where's Kelan? Is she here yet?

89
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,390
I've no idea.

90
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:31,200
I told you it would take forever with public transportation.

91
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,590
Why didn't you pick her up?

92
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,060
Fine. I'll give her a call.

93
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,940
Remember to pick her up. Meeting at 9 a.m.

94
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,270
It's almost time to leave now.

95
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,680
- Where's my phone?
- Your phone?

96
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,140
I left my phone with you, didn't I?

97
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,480
- That's right.
- Where is it?

98
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,880
How can you call her without the phone?

99
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,230
How can I find her?

100
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,480
It might take a while to get there.

101
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,280
Meng Meng, I'm sorry but I'm stuck in traffic.

102
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,240
Director Jin, could you drop me at the subway station ahead?

103
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,620
I'm on a tight schedule. Maybe it will be faster to take the subway.

104
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,640
Okay.

106
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,250
- Hello?
- Hello, Su Kelan. where are you?

107
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm stuck in traffic on Zhigang Avenue.

108
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,760
It may be a while longer. You may start without me.

109
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,210
I'm stuck in traffic. Maybe half an hour.

110
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,600
The traffic to the nearest subway station is still pretty bad.

111
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,900
Where are you going?

112
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,190
Don't leave. What if she arrives, and we can't find you?

113
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,684
Drink some water.

114
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,220
Thank you.

115
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,676
Actually, I...

116
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,904
Su Kelan, get off.

117
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,760
But Kelan,

118
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,520
the traffic will be better soon.

119
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,080
And riding a motorcycle is very dangerous, okay?

120
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,820
I'll guarantee her safety.

121
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,860
The traffic may be better here.

122
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,510
Can you make sure you won't get stuck again on the way ahead?

123
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:25,680
Su Kelan,

124
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,460
everyone is waiting for you.

125
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,820
Are you sure you want to waste time here?

Excuse me, Director Jin.

127

Back then, we were the Cyclone Duo dominating the Jiubin Road.

Good.

156
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,976
Good. We're already done here.

157
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,880
Do you need to go to school?

158
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,300
Of course.

159
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,940
The motorcycle is part of your memory of youth.

160

- Right?
- Right.

We'll do what you say.

163
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,420
But time is tight.

164
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,860
If there's a traffic jam, we won't finish it on time.

165
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,660
Then let's go by motorcycle.

166
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,620
See who will arrive first.

167
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,476
Sure.

168
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,040
Get on.

169
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,420
The motorcycles will arrive way ahead of us.

170
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,520
But our equipment is still here.

171
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,860
Can they take pictures if they arrive there early?

172
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,070
What are they doing here?

173
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,410
Those people...

174
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,272
I don't think they're from our school.

175
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,624
I remember that place.

176
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,100
Come on. Let's have some snapshots.

177
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,580
Okay.

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,200
Good.

179
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,740
What the hell is this?

180
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,381
I'm not here and you can't work anything out, can you?

181
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,016
Boss, who irritated you today?

182
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,640
How annoying! Why do you keep calling me?

183
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,160
Look at your stupid ideas!

184
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,920
My plan was perfect.

185
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,300
You should reflect on your lack of capacity.

186
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
I...

187
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,192
Nutjob.

188
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,616
Where's your capacity?

189
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,090
Let's work.

190
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,030
Quick, let's get back to work.

191
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,820
Here.

192
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,930
Ready. Go.

193
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,960
Here we go.

194
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,580
Wow, that's nice.

195
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,600
- One more shot.
- Okay.

196
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,980
You're a professional. Ready.

197
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,120
Go.

198
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,600
Done?

199
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,052
Done. One more.

200
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:43,580
- Get ready. Don't get hurt.
Okay.

201
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,960
Okay.

202
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,440
You have been taking pictures all day long. Is it still not enough?

203
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,096
The place is full of Meng Meng's youth memories.

204
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:54,840
Haven't you listened to that song?

205
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,732
♪ Walk on the way you came ♪

206
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,840
Do you know it's a song about bitter love?

207
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,040
Nonsense.

208
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,932
You know nothing.

209
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,396
When you're in love with someone,

210
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:14,720
not only do you want to spend every day with her,

211
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,560
but you will also want to participate in her past.

212
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,190
Do you remember

213
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,760
at that time, I wrote our names behind this door

214
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,860
and I even drew two hearts?

215
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,132
Why are they all gone?

216
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,380
Everything has changed.

217
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,040
Changed?

218
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,900
You're still the same, forcing me to

219
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,680
keep your company to the restroom.

220
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,604
If things haven't changed,

221
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:54,860
I remember someone here loved to sing in the restroom.

222
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,800
Sing now!

223
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,820
Missy, are you going to talk about this for life?

224
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,220
Of course!

225
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,532
Who competed with me for the winner of a singing competition

226
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:08,180
and secretly practiced singing in the restroom every day?

227
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,100
Are we now competing for the awkwardness?

228
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,764
You started with this!

229
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:16,332
What's the name of the boy you liked in high school?

230
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:19,160
The one you asked me to give him your love letter?

231
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,300
Su Kelan, don't talk nonsense.

232
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
- Who wasn't young and ignorant?
- Song Zujia!

233
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,072
I hate you. Don't tickle me.

234
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:28,200
- You want to deny it?
- Speaking nonsense.

235
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,160
You're annoying.

236
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,760
How time flies.

237
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,688
You're getting married.

238
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,120
Right.

239
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,470
When I was rejected by Song Zujia,

240
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,140
I was heartbroken for two months.

241
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,068
I was a fool.

242
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,820
You felt upset

243
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,330
because he was in your blueprint

244
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,970
of the future.

245
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,680
Someone disappeared from such a beautiful picture.

246
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,060
Even if that picture was just imaginary,

247
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,740
you would also be sad.

248
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,304
What are your expectations of life?

249
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,300
One more.

250
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,128
Take a break.

251
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,920
In high school uniform, walking on the high school campus,

252
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,660
are you remembering your youth?

253
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
Can't you set it straight,

254
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,920
or let it go?

255
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
Your wife has gone to the restroom for so long, aren't you worried?

256
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,070
She assigned me a mission

257
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,100
to care about you.

258
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,536
She keeps asking me what's wrong with you.

259
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,700
I told her you were afraid of settling it.

260
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,300
But I know

261
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,700
they're something you still can't let go of.

262
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,008
But...

263
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:11,360
the past is the past.

264
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,240
Even if we're in uniforms,

265
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,580
we're no longer high school students.

266
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,324
Gong Wenxing.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,608
That day, I approved her resignation

268
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,970
because when I learned that Shen Zhilin came back, I realized that

269
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,008
I couldn't let go of my previous relationship.

270
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,700
That day,

271
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,460
she called me and asked me to go hiking with her,

272
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,660
I couldn't believe I was still looking forward to it.

273
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,416
Let me put it this way.

274
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,616
If Shen Zhilin comes back,

275
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:10,100
will you want to be with her?

276
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,868
Then that's it!

277
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,076
But I haven't completely let go of my last relationship.

278
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,240
If I start a new one,

279
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,000
I'll hurt someone else's feelings.

280
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,760
When lovers break up, who can get rid of those feelings immediately?

281
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
Based on your rational,

282
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,260
if I called my first love's name in my dream,

283
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,900
and then I got dumped by my girlfriend.

284
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,924
Then I can no longer date in the future?

285
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:47,260
If I call my first love's name in the middle of the night, that means I didn't let go.

286
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,540
It would "hurt" others.

287
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,520
But I insisted on "hurting" others and finally,

288
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,068
I got reunited with my first love.

289
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,916
Even though you appear gentle,

290
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,480
you've had a very competitive character since you were a child.

291
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,128
Do you remember?

292
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:09,570
In junior high school,

293
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,820
you were in a singing contest

294
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,280
and fought fiercely for first place.

295
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,480
During the 6 years of middle and high school,

296
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,080
you never let yourself get second place in the exams for any subject.

297
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,500
Even in the 800-meter race when you threw up, you still got 1st place.

298
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
As for work...

299
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,080
about that matter of Yu Hao using a body double,

300
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,140
you racked your brains and even fabricated news to calm down Jin Xuan.

301
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,464
But why at this point,

302
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,900
when you're clearly fond of Yu Hao,

303
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,144
why don't you fight for him?

304
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,210
When I was young,

305
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,070
I thought that

306
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,090
as long as I wanted something,

307
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,370
I could get it with hard work.

308
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,032
But now...

309
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,456
I'm no longer a child.

310
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,420
I'm realistic.

311
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,110
I easily lose my balance.

312
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,620
Wearing high heels occasionally?

313
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,820
I can do that.

314
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,880
But if I wear them every day...

315
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,420
I'll eventually fall down.

316
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,560
So what if you fall?

317
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,300
- It hurts.
- Are you the kind of person who's afraid of pain?

318
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,020
Have you forgotten that time when you were rehearsing,

319
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,680
you even lost your voice. It hurt for days. You couldn't even speak.

320
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,332
You're just afraid of embarrassing yourself.

321
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,904
Running, singing, exams...

322
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:10,644
All of those are things you can make progress on through your own hard work.

323
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,116
But in love...

324
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,116
all your hard work is to make your partner notice them.

325
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,540
It can make you feel petty and low.

326
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,556
It's because you're too proud that you feel low.

327
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,840
Just like Gong Wenxing.

328
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,520
Look at the way he keeps playing up to me.

329
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,880
Do you see him as petty and low?

330
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,516
It's exactly because he's always coaxing you that you always bully him.

331
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,940
Actually, I was the cheeky one at first.

332
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,548
That time at KTV,

333
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,028
I was the one who kissed him first.

334
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,644
No way.

335
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,130
Sometimes,

336
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,310
you need to be cheeky first.

337
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,980
Then you'll discover

338
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,028
he can be more cheeky than you.

339
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,720
Photographers, come this way.

340
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,241
- Okay.
- This way.

341
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,680
What's he doing?

342
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,080
Let's go.

343
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,196
- 1, 2. 3...
- Right here.

344
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,220
5, 6, 7, 8. 2, 2, 3.

345
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,400
Excuse me, you guys.

346
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,500
- May I use this?
- Uh...Okay.

347
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,960
Thank you.

348
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,420
Meng Meng,

349
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,390
this is where you spent your youth.

350
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,912
I wasn't there during those times.

351
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,200
But now,

352
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,090
I'm here.

353
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,732
I want your past to be past and together join hands with you for all your future days.

354
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,560
Class 15, Grade 1, No.3 High School student, Han Meng,

355
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm Gong Wenxing, Class 8, Grade 3, Chongwai High School.

356
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,780
It's my great luck to have met you!

357
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,670
Great!

358
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,120
In those days,

359
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,990
after school

360
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,156
you could take anyone's hand freely,

361
00:25:53,156 --> 00:25:57,350
you might be upset, or confused, but you looked forward to being happy.

362
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,120
Now you're in a wedding dress

363
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,476
and are marrying the guy you were destined to win over.

364
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:07,660
All of this is different from what we imagined. .

365
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,910
The future

366
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,980
will also be very far from what we imagine now.

367
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,940
Which class are you in?

368
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,040
Get down from there.

369
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,030
Immediately!

370
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,000
Hey, don't run away!

371
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,900
I remember you!

372
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,640
Stop!

373
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,200
Don't run!

374
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,420
We aren't students anymore. Why are we hiding?

375
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,052
I don't want to see the hashtag "What To Eat Next? CEO dressed as a student" trending in the news.

376
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,570
Since you're so afraid of embarrassment,

377
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,960
why did you agree to dress up like this and take pictures with Gong Wenxing?

378
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,728
I'm influenced by his cheekiness.

379
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,600
So when you're with a cheeky person,

380
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,076
you can become cheeky, too?

381
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,500
Yu Hao?

382
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,880
- Yu Hao?
- Kelan?

383
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,020
Where have you guys been?

384
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,780
Where were you?

385
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,200
You scared us.

386
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,604
You guys, stay right there.

387
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:58,940
Don't run off somewhere.

388
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,200
Again?

389
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,052
Hurry, run!

390
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,730
[Our Marriage]

391
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
Mr. Gong Wenxing,

392
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,570
will you take

393
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,050
Miss Han Meng

394
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,320
as your wife?

395
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,280
For richer or poorer,

396
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,270
in sickness or in health,

397
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,070
are you willing to be with her forever?

398
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,956
I do!

399
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,800
Miss Han Meng, will you marry Mr. Gong Wenxing?

400
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,680
For richer or poorer,

401
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,600
in sickness or in health,

402
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,980
are you willing to be with him forever?

403
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,494
I do!

404
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:05,594
♫  Your long hair is softly scattered as you're curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

405
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:12,894
♫  A milky blossom in coffee, melting gently in the palm of your hand  ♫

406
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:19,994
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, the kitchen lit up with light  ♫

407
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:26,546
♫  Day by day, you're getting used to the warmth of the smoke from the fireplace  ♫

408
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:31,714
♫  You have short tousled hair  ♫

409
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:34,934
♫  You're lightly plucking the guitar  ♫

410
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:42,447
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

411
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:49,054
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, time stands still  ♫

412
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:51,840
Meng Meng.

413
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,120
I hope that every moment of your future

414
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,840
will bring more happiness than anything you've experienced in the past.

415
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,350
I hope that every moment of your future

416
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,980
will be more romantic than you ever expected.

417
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,410
And, whatever was in the past,

418
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,770
I'll always be standing shoulder to shoulder with you

419
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,920
now and in the future.

420
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,310
We'll continue to shoulder

421
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,800
changes as life's surprises.

422
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,320
Just like we once agreed that

423
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,800
only my number would be saved in this phone.

424
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,120
Now I give this to you.

425
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,430
No matter when you call me,

426
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,270
I'll always be there.

427
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:30,014
♫  I want to kiss you goodnight every day  ♫

428
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:42,575
♫  You have short tousled hair  ♫

429
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:45,175
You come, welcome.

430
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:47,800
I am so happy.

431
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,730
You are welcome.

432
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,376
Here are my two cents as a gift to you.

433
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,080
You can't wear high heels

434
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,280
because you are afraid of falling and being embarrassed.

435
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,960
As long as you aren't afraid of being embarrassed,

436
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,980
you won't be afraid of falling.

437
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,300
You might be flat-footed,

438
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,940
but today you're in high heels and still managed to get the bouquet.

439
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:14,162
♫  I love your companionship every day  ♫

440
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:17,162
♫  A simple tea and meal  ♫

441
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:21,385
♫  All I wish for is to kiss you goodnight  ♫

442
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:26,152
♫  Year after year and forever in this lifetime  ♫

443
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,852
♫  From dawn till dusks, through odds and ends  ♫

444
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:33,317
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

445
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:37,880
♫  I want to kiss you and say goodnight to you ♫

446
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,032
- Grandma.
- All right.

447
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:40,952
Hao Hao.

448
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:43,080
Meng Meng is going to take wedding leave now.

449
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,072
You seem short-handed.

450
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:49,128
Why don't you ask her to come back?

451
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,160
What are you doing here at someone else's wedding?

452
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,560
What am I doing?

453
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,100
Thanks to my foresight, I added Yu Hao's uncle as my WeChat friend at the KTV.

454
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,380
Thanks to me stalking the account every day,

455
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,480
I found out that your beloved and mine

456
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,560
will be bridesmaid and bestman today.

457
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,128
So do you think I dragged you here for nothing?

458
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,856
Bridesmaids and bestmen can fall for each other easily.

459
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:25,840
Keep a close eye on them.

460
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,561
It's all your fault. We would have gotten here earlier

461
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:33,960
if you hadn't walked so slow.

462
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,920
If I'd got here in time, I could've caught that bouquet.

463
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,081
Can such a breathtaking moment happen again?

464
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:40,180
Can it happen again?

465
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,852
It was just a bouquet.

466
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:44,160
Just a bouquet?

467
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,472
It was a bouquet held by a bride.

468
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:49,620
Don't you know what that means? Are you stupid?

469
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,440
The girl who catches it could get married next, right?

470
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
But you don't know with whom anyway.

471
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,880
That's a sense of destiny.

472
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,180
Look at the photo.

473
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,240
A sense of destiny.

474
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,200
It's just a coincidence.

475
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,616
Coincidence?

476
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,560
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

477
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,616
Look how she was flirting with my Hao Hao.

478
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,720
Look!

479
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,860
Look how calculated Su Kelan is!

480
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,760
Wh-Who is calculated?

481
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,180
How can you say that?

482
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,388
Look at her shoes.

483
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:30,720
My Hao Hao bought her the shoes on the day of the competition

484
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,600
outside the KTV.

485
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,048
She's wearing them on purpose.

486
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,400
You are thinking too much.

487
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,720
I… Wait for me.

488
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,120
Between us, who understands women better? You or me?

489
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,980
Aren't you worried? Hurry up.

490
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,740
What are you doing?

491
00:34:52,372 --> 00:34:55,900
Go ahead. Don't be a coward. Go.

492
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,060
H-H-Hold on. Wait a sec.

493
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,900
Men tend to be hot-headed.

494
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,920
What if Su Kelan uses you to agitate my Hao Hao's jealous if you show up suddenly?

495
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
See, I told you. The shoes.

496
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,640
She's wearing them on purpose.

497
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,540
How calculated!

498
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,820
I… I have flat feet.

499
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,532
I don't normally wear high heels.

500
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,440
But today, as a bridesmaid, I have to.

501
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,740
And it's the only pair I have.

502
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,780
Did I

503
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,652
ask you something?

504
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,480
Su Kelan.

505
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,320
Is it work related?

506
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,448
Then you should go ahead.

507
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:30,264
You must've taken a lot of time out of work to be the best man today.

508
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,220
Well…

509
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,680
Have you decided on the theme for the upcoming episodes?

510
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,232
President Yu, did you put your work aside just to ask me this?

511
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,460
Taking part in the program is also part of my job.

512
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,080
Shouldn't you have your PR department communicate with the crew about the details?

513
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,680
You are in charge of planning.

514
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,960
You are responsible for the guests' schedules and the relevant arrangements.

515
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
It's just simple communication, why bother running it by the PR department of “What to Eat Next”?

516
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,500
Don't you think that would be inefficient?

517
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,900
Besides,

518
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,600
it's the PR Director's wedding day.

519
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,944
Are you sure you want to give the bride more workload?

520
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,340
If you want to talk about efficiently,

521
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,220
you should talk to the director directly.

522
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,260
Wouldn't that be more efficient? Why are you asking me?

523
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,980
Because you are right here.

524
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
If I talk to the director, I'll have to call him,

525
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,220
which is totally unnecessary.

526
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,760
But that's not my scope of work.

527
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
Why do I have to go above and beyond?

528
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,260
I don't mind paying you the overtime for your extra responsibility.

529
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,960
Or…

530
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,840
Or you can resign from the crew

531
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,100
and return to "What to Eat Next" to assist me with my work.

532
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,320
I asked you what the upcoming theme is

533
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,800
because

534
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,348
you were supposed to teach me how to cook the dishes according to the theme.

535
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,200
And I want you to teach me tomorrow.

536
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,700
President Yu, let's make it clear.

537
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,360
I already resigned from your company.

538
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,428
Please find another cook to be your teacher.

539
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:42,028
Your salary must have taken a cut after you left "What to Eat Next."

540
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,916
Your resignation might have ended your employment contract with "What to Eat Next"

541
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:54,332
but teaching me how to cook

542
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,820
is an agreement between you and me.

543
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,760
If you refuse to honor the agreement,

544
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,750
I highly suggest you go over our contract again,

545
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,150
where it clearly states how much

546
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,660
you need to compensate.

547
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,780
Honor the agreement

548
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,700
or pay the compensation.

549
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,950
I think you're a rational person,

550
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:32,180
you won't let your emotions stand in the way of making the right choice.

551
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,780
Right?

552
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,580
So what's the theme of the upcoming episode?

553
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,000
Or do you want to tell me tomorrow?

554
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,212
What… What are you doing?

555
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,020
The theme is "How to get rid of someone who harasses you."

556
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,520
Director Jin?

557
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,580
What do you think you are doing?

558
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,340
Speaking of harassment,

559
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,552
I didn't expect an uninvited person would show up at the wedding.

560
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:03,849
It's a theme that can be definitely looked into.

561
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,740
Then I'll let you figure out what to cook for the theme of dealing with harassment.

562
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,520
See you tomorrow.

563
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,060
As I expected, he's agitated.

564
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,196
President Yu, you don't have to worry about the program.

565
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,980
The last few episodes were all shot indoors, and it's getting old.

566
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,080
I want to take the audience's advice

567
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,040
and go to the suburb for three days and two nights to make an episode featuring country life.

568
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,796
You are a busy man.

569
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,076
Yet the signals are bad in the suburb.

570
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:36,700
I don't want to interrupt your daily work.

571
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,660
So, President Yu, you don't have to attend this time.

572
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,748
Shooting outdoors for three days and two nights?

573
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm the sponsor. How come no one informed me?

574
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,060
I won't approve it.

575
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,640
Since when did the theme of the program have to be approved by the sponsor?

576
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,220
Don't you need more money for outdoors shooting?

577
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,013
Shouldn't you run it by me first when money is involved?

578
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:56,180
Don't worry.

579
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,100
I found another sponsor.

580
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,740
According to the contract, looking for other sponsors also needs my approval.

581
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,660
The party doesn't have any conditions, it's just financial support

582
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,524
so I don't need your approval.

583
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,840
Sponsor the program for nothing? Is he stupid?

584
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,060
Who cares as long as he pays?

585
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,620
Could it be you have a problem with money, President Yu?

586
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,720
If there's nothing else,

587
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,080
Kelan,

588
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,921
let's go back to the office and talk about the details of the episode.

589
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,561
Okay.

590
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:35,516
Su Kelan can't be a part of the filming this time.

591
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,480
She's my employee.

592
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,845
Since when is it your place to decide her schedule.

593
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,040
Her mother is in poor health.

594
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,380
She has to go home on time every day to take care of her.

595
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,340
She can't even work late, let alone go on a business trip

596
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,992
for three days and two nights.

597
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:58,413
It looks like you know nothing about your employee's family situation.

598
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,440
Kelan.

599
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,660
- Mom.
- It's okay. You can go.

600
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,000
Mom.

601
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,360
Director Jin already told me about these arrangements.

602
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,512
I'll be fine.

603
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,940
Go ahead and make plans with Director Jin.

604
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,600
I'll wait for dinner for you at home this evening.

605
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,296
Let's go, Kelan.

606
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,520
All right.

607
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,020
Jin Xuan,

608
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,060
I'll take part in this episode, too.

609
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,140
What's up?

610
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,220
President Yu is going on a three-day business trip.

611
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,860
He'll be back soon, and he's going to meet with all the departments to assign work for us.

612
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,580
He's suddenly going on a three-day business trip?

613
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,480
Shanghai? Beijing?

614
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,760
To meet investors?

615
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,800
- Out to the countryside to record a program.
- What?

616
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,420
Yu Hao is such a workaholic, but he's not going to work?

617
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,776
He's going to Tianxing Temple for three days.

618
00:43:27,776 --> 00:43:29,940
He's going to be filming the program.

619
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,780
Kelan is something else!

620
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,500
The director she's working for came looking for her at the wedding.

621
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
It seems like Kelan's mother likes that director a lot.

622
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,700
This is...

623
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,520
Has he been provoked into fighting for her?

624
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
We're planning to go public soon,

625
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,416
but we still lack a vice-president who's experienced with going public for the first time.

626
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,540
During these next three days, have the HR department get prepared.

627
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,120
Arrange for interviews after these next three days.

628
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,060
As for the PR Department, Han Meng is on her honeymoon.

629
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,680
Yao Qian, you can come directly to me if there's anything urgent.

630
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,680
President Yu, the crew just called and told us there will be a group activity this time.

631
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,940
The filming will be nonstop.

632
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,841
They're worried that it will affect your work, so they kept asking me

633
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,941
if you're sure you want to go?

634
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,320
Yes, that's right.

635
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,300
Please confirm this with the participants. We apologize for this last-minute notice.

636
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,120
Yes, we'd like to thank them for their cooperation.

637
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,164
All right, thank you.

638
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:39,780
Director, "What To Eat Next" has confirmed that

639
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,500
Yu Hao is going.

640
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,840
♫  Experiencing all the heartache  ♫

641
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,610
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like you're stranded  ♫

642
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,520
♫  When I see my future self,  ♫

643
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,090
♫  Only then can I understand why I'm moving forward  ♫

644
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,810
♫  Still be as stubborn as I've always been  ♫

645
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,940
♫  This world of fireworks, there are unexpected changes  ♫

646
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,870
♫  Being reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

647
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,420
♫  Stop and look up to see if we're moving forward together  ♫

648
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,720
Mom, let's eat.

649
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,160
Have you taken your shot yet?

650
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,040
I forgot.

651
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
Are you upset?

652
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,744
Is it because I suddenly told you to go film that program?

653
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,100
Mom, why were you so impulsive?

654
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,340
You know that if I'm not here to remind you, you always forget to take your shot.

655
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,192
What will I do if I'm not here and anything happens to you?

656
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,880
If you are not around, I'll be more careful to remember it.

657
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,800
I don't want to see you always stuck at home because of me.

658
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,340
I don't mind staying with you.

659
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,084
But I do mind.

660
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:37,552
I'll feel like I'm a burden to you.

661
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,780
I know you worry and care about me.

662
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,060
But if you act like this, it will really make me feel I'm a useless patient.

663
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,884
So you should relax.

664
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:53,200
Nonsense.

665
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,760
You're just trying to play a matchmaker.

666
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,576
Why do you have to be so straightforward?

667
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,460
Mom, tomorrow is your birthday.

668
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,208
Why do you have to make me go?

669
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:16,040
Your crew will all be going to the Tianxing Temple tomorrow, right?

670
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,740
Yes.

671
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,284
Do you remember?

672
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,940
Did I use to always go there on my birthday?

673
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,540
I remember.

674
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,930
That's where I first met your father.

675
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,340
Look.

676
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,844
When you were little, we used to spend some time there.

677
00:47:40,844 --> 00:47:42,820
Remember?

678
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,440
There are even pictures of you.

679
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,240
Look.

680
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,212
We took you there

681
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:52,876
quite often when you were little.

682
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,380
Kelan,

683
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,900
since my health isn't good,

684
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,540
I hope

685
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,696
you can go there again on my behalf.

686
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,240
Mom,

687
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,000
you forget things easily.

688
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,740
Remember to take the shot on time, no more and no less.

689
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,260
I'll order takeout for you for the next couple of days.

690
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,840
Wait for my call.

691
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,260
I'll do a video call with you and watch you take the shot.

692
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,560
Can we do that?

693
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,240
All right.

694
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,532
I'll sort the medicine for you.

695
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,820
When you take the medicine, pay attention to the date.

696
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,980
Don't get it wrong.

697
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,040
Remember to take a picture and show it to me before you take it.

698
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,080
Don't take any medicine until I've confirmed it's the right one.

699
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,140
By the way, I'll put away the fruits in the fridge.

700
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,036
Don't eat them.

701
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,040
Same for the cake.

702
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,220
Don't take advantage of my not being around and eat any cake.

703
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,976
Mom, I'm late.

704
00:49:01,976 --> 00:49:03,796
I have to go now.

705
00:49:03,796 --> 00:49:06,100
Eat this egg after the second class in the morning.

706
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,600
Eat the apple in the afternoon.

707
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,840
Got it?

708
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,920
Stop nagging.

709
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,504
She's not a baby anymore.

710
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,324
Don't drink colas.

711
00:49:15,324 --> 00:49:18,941
It's too sweet. You don't want to get diabetes like me.

712
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,661
Always in such a hurry. It's the same every morning.

713
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,140
Mom, I'll put the medicine in…

714
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,836
Mom, did you hear what I was just saying?

715
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:43,900
I heard you.

716
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,752
I'm just thinking.

717
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:52,260
I wonder what lucky guy

718
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,640
will be good enough to marry such a good daughter as you are.

719
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,840
Mom.

720
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,280
Mom, we're setting off. We are on our way there.

721
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,040
I'll have a video call with you tonight to celebrate your birthday.

722
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,320
Focus on your work. Don't get distracted.

723
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,680
Gavin?

724
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,720
The VP of "Fresh Fruit"?

725
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,540
Recruit him. Yang Zhen mentioned him to me before.

726
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,420
I'll meet him after I'm back.

727
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,608
Okay, see you.

728
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,880
What's your plan exactly?

729
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,660
Go away.

730
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,996
Is everything ready?

731
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:22,916
Contact me directly. Don't let the others hear you.

732
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,728
If the others find out, the surprise will be ruined.

733
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,680
An Jie.

734
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,544
Is there something going on with Presdient Yu?

735
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,580
He left suddenly for a three-day shooting without taking any employee with him.

736
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,168
Mom, don't worry about Yu Hao.

737
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:02,960
He even followed her to the countryside to shoot the program. He must be determined this time.

738
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,260
We haven't been to the countryside for years.

739
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,160
Same here.

740
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,380
Just consider it a spring excursion.

741
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,760
Let's have fun.

742
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,680
We are almost there. Get ready to get off.

743
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,780
All right.

744
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,200
[Film Crew]

745
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,120
We are finally here.

746
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,456
Here, let me help you.

747
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,630
This way.

748
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,840
- What do you want?
- Give you one last chance to decide if you are really going to attend the show.

749
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,610
I told you many times. Don't make me say it again.

750
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,868
I just released

751
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:49,720
- the trailer for this episode.
- Trailer?

752
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,125
I didn't know there was a trailer, either.

753
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,920
The crew just released the trailer.

754
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,060
How come we weren't notified?

755
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,180
For this episode, the crew will go to the countryside.

756
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,720
And for the first time ever,

757
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,708
instead of the round-table discussion format, we will change it to a competition.

758
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,316
They didn't even notify us of the change of program format.

759
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,820
In this episode,

760
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,660
each guest will cook one dish, and the local folks will vote on

761
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,940
the dishes and decide who's the winner.

762
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:32,160
The most anticipated part is that President Yu is full of confidence and determined to be the winner.

763
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,848
Otherwise, he'll withdraw from the program forever.

764
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,080
When did I agree to change the program format? And when did I say I'd withdraw from the program?

765
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,372
You can make a statement.

766
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:48,900
But the audience would think that you are scared and afraid to compete.

767
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,400
The filming condition is tough here.

768
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,660
Sorry, you have to share the room with Li Xuan.

769
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:21,260
But don't worry. I know Li Xuan very well.

770
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,100
He's quite clean. He doesn't have any bad habits...

771
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
except that he snores.

772
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,640
Do you have earplugs?

773
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,040
Will you film us even when we sleep?

774
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,960
Since it's a competition, we must make sure it's fair.

775
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,020
You once cheated before so we have to rely on regulations

776
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,592
and tools to make sure you won't break any rules.

777
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,340
You'll be video-taped every step of the way.

778
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,760
You can't violate the rules and seek help, or have someone else draft out a speech for you.

779
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
If the show doesn't come out right, it may hurt your image.

780
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,432
So you'd better reconsider if you want to join this time.

781
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:24,500
I've confirmed my participation. I don't want to repeat my words three times.

782
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,664
Has the sheet been cleaned?

783
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:36,340
President Yu, don't be so hard on yourself.

784
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,980
Just let me know if you can't adapt.

785
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,580
We'll proceed with the filming anyway, with or without you.

786
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,920
It's not hard at all.

787
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,880
- Where's the bathroom?
- I'm showing you the way right now.

788
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,220
It's a temporary bathroom for the crew. Sorry for the mess.

789
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,700
Don't worry. There's no camera in the bathroom.

790
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,920
Is this the only bathroom here?

791
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,520
Holy…

792
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,720
What's wrong with you?

793
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,052
Psycho.

794
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,420
Afraid of bugs?

795
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,760
Isn't that interesting?

796
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,724
Bossy and dominating as he is, he's actually

797
00:56:47,724 --> 00:56:49,480
afraid of bugs.

798
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,020
My mom always compared me with him when we were little, and it made me really upset.

799
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,580
So I put all kinds of bugs under his blanket when he was asleep,

800
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,180
including a bat.

801
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,080
That's so disgusting.

802
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,620
I was just a child back then.

803
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,160
Kelan, think about it.

804
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,880
With such a bad trauma, he still decided to go to the countryside

805
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,440
where you are exposed to mosquitos everywhere.

806
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,200
Apparently, he truly cares about you.

807
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,196
By the way, Jin Xuan is the one who made the trailer

808
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:20,604
on purpose to challenge Yu Hao, isn't he?

809
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,880
Knowing Yu Hao's personality, he could've sued him for it,

810
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,040
but he didn't say anything this time, and he wouldn't leave whatsoever.

811
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,960
For whom do you think he's doing this?

812
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,600
I thought you two would go on a honeymoon road trip.

813
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,640
Will you stop worrying about the others?

814
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:39,820
It's about my nephew and my bestie. How could you be others to me?

815
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:45,320
If you know I worry about you, you should be more proactive and make me less worried.

816
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,360
Fine. I need to go now. Give me some time to find bug spray.

817
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,920
Okay, go ahead.

818
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,560
That's it? What did she say about my nephew?

819
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,180
As soon as she learned he's afraid of bugs, she hung up on me and went to find bug spray for him.

820
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,300
So what does that tell you?

821
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,240
Say, what's wrong with Yu Hao?

822
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,520
He suddenly threw himself at me. So gross!

823
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,700
Jin Xuan, why did you do that?

824
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,000
Don't touch me. Men and women should keep a distance. Don't you know that?

825
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,980
Why did you release the trailer without discussing it with me? You said Yu Hao would leave if he can't be the winner.

826
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,124
If he leaves, then what's the point of me staying in this show?

827
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:39,120
I don't see any point or how it benefits you even if he stays.

828
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,720
- I…
- Stop. I'm very busy.

829
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,860
Peng Xiao, let's go location scouting.

830
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,980
What a lousy partner!

831
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,632
Sister, what's wrong?

832
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,200
I've got two plans. Plan A is to help Yu Hao be the winner so he can stay in this show.

833
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,136
Plan B is to seize this chance and win Hao Hao over.

834
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,784
I can go find Yu Hao.

835
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,140
I can approach him with the excuse of helping him,

836
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,696
and then he will be mine!

837
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,920
Where are you right now?

838
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,840
What's up? I heard there are cameras everywhere.

839
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,080
If you meet me, aren't you afraid that you'd be caught cheating?

840
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,540
There's no camera in the bathroom.

841
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,976
Find a time and sneak out tonight to teach me how to cook.

842
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:04,820
So you are hiding in the bathroom, a camera blindspot, and breaking the rules by seeking my help?

843
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,200
In addition, even if we can sneak out from the bathroom,

844
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,660
there's no place for teaching anyway.

845
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,700
We can borrow a kitchen from a villager.

846
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,470
It looks like you seem less competent

847
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:22,750
after you left "What to Eat Next."

848
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,760
Won't it take extra time for me to find a kitchen?

849
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,660
I'll pay you more teaching fee.

850
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,040
- Then you'll have to pay three times as much for the extra time.
- All right.

851
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,400
- And the kitchen fee.
- I'll reimburse you.

852
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,940
I have no invoice so I'll name a number.

853
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,660
Fine, fine. No problem.

854
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,820
[Yu Hao transferred ¥10,000 to your account]

855
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,980
Start working immediately, or I'll deduct your payment.

856
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,520
President Yu, you are not bad at cooking anymore.

857
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,680
Do you need to learn more?

858
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,360
Don't you think it's a waste of time?

859
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,660
I want to be the winner.

860
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,380
Why do you have to be the winner?

861
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,280
That trailer is merely for marketing hype.

862
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,920
You are the main sponsor. If you don't approve it,

863
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,240
it doesn't mean anything.

864
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,260
I don't want to lose in front of Jin Xuan.

865
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,108
One more word of nonsense, I'll cut your payment in half.

866
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,310
[¥10,000]

867
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,600
- Light the shredded paper and then…
- Can you do it or not? Are you doing it right?

868
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,900
Director, it's… It's a little difficult.

869
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,196
Step aside. Give it to me.

870
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,360
Let me do it. You are so useless.

871
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,980
Sister Bi, I'm impressed. Did you know how to do this?

872
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,480
Done.

873
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh, the smoke.

874
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,640
President Yu, why don't you give it a try?

875
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,001
- It's me.
- You scared me.

876
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:43,440
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

877
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,220
There are so many mosquitos here.

878
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,152
Why didn't you reply to me?

879
01:03:47,152 --> 01:03:49,172
My phone is dead.

880
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,230
Here.

881
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,580
Thank you.

882
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,500
So... you've been waiting for me here?

883
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,000
Or what? You said you'd teach me how to cook tonight.

884
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,500
My phone is dead so I couldn't reach you.

885
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,872
I could only wait here for you after they all left.

886
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,700
By the way,

887
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,740
let's use this for now. I've adjusted the spectrum.

888
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,220
Why didn't you find an excuse to come to see me? What are you afraid of?

889
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,020
Kelan.

890
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,900
Kelan.

891
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,520
Kelan.

892
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,260
Kelan.

893
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,720
Kelan!

894
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,820
Where did she go?

895
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,760
I'll be back.

896
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,300
President Yu,

897
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,588
where should we go for the class?

898
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,600
Oh, right.

899
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,980
Let's go.

900
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,560
My dear Hao Hao, I'll help you get first place.

901
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,652
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

902
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,376
I'm so nervous.

903
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,360
Auntie. Auntie!

904
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,920
Kelan, here you are. I've been waiting for you guys.

905
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,224
Long time no see.

906
01:06:25,224 --> 01:06:28,840
Is this your boyfriend? He's so handsome.

907
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,881
You know what? He looks a little bit like my son-in-law.

908
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:32,980
No.

909
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:38,000
He's the friend I told you whom I'd bring to cook together.

910
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,520
Ma'am, sorry for the trouble.

911
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,524
No trouble at all. Please come in.

912
01:06:42,524 --> 01:06:44,840
Kelan called me yesterday that she wanted

913
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,712
to borrow my kitchen to cook.

914
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,220
- But this morning you just…
- The price wasn't settled yet.

915
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,000
I'm so glad you are here to keep me company.

916
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,310
You don't have to pay. I said I didn't want the money, but she insisted on paying.

917
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,520
Remember, I get to name the price.

918
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,252
Come on, have some water.

919
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,648
Have some water.

920
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:13,120
And later, you can cook here.

921
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,120
I put all the ingredients there for you.

922
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,780
I just made the canola oil this year. It's very fresh.

923
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,260
If you need anything else, just let me know.

924
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,720
Auntie,

925
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,820
this is…

926
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,480
Look, I'm so excited that I forgot to tell you. Don't be afraid.

927
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,060
My husband has been dead for years.

928
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,480
I prepared this

929
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,572
for myself.

930
01:07:35,572 --> 01:07:39,080
Now that I'm old, I always suffer from body aches here and there.

931
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,564
One day my time will come.

932
01:07:41,564 --> 01:07:47,008
Since my husband died early, I could make his funeral arrangements.

933
01:07:47,008 --> 01:07:49,092
When I'm gone,

934
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:52,280
I don't want to trouble my daughter and my son-in-law.

935
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,700
They are both out of town and busy with work, and they need to take care of their child.

936
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,980
They don't even have time to come back during Spring Festival.

937
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:04,420
Since I can still take care of myself, I'll just make the arrangement in advance.

938
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:08,524
That way, I'll have less things to worry about.

939
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,960
Look, why am I talking to you about this?

940
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,061
Now, hurry. Go ahead and start cooking. I'll prepare the fish outside.

941
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:18,632
Let me know if you need anything.

942
01:08:18,632 --> 01:08:20,240
Auntie,

943
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,000
could you teach me how to start the fire?

944
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,620
Sure, sure. Come here. Come inside.

945
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:55,800
''I Love Your Companionship'' by Jason Hong

946
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:02,905
♫  Your long hair is softly scattered as you're curled up lazily on the sofa  ♫

947
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:10,305
♫  A milky blossom in coffee, melting gently in the palm of your hand  ♫

948
01:09:10,305 --> 01:09:17,364
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, the kitchen lit up with light  ♫

949
01:09:17,364 --> 01:09:23,657
♫  Day by day, you're getting used to the warmth of the smoke from the fireplace  ♫

950
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,072
♫  You have short tousled hair  ♫

951
01:09:29,072 --> 01:09:32,492
♫  You're lightly plucking the guitar  ♫

952
01:09:32,492 --> 01:09:39,905
♫  You're the warmth of a sweater being exposed to the sun, comforting and reassuring  ♫

953
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:46,772
♫  As the sky slowly darkens, time stands still  ♫

954
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:52,614
♫ This is the romance you like ♫

955
01:09:53,648 --> 01:10:01,025
♫  I love your companionship every day  ♫

956
01:10:01,025 --> 01:10:04,411
♫  A simple tea and meal  ♫

957
01:10:04,411 --> 01:10:08,511
♫  All I wish for is to kiss you goodnight  ♫

958
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:13,339
♫  Year after year and forever in this lifetime  ♫

959
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:17,094
♫  From dawn till dusk, through odds and ends  ♫

960
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:20,385
♫  I want to dine with you every day  ♫

961
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:27,890
♫  I want to kiss you and say goodnight to you every day  ♫
