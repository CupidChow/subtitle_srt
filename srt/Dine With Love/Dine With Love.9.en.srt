00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,840
Did you rent this?

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,100
Yes.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,780
When did you rent it?

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,480
The day before yesterday.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,360
The day before yesterday?

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,300
The day before yesterday...

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,120
It seems like I didn't pay you for the materials, right?

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,500
Right.

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,020
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

10
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,820
Add some oil.

11
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,280
A little more.

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
- Is it all just oil?
- Yes.

13
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,460
Put that in.

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,460
Now we wait.

[Braised Dongpo pork knuckle: A beautiful night]

17
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,540
The pork knuckle tastes greasy, and it's hard to cook.

18
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,400
Why not teach me something else?

19
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,610
This dish is meaningful.

20
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,500
Braised Dongpo pork knuckle was cooked by Wang Fu for Su Dongpo.

21
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,540
It was charred by accident.

22
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,420
Then she used spices to cover up the charred taste.

23
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,760
And unexpectedly, it became a delicacy.

24
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,420
After Wang Fu passed away, Su Dongpo couldn't get her out of his mind,

25
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,900
but he still happily married his cousin Wang Runzhi

26
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,120
and wrote the poem "Love of Butterfly" for her.

27
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,460
After Wang Runzhi's death,

28
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,360
he married a servant that he'd bought.

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,860
And he wrote the poem "Mourning Zhaoyun" for her.

30
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,760
The gifted scholar's love was deep but also wide.

31
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,300
How long will it take to steam this?

32
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,200
I came to get some salt.

33
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,440
I'll take a look at this.

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,080
While you're steaming this, you can't be in too much of a hurry.

35
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,760
Here, let me take a look.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,660
When you're steaming meat,

37
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,520
the heat can't be too high.

38
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,560
If it is, the meat can become mushy.

39
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
But if the heat is low,

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,300
the steam doesn't penetrate fully and it won't have much taste.

41
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,180
Young man,

42
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,940
cooking this dish well depends on the temperature.

43
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,460
Add firewood at the right time.

44
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,220
When it's time to lower the temperature, take some firewood out.

45
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,860
Do you know why we call men in Sichuan "soft ears"?

46
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,860
"Soft ears" means when Sichuan men should loosen up, they need to loosen up.

47
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,780
Kelan, do you think so?

48
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,540
All right, you guys carry on.

49
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm going to go marinate my fish.

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm going to marinate my fish, you guys carry on.

51
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,180
Here. Put it here.

52
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,840
Okay, okay. Have a seat. Sit down.

53
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,900
I'll try it first.

54
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,480
Delicious. Solid.

55
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,160
You cook just as well as your father.

56
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,260
You...

57
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,420
already know each other?

58
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,700
What else?

59
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,360
How else would I find someone willing to lend us the kitchen?

60
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,420
When I met Kelan's parents,

61
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,780
Kelan wasn't even born yet.

62
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,860
From what my mom said,

63
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,360
she once went to visit some relatives and got lost.

64
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,760
Then she met my dad, a volunteer teacher here.

65
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,460
My dad was trying to help her out.

66
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,460
But then the two of them got lost because of my mom's mistaken directions.

67
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,660
Later,

68
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,460
the two of them were walking by the river.

69
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,140
They...

70
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,180
walked the whole day until they were exhausted.

71
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,960
When they were too tired to move on, a fishing boat came appeared on the river.

72
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,880
Hey! Comrade!

73
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,180
My parents stepped on board

74
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,540
and got to Auntie Zhao's home.

75
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,720
They sat around this very courtyard and had fresh baked fish and potatoes.

76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,374
My mom said my dad was probably starving

77
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:56,460
and found the food so delicious. He nearly ate the whole thing all by himself.

78
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,320
Afterward,

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,280
my dad was so embarrassed. He came the next day

80
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,260
and cooked braised Dongpo pork knuckle for them.

81
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,860
And later he won your mother's heart.

82
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,400
In the past,

83
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,700
they came to see me every year.

84
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,660
After you were born, they would bring you with them.

85
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,180
But later they stopped coming because they were so busy at work.

86
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,102
They haven't come for a long time.

87
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,880
Seven years.

88
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
What? Has it been seven years?

89
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,670
Yes.

90
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,040
Seven years passed in a flash.

91
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:50,266
Seven years have flown by so fast.

92
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Everyone is busy.

93
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,760
But it's good to be busy.

94
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,000
Here. Here you are.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,080
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Here you are.

96
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,560
- You have some, too.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,360
- You have some, too.
- Okay.

98
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,880
Moths like light. I'll take that.

99
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,420
The braised Dongpo pork knuckle was delicious.

100
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,960
Yes.

101
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,280
When did you decide to teach me that dish?

102
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,820
Since you decided on it a while ago,

103
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,110
this morning, why did you pretend that you hadn't decided yet?

104
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,910
Because I wanted

105
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,730
to check if you still needed me

106
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,190
to teach you cooking.

107
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,820
I do.

108
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,120
That portable gas stove and the pots you originally brought to my house...

109
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,860
I originally stored them all away.

110
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,620
But later, I took them out again.

111
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,260
It's just that

112
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,860
I can't cook as well as you.

113
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,260
Do you just need the food I cook?

114
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,240
Of course not.

115
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,480
What else do you need from me then?

116
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,040
I...

117
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,020
I...

118
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm afraid of insects.

119
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,200
I know, I can tell.

120
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,870
But you still decided to come and record the program.

121
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,820
It's not just my fear of insects.

122
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,930
Right now, there are still a lot of things

123
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,920
that I haven't completely let go of yet.

124
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,560
Treasuring old friendships and valuing love

125
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,160
are like two sides of a coin.

126
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm willing to

127
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,820
wait for the coin to hit the ground.

128
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,540
When you put a lid on the past,

129
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,280
the love will remain.

130
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,660
You...

131
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
What are you doing?

132
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,620
Don't move.

133
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,680
There are bats.

134
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,900
You're afraid of insects, afraid of bats.

135
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,040
But I'm not afraid.

You're back.

I've been looking for you for a long time.

Director Jin, what do you need me for?

164
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,940
A very important meeting.

165
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,740
Mom?

166
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,340
Mom!

167
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,500
Why are you here?

168
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,890
It's the birthday gift Director Jin prepared for me.

169
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,330
What?

170
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,920
He asked me what I wanted for my birthday.

171
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,220
I said...

172
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,660
I wanted to see your happy face.

173

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,940
Happy birthday!

185
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,720
- Thank you, everyone.
- Happy birthday!

186
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,660
Thank you, everyone.

187
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,360
[Happy Birthday!]

188
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,060
- Good Night!
 - Good night.

189
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,960
- See you tomorrow.
- Happy birthday, Auntie.

190
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,120
Thank you! Thank you!

191
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,280
Director Jin is really thoughtful.

192
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm going to sleep. Good night!

193
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
Good night.

194
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,760
The portrait is really nicely done.

195
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
He painted it without us in front of him.

196
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,620
And it's not the same as any of our photos.

197
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,300
You can see that you're in his heart.

198
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,060
And you as well.

199
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,740
He likes you so much that he can even paint me.
 (T/N: Lit: love for a person extends even to the crows on their roof)

200
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,140
His feelings are deep.

201
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,460
Mom,

202
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,020
when did you and Director Jin plan this?

203
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,300
Did you ask him to do this?

204
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,940
Not at all.

205
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,880
He's the one who came to me.

206
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,220
What?

207
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,450
On the night you decided to visit Tianxing Temple.

208
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,420
Auntie.

209
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,020
Director Jin?

210
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,990
Hey...

211
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,680
Are you here to see Kelan?

212
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,000
Auntie,

213
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
isn't it your birthday tomorrow?

214
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,580
How do you know?

215
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,100
There are posts on your Weibo account of noodles or cakes every time on that day.

216
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,300
How thoughtful you are.

217
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,400
Then maybe I should tell Kelan not to go tomorrow.

218
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,380
She surely must want to stay with you.

219
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,400
But aren't your arrangements for a tour of Tianxing Temple for Kelan?

220
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,900
Well, this time...

221
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,180
this sudden decision to film on location

222
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,400
was really on impulse.

223
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,960
Because I wanted to drive away Yu Hao

224
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,330
and spend some time with Kelan alone.

225
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,860
But what Yu Hao said is right.

226
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,300
You also need to spend time with Kelan.

227
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,520
Auntie.

228
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,160
Actually, I...

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,900
I do indeed like Kelan.

230
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,140
I also hope to take advantage of this time

231
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,360
to confess my love to Kelan.

232
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,960
But...

233
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,700
I don't want to see Kelan unhappy because of my selfishness.

234
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,960
So I am coming here to confirm the day of your birthday.

235
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,560
Since it's confirmed,

236
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,260
I'm going to cancel the event and apologize

237
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
to Kelan.

238
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,580
Originally,

239
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,040
I hoped Kelan could go to Tianxing Temple.

240
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,200
Because it's the place where my husband and I met each other.

241
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,780
Then he began to talk about secretly bringing me here.

242
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,990
He was worried about my health

243
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,710
so he specially asked a retired doctor to come with me.

244
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,880
Mom,

245
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,220
you really like Jin Xuan, don't you?

246
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,800
I have my opinions.

247
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,220
But for your life,

248
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,690
you have to decide what you want.

249
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,350
Mom,

250
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,560
sing me a song, please.

251
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,120
But you said I was a terrible singer.

252
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,320
So what? I want to listen.

253
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,180
You're a good singer. Today is my birthday.

254
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Shouldn't you sing for me?

255
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,460
But wasn't your birthday wish to see my happy face.

256
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm happy when you sing a song. Hurry up and sing.

257
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,980
How old are you?

258
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,320
And you still want me to sing for you.

259
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,680
Three years old forever.

260
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,210
Sing.

269
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,280
Good job today.

270
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,140
You even did it without my direction.

271
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,300
Isn't that because you didn't stir up any trouble.

272
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,180
What? Trouble?

273
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,060
I helped you so much and you say I make trouble?

274
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,080
If I hadn't helped you change your appearance, wouldn't people still think you are like a bandit?

275
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,500
If I hadn't asked the kids in the hospital to attract Su Kelan's attention,

276
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,480
would your future mother-in-law have noticed your kindness?

277
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,260
You even got to go to their house for dinner and show off your painting talents.

278
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,220
If I didn't drag you to that wedding, how would you have come up with the idea of this tour?

279
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,813
If you weren't here, how could you celebrate your mother-in-law's birthday and touch Su Kelan's heart? Could you have?

280
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,510
Show me the videos and photos you just took.

281
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,980
- What are you going to do?
- Hurry up.

282
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,910
What am I going to do?

283
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,500
In a little while, you add Mama Su and Su Kelan into a WeChat group and send them the photos.

284
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,420
You've done so many good things, Of course, you have to amplify them.

285
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,960
You managed to draw such a pretty painting,

286
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,060
how come mine was so ugly?

287
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,940
You just sent it out like that?

288
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,040
Don't you need to retouch it first?

289
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,660
Now you know you need to retouch those photos taken with the front camera.

290
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,640
What's the matter?

291
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,200
I think I got bitten by bugs.

292
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,560
It's already late autumn, are there that many bugs?

293
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,820
Do they only bite you?

294
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,320
I was looking for someone outdoor today.

295
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,660
For Yu Hao?

296
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,160
Yes.

297
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,940
I got mosquito bites because of him,

298
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,320
but I couldn't find him.

299
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,280
I don't know where he went.

300
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,200
I remember during the birthday celebration,

301
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,860
he left.

302
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,080
He left?

303
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,880
I'll look for him!

304
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Ask Peng Xiao to go with you.

305
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,500
A girl walking alone at night is not that safe.

306
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,760
Look at my agility, maybe it's dangerous to you.

307
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,030
Good luck!

308
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,360
You're sure to win!

309
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,680
You too. Don't stay here.

310
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,480
Take quick action and get to the next base.

311
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,960
Thank you.

312
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,760
Please don't.

313
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,910
Don't be sad, okay?

314
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,860
Happy birthday.

315
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,260
Su Kelan.

316
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,470
Kelan,

317
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,500
can you go visit Auntie Zhao with me early tomorrow?

318
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,840
Mom, I didn't know you were coming.

319
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,830
Today, I already visited her.

320
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,160
I used her stove to cook

321
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,500
braised Dongpo pork knuckles

322
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,380
with Yu Hao.

323
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,300
During the birthday celebration,

324
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,880
did you notice him leaving the party?

325
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,060
Yes.

326
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,960
For him, birthdays

327
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,040
bring some bad memories.

328
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,380
I'm going to sleep now.

329
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,760
You don't have to stay here.

330
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,800
If you are worried about him, go look for him.

331
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,200
Thank you, Mom.

332
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,880
Don't mention it.

333
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,230
I said before, your life

334
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,660
is up to your own decision.

335
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
Good night.

336
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,720
Director Jin?

337
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,240
Kelan,

338
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,680
I want

339
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
to tell you something.

340
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,100
Director Jin,

341
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,720
thank you so much for my mom's birthday.

342
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,420
That's nothing.

343
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,720
But now

344
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,600
I'm worried about Yu Hao. I want to look for him first.

345
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,220
Can we talk tomorrow?

346
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,840
Thank you.

347
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm sorry. See you.

348
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,720
Yu Hao.

349
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,460
Can you hear me?

350
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,380
Yu Hao, where are you?

351
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,700
Why didn't you answer my messages?

352
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
My phone is dead.

353
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,820
Yu Hao,

354
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,620
where are you?

355
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,700
Reply me as soon as possible.

356
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Don't thank me.

357
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,400
President Yu!

358
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,500
President Yu!

359
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,540
President Yu?

360
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
President Yu!

361
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,840
President Yu!

362
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,020
God, please protect me.

363
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,180
Battery power, please hold on.

364
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,420
President Yu!

365
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,520
President Yu?

366
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,140
Yu Hao?

367
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,120
Yu Hao?

368
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,940
Yu...

369
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,480
Yu Hao?

370
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,920
Yu Hao!

371
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,540
Auntie! Auntie!

372
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,580
Yu Hao!

373
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,660
What's happening?

374
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,020
I don't know.

375
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,720
Auntie Zhao!

376
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
Hello?

377
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,100
Someone fell into the water.

378
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,800
We're on the river by Tianxing Temple.

379
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,240
Hurry up!

380
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,540
Auntie? Auntie!

381
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,040
Auntie!

382
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,040
Auntie!

383
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,040
Auntie?

384
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,700
Auntie!

385
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,020
Auntie!

386
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,380
Auntie!

387
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,500
You rescued her just in time. She's doing fine.

388
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,460
I can't get in touch with her child. Her phone also fell into the river.

389
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,300
Well, give me your number, and I'll call you as soon as I get in touch with her child.

390
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay.

391
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,280
Thank you.

392
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,300
Let her get some rest.

393
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,540
Auntie.

394
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,380
I already called Jiabao.

395
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,140
Let's wait for her to call back, Okay?

396
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,860
What happened?

397
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,460
Why did Auntie Zhao fall into the river?

398
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,380
I don't know.

399
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,340
This is

400
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,400
something I prepared for myself.

401
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
When we're old,

402
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,220
that day will come.

403
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,220
You stay with Auntie Zhao.

404
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,960
I'll prepare something for you to warm you up.

405
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,360
Okay.

406
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
It has been 7 years.

407
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,140
Even if I'm dying,

408
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,300
I'd rather not bother my daughter and son-in-law.

409
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,680
They are busy working everyday.

410
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,640
And they also raising a child.

411
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
They're just so busy.

412
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,340
Auntie,

413
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,840
I've prepared a fish dish for you.

414
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,700
Fish stew with potatoes.

415
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,000
Please help yourself.

416
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,300
Here you are.

417
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,970
Jiabao said

418
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
she couldn't come back.

419
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,400
She promised me she would be back next week.

420
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,780
I marinated a lot of fish

421
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,400
for them to take along.

422
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,250
But now she decided not to visit.

423
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,520
I've been marinating fish for them every year,

424
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,740
and she hasn't been coming every year.

425
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,480
When I was a kid,

426
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,680
my father was so busy with his work

427
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,820
and never came home.

428
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,900
On my eighth birthday,

429
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,040
I was really looking forward to that, he could come home.

430
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,010
He also promised,

431
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,600
he would be home.

432
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,400
But...

433
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,260
Don't be sad, okay?

434
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,540
Happy birthday.

435
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Where's Dad?

436
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,700
Dad is busy with the restaurant

437
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,800
so he'll be back late. He told us to eat first.

438
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,600
He promised me that he'll come back for dinner tonight. He promised me.

439
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,860
Hao Hao,

440
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,200
how about checking your birthday gift first?

441
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,380
You'll love it.

442
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,540
He broke the promise.

443
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,880
I don't want the celebration! I don't want the gift!

444
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,980
Hao Hao.

445
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
Hao Hao?

446
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,940
Hao Hao,

447
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,460
the gift is in your closet.

448
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
You may open it.

449
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,040
Then you...

450
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,780
Then you may take a nap.

451
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,420
When Dad comes back,

452
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,600
we'll celebrate your birthday together, okay?

453
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,220
I didn't know at that time

454
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,340
my mother's depression

455
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,240
was already serious.

456
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,190
I didn't expect that

457
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,160
was my last time talking to my mother.

458
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,060
Mom?

459
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,020
Someone jumped off the building!

460
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,700
What's happening?

461
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,640
Call the police!

462
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't want your daughter to bear regrets like me.

463
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
- Hello?
 - Hello?

464
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,120
Hello, Mom?

465
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,240
Auntie.

466
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,840
Jiabao.

467
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,880
Hello?

468
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,940
Hello. Mom?

469
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,340
Jiabao.

470
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,920
How did you fall into the water?

471
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,020
Are you okay?

472
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,150
Yes.

473
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,020
I'm fine.

474
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,780
I just slipped and fell.

475
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,700
I'm home now.

476
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,540
It scared me to death.

477
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,000
How can you be so careless?

478
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm glad that you're fine.

479
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,860
I'm fine.

480
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,960
I know you are busy.

481
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,860
You don't have to come back. Don't delay your work.

482
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,200
Are you really okay?

483
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,420
Really.

484
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,800
Stop nagging.

485
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,680
Skip it.

486
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,610
I'm going to hang up.

487
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,620
Then I'm not going to be worried.

488
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:33,120
Mom, give the phone to Kelan. I want to thank her for taking care of you.

489
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,700
All right.

490
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,800
Please don't say a word. Please don't say a word.

491
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,780
I was just… acting on impulse.

492
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,140
I'm fine now.

493
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,740
I don't want to bother her.

494
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,820
Hello?

495
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,780
Hello?

496
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,120
Hello? Kelan?

497
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,380
Can you hear me?

498
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,120
Thank you.

499
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,540
My mother must have made a lot of smoked fish. If we don't come back, there will be lots of leftovers.

500
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,280
Take some home.

501
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,710
- Jiabao.
- Yes?

502
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,060
Do you know your mother is very sad?

503
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,260
She told you it doesn't matter,

504
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,920
but actually, it does.

505
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,760
She really misses you guys and wants to see you guys desperately.

506
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,420
But she's afraid of being rejected again and bothered you.

507
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,550
Jiabao,

508
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,520
if today we weren't just around here,

509
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,040
you might have

510
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,690
lost your mother.

511
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,950
Auntie,

512
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,730
if you don't tell her,

513
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,700
Jiabao won't know how sad you are.

514
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,160
Jiabao might think you don't care that much, so she doesn't feel like she needs to come back home.

515
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,200
But if she suddenly found that she'd lost you forever, she would feel great pain and sorrow for her whole life.

516
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,980
Could you bear that?

517
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,820
Mom,

518
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,280
tell me. What's wrong with you?

519
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,950
Jiabao,

520
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
I miss you.

521
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,660
I miss Xiao Bao.

522
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,940
When will you come back?

523
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,900
I want to eat fish with you.

524
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,920
Okay. Mom,

525
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,020
we'll come back tomorrow.

526
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,680
I told you to go with Peng Xiao.

527
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,580
You just wouldn't do it.

528
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,420
You should keep your phone fully charged.

529
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,660
You add to my troubles.

530
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,540
Can you just stop bothering me?

531
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,220
Hurry! Come and save me.

532
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,090

My phone battery is almost dead.

It's so dark. What am I going to do?

Taking it out on a woman. What kind of man is that?

545
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Enough.

546

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,820
That day of my birthday,

554
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,660
I got the gift you left.

555
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,450
But I was so angry, I didn't look at it.

556
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,220
I left a birthday present for you.

557
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,120
Open it.

558
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,020
I like Doraemon

559
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,020
so

560
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,200
I was always hoping to be like Doraemon

561
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,500
and have a closet I could sleep in.

562
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,320
I often wondered...

563
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,380
if back then,

564
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,660
I had opened the closet,

565
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,160
would she have been happier?

566
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,580
Would everything

567
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,860
have been different too?

568
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,620
She wouldn't...

569
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,680
Su Kelan,

570
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,160
I'm sorry.

571
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,800
Thank you

572
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,310
for celebrating my birthday.

573
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,670
That's okay.

574
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,420
I forgive you.

575
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,830
Actually,

576
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,760
that day you quit,

577
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,120
I wanted to tell you to stay.

578
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,240
But I hesitated because of a phone call.

579
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,480
Now I won't let anything stop me.

580
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,880
I want you to come back.

581
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,600
Do you remember

582
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,720
what I've told you at the coffee shop?

583
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,820
You need to think clearly.

584
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,560
Even if I take twenty days off and public opinion fades away,

585
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,560
my affections for you

586
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
won't disappear.

587
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,940
If you have no way of facing me,

588
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,910
then just allow me to resign.

589
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,420
I remember it.

590
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,800
Then,

591
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,900
do you understand

592
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,760
what my coming back

593
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,460
actually means?

594
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,610
I do.

595
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,100
But there's a rule at the company.

596
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,620
Office romances are not allowed.

597
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,040
That's not a rule anymore.

598
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,900
You...

599
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,480
When can you come back to the company?

600
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,140
When will you be able to speak frankly?

601
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,210
When have you spoken frankly?

602
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,750
Su Kelan,

603
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,860
I know...

604
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,520
I'm just an annoying person.

605
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,020
And I don't understand

606
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,540
how to treat others well.

607
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,510
I'm even less sure

608
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,420
that I can give you the kind of life you want.

609
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,310
Even if that's true,

610
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,060
are you still willing to be with me?

611
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,810
♫  The distance is both far and near  ♫

612
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,520
I want to say

613
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:57,000
♫  The odds and losses are uncertain  ♫

614
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,580
that I know that the person who called a taxi for me

615
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,220
after the show that time

616
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,370
was you.

617
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,440
You fired Li Xun and I checked the CCTV.

618
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,050
I know you fired him,

619
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,280
because he went to a blind date.

620
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,460
And that day in the office,

621
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,900
when I was so sad

622
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,560
and accidentally scalded my hand,

623
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,480
Wan Shun showed up with that headgear

624
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,460
and ointment.

625
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,940
I noticed

626
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,760
the leftovers in your office

627
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,200
and that you took away the key to the pantry.

628
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,710
I know that the person who comforted me

629
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,190
was you.

630
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,000
♫  You are so full of life  ♫

631
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,800
Yu Hao.

632
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,780
Do you know something?

633
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,490
You are a much warmer person than you think.

634
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,960
All this time,

635
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,920
I'm a person

636
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,580
with many emotional needs.

637
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,740
I'm not sure if what I need from you

638
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,960
will hinder your career.

639
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,020
Even if so,

640
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,980
are you still willing to be with me?

641
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,260
Of course.

642
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,700
Okay, then.

643
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,340
Then I have a request right now.

644
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,040
Go ahead.

645
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,880
Your love

646
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,300
can only be given to the present

647
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,220
and the future

648
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,100
but not to the past.

649
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,880
Can you be straightforward?

650
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,260
Tomato...

651
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,920
You...

652
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:44,290
♫  To get closer to you  ♫

653
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:49,300
♫  The surging crowd seems to be erased  ♫

654
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,290
What else? Just tell me.

655
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,900
♫  I'm even more convinced  ♫

656
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,080
I want you to talk to me frankly, no implicit sentences.

657
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,830
- No hint from Natsume Soseki's book.
- I like you.

658
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,780
I want to be with you.

659
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,330
Is that frank enough?

660
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,040
Your turn now.

661
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,400
♫  I'll abandon reason and do my best to fight for it  ♫

662
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,880
Yu Hao.

663
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,480
Kelan!

664
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,920
All this time, I dare not express my affections for you.

665
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,900
I was always probing and observing, because I know I have no place in your heart.

666
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,500
Because I'm afraid if I confess and get rejected, we may not even be friends anymore.

667
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,760
But now I'm not afraid, because I have no escape.

668
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,320
I know you love your family and your life.

669
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,280
I do, too. So I can feel what you feel.

670
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,180
I can give you the warm life that Yu Hao can't.

671
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,660
You don't have to answer me right now.

672
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,660
But I hope you at least spare some time for me and also yourself.

673
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,200
Choose the right person.

674
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,960
One who can really spend this long life with you.

675
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:30,850
♫  Who's hiding in a corner of their memories, talking to themselves?  ♫

676
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:36,810
♫  Even in the void of the night, there's no one there answering  ♫

677
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:41,050
♫  The moment the wind blows, it awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

678
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:47,050
♫  Looking at the city lights, it's a contrast to reality  ♫

679
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:53,160
♫  But we've got to continue down the road  ♫

680
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:59,350
♫  Taking a step further, will my dream developed into something more  ♫

681
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,240
♫  This world of fireworks, there are unexpected changes  ♫

682
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,190
♫  Being reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

683
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:10,590
♫  How many journeys to take before I'm astounded and speechless?  ♫

684
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,440
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like you're stranded  ♫

685
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,350
♫  When I see my future self,  ♫

686
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,720
♫  Only then can I understand why I'm moving forward  ♫

687
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,040
President Yu, I remember you planned to cook braised Dongpo pork knuckle?

688
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,080
Why are you suddenly making stone pot fish instead?

689
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,720
Hot soup, fish, and potatoes are more suitable

690
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,540
for a group of people to enjoy together.

691
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,720
Because no matter how cold it is outside, this dish will give you warmth.

692
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,400
♫  The uncertain suspense of this world  ♫

693
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,880
♫  Who has never cried their eyes out before?  ♫

694
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,520
Give it to me, Kelan.

695
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,440
♫  Reconcile with yesterday  ♫

696
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,360
Dear Folks, if you think any dish is delicious, just give it a like!

697
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,220
Okay.

698
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,880
Just follow my example and get married as soon as possible.

699
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,340
I will attend your wedding after my honeymoon.

700
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,640
Is that Su Kelan?

701
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,380
Right. It's her!

702
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,740
I heard due to that incident, President Yu fired her.

703
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:37,380
Now... Is she at the program team to cling to him?

704
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,760
How shameless.

705
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,760
President Yu isn't here so you have no work to do, right?

706
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,420
Do you feel grateful toward Su Kelan because she didn't fire you?

707
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,780
You are so easy!

708
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,060
Are you stupid? She even posted a moment to force President Yu to respond.

709
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,280
Can she be sincere to you?

710
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,600
You don't know what you're talking about! If she's so scheming,

711
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,580
how would she not know posting the video will only damage herself?

712
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,480
I already confirmed. Her ex-boyfriend works at a marketing company responsible for editing "Dine with Love."

713
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,080
After the video was posted, her ex-boyfriend got fired.

714
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,520
So it must be her ex-boyfriend who did it.

715
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,280
"It must be her ex-boyfriend who did it."

716
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,340
Even if you're right, President Yu fired her anyway.

717
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,280
She's just thinking too highly of herself.

718
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,240
- President Yu.
- President Yu.

719
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,280
Sister Kelan?

720
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,020
President Yu.

721
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:48,760
President Yu, Gavin has arrived.

722
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,580
Apologize to him for me.

723
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,920
We're going to go public soon. We have appointed a new vice president.

724
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,520
She's responsible for listing while also managing the three departments;

725
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,720
business, public relations, and marketing.

726
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,580
I will no longer be responsible for the business approval of the departments concerned.

727
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,000
Just ask her to sign.

728
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,180
Su Kelan. Vice President Su.

729
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,340
Tell me.

730
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,220
I look pretty as well.

731
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,640
Why does nobody like me?

732
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,300
Fine.

733
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,640
You don't think I look pretty at all.

734
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,080
Su Kelan is the pretty one.

735
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,080
Why do all of you think she looks better than me?

736
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,240
Is she that pretty?

737
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,760
I have better temperament.

738
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,780
They say men like simple women.

739
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,320
But Su Kelan is so scheming.

740
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,980
How tiring it will be to be her boyfriend!

741
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,520
Who's scheming? She's better than you in every way, okay?

742
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,220
Men only pursue novelty.

743
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,320
You've never seen someone like her

744
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,240
so you think she's your true love when you've only known her for a few days.

745
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:28,500
Time can't decide the depth of love.

746
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,380
I just don't get it.

747
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,580
Why do you like her so much?

748
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,940
Right, she is considerate of others.

749
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,080
But isn't that the same as flirting with everyone?

750
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,440
Some people flaunt their bluntness,

751
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,480
but they're actually self-centered.

752
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,160
She's different.

753
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,600
Sometimes she won't tell the truth

754
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,900
in order to be genuinely good to others.

755
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,520
She genuinely cares for others.

756
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,900
And she knows clearly what she wants.

757
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,220
She will firmly reject somebody,

758
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,580
but she doesn't want to hurt him.

759
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,660
Forget it. Such a person like you won't understand.

760
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,960
Such a person like me? What kind of person am I? You'd better explain!

761
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,060
What kind of person am I?

762
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,000
Are you always looking down on me

763
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,040
and think I'm stupid or I'm bad at everything?

764
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,320
Sorry.

765
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,360
I didn't mean that.

766
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,420
You lost your love. So did I.

767
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:05,960
Why can't you understand that I'm also upset?

768
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,520
You really like him?

769
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,500
What do you like about him?

770
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,020
Everything.

771
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,180
He's the smartest man I've ever met.

772
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,740
I remember in the first season,

773
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,900
the host pointed to the ingredient and asked me with a grin,

774
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,280
"How much does it cost?"

775
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,960
How much?

776
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,920
Darn it, I was stuck!

777
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,620
Numbers were flying in my mind.

778
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:44,120
If it's a usual day, I'd just let it go.

779
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,680
But I was onstage. I was a star!

780
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,860
People on and off the stage were all staring at me.

781
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,400
Just when I was extremely embarrassed...

782
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,960
- ¥ 10.80
- ¥ 10.80

783
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,200
Just one second.

784
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,180
¥ 3.60 multiplied by three jin equals ¥ 10.80.
(TN: 1 jin = 500gr)

785
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,890
He figured it out in one second!

786
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,260
Wasn't it the story of "A Hero Saves a Beauty"?

787
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,380
Just that? Who can't do that?

788
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,360
If he's a baked roll cook. He has a beer belly. He's poor.

789
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,320
He works out how much ¥ 3.60 times three is for you.

790
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,380
- Will you fall in love with him?
- No.

791
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,160
I only love Yu Hao.

792
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,960
- You love him because he's rich, don't you?
- So what?

793
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,060
Money is a part of him.

794
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,180
Why can't I like him as a whole?

795
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,540
I like handsome, rich, and smart men.

796
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,340
Why do you only focus on the money and belittle me as a superficial person?

797
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:00,100
If I like somebody ugly and poor, I'll be called noble then?

798
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,420
Take you as an example. What if you meet an older woman? She's tender and cooks for you every day.

799
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:08,180
But when you send her home, she says she has nothing to do with you and that she has a boyfriend.

800
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,200
Will you still like her?

801
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,180
- The two scenarios are different.
- How?

802
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,680
In pure love, age shouldn't matter, right?

803
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,600
What? You must marry a young girl?

804
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,500
Makes sense.

805
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,280
Love is naturally conditional.

806
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,620
No one is nobler than others.

807
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,960
You are more honest than I thought.

808
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:55,180
I sent you some business cards. They are all our partners.

809
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,300
An Jie will introduce you to them first.

810
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,100
Just have a brief talk and have dinner sometime.

811
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,300
I also read your contract.

812
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,020
There's no problem. Hurry and go to the HR department

813
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,720
to get it signed.

814
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,000
What's the matter?

815
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,040
You told me when I came back, I would work in the President's Secretary's Office,

816
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,060
why did you appoint me as vice president?

817
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,480
You didn't tell Jin Xuan you would quit?

818
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,380
It's improper for me to return.

819
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,360
Meng Meng is now director of the PR department.

820
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,580
The company is ready for capital operation as the next step.

821
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,720
You may work as the President's secretary.

822
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,680
No way. I've never done that.

823
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,800
Before I started my business, I've never done that, right?

824
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,840
The skills of the president's secretary required are, first, high EQ.

825
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
You're qualified.

826
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,460
And second?

827
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,180
Second,

828
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,420
my person.

829
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,620
For this point,

830
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,420
you're quite qualified.

831
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,460
Then I'll try it.

832
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,300
But I must tell you first

833
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,380
I need time to take care of my mother.

834
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,940
If it turns out there's too much work to do,

835
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,400
I'll quit immediately.

836
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,300
No problem.

837
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,320
My secretary is also you.

838
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,020
I mean,

839
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,040
why did you ask the business and public relations departments to report to me?

840
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,180
In the future, all important information needs to be collected by one person.

841
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,800
This will help me lower labor costs. Isn't it nice?

842
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,540
President Yu,

843
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,740
before you make a decision, can't you discuss it with me?

844
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,380
Do you keep doing things just as you wish?

845
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,520
My company. Who else should I follow except myself?

846
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,060
But you confused public and private interests.

847
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,620
What will others think of me?

848
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,020
Why do you say that?

849
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,680
You made a casual appointment. Isn't that your confusion of public and private interests?

850
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,280
Because you are qualified!

851
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,120
If I turn to a headhunter, the candidate won't be familiar with the company.

852
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,420
Among my employees, you're the most qualified.

853
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,120
Then why did you make the appointment in public?

854
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,240
Because it's convenient.

855
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,340
That saved time for communication. Isn't it perfect?

856
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,720
What else made you think I confused public and private interests?

857
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,540
There were many people in the elevator. Why were you holding my arm?

858
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,480
In case you fell.

859
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,680
If you get hurt, it will affect work.

860
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,620
That would be a huge loss.

861
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,620
Anything else?

862
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,620
If not,

863
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,860
sign the contract now.

864
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,960
I can't.

865
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,080
An Jie,

866
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,440
bring the contract Vice President Su to sign now.

867
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,320
Yu Hao!

868
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,260
Just kidding.

869
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:30,640
Do you want to check the contract terms carefully again

870
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,000
or

871
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
do you want a pay raise?

872
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,600
Yu Hao,

873
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,820
I told you I couldn't take charge of so much work.

874
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,020
I mean it.

875
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,680
Working on listing as a secretary is the most I can do.

876
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,540
I need time to take care of my mother.

877
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,740
I'll go to work then.

878
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,640
Other departments can't be in my charge.

879
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,920
You may tell them.

880
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,400
How about staying for a while?

881
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,940
What's up? Is there any work?

882
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,240
Not really,

883
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,800
I just feel like

884
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,500
we haven't been with each other alone recently.

885
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,680
Why are you still standing?

886
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,400
Then I'll take a seat.

887
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,580
You're not used to wearing high heels.

888
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,440
Why do you insist on wearing them?

889
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,460
President Yu, you are the one who told me

890
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,840
I represent the corporate image when I go outside.

891
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,420
How can I embarrass you?

892
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,380
You're willing to listen to me now, aren't you?

893
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,020
Then do you want me to listen to you or not?

894
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,560
That depends.

895
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:16,100
I'll eat my words about the image. Because after all, that's not how you win.

896
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,780
Since you're not used to them,

897
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:24,080
don't wear high heels any longer.

898
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,380
Well, I'll just tolerate it for today

899
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,820
because I don't have another pair of shoes.

900
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,000
I asked someone to buy whatever

901
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,141
so I can change clothes easily when working overtime.

902
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,300
If they don't fit, they can be exchanged.

903
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,060
They suit you well.

904
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,190
You

905
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:46,320
put a closet in your office because you were prepared to work overtime?

906
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,220
Don't you also need a bed?

907
01:11:29,045 --> 01:11:33,417
♫ Who is hiding
in the corner of the memories, talking to themselves? ♫

908
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:39,081
♫ Even in the void of the night, there's no one there answering ♫

909
01:11:39,983 --> 01:11:44,201
♫  The moment the wind blows, it awakens me from my fatigue  ♫

910
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:50,101
♫  Looking at the city lights, it's a contrast to reality  ♫

911
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:56,241
♫  But we've got to continue down the road  ♫

912
01:11:56,241 --> 01:12:02,481
♫  Taking a step further, will my dream developed into something more  ♫

913
01:12:02,481 --> 01:12:05,321
♫  This world of fireworks, there are unexpected changes  ♫

914
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,281
♫  Being reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

915
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:11,741
♫  How many journeys to take before I'm astounded and speechless?  ♫

916
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,721
♫ Tasting all the bitterness ♫

917
01:12:13,721 --> 01:12:16,601
♫  As far as the eyes can see, sometimes it feels like you're stranded  ♫

918
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:19,421
♫ When I'm in the season of hope ♫

919
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:22,921
♫  only then can I understand why I'm moving forward  ♫

920
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,497
♫  Still be as stubborn as I've always been  ♫

921
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:38,801
♫  Who's hiding in a corner of their memories, talking to themselves?  ♫

922
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:41,781
♫ Who hasn't ever cried their eyes out ♫

923
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:45,221
♫  Self-reflection will diminish what may come tomorrow  ♫

924
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:47,221
♫  Reconcile with yesterday  ♫

925
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:49,941
♫  When the raindrops can sigh and cover the glimmer of the starry sky,  ♫

926
01:12:49,941 --> 01:12:52,941
♫  I look forward to sunny days coming soon after  ♫

927
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:55,001
♫  Stop and look up to see if we're moving forward together  ♫

928
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:58,889
♫  Is our pace the same as before?  ♫
