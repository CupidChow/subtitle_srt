Thank you, Sister.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,700
You're welcome.

00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,440
Little Friend, what are you doing?

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm hiding from someone.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,960
- Who are you hiding from?
- Xin Xin.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
Furry monster!

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,220
What furry monster? Let's go back and wrap dumplings.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,200
Director Jin?

Your mother?

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,470
It's fine. She gets dialysis twice a week, and her normal life is unaffected.

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,020
How about you, Director Jin? Why are you here at the hospital?

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,310
You and she are...?

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,660
During a past program, we filmed the inpatient department.

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,160
The children were cute, and we had a happy time playing together

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,170
so I come over from time to time to play with them.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,400
Playing hide-and-seek?

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,980
Not hide-and-seek.

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,760
The furry monster will teach everyone how to wrap dumplings,

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,120
but nobody wants to pay attention to him.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,700
Director Jin, we caught the other children and brought them back. Want to go wrap dumplings now?

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,520
It isn't fun.

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,740
It is fun.

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,400
Xin Xin, do you know that besides dumplings,

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,640
dough can also be shaped into little bunnies, kittens, and even deer?

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,660
Really? I want a little bunny!

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,500
Can you come to help me? I'm really bad at dealing with children.

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,400
- All right.
- Okay. A bunny!

This is Sister Kelan. She said she could make a bunny with dough.

33
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,140
You're talking nonsense. I don't believe it!

Neither do we!

Do you want to learn how?

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,460
Yes!

37

What? With Sister Kelan here, are you ignoring me?

38
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,560
Hurry, hurry! Quickly wrap more dumplings.

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,520
Even though the bunnies are cute, the dumplings are tastier.

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,540
Dumplings, dumplings, you only know about dumplings.

41
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,420
Furry Monster, other than dumplings, do you not know how to do anything else?

42
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,740
That's right! You only know how to make dumplings.

No way.

Wife, I was wrong.

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,680
What did you do wrong?

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
My mistake was that I shouldn't have left my wife alone.

84
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Your mistake was that you didn't believe me at all.

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,270
Am I that kind of unreasonable person?

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,920
You can tell me it is inconvenient to talk because it's other people's private matters,

87
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,940
or you can also ask for Yu Hao's consent.

88
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,900
But what about you? You threw me aside and let me worry for nothing.

89
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,780
Is it a lot of pressure to explain to me?

90
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,780
Everything my wife said is correct. It's all my fault.

91
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,660
I will change. I promise I will change.

92
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,890
Change?

93
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,490
Then tell me what's wrong with Yu Hao?

95
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm not good at talking so I wrote down everything I wanted to say on paper.

I was really wrong.

97

From now on, my wife will be my most important person. Yu Hao, move aside.

If you really want to know, I'll ask Yu Hao if I can tell you.

Did you eat garlic today?

102
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,620
I haven't!

103
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,980
When you were unhappy, I didn't have time to eat anything. Don't even talk about garlic or pig's intestines, I ate nothing!

104

Isn't it just to make everyone think there is something between her and her boss?

[About Su Kelan's Weibo Moment Video - Solutions]

177
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,440
Hello, Lawyer Shao.

178
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,100
Did you see the video?

179
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,280
Yes.

180
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,420
Besides the legal notice, help me check

181
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,120
how the behind-the-scene materials were leaked,

182
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,540
and who handled them.

183
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,000
President Yu.

184
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,680
Do you have any questions?

185
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,920
My other clients have also encountered similar issues.

186
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,800
For the girl to use this kind of method,

187
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,700
is a bit shrewd.

188
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,020
If you're going to talk to her later, handle it carefully.

189
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,600
Avoid being recorded.

190
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,720
You finish the legal notice first.

191
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,380
Seriously. I really didn't expect this.

192
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
Exactly the proposal we discussed last time.

193
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,940
Did you check WeChat Moments?

194
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,160
Have you guys seen it?

195
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,680
Su Kelan's WeChat Moments? She is announcing her relationship with the boss.

196
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
You mustn't talk recklessly.

197
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,860
If she becomes the president's wife later on, there will be trouble.

198
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,760
You can't say that for sure. We haven't seen President Yu's stance yet.

199
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,780
President Yu likes to eat the preserved and pickled vegetables in this fridge the most.

200
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,800
They were all personally made by Su Kelan.

201
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,280
Really? She's so shrewd.

202
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,600
That's right. Who could have seen through her?

203
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,620
- President Yu.
- President Yu.

204
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,680
Is there no work for you at work?

205
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,880
If there's no work, you can go home.

206
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,360
The company doesn't pay idle people.

207
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,340
I'm sorry, President Yu.

208
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,940

Where are you?

211
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Yes. The video violates privacy.

212
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,000

Please try again later.

219
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,160
Hello. Mom, how is it going?

220
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,870
Is there anyone at her home?

221
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,340
I ran downstairs

222
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,000
and kept knocking for a long time, but nobody opened the door. What's wrong?

223
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,240
It's nothing. I got it.

224
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,860
You should go back home.

225
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,300
Okay.

226
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,480
Is this because of the birthday matter?

227
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Did she post it after being provoked?

228
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,860
That's not possible.

229
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,020
Han Meng,

230
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,180
where exactly is Su Kelan?

231
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,660
Are you even asking me?

232
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,440
I wanted to ask what exactly your intention is?

233
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,980
If you don't like her, don't give her the wrong impression or trouble her.

234
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,080
If something really happened to her, could you afford to bear the responsibility?

235
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,960
Mom, give me the bag.

236
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,860
You must be tired from all the check-ups today.

237
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,800
What do you want to eat for dinner?

238
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,740
Something simple.

239
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,200
Something that can improve your mood.

240
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,800
My mood isn't bad.

241
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,040
You drank last night.

242
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,520
I already told you that was to accompany Meng Meng.

243
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,440
You didn't check your phone all day today.

244
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,540
Mom.

245
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,000
I usually don't check my phone when I am with you.

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,140
But not enough to constitute a whole day.

247
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,500
Are you unhappy with someone so that you are intentionally avoiding messages?

248
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,550
Fine.

249
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
Let's think about what we're going to eat tonight.

250
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,600
Take it easy.

251
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,220
She is the one who posted the WeChat Moment.

252
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,580
I'm the victim.

253
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,440
From what stance are you blaming me?

254
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,900
From her friend's stance!

255
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,920
From your aunt's stance!

256
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,160
Here, you only have one role. That is an employee of "What To Eat Next."

257
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,220
Okay.

258
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,880
Then I quit. Can I change my position to talk to you now?

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,440
I'm sorry. My phone was stolen.

288
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,620
That Moment is already deleted.

289
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,880
I didn't post the video.

290
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,420
My apologies.

291
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,440
It's my problem. My mistake.

292
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,820
If I had paid attention to my phone, the video wouldn't have been posted for so long.

293
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,600
For this period of time,

294
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,480
don't come to the company.

295
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,860
I'll give you twenty days of paid leave.

296
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,980
Why?

297
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,740
President Yu, do you think

298
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,480
if I appear at the company, it will cause you a lot of trouble?

299
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,880
Do you think it won't?

300
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,060
I didn't share the video.

301
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,280
The clip contains the source materials inside the hotel

302
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,100
and behind-the-scenes of the program.

303
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,840
I already contacted Director Jin to check who handled the contents.

304
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,100
- I'll find evidence!
- Do you really think

305
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,560
people will care whether you're the one who posted or not?

306
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
Fine.

307
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,480
You said you didn't post it. Where's the evidence?

308
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,960
Even if you have evidence,

309
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
who will care and believe you?

310
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,600
They will just think you're trying to hide the truth.

311
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,500
Then another controversial topic of discussion will be triggered.

312
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
A topic that could have disappeared within two weeks

313
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,840
and be forgotten within twenty days could be turned into an entertainment topic for several months.

314
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
As a director of the PR department

315
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,820
you don't have this most basic sense of judgment?

316
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,680
I care who posted it.

317
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,960
I care if you believe I was the one to share it or not.

318
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,680
It's not important whether I believe it or not.

319
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,380
It is important!

320
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,840
So you don't believe me.

321
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,370
You think...

322
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,880
this is an underhanded tactic I used so you don't want to see me to avoid being agitated.

323
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,380
I resign.

324
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,920
President Yu, you don't want to ever see me again.

325
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,960
You're just worried that if I resign, it will provoke more gossip, right?

326
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,920
This incident was originally my fault.

327
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,520
I apologize for the difficulties it caused.

328
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,980
You don't have to be in a troubled position. I will send you my resignation letter shortly.

329
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,280
When I said you could take temporary leave, I meant you could take a temporary leave.

330
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,920
Why are you over-interpreting it?

331
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Take twenty days off.

332
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,060
If you disappear for twenty days, the public will naturally lose interest.

333
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,760
And I'll still pay you. What's the problem with this solution?

334
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,560
I don't care what the people at the company think of me!

335
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,300
I only care about what you think.

336
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,640
I only care if you can trust me and if you still want to see me!

337
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,860
Can't you be rational instead of being emotional?

338
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,660
My rationality is to...

339
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,760
immediately resign.

340
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I won't approve it.

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
Why not?

342
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,980
When you see me, it will be bothersome and vice versa.

00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,170
How did you know?

525
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,560
Did Yu Hao even tell you that?

526
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,660
Tomato is your favorite.

527
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,300
Take it.

528
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,160
I need to go.

529
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,660
Kelan.

530
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,020
Give her some alone time.

531
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,160
What is it?

532
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,760
Don't you have anything to say to your potential future partner?

533
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,230
Why did you come back suddenly?

534
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,940
I'm on vacation.

535
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,020
I'll stay here for a week before I'm off to Shanghai.

536
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,920
And then I'll fly back to the U.S. from there.

537
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,000
What are you thinking?

538
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,860
Why don't you ask me why I'm going to Shanghai?

539
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,560
No reason.

540
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,720
I'm just thinking

541
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,680
about my company's business.

542
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,360
By the way, speaking of your company, have you ever considered

543
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,520
relocating your head office to Shanghai?

544
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,160
You'll have easier access to investors there, and life is more convenient.

545
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,240
- I'll find a chance to...
- Which hotel are you staying at?

546
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,220
Ritz-Carlton.

547
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,800
In terms of doing business,

548
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,020
you are still the same.

549
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,880
Yes, same old same old.

550
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,860
And you? Have you changed?

551
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,860
Same old.

552
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,320
Where will you take me to dinner later?

553
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,240
You don't eat dinner, do you?

554
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,700
What do you want to eat?

555
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,040
Don't bother. I was teasing you.

556
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,420
It looks like you indeed haven't changed.

557
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,080
You still remember my habit.

558
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,620
Meng Meng.

559
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,280
I really don't think Shen Zhilin matters that much.

560
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,900
I wanted to tell you about my ex-girlfriends, and you said I didn't have to

561
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,760
because it's all in the past.

562
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,200
Can't you see it's a different situation?

563
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,820
This Shen Zhilin was Yu Hao's first love.

564
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,040
She not only changed his life,

565
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,580
but she still has an impact on him like a haunting ghost

566
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,620
even though they've been broken up for five years.

567
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,860
Can you say for sure

568
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,920
that Yu Hao blocked her because he has completely gotten over her?

569
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,680
And the reason he hasn't dated for five years is not because he's still hung up on her?

570
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,220
No matter if it's for work or not,

571
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,900
he went to pick her up as soon as she came back,

572
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,820
and he even turned Kelan down.

573
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,960
Is it not because Shen Zhilin is more important to him?

574
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,160
That's not true.

575
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,680
Haven't you noticed that Yu Hao has started to show interest in Su Kelan?

576
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,860
Started to show interest?

577
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Do you know what kind of men

578
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,210
women

579
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,160
should stay clear of the most?

580
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,940
Men like me;

581
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,040
handsome, funny, charming,

582
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,500
adorable, sexy...

583
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,480
Men like Yu Hao.

584
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,980
He won't admit it,

585
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,580
but his heart has been occupied by a sweet love in the past.

586
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,240
No one can conquer memories.

587
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,340
Come on, eat something.

588
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,780
Have some water. Don't be angry.

589
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,860
Calm down.

590
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,380
Yang Zhen told you he wanted to visit the Diaoyu Fortress, didn't he?

591
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,520
You'll join us, right?

592
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,260
Just consider it a trip with two of your alumni and your potential business partners.

593
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,760
It's part of your job, right?

594
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,720
I'll wait for you to pick me up tomorrow.

595
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,520
See you then.

596
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,320
Let's go to the Diaoyu Fortress tomorrow.

597
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,600
And you can show us around.

598
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,560
We can talk about your IPO plan during the trip.

599
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,120
An Jie, something came up and I can't go to work tomorrow.

600
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,940
If there's anything, you can talk to Su...

601
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,780
Director Wang.

602
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,550
[E-mail]
[Su Kelan: Resignation Letter]

603
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,380
Did Sister Kelan leave the chatroom?

604
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,320
I don't think so.

605
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,560
Because of the social media incident... Did President Yu fire her?

606
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,240
Gong Wenxing, look what your nephew has done!

607
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,320
He really approved Kelan's resignation.

608
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,480
You know what? If he comes to the wedding, I won't even show up.

609
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,540
Meng Meng, calm down. Listen to me.

610
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,400
I'm sure Yu Hao is confused right now.

611
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,340
He's quite slow when it comes to love.

612
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,140
He only dated once in all these years.

613
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,020
He has no idea how to deal with a situation like this.

614
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,760
Although Shen Zhilin is not right for him,

615
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,800
he did have a history with her.

616
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,060
Before he could let go of the past,

617
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,160
if he kept Su Kelan by his side

618
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,180
then he'd be a real jerk.

619
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,500
Didn't you also ask him not to bother Su Kelan?

620
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,200
Sometimes women don't mean what they say.

621
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,320
When women say no, it means yes.

622
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,120
Don't you know that?

623
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,160
Then do you want me tonight?

624
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,680
No!

625
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,460
Gong Wenxing,

626
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,120
- will you stop joking around?
- All right.

627
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,540
All right, all right. Be good. Calm down.

628
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,380
You are so annoying.

629
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,200
Your resignation is approved.

630
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,880
You may talk to the HR Dept. for details.

631
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,760
Chou Chou.

632
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,280
Pardon me. Look at you.

633
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,680
I only let you out of my sight for a minute, and you brought a cat here.

634
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,000
Sorry about that.

635
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,180
You are so naughty.

636
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,040
Now, let's go home.

637
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,480
Mom, I want to keep the cat.

638
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,640
If you get better marks in your final exams,

639
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,360
I'll give you a cat as your reward, okay?

640
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,900
Okay.

641
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,160
Mom, why did you get up so early?

642
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,780
I can do it.

643
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,720
Old people tend to wake up early.

644
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,560
I want something to eat.

645
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,800
Why don't you sleep a little more?

646
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,580
Why are you so clingy this morning?

647
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,320
What's the matter?

648
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,980
Mom,

649
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,720
thank you.

650
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,580
Now, go back to bed.

651
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,040
I'll wake you up later.

652
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,625
- Let me do it.
- Go.

653
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,060
Just go.

654
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,380
I'll call you later.

655
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,080
Keep stirring. It's going to burn.

656
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,840
Go ahead.

657
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,300
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...

658
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,180
Hello, Jacqueline, have you thought of it yet?

659
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,360
This is not our agreement.

660
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,140
It's my first vacation in seven years.

661
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,200
I had a long-awaited arrangement.

662
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,260
I know. I know.

663
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,880
I'm sorry to interrupt your vacation.

664
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,930
But listen,

665
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,040
our Beijing team needs your expertise.

666
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,440
They are having issues with the evaluation of a tech firm.

667
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,560
I promise I'll make it up to you.

668
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,420
You have got to help us save this deal.

669
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,180
Okay?

670
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,460
I was in the shower and didn't hear the phone. Sorry.

671
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,080
I'll get ready and head out soon.

672
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,020
What do you want for breakfast? I'll bring it over.

673
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,600
Yu Hao, I'm sorry,

674
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,920
but I need to go to the airport right now.

675
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,160
One of our projects in Beijing has a problem with equity investment.

676
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,100
I'm so sorry.

677
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,440
I promise I won't stand you up next time I come back.

678
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,480
It's okay. Just go and take care of your work.

679
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:36,830
[This time, I actually came back to interview at a fund company in Shanghai...]

680
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,160
I heard Shen Zhilin had to leave.

681
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,980
It'll be boring for two men to hike together.

682
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,900
Let's meet up next time.

683
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,720
This time,

684
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,520
I actually came back to interview at a fund company in Shanghai.

685
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,820
Can you wait for me to be back?

686
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,100
Shen Zhilin was really looking forward to hiking with you.

687
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,700
She wouldn't leave unless it was something urgent.

688
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,840
Don't get upset with her.

689
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,660
Why would I be upset with her?

690
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,900
All right, I'm off to work now.

691
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,860
Mom, I resigned.

692
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,240
I think that's good.

693
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,160
So

694
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,980
is this a consolation meal?

695
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,820
What consolation meal?

696
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,380
It's an encouragement meal.

697
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,080
Try to find a new job soon.

698
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,680
Otherwise,

699
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,960
do you think we can still afford food like this?

700
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,480
If you don't work, we can only eat dirt.

701
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,700
That's so cruel.

702
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,160
Even my own mother won't let me take a break.

703
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,080
You should work hard when you are young.

704
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,020
Out with the old, in with the new.

705
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,320
When it comes to finding a job, you should choose wisely.

706
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,540
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

707
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,680
All right, I hear you, my "supervisor."

708
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,540
I'll start sending out my resume tomorrow.

709
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,880
By the way, Mom,

710
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,400
I need to go out later to take care of something.

711
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,480
I thought you already brought your things home last night.

712
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,520
I'm not going to the office.

713
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,120
I'm taking care of things somewhere else.

714
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,640
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

715
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,980
I didn't expect she'd post something on Moments to pressure me.

716
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,500
Back then, it was also her who had our classmates believe that we were dating.

717
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,220
She made it seem like I would be irresponsible if I didn't confess my feelings to her.

718
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,460
So it's good that you didn't get involved with this woman.

719
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,740
I heard last night she left the PR Department's group chat.

720
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,700
What a pity.

721
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,560
Even though she framed me,

722
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,040
I still...

723
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,860
hope she can live happily.

724
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,360
Don't get me wrong,

725
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,040
but I think you are too kind, and that's why she used you.

726
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,280
Anyway, kindness will be repaid sooner or later.

727
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,940
Look at you now. You have a nice girl and a good career.

728
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,960
You'll be invited to my wedding for sure.

729
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,520
Listen, I still have things to do.

730
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,760
I need to go.

731
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,140
I'll buy you dinner sometime.

732
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,520
All right. Bye-bye.

733
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,820
Baby,

734
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,720
I made lunch for you.

735
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,460
I'll bring it over to you later.

736
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,980
All right, Sweetheart.

737
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,420
I'm looking forward to it.

738
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,400
Hey! What are you doing here? Brother Xiang is looking for you.

739
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,540
- Hurry.
- Really?

740
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,300
In the conference room.

741
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,790
How come it's you?

742
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,180
Do you know each other?

743
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,720
This is Miss Su. The program team sent her to investigate the source material leakage.

744
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,100
Miss Su,

745
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,920
this is Mr. Li Xun, the editor of the program team.

746
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,920
He is in charge of

747
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,720
source material promotion.

748
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,660
Long time no see. What a surprise!

749
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,360
I saw the video on your Moments.

750
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,020
What? Did you join the program team after leaving "What to Eat Next"?

751
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,280
- Isn't that the woman in the video?
- Yes.

752
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,040
So she's the one who hooked up with the boss of "What to Eat Next."

753
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,170
She's shameless.

754
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,680
What does she think she's doing?

755
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,340
Your company has the behind-the-scenes materials of the program, right?

756
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,980
We do. Our company has made many promotional materials for different programs,

757
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,540
but nothing like this has ever happened before.

758
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,440
My colleagues all possess good business integrity.

759
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,040
There's no way that they'd give away the program team's source materials.

760
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,000
The people on your team, however,

761
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,230
had easy access to them, right?

762
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:47,700
Then please tell me who was editing the materials at 10:00 p.m. on December 2?

763
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,620
These are the final cut and the behind-the-scene materials of the show Dine with Love.

764
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,980
Please work hard tonight

765
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,340
to edit a trailer from these.

766
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,660
December 2.

767
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,400
It was a Sunday.

768
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,540
Su Kelan,

769
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,420
if you like Yu Hao and want to be with him,

770
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,940
I won't blame you.

771
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,740
And I won't blame you, either,

772
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,520
for squeezing me out of "What to Eat Next" because you feared that I'd hurt your reputation.

773
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,080
But now you've made my co-workers scapegoats because of your personal grudge against me.

774
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,760
I really can't stand it anymore.

775
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,500
What does she mean it's our fault?

776
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,900
She must have done it herself in order to climb up.

777
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,040
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

778
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,020
It's for retaliation.

779
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,160
Look closely.

780
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,200
There's a timestamp from the program team in the corner of the screen 32 seconds in.

781
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,180
December 2, 2018. 22:23 p.m.

782
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,040
What do you mean?

783
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,520
The program team's timestamp is carefully set.

784
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,600
The actual time will be shown each time when the video is on.

785
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,260
So, please tell me

786
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:10,680
who was editing the video at 10:00 p.m. on December 2?

787
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,740
- Li Xun was editing the video that night, right?
- Yes.

788
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,140
I saw Old Hu hand him the hard disk when I left.

789
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,100
This is the indictment I filed for the damage you caused to my reputation.

790
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,180
And just so you know,

791
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,600
the program team is also preparing to file a lawsuit against you.

792
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,760
No way.

793
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,180
What timestamp?

794
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,360
I've never heard of it.

795
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,280
How is that possible?

796
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,060
I clearly checked before I edited it.

797
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,220
What's going on?

798
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,520
So he forged the video to take revenge on his ex-girlfriend.

799
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,820
You tricked me, didn't you?

800
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,180
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

801
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,660
You are not persistent enough.

802
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,140
You are right. I added the timestamp.

803
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,320
So what?

804
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,820
You've admitted it anyway.

805
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,900
It's hard evidence.

806
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,200
How wicked!

807
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,480
He's so cruel.

808
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,480
Kelan!

809
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,700
Kelan!

810
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,120
Kelan!

811
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,720
Wait!

812
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,120
Kelan!

813
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,600
Kelan!

814
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,260
Kelan!

815
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:37,080
Please forgive me this time, because we dated for six years, okay?

816
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,280
I did such a stupid thing

817
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,200
because I got jealous.

818
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,320
Kelan,

819
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,600
I love you.

820
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,300
I love you so much.

821
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,460
It breaks my heart when I see you

822
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,680
with another man, Kelan.

823
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,900
It's because I hate that I can't have you that I did something so foolish.

824
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,500
You love me?

825
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,300
Do you want to get back together with me?

826
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,100
Then what about your girlfriend?

827
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,260
I...

828
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,400
I'll break up with her right away!

829
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,040
I'm dating her because I temporarily lost my mind.

830
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,680
Please give me another chance, okay?

831
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,760
Hello, Director Jin.

832
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,520
Kelan.

833
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,600
I heard everything from the publicity company.

834
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,840
How are things going with you?

835
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,080
Very well. It's all been taken care of.

836
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,900
I'm now taking a walk.

837
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,680
Director Jin, thank you.

838
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,440
You don't need to thank me.

839
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,640
I only told the publicity company

840
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,120
that you were with us, and you were in charge of the investigation.

841
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,500
That's all.

842
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,160
By the way,

843
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,400
last time I asked you

844
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,620
if you wanted

845
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,960
to join our team.

846
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,160
Have you decided yet?

847
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,060
You are back.

848
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,640
Yes.

Okay.

Here.

853

Give me.

854
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,480
Just wait outside. I'll let you know when it's done.

855
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,220

859
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,540
The last dish.

860
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,690

Yes.

883
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,000
Has the PR Department finalized the program's theme yet, Su Kelan?

884
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,540
Miss Han.

885
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,860
Not yet.

886
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,520
Please hurry up then.

887
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,080
Hi, Guys, I'm Su Kelan.

888
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,350
I'll come to work next week.

889
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,400
Welcome, Kelan!

890
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,440
Will we have tasty midnight snacks in the future if we work late?

891
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,580
This chatting group is for work. Mind your words.

892
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,200
Isn't eating our job?

893
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,410
First thing first,

894
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:26,560
on a serious note, Kelan, I'll add you to the guest communication team.

895
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,200
It tastes good.

896
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,100
President Yu. I thought President Yu wouldn't come to work until next week.

897
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,480
So did I. Who knows?

898
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,100
An Jie,

899
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,520
please buy some more preserved and pickled dishes.

900
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,740
President Yu, that was...

901
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,730
The preserved and pickled dishes, in the fridge

902
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,880
were made by Su Kelan.

903
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,200
Never mind.

904
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,480
Come.

905
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,260
Time to eat.

906
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,870
Come on.

907
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,740
You are so picky about food now.

908
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,380
President Yu.

909
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,940
Don't forget we have a program to shoot at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

910
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,460
Got it.

911
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,980
Jin Xuan. Director Jin.

912
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,240
Hi!

913
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,800
Why are you here?

914
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,700
Ta da.

915
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,740
What's that?

916
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,220
Love talisman.

917
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,700
I got this especially for you.

918
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,520
It worked like a charm. As soon as I got it, Su Kelan and Yu Hao broke up.

919
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,980
You know what?

920
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,920
I waited in line for two hours to get it

921
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,380
It only costs 888 Yuan.

922
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,720
Will you transfer me the money through Alipay or WeChat?

923
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,620
Come with me.

924
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,700
What do you want?

925
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,240
Didn't you invite Su Kelan to join your crew because you wanted to steal her?

926
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,560
Do you want to succeed?

927
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,400
Then come with me.

928
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,100
Get up.

929
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,720
Kelan, it's your first day at work.

930
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,480
Please feel free to look around and familiarize yourself with our working environment.

931
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,980
I'm already very familiar with it.

932
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:37,260
That's true.

933
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,260
Where's Director Jin?

934
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,220
That's weird.

935
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,800
Where did he go?

936
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Kelan, this is today's script.

937
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,640
- Please take a look.
- All right. Thanks.

938
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,780
Has the theme been finalized?

939
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:59,060
The theme of the next episode is "Running across an old friend."

940
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,300
Cook a meal for an old friend you encounter in a strange town.

941
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,500
It perfectly fits your current situation.

942
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,720
Then what should we cook?

943
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,960
We can cook

944
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,560
pickled cowpea with ground pork,

945
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,200
pancake with pickle,

946
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,640
stir-fried shredded pork with pickled ginger,

947
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,740
or...

948
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,720
Who can help me check the props?

949
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,680
Coming.

950
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,470
Hi.

951
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,600
President Yu, how are you doing?

952
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,660
What are you doing here?

953
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,620
We meet again.

954
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,240
I'm with the program crew now,

955
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,260
in charge of planning and publicity.

956
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:57,580
I hope our cooperation be smooth.

957
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,460
Well,

958
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,800
the theme dish is pickled cowpea with ground pork.

959
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,020
Who is it?

960
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,640
A new guest?

961
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,360
How come he looks so familiar?

962
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,080
Director Jin Xuan!

963
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,460
Yes! This Jin Xuan!

964
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,700
Director Jin!

965
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,660
It's Director Jin!

966
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,260
Kelan.

967
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,540
I...

968
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,700
Since the first time I met you...

969
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,620
Su Kelan,

970
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,780
from the first time I met you,

971
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,640
I've liked you.

972
01:12:54,966 --> 01:13:00,638
♫  Who's hiding in a corner of their memories, talking to themselves?  ♫

973
01:13:00,638 --> 01:13:06,002
♫  Even in the void of the night, there's no one there answering  ♫

974
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:10,222

975

976

♫  But we've got to continue down the road  ♫

977

♫  Taking a step further, will my dream developed into something more  ♫

978
01:13:28,502 --> 01:13:31,242
♫  This world of fireworks, there are unexpected changes  ♫

979
01:13:31,242 --> 01:13:34,302
♫  Being reluctant to be swept away by the scenery  ♫

980
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,810
♫  How many journeys to take before I'm astounded and speechless?  ♫

981
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:39,760

♫  The uncertain suspense of this world  ♫

987
