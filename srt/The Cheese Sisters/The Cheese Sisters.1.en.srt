1
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,583
What are you kids doing?

2
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,291
Hey.

3
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,166
Fern, my dear,
these cattle have feelings just like us.

4
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,000
Sometimes they're sad and happy.

5
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,833
If they listen to beautiful songs,
they might feel good just like we do.

6
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,708
Fern, my dear.

7
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,666
When we're milking the cow,

8
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,208
we need to entirely clean the surface,
then wipe the udders dry.

9
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,958
-Get it?
-Yes, Dad.

10
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,916
Okay. Look. And now…

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,833
I'll check to see if the milk quality
meets the standards.

12
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,458
All right.

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:38,250
Look! To see if it's good quality milk,
we need to look here.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,833
Do you see?

15
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,041
If any udder
has mucus discharge,

16
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,500
it means that udder is inflamed. Okay?

17
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,208
Fern,

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,208
come here.

19
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,625
Come help me milk them.

20
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,916
I've never done it.
I'm scared of hurting her.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,916
No, you won't. Come on, try it.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
Fhon, come try it, dear.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,875
Hold this and plug it in.

24
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,916
Now plug it in.

25
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,833
Gently, it'll suck it in tightly.

26
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,791
Now let the machine do its job.

27
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,208
How do you get so much milk?

28
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:28,125
The cow is happy,
so it gives a lot of milk.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,875
Fern, my dear.
You need to learn these things.

30
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:39,500
Because in the future,
you'll have to take over this farm.

31
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,333
Why do I need to?

32
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,875
Well, if one day I'm not here,
and Grandpa and Mom are not here,

33
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,875
you'll be the sole owner
of this whole farm.

34
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,583
Dad, don't say things like that!

35
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,625
Grandma used to say that it's bad luck.

36
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,541
Besides, without you, how will I go on?

37
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,833
All right, it's done. I'll pull it out.

38
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,416
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>I was very angry with my dad</i>

39
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,291
<i>that he talked about</i>
<i>life and death like that.</i>

40
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,333
<i>Because I was afraid</i>…

41
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,416
<i>that if someday, he was gone,</i>

42
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,458
<i>how could I take care of his farm?</i>

43
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:43,500
<i>Actually, I've heard</i>
<i>there are always things we enjoy doing</i>

44
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
<i>and things we have to do.</i>

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
<i>I guess my dad</i>
<i>would've accepted any path I chose.</i>

46
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,958
<i>I've chosen</i>

47
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,000
<i>to take care of this farm</i>
<i>even if I'm on my own.</i>

48
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,791
SUMET KUMMUL

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,208
Let's put these flowers
in front of the house,

50
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,083
and the rest on the tables and chairs.

51
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,375
Please help me take them to the car.

52
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,500
The car's waiting outside.

53
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,625
Please pick these poles up as well.

54
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
Mew.

55
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,791
-What, Mom?
-What are you doing?

56
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,791
-I'm playing a game.
-Can't you see you're on his way?

57
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,375
-I'm trying to get signal.
-You're in the way.

58
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,791
Oh, girl! Just get out of the way!

59
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,166
Damn it!

60
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,666
-She always complains.
-What's going on?

61
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,000
Fhon,

62
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,833
just go home.

63
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,208
There's something
I need to discuss with them.

64
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,291
Fern.

65
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,500
It's time you take over the farm.

66
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,291
Do you know how much debt we're in?

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
No, I don't really know.

68
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,291
Dad never told me.

69
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:43,416
Now we owe
more than 500,000 baht.

70
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,416
Your father had borrowed it.

71
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,500
Plus the wages
for the workers that we still owe.

72
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,708
I understand your father
left us all of a sudden,

73
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,666
so nothing is prepared.

74
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,583
It's okay. I'll help take care of it.

75
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,791
Yes, Uncle.

76
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,583
I think that with the savings
your father has left,

77
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,791
you can pay off some of the debt,
and use the rest to pay for the wages.

78
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,875
I agree.

79
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:25,125
And then, we should sell the farm
to pay off the rest of the debt.

80
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,708
We need to sell the farm?

81
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,000
People are interested in this land.

82
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,166
If we get the right offer,

83
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,750
we can then pay off the debts in full.

84
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,791
It'll solve all our issues.

85
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:48,541
-Where are we going to live then?
-You both can live with me and Mew.

86
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,583
You will have company.

87
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,083
Damn Karrie!

88
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,375
Just delete the whole game, man.

89
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,500
Damn it!

90
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,500
Stupid!

91
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,875
I'll help pay for your tuition fees.

92
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,083
You're studying Veterinary Medicine?

93
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,458
Does it take
five or six years to graduate?

94
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,208
I'm studying Animal Science.

95
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,791
It only takes four years.

96
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,875
Are they different?

97
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,250
Oh, well… That's all right.

98
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,875
That's all good, you'll be done faster.

99
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,875
Come, Fern.

100
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,500
-Where are you going?
-Hey, wait.

101
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,541
Fhon! Damn it!

102
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,125
We haven't settled everything.

103
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,333
<i>Thank you for getting me out of there.</i>

104
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,625
Sure!

105
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,083
I saw your face and really felt for you.

106
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,583
Now's not the time to talk about that.

107
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,291
I apologize for my dad.

108
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,916
What was he thinking about,
trying to collect debts in a funeral?

109
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,125
What got into him?

110
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,500
It's all right. I understand him.

111
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,416
-And don't you worry--
-Hey. Don't worry.

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,708
What's the difference between
Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science?

113
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,250
You mentioned it earlier.

114
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:44,250
Veterinary Medicine studies
disease prevention for animals,

115
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,541
while Animal Science
focuses on livestock.

116
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,125
Particularly livestock production
and trade.

117
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,166
I see.

118
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,708
How about your music studies?

119
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm taking a break this semester.

120
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:06,166
Have you ever heard
that music makes people relaxed?

121
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,125
But in reality,
we study hard like a military training.

122
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,375
That bad?

123
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:12,916
Yeah.

124
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,958
Well, actually,

125
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,166
I don't even know
what I'm going to do with it.

126
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,458
It doesn't seem to be of any use.

127
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,000
So when are you going back to school?

128
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,791
I'm thinking about
taking a break for a while.

129
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,375
And come back to take care of things.

130
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,708
Though I'm not sure I can do it right.

131
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,416
You should take it easy here.

132
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,416
Well, if one day I'm not here,
and Grandpa and Mom are not here,

133
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,458
you'll be the sole owner
of this whole farm.

134
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,500
Are you okay?

135
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,541
Did Nui quit?

136
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,083
Yes, he did.

137
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,375
And Daeng too.

138
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,625
He said it's not enough money.

139
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,708
He's going to find a new job in the city.

140
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,125
I see.

141
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,541
Well, his family has expenses.

142
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,000
I think that's what he'll do.

143
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,625
-How about Pol, is he going to quit?
-I don't know.

144
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,458
He'll probably stay.

145
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,125
He's not going anywhere.

146
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,833
Unless,

147
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,625
Nid's daughter…

148
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,333
sells this farm.

149
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,708
If she does that, I'll be doomed.

150
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,666
How?

151
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,250
You guys are still young.
You'll surely get a job anywhere.

152
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,291
I'm sorry.

153
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,000
-Fern.
-Hey, Fhon.

154
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,166
I asked my dad permission
to come help you.

155
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,875
Thank you so much, Fhon.

156
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:55,958
Hey.

157
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,666
What's up with the cow?
So little milk.

158
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,333
They must be suffering
from <i>heat stress.</i>

159
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,541
They might be
getting stressed from the heat.

160
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,208
So they eat less and produce less milk.

161
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:24,583
I'm thinking about adjusting their food,
and maybe install a fan.

162
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,000
That might help.

163
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,750
Has anyone taken the cows out for a walk?
When was the last time?

164
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,833
Probably not since Nid passed.

165
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,458
It's not getting any better.

166
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,041
Better call the doctor.

167
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,125
Give us lots of milk, cow.
Want to die like your master?

168
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,208
Hello, doctor.

169
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,958
I'd like to ask you a question.

170
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:56,166
If the cow is still unable to give milk,
what will they do with her?

171
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,416
She will be sold for meat.

172
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,791
Fern, are you back?

173
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,875
Come here, dear.

174
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,750
How are things today?

175
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,500
It's not getting any better, Grandma.

176
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,083
Your uncle came to see me.

177
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,833
He's been coming for several days now.

178
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,333
-About selling this farm?
-Yeah.

179
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,125
He wants us to sell it.

180
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,166
I didn't want to get involved in this.

181
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,083
But what he's saying makes sense.

182
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,458
We have debt, and now the cow's sick.

183
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,458
But this farm…

184
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,291
Before it was your father's,
it used to belong to your grandfather.

185
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,708
Your father took care of it
after your grandfather.

186
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
But you're still studying.

187
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,041
Want to live your life
surrounded by cow dung?

188
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,000
I should have sold it back then.

189
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,333
What are you trying to say?

190
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,708
I don't want you to live
your life like your dad.

191
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:38,416
You should live your own life.
Not need to bear any burdens.

192
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,250
Don't you want to go back to school?

193
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,250
Actually, I want to take care
of this place.

194
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:53,500
But if you tell me to sell it
to get money for my education,

195
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,250
I think what I'm studying
would be of no use.

196
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,375
But if it's going to benefit others,
isn't it worth selling?

197
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,875
The workers will get money
for their family.

198
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,875
But if they don't have somewhere to work,
what will they do next?

199
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,125
Do you want them to leave
their family to find work elsewhere?

200
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,291
Let them take care of their own lives!

201
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,416
And you have to save yourself first, Fern!

202
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,583
Can you give me a chance?

203
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,291
What can a woman do, Fern?

204
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,750
Your father was a good person,
but he still left his debt behind.

205
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,041
Just sell it.

206
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,208
Even if you insist to do it,
it won't do any good.

207
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,625
Just sell it so you can pay off the debts.

208
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,166
Grandma!

209
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,083
Grandma, are you inside?

210
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,708
Grandma!

211
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,458
Who are you gossiping about?
Sounds like fun.

212
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,791
Mom had me bring food for you.

213
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,958
Spicy minced pork salad,
beef soup and grilled beef.

214
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,208
Tons of food!

215
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,500
Do you want some, Fern?

216
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,333
Where are you going, Fern?

217
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,250
Fern!

218
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,500
That's okay, Grandma.
We can enjoy it by ourselves.

219
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,708
Here, Grandma.

220
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,708
Here, look.

221
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,458
Don't read it.

222
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,500
Just enjoy your Marian plums.

223
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,875
I'm sorry.

224
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,333
Just sleep over tonight. It's late now.

225
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,416
-Would that be okay?
-Yeah.

226
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:47,125
Sleep at our house tonight.
It's dangerous to go out now.

227
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,666
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

228
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,208
Thanks!

229
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,750
It's good you're here.
Our parents went to the city.

230
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,208
It's good to have you here.

231
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,875
We can chat.

232
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,208
I'm not lonely anymore.

233
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,625
Can I ask you something?

234
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,000
Are you selling your farm
and moving in with your uncle?

235
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,583
I don't know.

236
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,541
I don't really want to sell the farm.

237
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,541
Dad loved this farm and every single cow.

238
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,875
We both helped give birth to those cows.

239
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,958
I watched them grow.

240
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,916
Until now that they have
a calf of their own.

241
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,625
I really can't let them go.

242
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,125
But Grandma wants me
to sell the farm for everyone's sake.

243
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,250
Actually, it would be quite simple.

244
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,541
If my father was a bastard,

245
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,250
and treated me badly,

246
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,750
it would be easier for me
to make the decision.

247
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,208
Don't do it, Fern.

248
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,333
Don't give up!

249
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,333
Because if you sell your farm and leave,

250
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,541
I'll really miss you.

251
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,291
Be right back!

252
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,166
Here we go.

253
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,583
Hope it still works.

254
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:06,375
-Do you still play?
-Not really. Not since I went to college.

255
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,833
-Really?
-Yes.

256
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:11,708
Too bad. I remember you were great at it.

257
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,750
Well, do you remember
we used to give the cows concerts?

258
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:19,250
Of course! You got scolded by your dad.

259
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:23,000
My dad was dramatic!

260
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,500
Your dad was the owner of the farm,
and he didn't mind!

261
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,083
I was so confused.

262
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,791
-Up for a jam?
-No, it's been a long time.

263
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,375
-Hey, it's fine, let's do it.
-No.

264
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,250
Fern, are you all right?

265
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,875
I'm fine.

266
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:30,250
I'm sorry, I don't remember it.

267
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,750
Well, why are you saying sorry?
I haven't said anything yet.

268
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,208
We're not playing seriously at all.

269
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,041
I'm just happy we're playing together.

270
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,041
Hey.

271
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:54,416
I think I have an idea
about how to help the cows relax.

272
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,250
How?

273
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,958
We'll just bring back
memories of our old concerts!

274
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,458
Fhon, what are you thinking?

275
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,125
We did a great job!

276
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,916
I'm serious.

277
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,041
We did so great!

278
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,375
-Okay.
-Let's try it.

279
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:22,208
-Who knows? It might work.
-Okay, let's try it.

280
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,083
How should we start?

281
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,125
With classical music?
Easy-going music.

282
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,125
The cow should start to relax.

283
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,000
Hey!

284
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,583
What are you two doing?

285
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:56,875
-Are you making a TikTok video?
-No. Not a TikTok.

286
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,875
-Why are you up there?
-I'm trying to get signal.

287
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,666
That's very high up.

288
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm just trying
to play music for the cows.

289
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,166
They might feel more relaxed.

290
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,708
Classical music
will make the cows sleepy.

291
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,458
Just listen. Listen.

292
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,375
-Shall we start?
-Sure.

293
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,916
The milk is still as little.

294
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,833
It might take some time.

295
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,458
It's only the first day.

296
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,750
Music can't really help.

297
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,125
Just stop it. So annoying!

298
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,041
Dad, please.

299
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,250
I just want to help.

300
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:29,791
How?

301
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,833
What were you thinking,
that music would help increase the milk?

302
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,583
Please go back to school, Fhon.

303
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,875
Stop slouching around like this!

304
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,708
Dad, I already told you.

305
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,250
I don't need to study.

306
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:51,750
-I won't die if I don't study!
-Don't be stubborn.

307
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,041
I told you to go to school, just go!

308
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,875
I borrowed money from your aunt
to pay your tuition fees.

309
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:58,375
What?

310
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,875
-Why did you borrow from her?
-Why not? I have no money.

311
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,791
No pay.

312
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:11,708
Fhon.

313
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,833
I don't think this is going to work.

314
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,125
Hey.

315
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,875
Don't think that.

316
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,708
How can I not?

317
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,541
It's pretty obvious.

318
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:33,125
Maybe these cows have some health issues
that we're not able to help with.

319
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,916
Do you really want to sell the farm?

320
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:45,916
Come on!

321
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,541
Let's try one more time.

322
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,041
Yeah.

323
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,666
Which song should we play this time?

324
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:57,458
The same song we played that night.

325
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,333
Just let the kids try, Pol.

326
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:38,166
<i>It's not easy for cows to produce</i>
<i>the same amount of milk.</i>

327
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:44,041
<i>These cows in the farm</i>
<i>can really sense happiness and sorrow</i>

328
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,791
<i>from humans like us.</i>

329
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:52,958
<i>So I made up my mind</i>
<i>to make myself happy again.</i>

330
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,666
They look better.

331
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,916
Excellent, my dear.

332
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,958
They have good appetite.

333
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,041
I'll put that milk on the truck.

334
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,333
All there?

335
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,416
Yes. Go deliver then.

336
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,208
Fern!

337
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,250
The water is nice, want to jump in?

338
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,333
Here you go.

339
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,833
I made this for you.

340
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,208
Is it too sweet? I added more sugar.

341
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,833
No, it's perfect!

342
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,083
<i>I believe that everyone</i>
<i>has their own dreams,</i>

343
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,875
<i>and hopes to live the life they desire.</i>

344
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:42,833
<i>But there are still many people</i>
<i>that have to let go of their dreams</i>

345
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:47,833
<i>to follow what someone believes is best.</i>

346
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:57,458
<i>I must be patient with work</i>
<i>even if it doesn't make me happy,</i>

347
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,458
<i>because it gives stability to my life.</i>

348
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:02,708
Please work on this, Irene.

349
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,375
Sure.

350
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,958
How many times did I tell you
how to fill out this form?

351
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,541
<i>I had to listen and keep my mouth shut.</i>

352
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:24,125
<i>I can't talk back</i>
<i>because the adult is always right.</i>

353
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:29,583
That's work. You can't expect things
to be the way you want.

354
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:34,083
You have to stay patient, my child.
Otherwise you can't make it work.

355
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:40,250
<i>But being patient with everything,</i>
<i>how can we bear that?</i>

356
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,166
<i>Damn.</i>

357
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,333
<i>Irene, where are you?</i>
<i>Where did you go?</i>

358
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,375
<i>I can't reach you since the morning.</i>

359
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm out of town, Mom.

360
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,416
And I will be here for a few days.

361
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,250
<i>Which province? Why?</i>
<i>Don't you have to work?</i>

362
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,750
<i>Did you take a leave?</i>

363
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,833
<i>How could you disappear like this</i>
<i>and not even tell me--</i>

364
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:21,500
Why don't you come with?
Can you really stay by yourself?

365
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:25,500
Yes, Mom. Don't worry.
I'm not here alone.

366
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,125
I am with Bo.

367
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,458
Don't worry, Mom.

368
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,458
Isn't that right, Bo?

369
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,083
-That's all right.
-She's going to be okay.

370
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,625
We're leaving for a few days.

371
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:38,375
She won't starve to death
even though she can't cook.

372
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,416
But she can make yummy instant noodles.

373
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,666
-That's right.
-Make sure you lock the doors.

374
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,625
Got it?

375
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,458
Roger that.

376
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,458
-Go, then.
-Stop being cheeky.

377
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,125
-Let's go.
-Stop teasing her.

378
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,458
-All the time.
<i>-Bye, bye.</i>

379
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:59,416
Safe trip!<i> Bye, bye.</i>

380
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:55,333
<i>You must know and understand</i>
<i>the business you are in.</i>

381
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:59,583
<i>You must be aware of the market,</i>
<i>of who your customer group is,</i>

382
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:03,291
<i>and how you can set yourself apart</i>
<i>from your competitors.</i>

383
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,750
Excuse me.

384
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,500
Are you looking for a room to stay?

385
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:33,666
We are currently closed for renovations
and not accepting guests.

386
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:35,666
Closed for renovations?

387
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:37,916
Now?

388
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,291
Hello, Dad.

389
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,166
Do we have a spare room?

390
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,416
Someone is looking for a room to stay.

391
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,833
But we have no vacancy.

392
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:00,166
<i>I've just finished painting</i>
<i>the guest room.</i>

393
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,250
<i>If she has no place to go,</i>
<i>you can find another room for her.</i>

394
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:07,208
<i>And don't forget to find things</i>
<i>for her to do as well.</i>

395
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,875
Got it, Dad.

396
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,708
Well, that's all.

397
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,625
Great.

398
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,583
Well?

399
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:27,500
Come this way.

400
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,041
We only have one room.

401
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:40,375
You can stay here, right?

402
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,291
Definitely.

403
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,875
But if I stay in this one,
where will you sleep tonight?

404
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,541
Don't worry.
I can sleep anywhere in my house.

405
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,750
You can settle in
and make yourself at home.

406
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,708
Oh, wait. What's your name?

407
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,333
I don't know your name yet.

408
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,791
My name is Now.

409
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,041
I'm Irene.

410
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,250
Irene.

411
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,708
I think we're the same age.

412
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,750
You don't need to be so polite.

413
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,166
If you need anything, just ask.

414
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:37,791
Why won't you answer my calls?
Why are you so irresponsible?

415
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,958
I've never taught my daughter
this kind of behavior.

416
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:05,666
You're up?
I was going to wake you up.

417
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,625
Good morning!

418
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,666
I've just made breakfast. Let's eat.

419
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,250
Come on.

420
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,791
Here.

421
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:18,333
It might look plain,
but its taste is world-class.

422
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,166
If you don't believe me,
sit down and try it.

423
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,041
Sit down.

424
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,583
Try this.

425
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,583
Go ahead.

426
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,375
How is it?

427
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,875
It's all right.

428
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,541
Well, well, well…

429
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:45,333
If you like it, just say so.
Not "it's all right."

430
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,875
Yesterday I saw a picture over there.

431
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,250
You have a cheese-making workshop?

432
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,166
Are you interested?

433
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,000
Yeah.

434
00:46:56,083 --> 00:47:00,875
My dad gives jewelry-making workshops
and cheese-making workshops.

435
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:04,250
But he's been busy
these past few months, so no workshops.

436
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:05,916
Really?

437
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,458
Yeah. If you're interested,
I can teach you.

438
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:18,875
Well, today we will make
mozzarella cheese.

439
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:21,166
You can eat it now,
as it won't take long.

440
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,916
If it was a cured cheese,
you wouldn't be able to,

441
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,583
as it takes some time.

442
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,958
We filter the milk.

443
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,041
You're making me blind!

444
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,958
Sorry, was the flash too harsh?

445
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,000
It's all right.

446
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:44,000
Now that we're done pouring the milk,
we'll just wait a little.

447
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,125
Let the milk seep through first.

448
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:50,416
Then put it down and warm the milk.

449
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,291
Put it down here.
To avoid getting it burned.

450
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,041
Okay. Next.

451
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:03,833
Stir it.

452
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:12,375
No, stir in a figure-eight motion.

453
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,333
Then add in yogurt.

454
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,458
Pour it all in. I've pre-measured it.

455
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:23,166
-Yes.
-Pour it all in?

456
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,458
Yes, I measured it.

457
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,208
Just wait for 45 minutes,
and it will form solid curds.

458
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,458
Then we will massage it.

459
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,875
Now the milk is coagulated.

460
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:42,041
We'll then cut it into even squares
starting from this line.

461
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:45,625
Be careful.

462
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:48,958
Careful.

463
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,500
Do it like this.

464
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,291
That's okay. Let me do it.

465
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,375
-Hey! Don't do that.
-Trust me.

466
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,666
It's breaking apart.

467
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,416
-I'm the farm owner.
-It's sticky.

468
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,458
-Because you squeezed it.
-'Cause two people are holding it!

469
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,000
Hold it like this.

470
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,500
I haven't tried it myself.

471
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,958
-Let me help you.
-It's my cheese.

472
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,375
I'm sorry.

473
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,208
I didn't mean to do that.

474
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,750
Can you forgive me?

475
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,708
Please.

476
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,208
Don't bother me.

477
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,125
I grilled some pork for you.

478
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,291
Huge piece!

479
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,375
Fine.

480
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:04,916
Give me your plate.

481
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,791
But this is not because of the food, okay?

482
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:16,750
I'll be right back.

483
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,500
Just a second.

484
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,666
Ta-da!

485
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,291
What is that?

486
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,166
You'll see.

487
00:50:35,458 --> 00:50:36,625
Smell it and guess.

488
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:43,750
Is it sour plum?

489
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,000
That's right!

490
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,125
I've never tried it.

491
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,708
So try it.

492
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,541
Almost there.

493
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:10,500
I told you not to worry.
I can get home by myself, okay?

494
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,416
Yeah, I know.

495
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,458
Kisses, Dad.

496
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,916
Kisses!

497
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:22,375
Just go to bed.

498
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:26,791
Hey!

499
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,208
Hey, Now!

500
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,875
What are you doing?

501
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,875
-Are you still mad at me?
-All right.

502
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:38,250
-Tell me that you aren't mad at me now.
-Who's mad…

503
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:47,500
You're very talented.

504
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,791
It's humid today. Not sure…

505
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:46,666
What are you doing?

506
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:50,375
This is my flower diary.

507
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:54,000
When I see beautiful flowers,
I'll keep a sample like this.

508
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,166
Red roses are believed
to be Cupid's flowers.

509
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,958
Dad. That's good.

510
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:15,875
-It's done.
-I'm hungry now.

511
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:18,333
-Hurry up, Dad!
-Now, take this to your friend.

512
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:21,916
Irene, I made this omelet for you.

513
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,833
You don't like northern-style curry?

514
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,000
-Then have this omelet, lots of it!
-Sure. Thank you.

515
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,208
Don't mention it.

516
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,958
So what is her name?

517
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,833
-Irene.
-I…

518
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:36,750
-Irene.
-I see. Irene.

519
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,666
She taught you how to make cheese?

520
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,833
Nothing crazy or weird, right?

521
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:43,958
If so, that means
what you taught me is weird.

522
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,500
Because I taught her exactly
what you taught me and others.

523
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,250
Don't say that.

524
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:50,875
How's the life here?

525
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:55,125
-You're speaking standard Thai.
-Well, I do know it.

526
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,500
Well, it's good. It's peaceful here.

527
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:02,291
And the landscape
is more beautiful than in the photos.

528
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,083
If it wasn't for me taking photos,
uploading them online,

529
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,000
and creating a booking website,

530
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:09,291
no one would get to see
the beauty of our farm.

531
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:12,708
Very talented.
She's smart like her dad.

532
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,708
Pretty like her mom.

533
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,333
Taking all the credits.

534
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:17,875
Now let's dig in.

535
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,541
-Try it.
-This is also very good.

536
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,500
This Hung Lay curry is delicious.

537
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,333
-Listen to him.
-Yeah.

538
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,250
He doesn't sound like your dad.

539
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,916
From time to time.

540
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,875
-Who's this?
-Is he our neighbor?

541
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:06,916
You're an expert!

542
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,250
No, I'm just average.

543
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,375
Your mom and dad are so kind.

544
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:20,875
They're so funny and warm.

545
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:27,000
If I had parents like yours,
I'd be the happiest person in the world.

546
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,166
Honestly, it's not exactly like that.

547
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,791
You see me and my dad like this,
but sometimes we've fought and I cried.

548
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,500
Like this.

549
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,208
Dad!

550
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:44,333
-You're exaggerating!
-Don't believe me?

551
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,833
Exactly like this.

552
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,125
Calm down.

553
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:52,833
I got it.

554
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,625
What's next?

555
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:05,791
What is that?

556
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,875
It's concentrated rose water.

557
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:12,500
I'm thinking of mixing it in to make
Rosetta cheese.

558
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,958
Rosetta cheese?

559
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,916
-Right.
-Rose cheese, really?

560
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,833
-Will it work?
-You won't know until you try.

561
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,375
But it might be a waste of time.

562
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:28,000
Don't be so serious.
At least we tried.

563
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,583
In fact, you're the person
who gave me the idea.

564
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:36,333
They represent love, desire,
and bring good luck for love.

565
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,250
Come on. Let's add it in.

566
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,708
Coming through. Sorry!

567
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,750
The historic moment.

568
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:53,625
Here we go.

569
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:09,125
The color isn't showing up at all.

570
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:12,541
This might not work. What do you think?

571
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,625
We have to wait and see.

572
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,000
Wait for it.

573
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:20,291
Then decide whether it works or not.

574
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,875
How long will it take?

575
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,166
Well, at least four months.

576
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,208
Really? Four months?

577
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,458
I'll miss it then.

578
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,250
Because if it takes four months,

579
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,916
I won't be here anymore.

580
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,208
I thought I'd be the first
to see a rose curdled cheese.

581
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,708
Very simple.
You can come back in four months.

582
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,750
If you come back,
we'll look at it together.

583
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,791
The sky is so beautiful.

584
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,958
This is the first time
I see this many stars.

585
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:07,666
Is that right?

586
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,958
This is why I love this place so much.

587
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:14,041
You've never thought
of getting a job in town?

588
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:17,000
Never.

589
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:22,083
I'm happy here,
helping my folks manage the homestay.

590
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,000
That's true.

591
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,375
If I could choose,
I wouldn't want to go work anywhere else.

592
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,541
Hey.

593
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,958
Do you see those stars?

594
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:37,541
Where?

595
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,875
Over there!
That is the Orion constellation.

596
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:45,416
The stars all look the same.
How can you tell?

597
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,833
Those. And then down here.

598
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:50,708
Do you see?

599
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,833
Yeah, maybe.

600
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,208
Why?

601
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,541
There's an old saying…

602
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,916
If you get lost in the forest,
look for the Orion constellation.

603
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,750
Once you see Orion,

604
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,333
you'll see the North Star.

605
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:08,541
And Orion

606
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,291
will always face the North Star.

607
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:16,125
But if we're not in the forest,
there's no need to find the North Star.

608
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:18,250
Just in case.

609
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,541
If one day you get lost,

610
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:23,916
you can find your way home.

611
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:59,375
MOM: Have a safe trip back home.

612
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:02,250
Come home. I'm worried.

613
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:18,125
Sandwiches…

614
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:22,166
What are you doing? You startled me.

615
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,208
So what are you doing?

616
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,208
Sandwiches.

617
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,333
Because today,

618
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,458
I'll take you for a bike ride.

619
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:37,791
We'll go to the flower garden
and have a picnic there.

620
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,833
There's a waterfall too.

621
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:40,916
Great for selfies.

622
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,333
You know how to ride a bike?

623
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:47,875
What's with the face?

624
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,583
You don't want to go?

625
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:54,083
Well, if you don't,
we can find something else to do here.

626
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:57,541
It's not that I don't want to go.

627
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:00,958
But…

628
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,125
I came here to say goodbye.

629
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:09,375
Sorry that I can't go do things with you.

630
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:16,625
It's okay.

631
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,833
And how will you get home?

632
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:21,791
I'll call a cab for you.

633
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:25,375
It's okay. I can do it.
I don't want to trouble you.

634
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:30,458
It's my job to take
the best care of my customer.

635
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:34,000
Just wait here.
I'll call a cab for you.

636
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:36,708
Be right back.

637
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:59,958
Thank you for your hospitality.

638
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:04,500
You're welcome.
Have a safe trip back home.

639
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,125
I'm going now.

640
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:13,458
Good luck.

641
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,708
Good luck!

642
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:26,375
Irene, dear.

643
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,291
Where have you been?

644
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,541
I was so worried about you.

645
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,500
Where did you go?
Why didn't you tell me?

646
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,791
You made me worry so much.

647
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:44,250
If something happened to you,
how could I live?

648
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:47,916
If you have a problem, just come home.
You can tell me.

649
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,250
I thought something happened to you.

650
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,333
Don't do it again, okay?

651
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,333
If something's going on, talk to me.

652
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:04,458
When I call, please answer.
So I know where you are.

653
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:10,958
<i>A happy person doesn't necessarily</i>
<i>have all the best things in his life.</i>

654
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:15,958
<i>He just works with what he has</i>
<i>to the best of his ability.</i>

655
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:20,208
<i>Many things happen in our life</i>

656
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:23,041
<i>for us to embrace them</i>
<i>and learn from them.</i>

657
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:27,000
<i>Many people come and go everyday.</i>

658
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,250
<i>Among those people,</i>

659
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:37,291
<i>there must be at least one person</i>
<i>that can make us feel "extraordinary."</i>

660
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,333
<i>Someone we can share our feelings with</i>…

661
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:42,375
GO BACK IN 4 MONTHS

662
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:47,083
<i>our accomplishments,</i>
<i>problems, ups and downs,</i>

663
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,041
<i>without fear of rejection.</i>

664
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,125
<i>I think it's time now.</i>

665
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:57,000
-Not yet.
-Not yet?

666
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,291
This is Rosetta? I see.

667
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:18,708
Bo!

668
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,916
Do you think Irene will keep her promise?

669
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:39,916
Are you saying no?

670
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,541
What?

671
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:44,750
Bo!

672
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,041
Bo, where are you going?

673
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:48,500
Bo!

674
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,500
Where are you going? Bo!

675
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:52,958
Bo!

676
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,958
I'm sorry I got here so late.

677
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,791
I couldn't get a ride.

678
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,000
Just a little late.

679
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:31,750
I missed you.

680
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,166
<i>If you go, I'll miss you.</i>

681
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,916
But if you're happy, I'm also happy.

682
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:09,125
We did it!

683
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:19,875
Okay?

684
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,875
GO ALL THE WAY - STOP RIGHT BY YOU

685
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,500
What? Prang's not here yet?

686
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,208
She said she was on her way.

687
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,333
Late as always.

688
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:37,791
Damn.

689
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:39,833
Speak of the devil!

690
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:43,416
-Please put everything in the car.
-Yes, ma'am.

691
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:46,916
Here I am!

692
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,541
You're late again.

693
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:53,541
What time do you have to deliver by?

694
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:58,208
We'll make it. We have plenty of time.
It's only an hour or so to get to town.

695
01:08:58,291 --> 01:08:59,750
Be sure to get there in time.

696
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:03,625
If the customer complains,
I'll dock 10% of your pay.

697
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:07,041
Another 20% if you drive recklessly
and you ruin the cheese.

698
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:11,208
Okay, calm down.
I won't do it anymore. Promise.

699
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:13,500
Of course!

700
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,375
All done now!

701
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,000
I'm going now.

702
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,916
-Okay, hurry up!
-Don't dock my pay.

703
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,208
-Want to go now?
-Yes! Yes!

704
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:31,458
Those people are cheapskates!

705
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:36,750
Hello, Prang!

706
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,625
Hey!

707
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:41,125
Do you remember me?

708
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,833
Mew.

709
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:44,625
Remember me?

710
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:48,083
Well, of course.

711
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,625
So why are you here?

712
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:58,458
Well, Dow told me you work here,
so I came to see you.

713
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:03,291
Would you mind taking me to the city?

714
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:05,208
What?

715
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:07,958
Where are you going?

716
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:08,916
Bangkok.

717
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:10,583
Bangkok?

718
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,541
Could you do me the favor?

719
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,750
I want to go to the city,

720
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,583
but I don't really know
anybody except you.

721
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:21,625
Please.

722
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:24,708
What are you doing?

723
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,625
I'm leaving.

724
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,291
Get in first.

725
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,250
Don't talk here.

726
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,958
Thanks.

727
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:40,041
Hey, where is all your stuff?

728
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:41,875
In the trunk.

729
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,958
Let's go. Or we'll be late.

730
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:49,625
Fine. Okay.

731
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,583
Prang.

732
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:17,041
Can you slow down a bit? I want to live.

733
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,541
Prang.

734
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:23,958
Prang!

735
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,666
-What?
-Can you slow down?

736
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,083
And turn down the volume.

737
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,208
Oh, all right!

738
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,833
You've changed a lot.

739
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:49,833
I never saw this wild side of you.

740
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,000
Driving so fast?

741
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,958
I'm used to driving like this. Sorry!

742
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,125
What time is your train leaving?

743
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:07,250
At 2:50 p.m. But we should
get there around 1:00 p.m.

744
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:10,333
How about you?
What time do you need to deliver by?

745
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,083
Well, around the same time.

746
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,250
Then…

747
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:23,791
Once we get to town, you can drop me off,
and I'll get another ride.

748
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:28,083
Hey! That's okay.
I'll drop you off at the train station.

749
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:30,000
Don't worry, I'll make it.

750
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,583
So, why are you going to Bangkok?

751
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:38,916
Meeting a date?

752
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,791
What? No, I'm meeting a friend.

753
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,291
-Friend?
-Yeah.

754
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,083
How do you have a friend in Bangkok?

755
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,500
We met on an app.
We've been talking for a few months.

756
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,416
-An app?
-Right.

757
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

758
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,500
What, Prang?

759
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:04,916
Nothing.

760
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:07,916
Okay, then,

761
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:11,083
is this friend a man or a woman?

762
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:12,666
A man.

763
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,708
Fine. Thing is…

764
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:25,375
I'm actually going
to Bangkok to live with him.

765
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,291
Jesus, Prang!

766
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,708
-Prang!
-Shit!

767
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,750
You're crazy! Prang!
What the hell are you doing?

768
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:47,583
I'm sorry.

769
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,375
Jesus…

770
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:53,000
Damn, I shouldn't have come with you!

771
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,083
Do you want me to die
before I have a husband?

772
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:23,541
Hello, boo?

773
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,791
In a car.

774
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:28,875
Yes.

775
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,583
Don't you remember?

776
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:37,541
I've told you a million times
the train departs at around 2:00.

777
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,583
What did you say?

778
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,291
Stop flirting!

779
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,250
Slut!

780
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,541
Bitch!

781
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:53,875
Okay.

782
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:59,541
Sure. Well, once I get there,
I'll call you, boo.

783
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:03,000
Don't you worry.

784
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,833
You're too worried.

785
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:08,708
Damn, you're driving so slow!
Just go home if that's how it'll be!

786
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:15,625
Look at him. He drives like a turtle.

787
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,250
No, nothing.

788
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,875
She's one of my old friends.

789
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,041
Well, I asked her for a ride.

790
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,666
What are you saying?

791
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:33,833
You're teasing me again.
Are you crazy? I'm blushing!

792
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,291
Yes.

793
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,666
That silly cat?

794
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:42,625
Yes.

795
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,750
I already asked my mom to take care of it.

796
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:47,958
Don't worry, okay?

797
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:50,875
I don't care about that anymore.

798
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,250
I'd rather love you only.

799
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:55,666
Yes.

800
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,833
I went to ask the drink seller.

801
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:15,708
She didn't know anything
about the shop your dad mentioned.

802
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:17,000
Are you sure it's right?

803
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,250
I think so.

804
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,916
Why don't you check Google Maps?

805
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,208
-I don't have internet on my phone.
-Okay, wait.

806
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:29,625
Well,

807
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:32,125
-neither do I.
-What?

808
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:35,958
What should we do then?

809
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,375
Screw it!

810
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,750
Hey! You.

811
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:45,583
You can't do this.
I brought you here on my bike!

812
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:49,875
-Let's ask people around here again.
-It's okay if we can't find it.

813
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,791
I'll tell my dad.

814
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:56,875
But since we're here,
let's have some cake.

815
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:00,375
I heard that there's a new cute café.

816
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,083
The reviews say
their cheesecake is bomb.

817
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:04,708
Want to try it?

818
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:06,166
My treat.

819
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,916
Are you trying to flirt with me?

820
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,166
Flirt?

821
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:18,250
No! I just want to eat some cake.

822
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,041
That place has just opened.
You don't want to try it?

823
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:22,541
Well,

824
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:26,000
I think you're lying 'cause your eyes
look up and your nose expands.

825
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:28,708
Don't lie.

826
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:30,916
Don't you want to eat?

827
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,458
Yeah.

828
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:35,250
We have come this far,
might as well go there.

829
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:36,208
Okay.

830
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:38,958
Yeah.

831
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:44,750
What's that?
You went to a cooking class?

832
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,250
For me?

833
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:49,416
Of course! I'll try it then.

834
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,291
Make it good, okay?

835
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:54,583
If it's not good,

836
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,291
I'll teach you myself.

837
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,833
What's that?

838
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,458
Hey.

839
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:06,625
<i>Hello?</i> Hey!

840
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:09,250
Yeah, the signal's bad here.

841
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:11,666
I see.

842
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,083
How long will it take to get there?

843
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:25,958
It's about 10 to 15 minutes to the city.

844
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,416
We'll get there before 1:00 p.m. for sure.

845
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:32,375
This is a shortcut.

846
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:38,541
Come on!

847
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,500
-What's wrong with the car?
-What happened?

848
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,791
Hey! Come on!

849
01:18:48,541 --> 01:18:51,291
-What happened, Prang?
-It doesn't go into gear.

850
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:56,416
-Probably a problem with the clutch.
-Yeah. What is a clutch?

851
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:59,000
Okay, wait. I'll call a mechanic.

852
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:01,000
I don't get much signal around here.

853
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:02,791
Just my luck!

854
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:08,833
Where can I get signal?

855
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,291
Mew.

856
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:01,166
My friend is a mechanic,
he'll come take a look.

857
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,500
We'll wait here.

858
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,458
When will he be here?

859
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:10,041
In 30 minutes or so.

860
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:15,375
Good thing I left earlier.
Otherwise, I'd have missed my train.

861
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:21,500
Hey, do you think if I hitch hike
around here, someone will pick me up?

862
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:26,958
No, I don't think so.

863
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:34,916
Don't worry, you'll get there in time.

864
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,125
I also need to deliver my cheese.

865
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:46,708
Hey, your boyfriend in Bangkok,

866
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,541
do you trust him?

867
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:51,041
Making you go to Bangkok,

868
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:54,250
don't you think he's luring you for sex?

869
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:57,291
Prang, you and your potty mouth.

870
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:02,208
I just worry about you
being alone in Bangkok.

871
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,333
It's quite dangerous, you know?

872
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:06,500
I'm not afraid.

873
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:11,625
Besides, once I get there,
not only will I have a husband,

874
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:13,583
I'll also get a job.

875
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,083
If he happens to deceive me,

876
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:22,208
I'll leave him then,
and focus on making money.

877
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:24,125
That's it!

878
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,291
Well, if you really want to work,

879
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,750
there is plenty of work here.

880
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:35,583
The cost of living
in Bangkok is so high.

881
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,625
Do you like paying 100 baht for a meal?

882
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,958
This government causes
things to be expensive everywhere.

883
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:43,041
And,

884
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:47,541
if I stay, what can I do?
Be a delivery person like you?

885
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,833
Hey!

886
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:50,833
What's wrong with my job?

887
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,375
Do you think you can find a job
in Bangkok that easily?

888
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:57,416
If everyone thought the same,
they'd all move to Bangkok.

889
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:02,166
Enough! Stop talking about boring stuff.

890
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:08,416
Can I turn on some music?
And can I see your phone?

891
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,166
Mine has no internet.

892
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:15,750
Hey!

893
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:23,750
Is this our photo from the cheer tryouts?

894
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:25,541
Yeah.

895
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:32,791
Hey…

896
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,250
My boobs are bigger now.
Am I <i>sexy?</i>

897
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:38,916
No.

898
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,416
No matter how much you stuff them,
you're not getting any bigger.

899
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,583
You're getting on my nerve!

900
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,541
You're never supportive.

901
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:52,041
No.

902
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:56,500
What if you dance and the toilet paper
comes out on a guy, what should I do?

903
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:59,333
Bitch! You're constantly bad-mouthing me!

904
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:00,750
Also,

905
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,875
your finger touched my nose.

906
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:06,583
I have to powder it again.

907
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,958
Well, I'm just teasing you.

908
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:11,916
-Don't take it seriously.
-You messed it up.

909
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,083
Next step…

910
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:21,750
Is the best!

911
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,875
You know how to put eyeliner on?

912
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,583
No. I'm trying it now.

913
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:31,833
Hey!

914
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:33,250
Asshole!

915
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:34,541
Hey!

916
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:37,458
I'm concentrating. Bitch!

917
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,916
Well, your mouth is agape.

918
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,708
Need help? Come on.

919
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,666
-Do you know how to?
-Trust me!

920
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:48,791
Come here!

921
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
<i>Why do you still have this picture?</i>

922
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:14,416
Well, it reminds me of high school.

923
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:19,000
I wanted to crop you out.
But the picture looked too pixelated.

924
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:21,291
So I just kept it as-is.

925
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:22,833
Really?

926
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,625
Actually,

927
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,708
we had a great time back then, huh?

928
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:32,708
When are you talking about?

929
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:35,583
High school or…

930
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:37,958
when we were dating?

931
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:41,166
Well,

932
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:42,583
both.

933
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:00,208
Hey, your friend's here.

934
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:05,041
Yeah. You wait in the car.
I'll talk to him.

935
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:07,791
Why do you want me to wait inside?

936
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,500
It's so hot. Come on!

937
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:12,458
It's the same temperature inside,
and the windows are down.

938
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,583
Get in. It's much more comfortable.
I'll be right back.

939
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:16,708
What the heck?

940
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:23,750
Hurry up!

941
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:30,083
-What's the problem?
-Come take a look.

942
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:33,250
It'll be quite difficult.

943
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,416
-How do you open it?
-Oh, idiot!

944
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:40,833
There.

945
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:46,750
You jerk! You came too quickly!

946
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,041
I have work to do.

947
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:52,583
My bro would've gotten mad
if I came at the time you told me to!

948
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:54,208
What's up with you?

949
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:55,833
Why so sneaky?

950
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:58,125
None of your business.

951
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:02,083
Well, don't forget the cash you promised.

952
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:03,708
Here.

953
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:34,666
Okay. I'm leaving now.

954
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:39,875
-Bye, bye.
-Damn. Just get going, man!

955
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,250
Let's go. It's done.

956
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,333
Prang.

957
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,833
Let's stop by the gas station for me.

958
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:51,125
Why? Are you hungry?

959
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,125
I need to pee.

960
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:12,000
Are you visiting?

961
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,708
Oh, no.

962
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:17,791
I'm just carpooling with my friend
from Mae Win to the city.

963
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:21,291
That's a long way. This is a detour.

964
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:23,083
Why did she take this route?

965
01:27:23,166 --> 01:27:25,875
She said it's a shortcut.

966
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:28,583
No, it isn't.
No one takes this route.

967
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:32,833
People mainly take it
to sightsee and take pictures.

968
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,750
You came a long way.

969
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,500
You've been tricked.

970
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:41,541
It's not this way.

971
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:03,500
Hey, Mew, where are you going?

972
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:04,916
I'm leaving now.

973
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,791
I'll go to the train station by myself.

974
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:11,375
What? What's going on?

975
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:14,041
Prang!

976
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:16,708
Are you lying to make me late?

977
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:22,083
Nonsense! What are you talking about?

978
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:23,541
I know

979
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,666
you're taking me the long way.

980
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:28,291
And this freaking car
wasn't broken, was it?

981
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:32,625
Answer me!

982
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,166
Why are you doing this?

983
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:41,416
Okay. I also want to ask you something.

984
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:46,125
You said you were happy with me.

985
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:48,666
So why did you leave me?

986
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:54,125
All those years that you were gone…

987
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,583
I never forgot about you!

988
01:28:58,833 --> 01:28:59,666
You know?

989
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:03,875
I drove here and there to find you.

990
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:06,875
For a chance
to talk to you one more time.

991
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:09,625
As a friend or whatever.

992
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:14,625
And suddenly, you show up today.

993
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:17,833
So why should I let you go again?

994
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:28,833
Mew, I'm sorry.

995
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,666
Please come back to the car.

996
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:36,541
You won't be able to get a ride here.
It's dangerous.

997
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:44,416
If I go with you, how will I be sure
that you won't do it again?

998
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:31,625
Hey, don't give up!

999
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:37,416
-You can do it.
-Thank you.

1000
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,166
Hi, pretty girl.

1001
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:19,000
Where are you going? Need a ride?

1002
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,000
Come with me, it's safe.

1003
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:25,791
-It's dangerous around here.
-Don't touch me! Go away!

1004
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:26,708
Trust me!

1005
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:29,625
-I'll take you there.
-Go away!

1006
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:32,083
Nobody can help you.
You're so beautiful.

1007
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:35,583
-Help!
-You're the safest with me.

1008
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,750
Nothing to be afraid of.
I'll take you there.

1009
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:41,083
-Help!
-You'll be safe with me.

1010
01:32:41,166 --> 01:32:42,000
Help!

1011
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:46,750
Back off!

1012
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,250
Thank you.

1013
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:38,041
There's plenty of time.

1014
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:40,166
Want to come say goodbye?

1015
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,833
Excuse me!

1016
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,166
Has the train arrived yet?

1017
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:02,916
Not yet.

1018
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:05,333
Thank you.

1019
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:12,041
So,

1020
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:14,458
will the train only stop for a minute?

1021
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:22,875
Prang.

1022
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:27,916
When you asked me…

1023
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,208
why I left you,

1024
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:33,875
it was probably because…

1025
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:44,875
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>our relationship could be serious.</i>

1026
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,041
<i>I'm sorry…</i>

1027
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:53,041
<i>I left you and thought</i>
<i>you would slowly forget about me.</i>

1028
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,666
If you still can't move on,

1029
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:00,791
I just want to tell you this.

1030
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:08,458
No matter what, I can't go back to be
the same old Mew that you loved.

1031
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:15,208
Hey!

1032
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:18,000
Why are you getting dramatic now?

1033
01:36:20,291 --> 01:36:21,500
<i>I'm okay.</i>

1034
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,708
<i>I didn't think about it at all.</i>

1035
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:35,083
But when you mentioned
me going to Bangkok

1036
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:36,458
and whether it'll work or not,

1037
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:44,000
I too pondered over the same thing.

1038
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:47,666
But, shit,

1039
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:51,041
nobody really cares about me.

1040
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:57,583
Maybe I shouldn't go?

1041
01:36:58,666 --> 01:36:59,833
Hey, Mew!

1042
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:10,000
Can you stay with me for a while?

1043
01:37:27,833 --> 01:37:30,750
IRENE
KIRI FARM SHOP

1044
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:36,875
I'm sorry.

1045
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:39,208
I need to deliver the cheese.

1046
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:43,000
Hope that's all right with you.

1047
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:51,875
Prang!

1048
01:37:57,458 --> 01:37:58,916
You're not mad at me, right?

1049
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:04,541
I am.

1050
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:08,291
You should go.

1051
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:36,875
NONG LOM

1052
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,916
Kidding! I was never upset with you.

1053
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,333
Good luck with your journey,
my dear friend.

1054
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:18,291
<i>Just what I thought, you're late.</i>

1055
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:20,625
I'm here.

1056
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:24,583
<i>Hello, guys. I'm Patt.</i>

1057
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:26,916
<i>And this girl is Meiji.</i>

1058
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,750
<i>The most annoying human being</i>
<i>in the universe.</i>

1059
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:42,708
Hello.

1060
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:44,500
Hello.

1061
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:47,375
This café is so beautiful.

1062
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:50,458
I come here often,
but I've never seen this one.

1063
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:52,250
Excuse me.

1064
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:54,916
I'd like to order a cake.

1065
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:57,250
Sure.

1066
01:41:58,875 --> 01:42:00,750
Which cake would you like?

1067
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:05,791
I'd like a minimalistic, one-pound cake.

1068
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:07,916
And I want it in a color…

1069
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,250
that when people see it,
they fall in love.

1070
01:42:13,166 --> 01:42:15,125
<i>Color that will make people fall in love?</i>

1071
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:16,625
<i>What does it mean?</i>

1072
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,250
What would you like to write on it?

1073
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:26,666
Are you single? Can I flirt with you?

1074
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:27,583
What?

1075
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,875
I mean, the message on the cake.

1076
01:42:34,291 --> 01:42:35,291
My name is Meiji.

1077
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,416
My house is next to this café.
How about yours?

1078
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,541
What's your name?

1079
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:42,250
<i>That's it.</i>

1080
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:45,791
<i>My life hasn't been peaceful ever since.</i>

1081
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,291
What?

1082
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:00,041
Damn!

1083
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:03,500
<i>I left town and opened</i>
<i>this caf</i>é<i> in the countryside</i>

1084
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:05,333
<i>because I needed peace.</i>

1085
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:09,625
<i>And my life had been</i>
<i>so perfect before it got all ruined</i>

1086
01:43:09,708 --> 01:43:10,833
<i>by this silly girl.</i>

1087
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:14,291
Patt, can you hear me?

1088
01:43:16,041 --> 01:43:17,250
Patt!

1089
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:21,083
Hey, where are you going?

1090
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:29,458
Let's take photos.

1091
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:30,750
Come on. Let's take photos.

1092
01:43:30,833 --> 01:43:31,916
Hurry up.

1093
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,333
This corner is great.

1094
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:36,708
One, two, say "cheese"!

1095
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,500
Pretty. Pretty. Great!

1096
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:44,041
Definitely send me some of them.

1097
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:50,541
Oh, are you leaving now?

1098
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:51,916
Yes.

1099
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:59,166
<i>I don't want to have</i>
<i>any issues with my neighbor.</i>

1100
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:02,083
<i>So I decided to let it go and do nothing.</i>

1101
01:44:06,416 --> 01:44:09,958
<i>Besides, she is a regular customer</i>

1102
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:14,041
<i>that comes for cakes</i>
<i>with cheesy pick-up lines on top.</i>

1103
01:44:14,125 --> 01:44:18,875
<i>Those unfiltered, silly words are probably</i>
<i>for some guy she has a crush on.</i>

1104
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:21,750
It looks so yummy!

1105
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:26,125
-I'll take--
-Patt! I'd like to order a cake.

1106
01:44:26,666 --> 01:44:28,583
<i>There she is.</i>

1107
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:32,750
I have no chair at home.
Can I sit on your heart then?

1108
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,375
What?

1109
01:44:35,041 --> 01:44:37,791
Want a raisin?
No? How about a date?

1110
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:43,875
Are you worn-out, my love?
I want you to be mine.

1111
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:47,500
<i>Well, she keeps ordering,</i>
<i>but no luck with love yet.</i>

1112
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,875
Can I learn how to bake with you?

1113
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:53,375
No, Patt!

1114
01:44:53,458 --> 01:44:55,583
That's not a message for the cake!

1115
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:57,125
I asked you for a class.

1116
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,250
What?

1117
01:44:59,333 --> 01:45:00,750
There's no baking class here.

1118
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:03,083
Please teach me.

1119
01:45:03,708 --> 01:45:07,875
I think that your cakes are great!

1120
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:09,916
And I want to learn how to bake like you.

1121
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,208
-Ordering one is much easier.
-No!

1122
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:18,833
I want to bake a cake
for someone I have a crush on,

1123
01:45:18,916 --> 01:45:20,416
but I don't know how.

1124
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,083
So I want to learn from you.

1125
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:26,791
Normally, you just order a cake.
You have plenty of times.

1126
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:29,125
But this person is different.

1127
01:45:29,625 --> 01:45:34,000
I'd like to show
my efforts and honesty to this one.

1128
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:38,166
Can you please teach me?

1129
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:43,333
I know that you don't really like me.

1130
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,541
How about this?

1131
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:49,000
If you teach me,
I'll stop bothering you,

1132
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:50,791
and won't come here again.

1133
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:54,375
<i>Actually, this offer sounds really good.</i>

1134
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:58,291
Okay, how about…

1135
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:01,541
I help you at the café for free?

1136
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:03,666
Would that interest you?

1137
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,875
<i>This offer is even more interesting.</i>

1138
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:06,791
<i>What should I do?</i>

1139
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:10,666
<i>I'd just bake cakes</i>
<i>and have this girl watch the café,</i>

1140
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,083
<i>-clean the floor, tables and dishes</i>…
-All for free.

1141
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:18,958
Well, okay.

1142
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:21,500
-Really?
-But…

1143
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:23,291
do not cause any trouble.

1144
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:24,208
Got it?

1145
01:46:24,708 --> 01:46:27,250
Okay, I won't be annoying.

1146
01:46:27,333 --> 01:46:28,250
I promise!

1147
01:46:31,166 --> 01:46:32,291
I'm here.

1148
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:46,625
<i>Did I make</i>
<i>the right decision to teach her?</i>

1149
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:49,291
Are you okay?

1150
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:01,208
<i>She's cleaning it up.</i>

1151
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,416
<i>I haven't told her to do so.</i>

1152
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:08,333
Meiji.

1153
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:10,166
Just wear mine.

1154
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:12,666
And put those away, okay?

1155
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:16,041
I told you to wear non-slip shoes.
Don't you remember?

1156
01:47:16,916 --> 01:47:20,458
I couldn't find any.
I only have this pair.

1157
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:22,958
Just wear mine then.

1158
01:47:23,041 --> 01:47:24,916
Otherwise, you'll destroy my kitchen!

1159
01:47:26,416 --> 01:47:27,250
Okay.

1160
01:47:28,166 --> 01:47:29,000
Thank you.

1161
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,208
Patt.

1162
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:41,125
Is this good?

1163
01:47:41,708 --> 01:47:43,791
Yes! Pour it in the bowl now.

1164
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:05,875
Just add butter.

1165
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:09,208
Then use a spatula
to mix it well together.

1166
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:10,750
Then pour it into the mold.

1167
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:12,750
Press it tightly and smoothly.

1168
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,083
Got it.

1169
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:32,166
Sorry.

1170
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:35,625
I want to put this hair clip on you.

1171
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:38,041
Don't be annoyed with me.

1172
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:41,291
<i>Damn it!</i>

1173
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,625
<i>Why am I blushing?</i>

1174
01:48:45,875 --> 01:48:46,750
Thanks!

1175
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:55,250
Well, what kind of cake
do you want for your crush?

1176
01:48:56,916 --> 01:48:58,666
What kind of cake do you like?

1177
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,458
I have no <i>idea, </i>so I'm asking you.

1178
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:12,500
There's chiffon cake, butter cake…

1179
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,291
But they require baking.

1180
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:17,500
And cheese pie, which we're making now.

1181
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:23,458
Then I'll try the chiffon cake.

1182
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:25,083
I'd like to try baking a cake.

1183
01:49:25,625 --> 01:49:29,375
Okay. We'll bake one this evening.

1184
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:31,166
Really?

1185
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:55,958
Mr. Off, you're here a little early today.

1186
01:49:56,041 --> 01:49:57,166
That's right.

1187
01:49:57,833 --> 01:50:01,583
Your café is really pretty
and has good vibes.

1188
01:50:02,333 --> 01:50:03,333
The cakes are so yummy.

1189
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,833
I have much more energy to work.

1190
01:50:05,916 --> 01:50:08,500
So, do you want a hot cocoa as usual?

1191
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:11,666
Oh, my gosh, Patt, you're so awesome!

1192
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:14,166
You remember what each customer likes?

1193
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:16,125
Not really.

1194
01:50:17,416 --> 01:50:21,958
Hey, I added you on LINE,
so please accept my request.

1195
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:23,708
-Sure.
-Thanks.

1196
01:50:41,125 --> 01:50:44,166
<i>When she behaves</i>
<i>like a normal person, she's quite cute.</i>

1197
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:48,291
Meiji.

1198
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:51,041
Do you want to try decorating the cake?

1199
01:50:51,791 --> 01:50:52,666
Yes.

1200
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,625
Okay. I'll teach you then.

1201
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:56,791
Let's try piping on the tray first.

1202
01:50:56,875 --> 01:51:00,333
Okay, carefully squeeze the piping bag.

1203
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:03,125
and write uniform characters.

1204
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,208
Here. Just try it.

1205
01:51:08,875 --> 01:51:10,500
Hey, no!

1206
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:12,458
This way. You need to squeeze slowly.

1207
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:14,708
And carefully squeeze it like this.

1208
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:18,625
If you squeeze too hard,
it can come out too much.

1209
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:19,541
Get it?

1210
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:21,083
I got it.

1211
01:51:35,541 --> 01:51:38,166
<i>Don't do it, Patt! What am I doing?</i>

1212
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:45,458
Here, just like that. Try it.

1213
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,750
Oh, Patt.

1214
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:14,708
You haven't told me
what kind of cake you like.

1215
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:15,625
Me?

1216
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:23,333
I like cheese pie
with lots of fresh tart fruits

1217
01:52:23,416 --> 01:52:25,958
like strawberries or lemon.

1218
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,125
How about you?

1219
01:52:28,208 --> 01:52:30,458
Who's your crush?
Why haven't you told me?

1220
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:32,000
Been liking him for a while?

1221
01:52:33,375 --> 01:52:36,625
Yes, for a while.
That person is my senior.

1222
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:40,583
The reason you've ordered
all my cakes is to flirt with who?

1223
01:52:42,833 --> 01:52:44,625
The same person!

1224
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:48,958
But that person
is not interested in me yet.

1225
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:54,375
I thought that if I baked it myself,
it would show my great efforts.

1226
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,750
You're crazy!

1227
01:52:57,833 --> 01:53:02,166
This guy must be very handsome
for you to do this much!

1228
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:05,000
No. She's very beautiful.

1229
01:53:07,916 --> 01:53:10,583
What? You're crazy!

1230
01:53:11,458 --> 01:53:14,500
Go pick up all your stuff and go home now.

1231
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:16,666
Go on! Hurry up. And follow me.

1232
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:19,458
Okay. Hey, please wait for me.

1233
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,375
I'm leaving now.

1234
01:53:35,916 --> 01:53:37,625
<i>She has a crush on a woman?</i>

1235
01:53:43,208 --> 01:53:44,458
Hey!

1236
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:52,875
MEIJI

1237
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:57,041
A-ha!

1238
01:53:57,666 --> 01:53:59,541
Are you peeking at me?

1239
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:05,333
What the heck are you doing?

1240
01:54:05,416 --> 01:54:06,625
That scared me!

1241
01:54:06,708 --> 01:54:10,208
You looked so funny
when you were stunned!

1242
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:13,250
Hey, if this is just a prank,
I'll hang up.

1243
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:17,166
Don't hang up yet, I apologize.
I'll stop teasing you.

1244
01:54:18,125 --> 01:54:22,458
Why are you still up?
Are you thinking of someone?

1245
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:24,125
It's not that.

1246
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,916
I have a question for you.

1247
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,833
I told you so many things.

1248
01:54:30,916 --> 01:54:32,541
Do you have a boyfriend?

1249
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:35,041
-I just want to know.
-No, I don't want to.

1250
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:37,458
Tell me, please!

1251
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:43,750
We broke up a long time ago.

1252
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:45,125
What happened?

1253
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:49,708
He cheated on me, and got her pregnant.

1254
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:51,791
I was so disappointed and sad.

1255
01:54:51,875 --> 01:54:54,166
That's terrible.

1256
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,083
How about that guy called Off?

1257
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:59,375
You're so annoying!

1258
01:54:59,458 --> 01:55:02,750
I'm happy taking care
of my café and myself.

1259
01:55:02,833 --> 01:55:05,208
I don't want a boyfriend. Is that clear?

1260
01:55:07,208 --> 01:55:08,916
Why did you shut down your chances?

1261
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,166
You should give it a try.

1262
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:16,250
Maybe someone has a crush on you,
and they won't make you regret it.

1263
01:55:17,375 --> 01:55:19,208
Is that all you have to say?

1264
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:20,833
Oh, no.

1265
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:23,750
I wanted to tell you
that I had so much fun today.

1266
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:26,916
I got to do many different things.

1267
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,083
I really enjoyed it.
And thank you so much.

1268
01:55:32,666 --> 01:55:33,958
Glad you had a good time.

1269
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:37,166
There'll be some more fun stuff
to do tomorrow. Interested?

1270
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:38,208
Of course.

1271
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,541
Why are you buying so much stuff?

1272
01:55:44,208 --> 01:55:46,458
Had I known,
I wouldn't have come along.

1273
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:49,583
I forgot to buy parchment paper.

1274
01:55:50,125 --> 01:55:52,708
Can you go buy it? I'll wait around here.

1275
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:57,208
Sure, I'll be right back.

1276
01:55:58,250 --> 01:55:59,333
I'll be back soon.

1277
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:45,375
<i>Ask her who the woman she talked to is.</i>

1278
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:48,333
<i>Is the cake for her?</i>

1279
01:56:49,791 --> 01:56:52,125
<i>She wants to bake a cake for that girl.</i>

1280
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:54,541
<i>You can only teach her.</i>

1281
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:56,666
<i>Don't develop any feelings for her.</i>

1282
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:58,958
<i>Want to get hurt again?</i>

1283
01:57:00,625 --> 01:57:01,666
I LIKE YOU

1284
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:04,083
Patt, am I doing it right?

1285
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:11,166
I'm getting much better, right?

1286
01:57:11,875 --> 01:57:12,875
Yeah.

1287
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:16,000
So I can bake a cake now, right?

1288
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:19,166
Yes, you can.

1289
01:57:24,875 --> 01:57:26,166
Are you okay?

1290
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:32,500
Now you can bake a cake
for someone you like.

1291
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,541
You don't need to come tomorrow.

1292
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:39,875
-But I haven't baked--
-If you don't know how, check online.

1293
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:41,833
I already taught you all the basics.

1294
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:46,625
I want to continue learning from you.

1295
01:57:46,708 --> 01:57:48,666
But I don't want to teach you anymore.

1296
01:57:50,125 --> 01:57:51,083
Why?

1297
01:57:52,791 --> 01:57:53,916
I've enjoyed…

1298
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:58,875
all this time we spent baking together.

1299
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:02,416
Don't you feel anything?

1300
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,625
No, I don't.

1301
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:09,625
I'm exhausted!

1302
01:58:10,541 --> 01:58:13,166
I need to take care of the café and you.

1303
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:16,208
No, but I'm--

1304
01:58:19,208 --> 01:58:20,458
I'm sorry.

1305
01:58:20,541 --> 01:58:22,083
-I'll help you.
-Don't!

1306
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:24,833
Go home! I'll do it myself.

1307
01:58:25,958 --> 01:58:27,916
And stop being so annoying.

1308
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:29,875
Please!

1309
01:59:30,125 --> 01:59:32,500
<i>Hi, everyone. I'm Meiji.</i>

1310
01:59:32,583 --> 01:59:34,708
<i>Patt, whom I'm baking a cake for,</i>

1311
01:59:34,791 --> 01:59:37,791
<i>is the hardest woman</i>
<i>in the world to flirt with.</i>

1312
01:59:37,875 --> 01:59:41,375
<i>Anyway, no matter what, I won't give up.</i>

1313
01:59:41,958 --> 01:59:46,291
<i>I'll show her my efforts</i>
<i>and change her mind.</i>

1314
01:59:47,916 --> 01:59:52,416
<i>I've had a crush on Patt</i>
<i>since I moved here a few months ago.</i>

1315
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:05,250
<i>But I'm afraid she doesn't like me.</i>
<i>Because I like her.</i>

1316
02:00:05,833 --> 02:00:07,875
<i>I go see her at her café every day.</i>

1317
02:00:09,291 --> 02:00:11,166
I'd like to order a cake.

1318
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:17,375
<i>I try to keep her away from others.</i>

1319
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:27,083
<i>I spend money to buy her cakes</i>
<i>so that she remember me.</i>

1320
02:00:27,166 --> 02:00:28,833
What is your name?

1321
02:00:28,916 --> 02:00:32,666
<i>But it seems like she doesn't remember me.</i>
<i>Or doesn't want to remember.</i>

1322
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:33,583
Meiji.

1323
02:00:34,291 --> 02:00:38,916
<i>Until my senior, Dow,</i>
<i>told me to enter Patt's world</i>

1324
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,583
<i>so that she gets to know me.</i>

1325
02:00:41,666 --> 02:00:43,541
You just slowly sway in.

1326
02:00:43,625 --> 02:00:45,625
She'll give in, believe me.

1327
02:00:46,458 --> 02:00:49,250
Yeah. Just like me and my boyfriend.

1328
02:00:52,125 --> 02:00:54,041
You have a boyfriend?

1329
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:56,750
Even though I'm like this,
I have a boyfriend.

1330
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:58,166
That's great!

1331
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:01,583
As for me, no matter what I do,
Patt is still not interested in me.

1332
02:01:02,666 --> 02:01:03,625
There, there.

1333
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:05,333
Anyway, I wish you the best.

1334
02:01:05,458 --> 02:01:06,541
-Keep at it!
-Yeah.

1335
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:23,416
You brought my cocoa here.

1336
02:01:24,041 --> 02:01:25,541
It looks delicious.

1337
02:01:26,666 --> 02:01:29,041
Everything you make is always delicious.

1338
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:33,208
-Not at all.
-Do you want to see my reviews on YouTube?

1339
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:37,041
This is so pretty.

1340
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,458
Prang, are you delivering the cheese?

1341
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:03,708
Yes.

1342
02:02:04,916 --> 02:02:05,916
What are you doing?

1343
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1344
02:02:11,958 --> 02:02:13,541
Are you throwing the cake away?

1345
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:19,875
But this isn't Patt's cake.

1346
02:02:20,458 --> 02:02:22,625
This one I made it myself.

1347
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:26,666
Hey! Why did you do that?

1348
02:02:28,291 --> 02:02:29,375
Because…

1349
02:02:42,875 --> 02:02:45,583
But you haven't told Patt, right?

1350
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:48,958
That's right.

1351
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:52,375
But it's pretty obvious
she doesn't like me.

1352
02:02:52,458 --> 02:02:54,666
So the cake is of no use.

1353
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:56,208
Hey, relax!

1354
02:02:56,291 --> 02:02:57,958
You put a lot of effort into it.

1355
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:59,666
Why are you giving up so easily?

1356
02:03:00,416 --> 02:03:02,041
Wanna take it then?

1357
02:03:02,916 --> 02:03:04,208
No. I don't want to.

1358
02:03:05,041 --> 02:03:06,333
Then I'll throw it away.

1359
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:09,916
Do you really like Patt?

1360
02:03:13,041 --> 02:03:16,083
If you really like her
and have a chance to do so,

1361
02:03:17,291 --> 02:03:18,875
you should try to tell her.

1362
02:03:22,291 --> 02:03:27,708
And this cheese pie, do you know
how hard it is to make?

1363
02:03:29,083 --> 02:03:31,625
I do know. I made it myself.

1364
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:33,541
Why wouldn't I know?

1365
02:03:34,625 --> 02:03:37,666
No! Cheese is an expensive ingredient,

1366
02:03:38,583 --> 02:03:42,250
and the reason why is,
everyone devotes their attention to it.

1367
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:47,708
<i>Even though we don't really know</i>
<i>where the cheese will go in the end,</i>

1368
02:03:48,958 --> 02:03:51,666
<i>everyone is giving</i>
<i>their best efforts into making it.</i>

1369
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:56,250
<i>Until getting the best quality milk,</i>

1370
02:03:56,833 --> 02:03:59,250
<i>then to the cheese maker…</i>

1371
02:03:59,333 --> 02:04:03,416
<i>It must all be done</i>
<i>meticulously and patiently.</i>

1372
02:04:04,125 --> 02:04:05,000
Just like me…

1373
02:04:05,791 --> 02:04:08,500
I drive my car all the way here
to deliver the cheese.

1374
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:11,166
And now it's in your hands.

1375
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:13,041
It's this cheese pie.

1376
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:16,958
You really want to see
everyone's efforts go to waste?

1377
02:04:20,333 --> 02:04:23,000
Can you stay with me for a while?

1378
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:26,833
I'm sorry.

1379
02:04:27,916 --> 02:04:29,375
I need to deliver the cheese.

1380
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:37,333
<i>Love is like this block of cheese.</i>

1381
02:04:38,291 --> 02:04:39,916
<i>It takes so much work to perfect it,</i>

1382
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,333
<i>and before it can taste so good, it must</i>
<i>come through processes.</i>

1383
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,708
<i>It must go through a lot.</i>

1384
02:04:52,041 --> 02:04:53,791
Come on. Try it one more time.

1385
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:02,291
Damn!

1386
02:05:02,375 --> 02:05:04,708
Crap! I need to deliver the cheese now.

1387
02:05:04,791 --> 02:05:06,000
See you later.

1388
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:06,916
Don't give up.

1389
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,125
Thank you so much.

1390
02:05:23,083 --> 02:05:24,791
-You did it, right?
-Yes.

1391
02:05:38,625 --> 02:05:39,791
Meiji.

1392
02:05:45,166 --> 02:05:46,000
Patt.

1393
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,416
This cake is for you.

1394
02:05:50,833 --> 02:05:52,541
It's always been for you.

1395
02:05:54,625 --> 02:05:55,541
I…

1396
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:58,750
I've had a crush on you for a long time.

1397
02:05:59,333 --> 02:06:00,916
Since I met you,

1398
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:04,416
I've never liked anyone else.

1399
02:06:06,125 --> 02:06:07,875
I came to bake with you…

1400
02:06:10,208 --> 02:06:12,541
because I wanted you to see my efforts.

1401
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,000
I came to see you everyday,

1402
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:18,000
only hoping that you recognize me.

1403
02:06:26,916 --> 02:06:28,375
And I want you…

1404
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:30,291
to think…

1405
02:06:32,125 --> 02:06:33,000
that…

1406
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:36,500
I'm not that annoying.

1407
02:06:48,041 --> 02:06:51,541
I just want you to know
that I did my best.

1408
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:56,916
And I won't come here again,

1409
02:06:59,291 --> 02:07:01,041
as I promised you.

1410
02:07:35,083 --> 02:07:36,208
Meiji.

1411
02:07:44,833 --> 02:07:46,583
Your cake…

1412
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:48,833
tastes horrible!

1413
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:55,625
You need to learn
how to make it again with me.

1414
02:07:59,083 --> 02:08:02,583
Because I like you too.

This is for you, for letting me
take photos around your café.

Are you Dow's boyfriend?

1421
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,625
That's right…
Oh! You know Dow?

1422

Dow…

1423
02:08:54,958 --> 02:08:56,750
She and I do cosplay quite often.

Patt, was my cake really that terrible?

1428
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:18,500
I won't tell you.

1429
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,416
Hey, wait!
