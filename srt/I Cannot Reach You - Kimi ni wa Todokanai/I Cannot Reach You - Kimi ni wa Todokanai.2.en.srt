are childhood best friends.
[Entrance Ceremony]

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,600
Seriously? Duped again?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,590
But I'm broke this month...

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,600
Wait! You do my last pull!

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,560
- Why?
- Because you've got insane luck.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,990
Please? You were lucky with that crane game before!

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,070
Sure, I guess.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,420
Nice.

[Super Rare]
(Game - "Monster Strike")

I've witnessed the hands of god.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,030
But recently...

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,980
Let's head home.

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,570
Something feels different between us.

16
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,220
No, wait! Yamato and I are best friends.

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,710
What's up?

18
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,660
Nothing.

19
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,380
You still coming over for games tomorrow?

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,000
Definitely!

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,110
Ohara.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,160
Here's the manga I was telling you about.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,480
- That series is super popular! Could I borrow it after?
- Sure.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,290
- Is that fine with you?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,110
Say, have you kept in touch with any of the girls from the group date?

26
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,470
No, I haven't.

27
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,250
What about you and Akane, eh? Any news?

28
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,760
We just text sometimes, that's all.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,440
Sure, sure. Looks like you actually beat Ohara to a girlfriend.

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,920
She's not my girlfriend.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,720
- Must be sad losing your friend to a new girlfriend.
- I told you, we aren't going out yet!

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,790
- Yet. You said yet!
- Buzz off!

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,830
Aw, you're hoping for something!

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,850
I'm... going to head out.

35
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,740
Why?

36
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,730
What's he so miffed about?

37
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,850
I can't believe I'm getting jealous... Pathetic.

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,550
Jealous? Of who?

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,570
You always turn up out of the blue.

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,290
We live in the same house, of course I might run into you.

Kakeru's coming over tomorrow to play games.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
Tomorrow? I have club after school.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,100
I know. That's why I invited him.

44
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,430
But I'm the better gamer though...

45
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,340
I get it, you want to get all chummy without me.

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,280
Remember, Kakeru's my friend.

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,230
So what?

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,200
- It's not like he's yours to keep.
- He's mine.

49
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,450
Is he?

50
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,460
And as I recall, anything that's yours is also mine, by sibling rule.

51
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,080
Mine...?

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,890
I'll never become anyone "special" to him...

53
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,030

I fell again.
(Game - "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe")

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,620
You'll never win a race against me.

59
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,810
Fall, dang it!

60
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,620
Well, this is how I imagined our day would look like, but...

61
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,810
Am I at a funeral or something?

62
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,970
Seriously, what's with this atmosphere?

63
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,910
It's way too dreary. No one's died!

64
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,520
Is this really kart racing, or a horror game?

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,360
What game are we really playing right now?

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,080
I want out. Out!

67
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,220
Why is he mad anyways?

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,270
Should I apologize?

69
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,930
But I'd rather know what I'm apologizing for...

70
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,810
What?

71
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,150
Are you mad about something?

72
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,770
I'm not mad.

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,660
Liar. You haven't even looked at me since I got here.

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,720
- That's not true.
- I hit a sore spot, didn't I?

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,860
It's not that I'm mad, really.

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,730
Then what's bothering you?

77
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,230
Well...

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,320
Come on, just look at me already!

79
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,770
Ow!

80
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,070
- I heard my neck crack.
- Sorry.

81
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,690
I'm a pacifist! Yamato Ohara has gone violent!

82
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,810
Someone help!

83
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,240
Look. If something's up, tell me.

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,330
If I don't know what's bothering you, I can't help.

85
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,560
- Who's that from?
- Huh?

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,660
My mom.

87
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,460
Yamato...?

88
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,020
So...

89
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,950
The girl from the group date you're texting...

90
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,980
You said you two weren't going out, "yet"?

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,780
Right. My tongue slipped there. That's not what I meant exactly.

92
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,110
We're really just texting, that's all.

93
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,100
Yamato, maybe...

94
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,560
Do you... not want me to get a girlfriend?

95
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,590
Just kidding. Just a joke.

96
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,500
I was pulling your leg.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,900
Yeah.

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,600
I don't.

99
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,530
You don't?

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,100
Right, I get it. If I get a girlfriend, we won't be able to hang out much anymore. That would suck.

101
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,330
Yes.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,150
Then what's your type?

103
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,080
A childhood friend...?

104
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,910
Kakeru, as long as I have you, I...

105
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,170
Yamato likes me.

106
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,390
But whenever I reach that conclusion, I quickly erase the thought.

107
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,350
I'm scared to find out if it's true or not.

108
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,260
Hey, did something go down between you and Ohara?

109
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,150
Why do you ask?

110
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,740
Nothing happened.

111
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,370
'Cause it feels like pins and needles with you two today.

112
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,190
I mean, you two haven't spoken a word to each other.

113
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,150
That's not true.

114
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,730
I'm scared because I feel like our status quo would change... forever.

115
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,980
I'm stopping by the bookstore today. Want to come—

116
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,930
Ohara, there's a first year asking for you. A girl.

117
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,990
All right.

118
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,620
Um...

119
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,450
Here.

120
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,070
Sorry, but I—

121
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,350
Please, at least read it.

122
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,200
I really wanted to tell you this.

123
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,550
To let you know how I feel.

124
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,710
If I don't tell you,

125
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,700
I'll never be able to process my feelings.

126
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,830
Thank you.

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,000
[To: Ohara]

128
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,060
Aren't you gonna head home?

129
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,750
No.

130
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,760
I thought I'd wait for Yamato.

131
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,110
That's yet another confession of love.

132
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,960
For sure. How many does this make?

133
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,640
Of course he's popular.

134
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,250
With his face and brains, I'd be more surprised if he wasn't.

135
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,670
- I'm so jealous!
- You literally have a girlfriend.

136
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,420
Those are two separate matters, don't get it twisted.

137
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,100
How's Ohara still single, despite all those confessions?

138
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,220
Hey, maybe today's girl is the one.

139
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,210
Ohara's sure got it good.

140
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,780
I bet he'll never have to lift a finger for anything in his life.

141
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,450
And he probably knows it.

142
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,740
Yeah, he's definitely on a different level or something.

143
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,630
- Or something!
- Or something!

144
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,250
I bet Ohara keeps you around because it makes him look good.

145
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,730
- No way.
- Come on, you know it's true.

146
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,990
You're a nice guy. He takes advantage of that.

147
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,060
- Right?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,380
No...

149
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,290
Yamato's not that sort of guy.

150
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,070
Sure, he's shy and sort of cold.

151
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,270
But he never brags about being popular.

152
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,530
He doesn't look down on people either.

153
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,250
He's a really nice guy.

154
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,380
Don't talk shit about Yamato, when you know jack about him!

155
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm going home.

156
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,290
Kakeru?

157
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,660
Kakeru!

158
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,750
Kakeru.

159
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,860
Kakeru.

160
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,850
Kakeru, you're walking too fast.

161
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,140
I took that stuff too seriously.

162
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,800
Don't be hard on yourself. Those guys took it too far.

163
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,520
Still, I have to admit I use to be in their camp.

164
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,420
But when Ohara joined us the other day, it changed my impression of him.

165
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,580
- He's surprisingly funny once you get him to talk.
- Exactly.

166
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,840
They shouldn't badmouth him.

167
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,200
Sure, Yamato's insanely popular, and I end up getting compared to him,

168
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,420
but that's only because I'm so pathetic.

169
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,000
None of it's Yamato's fault.

170
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,250
Hey, you're not pathetic.

171
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,840
You're really nice.

172
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,550
- Really?
- Just kidding.

173
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,600
No wait, compliment me more!

174
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Don't talk shit about Yamato, when you know jack about him!

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,170
There she is.

176
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,720
Sorry about that...

177
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,390
- Was that it?
- Yes.

178
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,320
- Good to hear.
- Mikoto.

179
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,020
Yamato?

180
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,690
- Do you have any business with my sister?
- Oh, she's your sister?

181
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,480
Woah, don't be so on guard man.

182
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,220
We were just returning her phone. She left it at a cafe.

183
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,110
So she's your sister, Ohara?

184
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,520
- No wonder she's so cute.
- "No wonder"?

185
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,760
- Don't talk to strangers.
- We're not strangers anymore though.

186
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,740
By the way, we're your older brother's friends.

187
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,950
Fair point.

188
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,860
Mikoto.

189
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,310
I mean, he's right.

190
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,240
Let's go.

191
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,020
You're kinda funny.

192
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,030
I sort of blew a fuse.

193
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,290
But it's not their fault. They just don't know Yamato that well.

194
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,060
Besides, if our positions were swapped, I bet Yamato would defend me too.

195
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,240
Why... do I keep thinking about him?

196
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,560
Do you think... I'll be able to speak to him tomorrow?

197
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,970
Here's your second remedial worksheet, just for you.

198
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,810
I'll give you until tomorrow.

199
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,600
Tomorrow?! That's impossible.

200
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,920
Good things only come to those who believe in themselves.

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,530
O-Okay, I get it sir.

202
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,310
Again...?

203
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,320
Need a hand?

204
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,920
You don't mind?

205
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,290
Multiply this with this, and you get...?

206
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,400
I got it!

207
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,350
Yup, hanging out with you definitely calms me down.

208
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,370
What are you saying?

209
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,750
Seeing Yamato's smile makes me happy.

210
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,610
I enjoy the time I spend with him.

211
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,520
While I don't really get how he feels,

212
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,760
I certainly don't want to lose the time we share.

213
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,930
What, you two made up already?

214
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,350
- We never fought in the first place.
- Lies.

215
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,820
You guys have been acting weird lately, so I was thinking about stepping i

216
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,160
- Mind your own business dude.
- Right, I forgot.

217
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,220
You two are childhood friends who can talk anything out.

218
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,190
There's no place for me to meddle.

219
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,440
Condescending much?

220
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,700
- Yeah, yeah. So sorry.
- Drop it already.

221
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,490
Not everything's an open book between us.

222
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,080
Ohara.

223
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,390
That first year from the other day is waiting on the roof.

224
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,710
All right.

225
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,020
Lucky bastard.

226
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,410
And it totally killed the vibe.

227
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,650
Seriously, no one was asking for his opinion.

228
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,080
Yamato's getting a love confession right now, isn't he?

229
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,620
Dude, you listening to this?

230
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,450
Yeah, of course.

231
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,390
Anyways, he must've been playing.

232
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,810
No wait, this happens all the time.

233
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,620
Huh? Where's Ohara?

234
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,950
He's out. Why?

235
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,480
He accidentally turned in his ancient history notes, instead of modern history.

236
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,020
Huh? Why am I running right now?

237
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,620
What's got me all anxious?

238
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,910
Yamato's an important friend to me.

239
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,240
But then...

240
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,330
Why am I so...?

241
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,620
Where's the first year girl?

242
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,090
She already left.

243
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,350
Another confession?

244
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,790
Yes.

245
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,850
Are you going—

246
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,290
Mr. Popular's reputation remains untarnished.

247
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,030
So, what'd you tell her?

248
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,280
I turned her down.

249
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,110
- I see.
- Either way...

250
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,790
It's not your place to butt in.

251
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,510
Something's up between us these days...

252
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,110
Yamato!

253
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,950
Kakeru?! Let go!

254
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,350
I won't.

255
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,810
I hate how awkward things are between us.

256
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,460
Let's make up already.

257
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,720
I'll quit it with my weird, self-conscious misunderstandings.

258
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,820
- What are you talking about?
- I'll even study harder, too.

259
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,850
So I want us to stay best friends. Okay?

260
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,190
Best friends...

261
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:55,200
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side ♫

262
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,630
Fine. I get it, so just let go.

263
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,310
Promise me that we'll be on good terms?

264
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,290
I promise. Let go already, you dumbass!

265
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,640
- You better swear by it forever.
- Fine.

266
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,520
I swear it. Okay?!

267
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,810
Forever, I promise.

268
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,770
♫ So you won't notice my wavering heart ♫

269
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,590
What a relief.

270
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,210
♫ Let me be ♫

271
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,970
♫ How much further until I reach your place? ♫

272
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,290
♫ Until I reach it, I don't wanna cry ♫

273
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,950
I don't want to shatter this smile.

274
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,050
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

275
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,870
And that's why...

276
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,260
Kakeru and I are childhood best friends.

277
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,660
Let's head back to the classroom, yeah?

278
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,710
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫

279
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,430
We are now...

280
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
and always will be.

281
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,200
♫ Holding our connected hands tightly ♫

282
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,150
Because I want to be around that smile, forever.

283
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,710
♫ Softly placing our wishes in the starry sky and praying ♫

284
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,110
♫ Forever, may I stay by your side ♫

285
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,680
Nothing hides their presence from me.
[What happens, if someone catches onto these feelings...?]

286
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,530
Your feelings for him are spilling out.

287
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,150
Kakeru and I are best friends. Nothing more, nothing less.
[Can they truly remain, as just "best friends"...!?]

288
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,140
Don't you ever want to let your emotions take the wheel?

289
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,350
I'm better off keeping them to myself.
