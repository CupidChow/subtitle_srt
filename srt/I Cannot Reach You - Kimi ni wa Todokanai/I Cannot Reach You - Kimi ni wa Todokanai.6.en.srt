How can I sleep?!

[Kyoto School Trip]

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,010
After that incident,

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,920
Yamato was laid up in bed for the rest of the trip.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,990
And his replies to the worried messages I sent him were...

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,720
Cold.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,020
Kakeru, you like marshmallows. Right?

8
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,430
That was my first kiss!

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,910
Plus, that was the first time someone confessed to me.

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,970
How many "first times" is he going to take from me?

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,770
- Ashiya.
- What?!

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,330
- Oh, you gave me a shock!
- It's you, Murasen.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,320
Your reaction gave me a scare.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,210
- Are you okay? Still your usual self?
- Yes.

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,630
Okay. Could you take this to Ohara? It's the worksheet for today's lesson.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,220
Huh? Why do I have to do it?

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,690
- You guys are close—
- Okay, Ashiya and I will give it to him.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,810
I never said I'd do it!

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,790
But you're worried about Ohara, aren't you?

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,930
He might be fighting a fever right now.

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,240
- Fever?
- He might not even be able to eat!

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,940
Thanks for bringing this. I'll be back at school tomorrow.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,100
Collapsing during the school trip...

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,480
That must have caused so much trouble.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,820
No, it was actually kind of funny.

26
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,360
Brother,

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,820
I'm going out to buy some things.

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,540
I'll be heading home, then.

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,150
Why did you even come here?

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,510
I just wanted to take a look at your house.

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,370
- Then, I'll get going, too.
- You stay here for a while longer.

32
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,240
You still have the worksheet, don't you?

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,530
The worksheet!

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,490
Take your time.

35
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,010
Kakeru?

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,810
Yes?

37
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,620
I want to apologize to you.

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,010
I'm sorry for what happened during the trip.

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,470
No, I was just a little shocked.

40
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,580
Of course, you would be shocked...

41
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,470
When I collapsed out of the blue.

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,820
Actually, I wasn't feeling well that day.

43
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,540
My memories before I collapsed are a little fuzzy.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,980
I don't really remember anything.

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,880
He doesn't remember?

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,620
I like you.

47
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,320
Did he forget that, too?

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,250
And that?

49
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,800
Kakeru.

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,410
I'm going home.

51
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,740
Wait. What's wrong?

52
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,210
This is the end.

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,030

[I Cannot Reach You]

55
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,420
Say, Mikoto.

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,060
How well do you know your brother?

[Episode 6]

58
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,360
Aren't you curious to know what happened between your brother and Ashiya during the trip?

59
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,190
What's your relationship with my brother?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,750
Friends?

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,140
Hey, I've been wondering...

62
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,010
Why do you talk about your brother so politely?

63
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,810
Most people give their brothers silly nicknames.

64
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,340
I used to get teased for having a brother complex.

65
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,410
So I wanted to distance myself from him. Thus, the politeness.

66
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,110
I see.

67
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,220
I don't care much, as long as he is happy.

68
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,090
However...

69
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,400
Are you saying I should push my feelings onto him?

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,860
Don't put it like that...

71
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,170
I'm better off keeping this to myself.

72
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,960
Even if their feelings are mutual,

73
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,030
would it lead to a future?

74
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,810
Nobody knows about the future.

75
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,090
But if they decide to be together,

76
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,150
wouldn't that be a good thing?

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,770
It sucks to live by other's standards, doesn't it?

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,550
Kakeru?

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,230
Did I do something wrong?

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,230
- Kakeru.
- Don't talk to me!

81
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,770
Hey, why are you ignoring me?

82
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,160
You haven't replied to my messages since yesterday, either.

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,830
I told you, I'm cutting ties with you.

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,670
Tell me the reason, then!

85
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,850
Don't touch me!

86
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,580
Tie-cutting punch!

87

You guys are arguing again?

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
I don't know if it's a fight, but he's angry.

89
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,260
I see.

90
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,320
So he rejected you, huh?

91
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,300
I mean, you pulled that stunt on Togetsukyo Bridge.

92
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,600
Your kiss with Ashiya.

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,420
- Dude! Didn't we promise not to tell anyone about it?
- He's the one who did it, so it's okay.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,230
Kiss?

95
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,740
Don't you remember?

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,670
Yamato, I'm cutting all ties with you!

97
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,300
Kakeru?

98
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,830
Mikoto!

99
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,770
What's wrong? You seem preoccupied by something.

100
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,350
Did my brother confess his love to you?

101
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,620
Sorry, I actually meant it as a joke.

102
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,550
What was your reply?

103
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,610
I haven't yet.

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,650
I don't know whether he's serious or not.

105
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,330
Don't worry. He's serious.

106
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,650
You know that yourself, don't you?

107
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,980
I've thought of the possibility...

108
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,200
But I was afraid of things getting awkward between us.

109
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,050
So I never asked.

110
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,400
Sorry, I'm such a loser.

111
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,050
It's easier to leave things as they are.

112
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,200
My brother said the same thing, too.

113
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,420
But it's not true.

114
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,020
So I'm glad my brother told you.

115
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,160
He doesn't want to upset you,

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,930
so he's been suppressing his feelings all this while.

117
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,730
Kakeru, you should tell him your feelings honestly.

118
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,650
No matter what your answer is, I'm sure it will help you move forward.

119

The sun came out.

120
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,170
Even so, Yamato can't remember anything.

121
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,090
Kakeru, do you have a second?

122
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,140
I want to talk to you about what happened during the trip.

123
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,750
Now?

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,810
Kakeru, I want to apologize to you.

125
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,390
About...

126
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,390
my confession to you.

127
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,410
You remembered?

128
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,020
Sorry.

129
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,220
You must have been shocked.

130
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,090
It was more than a shock!

131
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,460
Suddenly telling me you like me...

132
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,360
You even kissed me!

133
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,940
I've been seriously stressed about how to face you after that!

134
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,070
And you didn't even remember any of it.

135
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,510
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,960
Plus, doing something like that out in public!

137
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,050
Don't you have any self-control?

138
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,200
I couldn't help it!

139
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,930
I just wanted to do it.

140
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,540
Huh?!

141
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,400
Sorry.

142
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,950
That's not right...

143
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,020
That's not what I meant.

144
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,470
I was happy.

145
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,360
I didn't even care how much it was going to hurt after.

146
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,360
I just wanted to tell you everything.

147
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,840
Up till now,

148
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,440
I've always been afraid to let you know about my feelings.

149
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,020
I kept telling myself that my feelings weren't real.

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,430
However...

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,750
I realized that everything we shared is important to me.

152
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,250
Kakeru, I like you.

153
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,420
I've always liked you.

154
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,440
All this time, I've loved you.

155
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,260
Shall we go back?

156
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,380
Sorry to make you listen to all this.

157
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,650
Aren't you going to listen to what I have to say?

158
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,620
You just said what you wanted,

159
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,270
but I also have things to say to you.

160
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:13,020
I couldn't forget what happened that day.

161
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,970
And I couldn't sleep at night.

162
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,980
I kept worrying and worrying...

163
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
But...

164
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm sure you've worried much more than me.

165
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,310
I want to give you an honest reply.

166
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,190
I've always thought of you as only a friend.

167
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,810
Honestly, I don't know about dating yet.

168
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,210
But I'll think about it.

169
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,800
About what I want our relationship to be.

170
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,990
Can you accept that for now?

171
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,380
Kakeru.

172
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,980
Come on, we gotta hurry back to class!

173
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,020
Wait! Don't go!

174
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,440
Does that mean I don't have to give up?

175
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,470
Can I still continue...

176
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,890
to like you?

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,290
Yes, you can continue...

178
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,890
to like me.

179
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,800
Someone confessed to you? Who was it?

180
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,500
Lower your voice!

181
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,830
I haven't given an answer yet.

182
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,300
I see.

183
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,610
What are you going to do? Will you start dating?

184
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,950
I'm not sure yet.

185
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,020
I can't stop thinking about it. I can't act normally.

186
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,620
Why should you force yourself to act normal?

187
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,430
Kakeru!

188
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,710
You're staring.

189
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,090
- Of course I am!
- Isn't it a common sight?

190
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,210
How can you act so calm?

191
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,850
I haven't been able to act normally at all.

192
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,150
It's all I can think about.

193
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm not as calm as you think.

194
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,790
The person I like is right in front of me, after all.

195
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,610
How can you say such embarrassing stuff so casually?

196
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,990
If I were to act nervous in front of you,

197
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,340
you'd think I was a loser.

198
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,460
I'd never think you were a loser!

199
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,860
Hey!

200
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,450
Do you want to go on a date tomorrow?

201
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,950
Da...

202
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,290
Date?

203
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,580
Yes.

204
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,610
Okay.

205
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,510
Maybe his heart is also racing a little.

206
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,870
That suits you!

207
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,170
Do I look cool?

208
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,400
He's so hot!

209
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,730
The person beside him is probably his friend. Right?

210
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,760
The little one?

211
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,680
Oh, that shop!

212
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,290
Excuse me.

213
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,650
Do you have a moment? Here's my card.

214
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,400
- I'm from a modelling agency.
- Sorry, I'm busy right now.

215
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,970
But your face is so handsome! And your style! You'll definitely be popular.

216
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,920
- How about it? Do you have time to talk?
- If I really consider it...

217
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,720
What does Yamato like about me?

218
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,340
I'm not someone he can brag about.

219
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,780
No matter how much I think about it, there's nothing special about me.

220
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,460
Kakeru!

221
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,020
Kakeru?

222
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you okay?

223
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,010
Sorry.

224
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,650
What have I done?

225
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,770
Shall we go back and change out of your clothes?

226
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,490
Let's watch a movie at home.

227
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,730
Don't worry about it.

229
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,270
Sorry.

230
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,150
- You can just sit over there.
- Okay.

231
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,280
It's the one from the group date.

232
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,610
You got it for me,

233
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,050
so I didn't want to give it to anyone else.

234
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,540
Kakeru.

235
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,100
Did I fall asleep?

236
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,330
You should have woken me up.

237
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,650
No, you looked so comfortable sleeping.

238
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,730
Sorry.

239
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,500
Today must have been so boring for you.

240
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,430
It was supposed to be a date, but I ruined everything.

241
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,830
That's not true.

242
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,920
I enjoyed myself very much.

243
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,500
You're lying.

244
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,920
- It's not a lie.
- I also ruined the promise we made during the school trip.

245
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,720
I wanted to make it up to you today.

246
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,730
But I kept messing things up. I'm not attractive like you are.

247
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,540
Why do you have to say that?

248
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,760
I'm not someone you should like, Yamato.

249
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,920
There's nothing appealing about me.

250
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,350
Kakeru.

251
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,750
Do you really think that?

252
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,160
Have you always thought there was nothing appealing about you?

253
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,270
- Well...
- What are my feelings for you, then?

254
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't you understand how I feel all the time?

255
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,080
Don't you know how much I like you...

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,250
and how much I cherish you?

257
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,060
It's so much I stop seeing everything else around me!

258
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,120
Even being next to you now, my chest hurts so badly I can't take it.

259
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,480
Yamato...

263
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,820
Kakeru.

264
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,540
Yamato, stop.

265
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,650
Yamato, I said no!

266
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,190
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side ♫

267
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,750
Sorry.

268
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm going home.

269
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,020
♫ As naturally as breathing ♫

♫ You probably won't reach it, you probably won't understand ♫

272
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,010
I never wanted to make him to look that way.

273
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,290
Yamato!

274
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,640
Just by being next to him,

275
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,800
my chest hurt so badly,

276
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,680
I couldn't stop my emotions from overflowing.

277
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,080
I want to get closer to his heart.

278
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,990
I want to touch him...

279
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,650
and I can't stop it.

Your feelings won't get through to him if you don't tell him.
[Despite confirming each other's feelings...]

282
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,940
Yamato won't fall in love with just anyone.

283
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,490
There's someone you want to express gratitude to. That's wonderful.
[How will it end for both of them who missed each other?]

284
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,100
What kind of feelings do I have for Yamato? I'm still feeling confused.
