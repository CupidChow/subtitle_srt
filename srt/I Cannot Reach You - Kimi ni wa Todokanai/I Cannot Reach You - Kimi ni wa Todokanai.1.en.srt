1
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,660
This won't ever reach you.

2
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,570
This feeling is neither admiration nor nostalgia.

3
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,550
This pain is...

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,840
Ohara,

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,240
I like you.

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,460
Crap!

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,620
You're always the first thing my eyes are drawn to.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,450
And each time, I...

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,930
So Fujiwara, the idol of 2nd year, also wants Ohara?

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,720
Of course she does. This is Ohara we're talking about.

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,590
I didn't even make a move on her,

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,430
- and I feel heartbroken.
- Poor you.

13
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,610
Hey! You guys agreed that Fujiwara was cute!

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,800
Sure, 'cause you insisted.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,920
Dude...

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,010
I guess girls just like that cool personality of his.

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,910
No way! Cool? More like straight cold.

18
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,370
Either way, romance seems like it'd be a cinch for him.

19
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,400
What are you guys doing out here?

20
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,900
- Adolescent puppy love?
- Who says that?

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,100
Well, here's a taste of adolescence for you too, Ashiya.

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Test-takers who scored under a 40 get afterschool remedial.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,230
So, Ashiya.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,070
What'd you score?

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,720
Not telling.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,910
[28 points]

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,390
28 points...

28
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,120
Please, don't say it out loud!

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,930
And just to satiate my curiosity, what'd you score?

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,830
98.

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,790
How did childhood friends like us,

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,710
end up as complete opposites of each other?

33
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,660
- I'm so done for...
- For now,

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,480
let's take this worksheet from the top.

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,690
For this question...

36
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,180
We use this formula to calculate the value of cosine.

37
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,510
I think I got it!

38
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,130
Yamato, I swear my brain only understands your way of explaining things.

39
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,030
I wonder why?

40
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,240
Because we're childhood friends?

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,480
I seriously doubt it.

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,440
But I can't deny the fact that I'd be useless without you.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
Watch this split... huh?

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
I broke it!

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,840
That always happens with those.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
I guess so.

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,600
Anyways, thanks for tutoring me. Here.

48
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,920
- It's fine, I'll take the shorter half.
- But...

49
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,040
Wait, let's do this!

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,750
- Just take a bite out of this.
- Huh?

51
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,990
For the even split.

52
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,450
Nah, it's all right.

53
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,730
Hurry, it's already melting.

54
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,050
Open wide.

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,410
And with that, it's perfect halfsies.

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,040
So, what's the deal with you and Fujiwara?

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,650
Are you two going out?

58
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,340
No.

59
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,200
Aw, what a missed opportunity! She's so cute.

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,810
It doesn't matter if I don't like her myself.

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,380
If you say so.

62
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,390
I wonder how much longer we'll be able to do this stuff after school.

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,990
I mean, if you get yourself a girlfriend,

64
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,890
you're definitely not staying to tutor me.

65
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,570
That doesn't just apply to me.

66
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,750
You could be the one to get a girlfriend first.

67
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,830
Me, a girlfriend? No way.

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm not popular like you.

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,550
I'm not even smart!

70
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,890
I'm not popular.

71
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,320
You are!

72
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,370
So, does Mr. Popular have a crush on anyone?

73
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,250
Kakeru.

74
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,370
Huh?

75
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,010
Kakeru.

76
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,170
Oh, oh...

77
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,580
Ashiya!

78
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,330
If you've got the brains, use them in the first place!

79
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,680
That's what you were talking about? I was so nervous!

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,390
I need to stop by the bookstore, so I'll be heading out.

81
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,050
- Really?
- Goodbye.

82
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,810
Yeah.

83
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,710
Take care.

[I Cannot Reach You]

85
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,530
Morning.
[Episode 1]

86
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,790
We have PE today.

87
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,720
What a pain!

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,950
And it's your favorite, basketball.

89
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,030
- Shut it.
- Look, it's Ohara!

90
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,130
We're so lucky to catch a glimpse of him.

91
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,530
Today's gonna be a good day!

92
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,530
Man, you've turned into an omen of good luck.

93
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,840
Big news, Ashiya. Fujino got himself a girlfriend!

94
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,060
For real?!

95
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,160
It is indeed for real.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,490
You lucky bastard. I want a girlfriend, too.

97
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,240
You're missing out, my guy.

98
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm going on ahead. See you in class.

99
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,540
What's his deal?

100
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,630
As cool as ever.

101
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,250
Ohara seriously doesn't talk to anyone except Ashiya, huh?

102
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,400
He's shy.

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,690
Smooth moves.

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,620
Ouch...

105
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,280
- And not-so-smooth.
- Try again.

106
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,990
Man, Ohara's amazing.

107
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,520
Not only does he have brawn and brains,

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,170
he's got looks to boot. But his personality stinks.

109
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,670
It doesn't stink once you get to know him.

110
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,070
Call him shy, like he is.

111
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,920
Say, Kakeru. You're in the market for a girlfriend, right?

112
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,940
I... do.

113
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,860
Why are you asking?

114
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,480
- Woah.
- Perfect! Then I've got just the thing.

115
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,870
I've got a group date set up with the Shinomiya High girls this weekend.

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,520
- The Shinomiya girls?!
- How?

117
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,110
My girlfriend's a Shinomiya girl herself.

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,450
Are you okay?

119
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,590
- Fine.
- Sorry, Ohara.

120
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,830
- It's all right.
- I swear it wasn't on purpose...

121
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,060
I'm fine, really.

122
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,590
Sorry...

123
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,930
Ohara's pissed.

124
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,690
Poor Yokouchi.

125
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,630
Seriously?

126
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,280
There's no way he'd get mad over something like that.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,870
[Clinic]

128
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,370
I suck at this.

129
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,310
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

130
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,120
Give me that.

131
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,360
Keep this a secret. Okay?

132
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,060
Yokouchi will only feel worse if he found out.

133
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,530
Got it.

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,960
Need bandages, too?

135
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,750
That seems like overkill.

136
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,900
But if you leave it like that, the patch will come off right away.

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,480
Then... I guess.

138
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,480
You know...

139
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,230
If I were a girl, this situation would definitely have sparks flying.

140
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,440
Sorry you're stuck with me, Yamato.

141
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,830
Yamato.

142
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,710
Yamato?

143
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,320
I went to visit Dad in the hospital today.

144
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,170
Dad still...

145
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,790
won't wake up.

146
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,560
But I decided I have to protect Mikoto.

147
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,290
I have to protect my sister while Dad's gone.

148
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,860
That's why, I...

149
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,110
Then if you ever need to cry, call for me.

150
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll share half of your sadness.

151
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,230
We're best friends, after all.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,770
You're important to me.

153
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,410
You're amazing, Kakeru.

154
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,380
How am I amazing?

155
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,630
It certainly pisses me off when Mr. Perfect says so.

156
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,090
You're kind.

157
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,340
You care about people.

158
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,520
And that's why...

159
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,300
That's why you're always the center of attention.

160
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,560
Are you trying to say you want more friends?

161
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,650
No, not exactly...

162
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,450
Say, Fujino and the gang invited me to a group date this weekend.

163
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,530
Wanna come with?

164
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,340
A group date?

165
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,600
To do what?

166
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,480
To find a girlfriend, I guess?

167
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,390
Do you want a girlfriend that badly?

168
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,290
It's not that I really want a girlfriend, I just want to find someone special, just for me.

169
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,430
I'll go.

170
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,030
I said, I'll go to the group date.

171
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,210
If you go alone...

172
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,110
I'd get worried.

173
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,860
Worried? Come on.

174
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,890
But I'm glad you're going.

175
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:07,980
I've always wanted you to get along with my other buddies.

176
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,660
Ohara's late...

177
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,020
Are you sure he's coming?

178
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,400
- I swear it.
- Really?

179
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Sorry, guys.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
He really did come!

181
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,400
He's so freakin' hot... I'm gonna pray to his face!

182
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Now a god?

183
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,820
I knew it, they're all here for him.

184
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,570
Sorry, I'm late. I hope we have a good time today.

185
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,980
Bowling's pretty hard, isn't it?

186
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,690
Yeah.

187
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,610
I'm basically a beginner, so I don't even know what ball to pick.

188
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,100
Is there something on my face?

189
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,700
No, sorry.

190
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,340
You just remind me of my little brother.

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,300
Your little brother...?

192
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,140
Yeah, so I sort of felt a bit close to you.

193
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Wait! You seriously don't have a girlfriend?

194
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,890
No.

195
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,220
But why?

196
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,700
That's the real mystery.

197
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,020
- Especially since he's so good-looking.
- Totally!

198
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,790
Well, I can't say...

199
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,010
Then, what's your type?

200
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,650
A childhood friend...?

201
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,680
Sorry, what?

202
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,060
So we never had a chance at all.

203
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,550
Huh?

204
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,030
Kakeru?

205
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,820
A childhood friend?

206
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,840
But Yamato's childhood friend is...

207
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,190
Kakeru?

208
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,400
Everything all right? Are you not feeling well?

209
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,810
No, I'm perfect. Never better.

210
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,900
Your face is red.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,930
I'm fine!

212
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,580
Gotta go to the bathroom.

213
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,240
What's up with me...?

214
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,050
Missed again...

215
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,780
Crane games are my specialty.

216
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,010
Really?

217
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,500
Yeah. My little brothers make me get stuff for them.

218
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,490
Nice, nice!

219
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,830
I thought I had it!

220
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,180
You definitely got close.

221
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,060
Okay, I believe in this next one.

222
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,370
Think I should grab the left?

223
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,170
- Maybe the right.
- Right, it is.

224
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,480
It's okay, you've done your best.

225
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,800
But I wasn't lying, I'm seriously good at—

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,680
I believe you! We all have off days.

227
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,320
I was so close though...

228
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,710
Here, use my money then.

229
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,860
- I couldn't—
- I'll go make some change.

230
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,260
- Be right back!
- Hey, wait!

231
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,560
Why am I screwing up all of a sudden?

232
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,090
Let me try.

233
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,850
It's pretty difficult though.

234
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,870
Holy...

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,420
Here.

236
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,350
Thanks! Akane's gonna love this.

237
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,660
You're seriously something else.

238
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,490
Sports, academics, even something like this doesn't phase you.

239
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,910
- Unlike me—
- You're giving this to that girl?

240
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,250
Yup.

241
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,600
Then don't tell her I got it.

242
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,220
Why not?

243
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,460
Yamato!

244
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,690
- Let's trade LINE IDs.
- Me too!

245
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,160
- Me three.
- Sure, I don't mind.

246
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,480
Ohara is pretty popular!

247
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,600
Kakeru.

248
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,730
Could I get your LINE ID?

249
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,310
- Mine?
- Yeah.

250
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,080
S-Sure.

251
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,860
I'll bring up my QR code.

252
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,330
Thanks, I'll scan it then.

253
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,690
- Got it!
- Yeah?

254
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,230
- Great.
- Thanks.

255
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,050
Here, I'll send you a sticker.

256
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,240
It's not that I really want a girlfriend,

257
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,820
I just want to find someone special, just for me.

258
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,480
Thanks for coming along with us today.

259
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,730
All that activity definitely tired me out though.

260
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,150
Really? You seemed to enjoy the company.

261
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,760
You mean Akane? Yeah, we were on the same wavelength.

262
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,930
I'm so glad you got along with everyone today.

263
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,900
Asking you to join was definitely the move.

264
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,720
Hell, I didn't even need to be there.

265
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,740
Those guys would've seen how great you are regardless.

293
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,020
A childhood friend...?

294
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,330

It's not like Kakeru is yours to keep.

300
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,650
He's mine.

301
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,120
Do you... not want me to get a girlfriend?

302
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,340
Not everything's an open book between us.
[These childhood friends, are headed for unknown waters...!?]
