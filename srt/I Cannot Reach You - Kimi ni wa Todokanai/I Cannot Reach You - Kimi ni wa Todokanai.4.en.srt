1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,110
You'll gain knowledge and insight of daily life skills,

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,490
and learn to respect the rules of a community.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,490
You'll also acquire upstanding morals, through this shared experience.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,520
An experience, also known as...

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,430
The school trip!

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,050
- No reaction?
- No, you're just way too hyped about this!

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,930
You're not excited?!

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,850
Whatever happened that day, has remained vague between us.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
Now groups, plan your schedule.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,790
You've been staring at me. What is it?

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,110
Hosaka?

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,400
I've just always wanted to get to know you.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,630
So I'm glad we're in the same group.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,460
Look here. There's a town named "Ohara" in Kyoto. Just like you.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,830
Ohara's the suburbs. We can't visit—

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,970
I never said anything about visiting.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,060
Just thought I'd mention it.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,200
You know a lot about Kyoto, Ohara.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,420
A little.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,120
I want to get photos at Fushimi Inari Shrine.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,820
Great idea.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,570
Any other places you'd recommend?

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,030
Well, if we go to Fushimi Inari,

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,360
the nearby Tofuku-ji Temple is nice.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,510
It's got great views, too.

26
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,610
Is there anywhere you want to go, Kakeru?

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,630
Not really. Just give me the good food, and I'm satisfied.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,370
I should've expected that.

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,080
You literally hugged me.

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,670
How can you be acting like it never happened?!

31
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,410
Maybe it meant nothing to him?

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,060
Then I'm the only one panicking over this, like an idiot.

33
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,730
Kakeru!

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,030
I thought we could eat lunch together today.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,120
Here's your half.

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,220
Thank you.

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,150
Nothing.

38
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,530
Yamato, how come you know so much about Kyoto?

39
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,740
My dad was born and raised there.

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,020
- Really?!
- Yeah.

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,490
So that's it...

42
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,520
I guess there's still stuff I don't know about you, huh?

43
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,850
Wait, don't tell me.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,460
Are there places you want to go, but aren't bringing up to us,

45
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,200
because you've been before?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,640
That's a bad habit of yours.

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,220
Sorry.

48
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,830
So, tell me. Where do you want to go?

49
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,050
I'd like to visit Arashiyama again.
(A district in Kyoto)

50
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,990
The view from Togetsukyo Bridge is beautiful.

51
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,320
I've always liked it there.

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,280
But I'll have another chance to go.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,020
- We should let the others—
- Okay.

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,090
Then let's use our free time on the second day to visit Arashiyama.

55
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,470
After hearing your rave reviews, I'm itching to visit too.

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,670
Is that okay?

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah. Let's go see that Togetsukyo Bridge.

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,930
Promise.

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,720
Thanks, Kakeru.

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,060
No need to thank me.

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,730
Yamato's not acting any different.

62
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,020
But here I am, getting flustered on my own.

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,650
Say, hear me out.

64
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,110

65
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,590
Why did you...

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,670
It's so nice out today!

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,210
Kakeru, you were saying?

68
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,090
Nothing. Let's start heading back.

69
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,490
We need to prep for PE.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,100
Right.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,550
What was going through Yamato's mind when he did that?

72
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,750
Kakeru!

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,330

74
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,450
I'm fine, thanks.

75

Be careful on the steps.

76
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,560
Can I keep up as Yamato's friend

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,350
while holding onto these weird feelings?

78
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,590
And what exactly should I be doing... with this odd feeling?

Now, smile!

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,350
Yeah, fine.

We wanted to keep it a surprise!

104
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,410
- Right?
- Right!

105
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,100
Fun fact about this shrine. It's actually famous for matchmaking!

106
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,420
So, dibs on Yamato.

107
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,070
Sorry, I need the bathroom.

109
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,560
No? What trick?

110
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,340
If you give this charm to your crush during the school trip,

111
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,060
and they accept it, your feelings will be mutual.

182
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,650
I want to become that special someone in your heart.

183
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,770
Kakeru...

184
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,950
can't it be me?

185
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,040
What're you two doing out here, having a moment?

186
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,060
Was I asleep?

187
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,950
Go wash up and pass out already!

188
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,150
Otherwise I can't get any shut eye either.

189
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,170
Let a guy rest, will ya?

190
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,880
Let's go take a dip in the baths.

191
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,550
The baths...?

192
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,170
Hot springs, hot springs, hot springs!

193
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,610
A bath?

194
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,240
Taking a bath, with Yamato?

195
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay?

196
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,430
No, it's nothing.

197
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,570
Is that so?

198
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,420
Hold on, why am I getting nervous?

199
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,360
Guys take baths together. That's normal!

200
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,330
- Ready to go, Kakeru?
- M-M-Me?

201
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,270
Is Ashiya here?

202
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,820
Dude, you sound pathetic.

203
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,100
- So?
- Kurosawa's calling.

204
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,010
Kurosawa?

205
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,790
- Why?
- A confession, perhaps?

206
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,900
I'll head to the baths first.

207
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,000
I need you to hand this to Ohara.

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,310
You have to.
[Shimamaru Shrine]

209
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,490
You have to give it to him during this trip. Okay?

210
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,010
A charm? Hand that to him yourself.

211
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,020
Take a hint, or else.

212
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,250
You're terrifying.

213
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,820
I'm counting on you.

214
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,750
[Matchmaking Charm]

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,200
I feel so worn out from today...

216
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,810
I've ended up harboring this weird feeling all day.

217
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,250
Meanwhile, Yamato's acting like nothing is up.

218
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,700
If I also return to normal, then our problem is solved.

219
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,510
But... is that really the solution?

220
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,160
Ashiya.

221
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,090
You got out of the bath fast.

222
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm more of a shower guy. Everyone else is still soaking though.

223
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Is that a charm?

224
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,300
Yeah. I was told it's for Yamato.

225
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,460
Speaking of Ohara, I wonder if he hates me.

226
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,480
I mean, look at how he treats me.

227
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Well, yeah, that's because you get all up in his face.

228
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,160
You think?

229
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,260
Yamato has always been a shy guy.

230
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,820
He's no good with people who ignore personal space, like you.

231
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:39,100
I guess childhood friends really do know everything about each other.

232
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,340
That's not true.

233
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,600
We have things we'd rather keep to ourselves.

234
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,260
And to be honest, I never know what's on Yamato's mind.

235
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,410
Then why not just ask?

236
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,740
I'm always quick to speak my mind.

237
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,510
Of course, that's made some people dislike me.

238
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,110
But you won't ever know how someone feels unless you ask.

239
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,820
Sure, but...

240
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,420
Prying might change your relationship with that person.

241
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,990
Doing nothing maintains the status quo.

242
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,040
You think?

243
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,810
Doing nothing

244
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,040
doesn't always guarantee stability, you know?

245
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,650
Choosing ignorance and glossing over things,

246
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,950
those are already signs of change.

247
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,720
So it's more about how you want to act,

248
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,820
and which relationships you want to maintain.

249
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,060
To regret or not to regret.

250
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,580
That's a choice you can make.

251
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,850
Kakeru, we all finished soaking without you.

252
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,290
Oh, right.

253
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,290
It's nothing.

254
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,490
I need to have a proper talk with Yamato.

255
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,330
Damn it!
(Game - "Tekken 7")

256
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,400
You still got a chance— No!

257
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,220
What was that move?!

258
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,910
- The Phoenix Smasher.
- So you're good at games, too?
(A move used by Paul Phoenix, from Tekken 7)

259
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,350
- I guess so...
- I guess?

260
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,810
- You admitted it!
- Hey, knock it off...

261
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,070
Dude, don't you need to return to your room?

262
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,920
- What time is it?
- 10:30 p.m.

263
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,500
There's a faculty meeting until 11:00.

264
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,920
- I just need to be back by then.
- Awesome.

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,460
- Then three more rounds.
- Hey, guys.

266
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,040
Murasen's checking for lights out.

267
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,800
Already?!

268
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,560
Wait, the game. The game!

269
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,910
Let's see if anyone's awake...

270
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,920
Anyone... Anyone?

271
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,180
- I'll help.
- Unplug it.

272
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,770
- Got it?
- Got it.

273
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,270
- Thanks.
- I'll grab this.

274
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,640
Someone get the controllers!

275
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,670
And now what? Sleep?

276
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,310
He's coming! He's here!

277
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm turning off the lights.

278
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,660
H-Hey!

279
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,080
This smells like...

280
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,860
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side, ♫

281
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,260
Just... bear with it for a bit.

282
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,400
♫ As naturally as breathing ♫

283
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,170
♫ Laughing, crying ♫

284
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:19,670
♫ You probably won't reach it, you probably won't understand ♫

285
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:26,480
♫ So you won't notice my wavering heart ♫

286
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,180
♫ Let me be ♫

287
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,920
♫ How much further until I reach your place? ♫

288
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,390
♫ Until I reach it, I don't wanna cry ♫

289
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,470
♫ My heart hurts ♫

290
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:44,180
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

291
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,830
♫ If our wishes could come true, even for just a moment ♫

292
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,680
♫ Please stand beside me without asking anything ♫

293
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,000
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫

294
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,780
♫ I can't say more than this ♫

295
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,340
♫ U&I, U&I ♫

296
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,780
Aren't your eye bags too dark?
[After that exciting night, their relationship has rapid progress!?]

297
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,980
I'm glad I didn't forget about it.
[After that exciting night, their relationship has rapid progress!?]

298
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,850
I told you I won't accept it.

299
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,170
I'll hang out with them.

300
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,250
Are you really okay, not doing anything about it?
[The promise he wanted to keep...]

301
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,150
We made a promise, Yamato!
