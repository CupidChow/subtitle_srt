1
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,090
What am I doing to a sick person?

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,270
See you tomorrow.

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,030
I thought he was going to kiss me!

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm glad you recovered from your cold.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,070
Did you sleep the whole time?

6
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,920
Well...

7
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,390
Koki. Sorry to make you wait.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,690
Why is everyone so lovey-dovey?

9
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,370
The power of Sakisaka Day is incredible!

10
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,220
Does it feel warm?

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,900
Oh, Fujino. What are your plans with your girlfriend on Christmas?

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,570
We were just going to have a laid-back date at home.

13
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,600
That's so normal.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,230
You think so, right?

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,730
But actually, my parents will be going on a trip that day.

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,390
Seriously?

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,010
So, you're finally gonna—?

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,600
What about you, Kakeru? What happened after the confession?

19
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,910
What's wrong?

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,830
Yamato, what are you doing on Christmas Eve?

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,250
I don't have any plans yet.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Shall we have another date to make up for the previous one?

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,190
Why are you so shocked?

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,620
Well...

25
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,510
I didn't expect you to ask me on a date on Christmas Eve.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
Thank you.

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,130
That makes me really happy.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,650
I'll tell him on Christmas Eve. I'll tell him how I feel.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,740
Okay.

30
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,150
I've always turned to Yamato for help.

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,170
So after I work hard on my own, I'll tell him that I like him.

32
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,610
Ashiya's been working hard lately. He even studies during breaks.

33
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,980
Are you feeling lonely, Ohara?

34
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,060
It's a good thing to be hardworking, though.

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,670
You must be lonely.

36
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,700
Be quiet.

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,130
Next, Ohara.

38
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,500
94 points.

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,920
Whoa! You did better than me.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,500
You must have worked hard.

41
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,060
I wore this on our last date.

42
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,440
And I wore this at the festival.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm so lame! Doing a fashion show all by myself. So lame!

44
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,220
I'm so lame to put so much effort into dressing up!

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,900
Tomorrow is... Christmas Eve.

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,800
I can't wait to tell Yamato how I feel.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,180
You haven't gotten any reply to your confession, have you?

48
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,760
It's fine. Kakeru must be thinking about it.

49
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,590
He's making you wait for such a long time. What if he rejects your confession?

50
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,010
Even if he does... I'll be fine.

51
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,170
Even after knowing my feelings, he hasn't changed.

52
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,310
And he said that he worried about me.

53
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,120
Just that makes me feel like all my feelings up until now have been rewarded.

54
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,720
But...

55
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,940
I'll still cry if he rejects me.

56
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,030
If that happens, I'll keep you company until morning.

57
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,240
Thank you.

58
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,080
Hey, stop it!

59
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,900
- Just for a little bit.
- No.

60
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,080
- I'm not going.
- It's a nice place.

61
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,220
- Let's go.
- I said no!

62
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,640
I don't want to.

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Stop it!

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,400
I said I don't want to go! Stop it!

65
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,040
Kakeru would definitely intervene...

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,350
Just leave me alone!

67
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,930
Excuse me. She's my friend.

68
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,850
Kakeru!

69
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,020
Yuppee!

70
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,100
- I just happened to walk by—
- You were so cool!

71
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,170
Right?

72
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,830
When I was walking, some guys—

73
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,750
By the way, you guys must be close to be spending Christmas together!

74
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,030
It's nothing special.

75
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,710
What kind of a relationship do you guys have?

76
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,780
Well...

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
We are childhood friends.

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Childhood friends?

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,670
- Yes.
- I see.

80
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,310
I'm going home.

81
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,660
Please enjoy yourselves.

82
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,420
Kakeru!

83
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,070
Kakeru! Kakeru, stop!

84
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,170
I said stop!

85
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,720
Sorry, are you okay?

86
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,400
You don't really like me, do you?

87
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,560
You don't really like me, do you?

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Kakeru.

89
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,290
Why would you do this on Christmas, of all days?

90
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,830
You're wrong! I met her totally by coincidence!

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,840
Kakeru. Look at me.

92
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,570
Look at me.

93
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,660
Kakeru.

94
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,300
When it comes to you,

95
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,180
I never know what to do.

96
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,860
I was really looking forward to today.

97
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,250
But...

98
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,770
I keep making myself look like an idiot.

99
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,920
That's not true.

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,510
I felt the same way.

101
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,290
I wasn't confident.

102
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,030
I kept running away.

103
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,380
However...

104
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm glad that I fell in love with you.

105
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,980
Just now, when I saw that woman in trouble,

106
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,960
I thought that if it were you, you would definitely help her.

107
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,070
Thinking that made me so happy.

108
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,770
Why are you crying?

109
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,340
Because... I like you.

110
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,960
Finally, I got you.

111
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,060
Thank you for crying...

112
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,230
for my sake.

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,560
Sorry.

114
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,450
Now...I'm taking a bath at Yamato's place.

115
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,600
Kakeru?

116
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,990
- Yes?
- I'll leave the clothes and towel here.

117
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,360
Okay.

118
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,180
Okay, all done.

119
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,870
Thank you.

120
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,290
Kakeru, your hair is so fluffy.

121
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,670
It's just frizzy.

122
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,780
And I always get bedhead. It's such a pain.

123
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,470
Well, I like your hair.

124
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,300
What are you talking about?

125
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,560
You have such beautiful, straight hair!

126
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,790
Kakeru!

127
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,400
Stop—

128
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,870
When you said you liked me, I was so happy.

129
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,790
I was so happy, I thought it was a dream.

130
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,940
That's why I didn't want you to leave.

131
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,030
I used the cold as an excuse,

132
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,660
and suggested you come to my place to warm up.

133
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,960
I feel the same way.

134
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,630
I don't...

135
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,000
want to leave just yet.

136
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,120
We're the first ones here!

137
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,390
Maybe they'll change seating arrangements for the 3rd term.

138
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,820
I really like this seat because of the sunshine, though.

139
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,180
Is that the only reason?

140
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,980
And because I'm behind you.

141
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,870
Someone might come!

142
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,350
Then...

143
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,660
Is it okay now?

144
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,690
Good morning.

145
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,480
G-Good morning! You're here early!

146
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm on duty. You guys are here early, too.

147
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,060
Wait... Are we dating?

148
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,660
God, are we dating?

149
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,600
Are you guys dating?

150
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,430
Well, I'm happy with the way things are now.

151
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,550
If we start dating, we might break up someday.

152
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,360
Kakeru, are you done?

153
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,590
Ouch!

154
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,200
Yamato, this is so embarrassing.

155
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,120
But you're injured, so we have no choice but to do this.

156
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,360
I want to do this.

157
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,330
Okay, all done.

158
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,660
Thank you.

159
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,270
I didn't sleep well. Shall I just go take a nap?

160
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,250
I didn't sleep well, either.

161
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,160
Hop on. I'll carry you to bed.

162
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,450
No, I can walk!

163
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,130
You're just exaggerating things.

164
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,930
I can't help it. I'm worried about you, after all.

165
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,920
Why didn't you sleep well?

166
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,090
Because... I was thinking about you.

167
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,230
Thinking about me?

168
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,650
When I woke up in the morning,

169
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,850
I wondered what I would do if your feelings had cooled off.

170
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,460
Yamato always tells me his feelings so honestly.

171
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,090
That's why...

172
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,800
when you said you didn't sleep well, I was a little relieved.

173
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,980
I thought you might have been feeling the same way.

174
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,210
I should be honest with him too, then.

175
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,480
Yamato.

176
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,190
Please be my boyfriend.

177
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,520
If my feelings were to cool off over time,

178
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,380
I wouldn't have worried about them this much.

179
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,960
Yamato, I really like you.

180
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,300
I want to be someone special to you.

181
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,130
Well... what about you?

182
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,940
What do you think?

183
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,160

185
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,140
I feel the same way.

186
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,090
Thanks to our Chief Editor kakashiandme

187
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,590
Kakeru.

188
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,070
Please be my boyfriend.

189
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,190
Okay.

190
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,290
I was so nervous.

191
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,510
I've wanted to tell you for so long.

192
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,300
But I wanted to show you my best.

193
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,060
I studied so hard, and I wanted to confess to you at the park.

194
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,320
But I caught a cold in the rain.

195
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,700
All that...

196
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,660
was for me?

197
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,930
Maybe we should head back to the classroom.

198
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,650
For the longest time,

199
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,580
I've wanted to do this.

200
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,010
Yamato.

201
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,600
♫ Please stand beside me without asking anything ♫

202
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,210
Yama—
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫

203
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,580
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫

204
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,450
♫ I can't say more than this ♫

205
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,130
♫ U&I, U&I ♫

206
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,630
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side ♫

207
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,780
♫ As naturally as breathing ♫

208
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,810
♫ Laughing, crying ♫

209
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,610
Ashiya.
♫ Laughing, crying ♫

210
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,240
♫ You probably won't reach it, you probably won't understand ♫

211
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,790
Is he okay?

212
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,450
He wasn't feeling well.

213
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,500
Then, let him sleep here.

214
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,610
♫ Let me be ♫

215
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,370
♫ How much further until I reach your place? ♫

216
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,780
♫ Until I reach it, I don't wanna cry ♫

217
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,900
♫ My heart hurts ♫

218
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,670
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

219
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,110
Goodnight.
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

220
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,470
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

221
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,100
♫ If our wishes could come true, even for just a moment ♫

222
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,620
♫ Please stand beside me without asking anything ♫

223
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,000
It's easy to understand why you stole my heart.

224
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,820
However... I thought my feelings would never reach you.

225
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,340
Along the way, those feelings became painful.

226
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,130
But you transformed them into happiness.

227
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,450
I'm sure the future holds all sorts of things for us.

228
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,910
- I'll leave you behind.
- We might argue.

229
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,860
We might even be brought to tears.

230
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,830
But I want to tell you each and every time.

231
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,430
Let's go home together.

232
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,590
I hope these feelings reach you.

233
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,140
Want to watch a movie?
