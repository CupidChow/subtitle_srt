I can hear his heart beating.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,880
The warmth of Kakeru's body...

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,050
makes me feel dizzy.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,810
His heat...

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,150
is melting my body.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,500
Are you all really asleep?

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,120
No way.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,910
This is boring.

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,930
Murasen is gone.

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,120
Oh! I didn't notice at all!

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,590
You guys must be really close to be able to share a bed.

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,550
No way, we're not that close.

13
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,850
- Right?
- I'll go get some water.

14
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,830

[Episode 5]

18
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,270
You guys have wicked eyebags.

19
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,550
I couldn't sleep last night because I had too many things on my mind.

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
Kakeru, you'll get ketchup on your sleeve.

21
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,300
That was close!

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,230
Is he your dad?

23
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,080
Of course not!

24
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm going to eat.

25
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,740
This tastes so good!

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,720
So, where are you guys going today?

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,890
Arashiyama. I heard there are loads of shops that sell delicious food there.

28
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,200
The only thing you're interested in is food...

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,630
Am not! I also want to go to the pretty bamboo forest.

30
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,150
It's a bamboo "grove".

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,920
Well, I'm glad you guys are close,

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,570
but you'll never be able to get a girlfriend at this rate.

33
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,410
Girlfriend talk again, Fujino?

34
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,340
That's why...

35
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,220
Stay with me a little longer. Okay?

36
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,390
That's fine with you guys. Right?

37
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,210
- What?
- Hurry up.

38
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,360
Eat up and let's go!

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Why do you and I have to wait?

40
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,660
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

41
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,790
No, I'm okay.

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,750
Really?

43
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,410
You've got ketchup on your mouth.

44
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,350
I will wipe it myself. It's fine.

45
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,270
That's right. I'm sorry.

46
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm so glad it's sunny today!

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,530
What is Fujino doing? What's taking him so long?

48
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,520
At that time...

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,800
what was going on in Kakeru's mind?

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,740
I almost forgot.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,710
This is for you.

They say if you give it to the person you like during the school trip,

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,120
your love will come true if the person accepts it.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,010
- What is this?
- Kurosawa asked me to give it to you.

56
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm glad I didn't forget about it.

57
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,800
Yamato?

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,480
Why are you giving me a charm from someone else?

59
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,560
Well, that's because she asked me to do so.

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,670
Return it to her. I won't accept this.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,090
Wait up! Why are you angry?

62
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,250
I told you I won't accept it.

63
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,230
Then you can return it to her yourself.

64
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,080
Why do you need to get angry at me?

65
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,570
Would you do anything if someone asks you to do it?

66
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,060
Don't you have a mind of your own?

67
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,070
Why are you acting like this?

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,650

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,780

What's going on?

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,180
Kakeru.

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,960
Come over here for a moment.

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,190
I was talking to them just now.

76
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,740
Shall we give some time to Kakeru and Akane for themselves?

77
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,220
- What?
- They seem good together. Right?

78
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,330
Sorry to disrupt your schedule.

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,270
Hey, your hair looks different today.

Kaho did it for me.

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,920
It suits you.

Thank you.

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,800
Yamato! Let's have fun together today!

85
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,620
It's been a while since we had fun together.

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,740
That's right. It's better to go around with the girls today.

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,060
But I made a promise with Yamato...

88
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,730
Sure.

89
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,180
I'll hang out with them.

90
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,930
Yay!

91
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,100
- What about Togetuskyo Bridge? We have a promise—
- Forget it.

92
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
I didn't want to go that badly.

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,040
We'll be on our way.

94
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,940
Kakeru and Akane, you both go have fun.

95
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,070
What?

96
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,140
Let's go over there!

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,630
Let's go.

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,870
- Yamato, do you want some?
- Have mine!

99
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,450
No, I'm fine.

100
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,440
Of course it's a no!

101
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,460
- Look at this pic!
- Show me!

102
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,600
I hope that things go well for Akane and Kakeru.

103
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,700
It'll be great!

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,070
Ohara, where should we go now?

105
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,740
Ohara?

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,120
This area is so pretty.

107
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,720
Kakeru?

108
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,400
Kakeru.

109
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,320
Sorry. I was in a daze.

110
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,650
I'm sorry things turned out weird.

111
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,820
No, I should be the one apologizing.

112
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,710
You came all the way to Kyoto, but you're stuck with me.

113
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,150
No, I'm totally fine with it.

114
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,210
But you had a promise with Yamato. Right?

115
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,770
Don't worry about it. Yamato already said to forget it.

116
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,960
Well, since we're here, are there any shops you'd like to visit?

117
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,130
I wonder if Yamato's drinking green tea with Kakeru right now.

118
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,060

Ohara! What a coincidence!

121
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,940
You don't need to run away from us.

122
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,450
We're friends, after all!

123
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,680
Let me go.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,890
Oh? Where's Ashiya?

125
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,220
Why are you alone?

126
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,700
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,730
Here's your Tenryuji Parfait and Kyokuro rolls.

128
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,070
It's so pretty!

129
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,860
I know. It's so pretty!

130
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,540
And it's delicious!

131
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,160
I'm glad you're okay with sweets.

132
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,630
Yamato and I often go eat sweets together.

133
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,380
Wow, that's unexpected.

134
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,820
Yamato seems like he wouldn't like sweets.

135
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,970
That's true. He doesn't eat much, but he comes along with me.

136
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,570
- He's a kind person, isn't he?
- Yeah.

137
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,930
So then you cancelled your plans?

138
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,790
I guess...

139
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,330
But I shouldn't ruin such a good chance for him.

140
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,750
Chance?

141
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,970
It's common sense to choose to spend time

142
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,690
with the girl who might become his girlfriend instead of me.

143
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,370
- Common sense?
- Who said that's common sense?

144
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,610
I didn't have a choice.

145
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,550
I'm just his friend.

146
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,450
Are you okay?

147
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,300
Ohara, what are you going to do now?

148
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,260
- I was thinking of going to take some photos.
- Photos? Where?

149
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,060
The Bamboo Grove and Togetsukyo Bridge.

150
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,370
If I take the photos, I can show them to Kakeru later.

151
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,520
How noble.

152
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,070
Why do you want to show him so badly?

153
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,890
Well,

154
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,320
I've loved those views since I was a kid.

155
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,800
The tall blue skies.

156
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,260
The sound of the river.

157
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,030
Those are all...

158
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,450
special places to me.

159
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,520
I wanted Kakeru to see them, too.

160
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
And Ashiya?

161
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,830
Did you tell Ashiya that?

162
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,790
No.

163
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,220
I don't need to tell him all that.

164
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,550
Where shall we go now?

165
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,730
Let's see... Oh!

166
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,570
I have a guidebook with me.

167
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,210
Kakeru,

168
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,290
are you having fun?

169
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,820
Yes, I am. Why do you ask that?

170
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,610
Because you've been lost in your thoughts since we split ways with the group.

171
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,780
Sorry. I just didn't sleep well.

172
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,810
I'm fine now. Let's think about where we should go.

173
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,250
[This looks like a place Kakeru would like.]

174
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,320
Huh? This is Yamato's guidebook.

175
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,410
I'll get going then.

176
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,490
Are you trying to act like a heroine in a tragedy?

177
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:21,010
You've been talking about "common sense" and "not needing to tell him" things.

178
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,950
Are you trying...

179
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,290
to endure everything yourself to make him happy?

180
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,110
- What?
- You're just putting a curse on yourself.

181
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,250

How well do you understand Ashiya, then?

185
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,680
Doesn't he want to know how you really feel?

186
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,980
You're just assuming how he feels.

187
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,820
So which one of us really acts like they know everything?

188
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,450
There's no way I can tell him...

189

how I really feel.

190
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,270
If your true feelings truly ruin everything,

191
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,710
you two were never best friends, to begin with.

192

you keep thinking about something.

199
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,930
I don't have a clue what it is,

200
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,980
but is it really something you don't care about?

Kakeru!

207

If you are going to Arashiyama,

208
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,610
it's better to take the Hankyu train from Kawaramachi Station.

209

I always felt sad for some reason.

He's the most important person to me,

However...

218
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,820
