1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,020
I'm contented just to have him laugh beside me.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,900
That was what I've always thought.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,560
I don't think I can do this.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,260
- Be serious about it!
- The stronger my feelings for Kakeru become...

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,910
How can you not know this?

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,460
...the more I want him.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,150
I'm not someone you should like, Yamato.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,840
Do you really think that?

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,640
That was simply a one-sided desire on my part.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,720
It did nothing but scare Kakeru.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,130
Look...

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,390
About yesterday...

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,210
Ohara.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,860
Do you have a moment?

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,340
Yes, sir.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,880
Sorry, I have to get going.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,990
Sir.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,630
Brother.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,640
Brother.

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,160
- What's the matter?
- I'm going to the festival to buy some takoyaki.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Alone?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,470
What if some weirdo approaches you?

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,560
Instead of worrying about others, you should worry about yourself.

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,780
Brother,

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,850
you had a fight with Kakeru, didn't you?

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,820
[Wanna go to the festival?]

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,690
No, no way...

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,850
How did I end up outside Yamato's place?

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,760
[Yamato]
[Proceed to start voice call with Yamato?]
[Cancel] [Yes]

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,920
I can't!

31
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,480
I'd better go home.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,350
Kakeru?

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,500
Mikoto?

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Aren't you looking for my brother?

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,190
Yeah, but...

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,850
I bumped into Kakeru.

37
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,540
I'm heading to the shrine with him.

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,130
You see, I keep messing everything up.

39
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,110
I hate myself for being such a loser.

40
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,860
So I complained about it to Yamato.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,970
Kakeru, you don't have confidence in yourself.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,460
Though I don't know everything about my brother,

43
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,220
there's one thing that I'm sure of.

44
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,830
Yamato won't fall in love with just anyone.

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,220
Kakeru!

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,820
Yamato?

47
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,750
About the other day...

48
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,460
No, I'm sorry, too...

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,840
- The other day...
- Hang on a sec!

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,740
That's Ashiya and Ohara!

52
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,220
'Sup!

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,240
You two have made up, huh?

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,500
Enough about that!

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,730
I'm going to offer my prayers.

56
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,200
What the...?

57
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,320
[I Cannot Reach You]

58
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,800
[Episode 7]

59
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,780
Please let things go back to normal with Yamato and me.

60
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,460
What's happened between you two this time?

61
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,410
Kakeru doesn't have confidence in himself.

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,790
Just being with Kakeru is enough to make me happy.

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,050
But...

64
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,250
when I think about Kakeru's feelings when we're together,

65
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,650
I get sad.

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,740
So I did something rash.

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,600
Did you tell Ashiya about how you feel?

68
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,620
No.

69
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,420
Your feelings won't get through to him if you don't tell him.

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,210
If you keep this up, you guys will end up in an argument again.

71
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm going to find Kakeru.

72
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,590
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

73
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,420
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

74
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,720
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

75
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,680
That's great, isn't it?

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,890
Yamato?

77
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,350
Kakeru, do you still think you're nothing special?

78
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,320
I see.

79
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,370
Are you tired of hearing that?

80
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,180
A little.

81
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,610
I guessed as much.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,060
But...

83
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,250
I also like that part of you.

84
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,890
I like that you don't have much confidence.

85
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,990
I like that you help others in trouble.

86
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,320
I like that everyone adores you.

87
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,610
I like that you're so sincere with me, despite everything.

88
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,210
I like all of you.

89
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,820
So... you are special.

90
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,390
Somehow, that weird feeling in me has vanished.

91
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,690
Thank you.

92
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,840
Right now, I want to touch you like crazy.

93
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,810
I want to hold your hand.

94
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,540
I want to hold you.

95
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,500
I'm sorry about the other day...

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,390
for scaring you.

97
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,850
I won't do anything that'll make you uncomfortable again.

98
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,580
You don't have to worry.

99
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,050
I...

100
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,530
didn't say that I hated it.

101
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,850
Sure, I was a little surprised,

102
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,430
but I didn't hate it.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,940
I didn't.

104
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,640
That's unfair.

105
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,790
Really unfair.

106
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,490
Why are you telling me this?

107
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,400
I...

108
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,960
will work harder...

109
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,700
to make you fall in love with me.

110
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,210
Where did they go?

111
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,730
There they are!

112
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,600
- Found them.
- What were you two doing here?

113
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,390
None of your business!

114
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,780
Let's go.

115
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,820
- That's really suspicious.
- All this time, I had been afraid.

116
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,310
I had been suffering.

117
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,690
I kept wondering if my feelings for him would ruin our relationship.

118
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,980
But...

119
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,850
now, I can say...

120
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm glad to have fallen in love with Kakeru.

121
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,860
Slowly but surely,

122
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,090
I have a feeling that something is starting to change.

123
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,510
Kakeru, how did you score for the test?

124
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,230
[70]

125
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,480
70 points? You?!

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,190
Hey, dude, show some respect.

127
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,410
Kakeru, it's all because of your hard work.

128
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,910
I want to be proud of myself even when I'm with Yamato.

129
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,890
Hang on... Hang on, hang on!

130
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,040
What's up?

131
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,300
It's that, isn't it?

132
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,050
You were studying hard because of "that"?

133
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,600
"That"?

134
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,830
You plan to receive plenty of sweets on Sakisaka Day. Right?!

135
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,900
Huh? "Sakisaka Day"?

136
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,590
You don't know?

137
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,080
It's our school's traditional Confessions Day,

138
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,530
where couples are formed by confessing their feelings before Christmas.

139
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,040
Confession?

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,750
And when is that?

141
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,300
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?!

142
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,750
No, it'd be strange for me to give sweets to Yamato.

143
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,230
But...

144
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,160
if it's as a customary form of gratitude...

145
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,370
Besides, I feel bad for not giving an answer to his confession.

146
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,650
Kakeru?

147
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,310
Akane...

148
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,930
The last time we chatted like this was during our school trip.

149
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm really sorry about what happened.

150
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,350
Don't be.

151
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,620
Kakeru, were you looking to buy sweets?

152
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,380
A present for someone?

153
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,750
Y-Yeah. Like a customary form of gratitude.

154
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,450
I see.

155
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,400
But the present doesn't have any deep meaning.

156
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,070
There's someone you want to express gratitude to.

157
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,950
I think that's wonderful.

158
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,330
You think so?

159
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:37,530
If that person knows that you chose the present with them in mind,

160
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,330
I'm sure they'd be happy.

161
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,060
Thank you for helping me to choose the present.

162
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,330
I hope you have no troubles giving the present.

163
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,980
Now that I think about it,

164
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,120
isn't it gross that I'm giving someone sweets?

165
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,820
Kakeru, you're a wonderful guy.

166
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,450
Have more confidence.

167
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,780
In yourself and your feelings.

168
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,230
Akane...

169
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,050
Go for it.

170
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,310
Hey, I heard from Mr. Kimura
[Sakisaka Day]

171
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,390
- that he's not coming today.
- Huh? Why?

172
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,070
I'm not feeling well, so I'm going to the hospital.

173
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,860
Ashiya.

174
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,690
Ohara is absent on Sakisaka Day. What's going on?

175
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,890
- I don't know why he didn't come to school today.
- That's right!

176
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,990
He seems to be down with a cold.

177
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,500
What? A cold?

178
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,200
Ohara's been catching colds really often!

179
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,640
- Yeah.
- He's always sick!

180
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,770
Hey, ladies. Perhaps I'll receive these on his behalf.

181
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,420
Why should we give them to you?

182
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,550
Well, I mean...

183
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,520
Ashiya.

184
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,260
Here. Could you help me pass it to Ohara?

185
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,770
Again?

186
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,280
Even though I couldn't pass your lucky charm to him?

187
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,050
Then you must give it to him this time.

188
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,080
Would you do anything if someone asks you to do it?

189
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,430
Don't you have a mind of your own?

190
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,490
Sorry. I can't help you pass it to him.

191
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,320
Kakeru.

192
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,190
Aren't you feeling unwell? Are you okay?

193
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,580
I'm feeling fine. Mikoto—

194
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,920
She texted you.

195
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,380
Huh? Mikoto did?

196
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,800
- You seeー
- Sayー

197
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,250
Sorry.

198
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,880
You first.

199
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,370
You see...

200
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,480
I heard it's Sakisaka Day today.

201
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,130
This is for you.

202
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,750
Who's that from?

203
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,420
Me.

204
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,450
Is it gross?

205
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,660
It's gross for me to give you one, isn't it?

206
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,220
It's just a customary form of gratitude.

207
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,780
No, actually it's not.

208
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,980
I hope giving this to you makes you happy.

209
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,530
Here.

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,730
I'm so happy that I could die right now.

211
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,750
D-Don't.

212
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,980
Actually, I have something for you, too.

213
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,770
Here.

214
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,180
It's my first time baking sweets.

215
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,400
You made these?

216
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,420
What kind of feelings do I have for Yamato?

217
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,600
Bon appétit.

218
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm still feeling confused.

219
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,250
Incredible!

220
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,240
But...

221
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,190
I like Yamato.

222
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,250
It's nothing.

223
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,260
Have some too, Yamato.

224
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,450
Let's take a look at how these two factors influence each other.

225
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,190
First of all, regarding this...

226
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,410
I didn't confess to him...

227
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,410
What's wrong?

228
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,390
Nothing.

229
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,370
That was the most important part!

230
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,290
It's too embarrassing to confess to him now.

231
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,470
And how does this confession thing work?

232
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,180
No, this won't do.

233
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
I have to tell him clearly.

234
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,790
Kakeru, I like you.

235
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,450
All this time, I've loved you.

236
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,120
Yamato expressed his feelings to me loud and clear.

237
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,580
In any case, I have to make it look cool.

238
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,880
- Hey, did you watch the drama yesterday?
- I did!

239
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,740
That confession was so cool!

240
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,280
I'd love for someone to confess to me surrounded by beautiful scenery!

241
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,260
- It doesn't matter where, I just want to be confessed to!
- Beautiful... scenery?

242
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,590
Here's your half.

243
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,250
Thanks.

244
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,790
Thunder...

245
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,740
Hey...

246
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,810
There...

247
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,370
is something I want to tell you.

248
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,340
This comes a little late, but...

249
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,760
♫ If our wishes could come true, even for just a moment ♫

250
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,420
That was so quick!

251
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,660
Kakeru, let's go!

252
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,550
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫

253
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,010
And then, I alone caught a cold...

254
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,600
♫ U&I, U&I ♫

255
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,720
Yamato is here.

256
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,870
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side ♫

257
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,180
Kakeru?

258
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,480
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side ♫

259
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,670
♫ As naturally as breathing ♫

260
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,790
♫ Laughing, crying ♫

261
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,880
He's sleeping, huh?

262
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,620
Why am I pretending to sleep?

263
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,530
You're so lucky.

264
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,850
You get to be with him all the time.

265
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,490
♫ Let me be ♫

266
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,710
He has looked so adorable lately.

267
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,770
♫ My heart hurts ♫

268
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,340
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

269
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,090
♫ If our wishes could come true, even for just a moment ♫

270
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,940
♫ Please stand beside me without asking anything ♫

271
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,290
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫
[Coming up in the final episode...]

272
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,830
Shall we have a date to make up for the previous one?

273
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,350
No matter what Kakeru's reply is, I'm glad that I fell for him.

274
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,640
Kakeru, stop!

275
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,400
You don't really like me, do you?

276
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,140
Why are you crying?
