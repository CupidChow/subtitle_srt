1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,490
At first, I just wanted to be with him.

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,420
That's all it was. But now...

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,410
Yamato!

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,120
Kakeru?!

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,840
Now, my feelings have swelled far beyond that.

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,110
They've begun spilling out from my clutches.

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,390
I'm team pizza buns, all the way.

8
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,300
Those mushrooms you find in meat buns are gross.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm no mushroom fan either, but they are so minced, you can't tell.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,400
No way. No amount of mincing hides their presence from me.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,210
Mushrooms make themselves pretty obvious, huh?

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,690
Yamato, what's your go-to steamed bun?

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,910
Curry buns.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,970
Curry! I totally forgot about those.

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,580
Curry, huh?

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,090
[To: Ohara]

17
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,280
How do people feel when they express themselves to someone?

18
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,620
Will these feelings I keep hidden away,

19
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,620
suddenly disappear one day?

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,350
Will they eventually vanish for good?

21
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,900
Let's grab curry buns on our way back.

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,200
It's a deal.

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,330
[I Cannot Reach You]

24
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,480
[Episode 3]

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,980
Here's your half.

26
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,920
Thank you.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,060
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

28
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,330
Woah, curry buns are good!

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,050
Hey, could I come hang at your place again?

30
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,250
I need to try my hand at that game again.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,700
Even though you'll just lose?

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,740
Hey, I only need practice. All right?

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,050
I'm not giving up until I win.

34
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,450
Then I guess we'll go at it forever.

35
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,170
You make a point there...

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,620
Wait, hold on. Is that a good thing?

37
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,100
How about tomorrow?

38
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,370
I can't tomorrow.

39
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,370
- What about you and Akane, eh?
- We just text sometimes, that's all.

40
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,640
- Why?
- Mom's going shopping.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,220
I'm on little brother duty, for a mere 1,000 yen.

42
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,020
- Sounds like cheap pay.
- Right?

43
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,490
I definitely deserve more for that labor.

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,630
How many curry buns could you get with that?

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,620
Great question.

46
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,450
You're buying more?

47
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,890
I told you it's a sale day today! You can't be tired already.

48
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,450
I'm paying you 1,000 yen for this.

49
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,940
And it's cheap pay.

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,900
I wanna go see toy cars.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,250
Sure! Kakeru will take you.

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,150
- What? No, let's take a break.
- No! Toy store!

53
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,370
You're kidding...

54
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,360
Kakeru?

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,820
Akane.

56
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,990
Running errands?

57
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah. Mom's orders.

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,350
- Ah, hello.
- Hello.

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,030
Sorry, I must've scared you.

60
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,290
You have matching bedheads.

61
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,040
Seriously...?!

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,740
I'll take Riku to the toy store.

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,830
- What about your sales?
- It's fine, I'll manage.

64
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,080
Go enjoy yourselves!

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,730
See you later!

00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,430
Your mother seems fun to be around.

67
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,540
Thank you for waiting.

68
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,150
Here is your Strawberry Snowcream Pancake. Enjoy.

69
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,400
If you're happy, act more upfront about it.

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm always upfront with how I feel.

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,060
This is really good.

72
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,870
Want to try a bite?

73
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,250
A bite?

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,940
Yes, one bite.

75
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,310
I'll pass. It's all yours.

76
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,760
You're always like that.

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,390
Like, what?

78
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,110
Brother,

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,960
you love Kakeru, don't you?

80
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,110
So cute... these eyes are sucking me in!

81
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,970
Right?

82
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,580
It's so tiny.

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,120
Look! It's the bunny you tried to win for me.

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,180
I-I'm sorry I didn't give you that one...

85
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,970
Don't apologize. Kaho scored one for me too, remember?

86
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,820
Here you go.

87
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,790
- Thank you!
- One try is all it takes.

88
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,600
- Easy.
- In one try?

89
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,420
I told you I was good at crane games.

90
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,500
That was so much fun, wasn't it?

91
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,050
Here.

92
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,400
Thanks!

93
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,650
Yamato!

94
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,440
I want us to stay best friends. Okay?

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,360
Why did I grab onto him like that?

96
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,770
Best friends...

97
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,930
I wonder what Yamato's up to right now.

98
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,220
[Yamato]

99
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,620
No, no, no! Why am I feeling so weird?

100
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,110
Yamato and I are best friends.

101
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,370
I'm acting like...

102
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,540
- I—
- Kakeru?

103
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,170
Sorry, my mind was wandering.

104
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,670
- Let's check out that store, too.
- Sure.

105
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,790
Did you think I'd never catch on?

106
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,010
I've been your sister for years. Of course, I would.

107
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,860
Kakeru is just a childhood friend.

108
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,120
Sure, keep convincing yourself that.

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,400
But we are.

110
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's say Kakeru eventually gets a girlfriend

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,930
and decides to marry her,

112
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,990
would you truly be able to give them your blessings?

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,460
- I would.
- Really now.

114
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,680
Because if you can't,

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,490
you should give up on him early.

116
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,380
- Or else no one will end up happy.
- I know that already.

117
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,440
Brother,

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,940
you always prioritize others over yourself.

119
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,380
However...

120
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,680
don't you ever want to let your emotions flow?

121
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,790
Are you saying...

122
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,140
I should push my feelings onto him?

123
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,040
- Don't put it like that...
- And how do you think he'd feel afterward?

124
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,590
Ultimately...

125
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,360
that would only bring me solace.

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,660
I'm better off keeping this to myself.

127
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,020
As rational as ever, aren't you?

128
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,880
Does this look too mature on me?

129
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,810
No, not at all.

130
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,770
It matches your outfit from the other day.

131
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,290
- You think?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,310
Then I'll get this.

133
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,110
- I'll wait for you outside the store.
- Okay.

134
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,190
Akane is cute.

135
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,720
I have fun hanging out with her.

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,760
If we met any earlier, I would've easily been crushing on her.

137
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,430
But now...

138
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,510
Yamato?

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,950
Hey, Yamato.

140
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,240
Yamato.

141
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Dude, slow down.

142
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
What's gotten into you?

143
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
- And what are you doing here?
- Kakeru,

144
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,350
- why were you with that girl?
- Huh?

145
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,900
You told me you'd be out with family today.

146
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,430
- Well—
- You said things weren't like that with her.

147
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,570
Yamato...?

148
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,550
It'll always be this way.

149
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,580
Always.

150
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,560
Yamato? What's going on?

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,020
I don't have the courage to tell him how I feel.

152
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,530
I don't have the guts to ask him how he feels, either.

153
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,210
And yet...

154
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,700
I can't seem to give up.

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,810
Sorry, I'm getting a call.

156
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,990
[Akane]

157
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,370
It hurts.

158
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,220
Maybe he's using the restroom...

159
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,090
Mom, look. It's Kakeru's girlfriend.

160
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh my, where's Kakeru?

161
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,280
I seem to have lost him.

162
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,510
What? He got himself lost?

163
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,470
Brother is so lame!

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,450
Yamato?

165
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,080
Yamato...

166
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,320
Someone might pass by.

167
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,820
Yamato...

168
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,710
Kakeru,

169
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,880
I...

170
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,910
I really...

171
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,260
Mom, I found Kakeru!

172
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,310
Riku! What's up?

173
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,180
And look, Yamato's with him.

174
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,870
I just bumped into him.

175
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,230
We're bumping into all sorts of folks today, huh?

176
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,220
First Akane, now you.

177
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,650
Akane had to leave for cram school, Kakeru.

178
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,760
You shouldn't have left her hanging!

179
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,020
Sorry. I got the wrong idea.

180
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,410
Enjoy your shopping.

181
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,120
Yamato, hold on—!

182
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,650
You haven't earned 1,000 yen yet, mister.

183
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,300
- But this is important!
- Come on.

184
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,130
Yamato!

185
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,160
Kakeru,

186
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,650
I...

187
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,790
You staying after school or something?

188
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,120
Nah, I'm on my way out.

189
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,200
So, I heard you went on a date with Akane yesterday.

190
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
That wasn't a date.

191
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,850
We just ran into each other.

192
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,820
My girlfriend said Akane was over the moon though.

193
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,890
Go you.

194
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,770
Ashiya.

195
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,190
Mind telling me how you scored on today's exam?

196
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,550
- I got a 38.
- And I got your worksheet.

197
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,630
The worksheet specter strikes again...

198
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,690
I'm expecting spect-acular results next time.

199
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,640
Oh, that was so lame.

200
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,840
I expect that on my desk once you're done.

201
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,310
I'm heading home with my girl. See ya.

202
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,660
Sorry.

203
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,650
I'm busy today.

204
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,700
My bad, gotta dip. See ya.

205
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,860
'Sup, Ohara.

206
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,640
How about heading home together?

207
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,980
Hey, don't ignore my peace offering. This stuff's good.

208
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,690
Someone's gloomy today.

209
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,820
More gloomy than usual.

210
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,760
Lemme guess. Love problems?

211
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,390
That's none of your business, Hosaka.

212
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,920
Bullseye, huh? You suck at lying.

213
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,630
Ohara,

214
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,020
you've got a crush on Ashiya. Don't you?

215
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,870
It's pretty obvious.

216
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,270
Just like mushrooms in a meat bun.

217
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,590
Bit of a surprise, though.

218
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,000
You always seem so calm and collected.

219
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,270
Are things not working out with Ashiya?

220
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,680
Girls practically fall at your feet though.

221
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,220
Shut up.

222
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
You finally responded.

223
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,290
Go home alone.

224
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,210
You should just confess already.

225
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,090
I mean, Ashiya's definitely confused.

226
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,230
Especially since your feelings for him are spilling out.

227
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,890
- Spilling out...?
- Yup.

228
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,180
Even I caught on, you know?

229
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,860
Besides, if you keep it all in, it's only going to keep hurting.

230
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,440
Of course, if I totally misread the situation, that's on me.

231
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,160
But I can't say I enjoy watching Ashiya run in circles over this.

232
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,430
Look, I don't...

233
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,990
Kakeru and I are best friends.

234
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,450
Nothing more, nothing less.

235
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,980
Falling in love sure is a pain, isn't it?

236
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,750
You realize how jealous and selfish you can get.

237
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,350
It really pulls out a whole new side to yourself.

238
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,060
Sorry. I'm busy today.

239
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:25,690
However, isn't it better to take out your frustrations on yourself,

240
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,470
not on the other person?

241
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,080
Or so I say, but I'm no expert at this either.

242
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,730
See you around.

243
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,710
♫ If our wishes could come true, even for just a moment ♫

244
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,490
♫ Please stand beside me without asking anything ♫

245
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm sorry for the way I acted earlier.

246
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
I want to talk about yesterday.

247
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
♫ I don't wish for anything else ♫

248
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,510
♫ I can't say more than this ♫

249
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,300
♫ U&I, U&I ♫

250
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,940
I've got no motivation to do this...

251
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,520
♫ Whenever I realize, you're always by my side, ♫

252
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,100
I still don't have the courage...

253
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,710
[I'm sorry for the way I acted earlier.]

254
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,400
...to convey how I feel.

255
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,980
♫ As naturally as breathing ♫

256
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,300
♫ Laughing, crying ♫

257
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,250
Really,

258
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,210
how stupid can I be?

259
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,240
I got Kakeru wrapped up in my own angst...

260
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,560
and ended up hurting him.

261
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,050
♫ So you won't notice my wavering heart ♫

262
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,700
♫ Let me be ♫

263
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,450
♫ How much further until I reach your place? ♫

264
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,670
♫ Until I reach it, I don't wanna cry ♫

265
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,150
[Akane]
♫ Until I reach it, I don't wanna cry ♫

266
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,030
[I'm sorry I had to leave early yesterday. I had a blast!]
♫ My heart hurts ♫

267
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,470
♫ Time doesn't stop, U&I ♫

268
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,770
[I'm sorry I had to leave early yesterday. I had a blast!]

269
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,360
♫ If our wishes could come true, even for just a moment, ♫

270
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,140
♫ Please stand beside me without asking anything ♫

♫ I can't say more than this ♫

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,800
♫ U&I, U&I ♫

274
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,660
♫ Holding our connected hands tightly ♫

275
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,970
♫ Softly placing our wishes in the starry sky and praying ♫

276
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,180
Still...

277
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,430
I can't help it.

278
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,240
♫ Forever, may I stay by your side ♫

279
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,360
♫ U&I, U&I ♫

280
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,630
I...

281
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,880
...love Kakeru.

282
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,570
♫ Until the end, don't look away anymore ♫

283
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,320
♫ Because I promise, don't let go of both hands ♫

284
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,110
♫ A world filled with color ♫

285
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,680
An experience, also known as... the school trip!
[The school trip in Kyoto!]

286
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,420
You hugged me. How can you act like it never happened?!
[Will their feelings inch any closer...?]

287
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,300
I just want Kakeru to smile. That's all I need.
[Will their feelings inch any closer...?]

288
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,130
I'm acting way too conscious of him...

289
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,570
Kakeru,

290
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,150
can't it be me?
