2
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,516
I think that man…

3
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,189
is still alive.

4
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,361
Are you okay?

5
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,615
To my foolish question, she responded…

6
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,875
Am I dreaming?

7
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,713
I've been having so many nightmares.

8
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,730
He comes back to life

9
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,358
again

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,610
and again in those dreams.

11
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,240
They were terrifying, but I was okay.

12
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,118
Because they were just nightmares.

13
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,869
But…

14
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,084
do you mean that nightmare
has come true now?

15
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,671
Perhaps.

16
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,392
Bring it on.

17
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,855
Keep coming if you dare.

18
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,983
I won't let a scumbag like you
trample over me.

19
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,819
I'll never give in.

20
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,540
-Look at my posture.
-What?

21
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,834
-Is this how you do it?
-So annoying.

22
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,795
-Come on, man. Don't laugh.
-Look at him.

23
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,965
-Do it properly.
-It's so hot.

24
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,510
It really wasn't you two who beat him up?

25
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,012
What?

26
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,932
By the time we got there,
he was already beaten to a pulp.

27
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,600
-Yeah.
-Then who was it?

28
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,894
I'm telling you
he was completely knocked out.

29
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,397
-Knocked out?
-What are you guys whispering over there?

30
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,067
It's rude to leave us out of it.

31
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,196
Why are you swinging your arm?
Did you get a frozen shoulder again?

32
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,991
I told you to do
some stretching like this.

33
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,205
My goodness.
She thinks stretching is a cure-all.

34
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,373
Just try it, okay?

35
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,043
Here he comes. The cure-all.

36
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,089
-There must be a survivor.
-Seriously.

37
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,840
Come on, man.

38
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,387
Would you like some honey water?

39
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,013
No, I'm okay.

40
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,933
-Do you like pine nuts?
-I do, but no thank you.

41
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,560
-Would you like to join our resident--
-No.

42
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,230
-He's so rude.
-His parents must be so proud, right?

43
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,148
They must not need anything else.

44
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,359
Of course not.

45
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,111
-They wouldn't even need to eat.
-Totally.

46
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,279
They would die then.

47
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,571
-Jeez.
-What?

48
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,242
I'm sure your parents are great too.
What do they do for a living?

49
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,287
-We don't know anything about you.
-That's right.

50
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,830
They're going to interrogate him now.

51
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,456
-Got a girlfriend?
-How tall are you?

52
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,458
-How old are you?
-What are your hobbies?

53
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,876
What are you good at?

54
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,045
What's your name, Mr. Chef?

55
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,896
Eun Gyehoon.

56
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,483
My name is Eun Gyehoon.

57
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,819
What's the real reason?

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,488
Was it really to find your sister?

59
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,533
No.

60
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,118
Then?

61
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,412
Perhaps,

62
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,540
the one I'm trying to find…

63
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,792
is one of them.

64
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:50,767
THE CHILD RETURNS

65
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
EPISODE 5

66
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,856
I'm going to eat a lot from now on
and become strong and healthy.

67
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,107
But you've always eaten a lot.

68
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,318
That's one thing
that you've always done well.

69
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm speaking metaphorically.
I don't mean just eating,

70
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,407
but what eating represents.

71
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,993
Like courage, determination,
and resolution.

72
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,162
-What is she saying?
-Beats me.

73
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,248
I guess she's determined now.

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,583
I see.

75
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,589
Mom, Grandma. By any chance…

76
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,590
By any chance?

77
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,385
That scum--

78
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,762
-What scum?
-Who's bothering you this time?

79
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,349
Never mind.

80
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,519
Well, I'm not 100% sure yet
that he's alive.

81
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,525
I said never mind.

82
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,152
I mean it.

83
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,406
Stop glaring and eat.
I'm going to have indigestion.

84
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,202
-By the way, you.
-What about me?

85
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,454
You're no longer a teenager.
Stop rebelling, okay?

86
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,332
Quit that chef's restaurant at once
and find a new job.

87
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,336
Or else, I'll meet with him myself
and duel it out.

88
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,338
-Come on, Mom.
-How could he make you work for him

89
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,798
when we have a restaurant too?

90
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,216
He has no business ethics.

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,884
I'll handle this right now--

92
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,594
But he has the upper hand.

93
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,680
What?

94
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,516
We need to get on his good side.

95
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,892
Why?

96
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,104
It's okay. Just tell us.

97
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,189
The thing is that…

98
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,236
I kind of shared my secret with him.

99
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,239
I think he has something on me.

100
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,991
No way.

101
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,868
He knows everything.

102
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,578
About what?

103
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,873
That I killed someone

104
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,334
and hid the body in the refrigerator.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
How?

106
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,005
I told him everything.

107
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,467
Did he threaten you to tell him?

108
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,801
We were just eating.

109
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,553
He threatened you while you were eating?

110
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,889
Well, I had a drink too.

111
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,726
I was buzzed, so I spilled everything
even though he didn't ask--

112
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,853
Darn, you little…

113
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,812
Use your words!

114
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,690
You've really lost your mind!

115
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,693
-I didn't tell him everything.
-Why would you tell him about that?

116
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,070
I just said I killed someone,
but he figured it out.

117
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,906
-Grandma!
-Let go, Mom.

118
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,366
-It turns out that he's very smart.
-You're complimenting him

119
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,577
in the middle of this?
How could you tell him that?

120
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,454
-Darn it. Come here!
-Grandma!

121
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,955
Grandma, I'm going.

122
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,624
Hey, come back here!

123
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,876
Come back here now!

124
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,213
Dear heart, stop beating so fast.

125
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,465
And remember this.

126
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,509
I've never been concerned about you.

127
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,511
I do admit
that I sympathized with you at times.

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,179
But that's it.

129
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,390
Don't forget.

130
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,059
His kindness means pity.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,602
Is everything all right?

132
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,813
Yes, chef.

133
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,231
That's good…

134
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,693
to hear.

135
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,908
Everyone is late today.

136
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,326
I'm just early.

137
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,244
Oh.

138
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,621
Can you help me prep then?

139
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,915
Of course. I'm at your beck and call.

140
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,796
I'll help you tie it.

141
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,339
No thank you.

142
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,011
Dahyun, are the onions ready--

143
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,643
Dahyun, let me do it.

144
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,484
You cut the onion in half.

145
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,279
And then…

146
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,488
Dahyun,

147
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,282
can you check the taste?

148
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,329
It tastes good.

149
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,966
Have I done something today

150
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,802
that offended you or made you upset?

151
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
-No.
-I think I have.

152
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,722
Not at all.

153
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,307
Good morning.

154
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,855
Dahyun, you're smiling
even brighter today.

155
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,733
-Am I?
-He's right. Having a good day so far?

156
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,859
Yes, I am.

157
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,694
-I like your necklace.
-Do you like it?

158
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,946
They have many pretty things.
Do you want to go with me?

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,740
My mom will scold me if I go shopping.

160
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,450
Then I'll go. Bring me with you.

161
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,078
Butt out, Jinhoo.
Stop trying to hang out with us.

162
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,373
I'm not trying to hang out.
I just want to look too.

163
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,290
He's upset.

164
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,919
Excuse me, Ms. Noh.
The sauce we made earlier…

165
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,754
Yes, chef. The sauce?

166
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,395
So he knows everything?

167
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,437
Who?

168
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,025
Our lives depend on him.

169
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,487
Then…

170
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,666
we need to get on his good side.

171
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,006
Did you have breakfast?

172
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,510
If you haven't,
would you like a pot of stew?

173
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,013
Koreans need Korean food,
not Italian food.

174
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,057
Tell us any time
if you want Korean food, okay?

175
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,226
We consider our neighbors family.

176
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,186
Of course, they are.

177
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,403
Darn it, that kid.

178
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,197
Why do I have to brownnose up to him?

179
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,701
Go along with it for now and we'll see
about what to do next. That hurts.

180
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,828
It's humiliating. I want to die.

181
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,789
I'll do the dishes

182
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,625
-since I lost.
-I got some pictures.

183
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,962
Its belly is filled with eggs.

184
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,131
It is, indeed.

185
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,925
Looks like it's going to pop.

186
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,097
-You don't have another one?
-It's not just full. It popped.

187
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,307
What about…

188
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,946
Eun Gyehoon.

189
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,996
Eun Gyehoon. My goodness.

190
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,625
What in the world…

191
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,796
Jeez, this guy.

192
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,048
-What's wrong?
-What is he doing over there?

193
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,886
He's always peeking in from there.

194
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,471
Why?

195
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,555
I wouldn't know.

196
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,768
Perhaps because he misses
peeing everywhere.

197
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,815
-Gosh.
-What an oddball.

198
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,490
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

199
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,514
I think that man…

200
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,350
is still alive.

201
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
I'm not scared at all.

202
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,086
Don't drop crumbs.

203
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,129
Sorry.

204
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,799
Oh, no.

205
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,885
Clean it up now.

206
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,263
Come on, give me a break.
You're in a good mood these days.

207
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,183
Am I? How would you know that?
I wasn't even aware.

208
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,727
Because Dahyun seems happy.

209
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,022
She's always smiling
and very cheerful lately.

210
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,983
That means you must feel happy too.

211
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,278
Dahyun's feelings are
directly transferred to you.

212
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,910
I guess she seems fine on the outside.

213
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,411
But not on the inside?

214
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,295
You startled me!

215
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,839
-Why do you keep getting startled?
-What's wrong with you today?

216
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,216
Gosh, seriously.

217
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,028
Because…

218
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,200
Watch the video and follow slowly

219
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,369
-step by step.
-Noh Dahyun is fighting her fears.

220
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,663
Good. From this position,

221
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,623
swing your arm and lock his arm.

222
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,421
She's trying to appear brave

223
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,674
and pretending to be fine.

224
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,109
And acting cold…

225
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,278
-Hello.
-Hi, Dahyun.

226
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,155
When are you getting married?

227
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,281
…only towards me.

228
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,050
I heard you'll be discharged soon.

229
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes, in a day or two.

230
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,563
But you really don't remember anything?

231
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,065
You know who I am, don't you?

232
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,525
Make sure you file a report.

233
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,069
Then I'll give up my badge…

234
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,034
and follow you wherever you go
for the rest of your life.

235
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,789
You really don't remember?

236
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,541
I told you I don't. Must I repeat myself?

237
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,085
I'm not a broken record.

238
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,011
Okay, sir. Give us a call
if anything comes to mind.

239
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,972
One more thing.

240
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,225
Nice face.

241
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,737
-We'll be back.
-Okay. See you later.

242
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,323
I don't want your pity.

243
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,368
-What do you mean pity?
-Don't be unnecessarily kind.

244
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,745
-I'm not trying to be kind--
-It's not kindness or pity,

245
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,664
and you weren't concerned.
What was it then?

246
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,253
Oh, I see.
I guess you're just nice to everyone.

247
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,132
It's called…

248
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,342
humanism.

249
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,732
-It's because…
-What was that for?

250
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,154
That car almost ran us over.

251
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,203
That car looked like it was coming
straight at us and run us over.

252
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,289
Why am I so strong?

253
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,708
I think I practiced self-defense too hard.

254
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,087
Oh, no.

255
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,923
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,637
It's okay.

257
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,120
Oh, no.

258
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,919
Are you all right?

259
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,340
Don't be unnecessarily kind to me either.

260
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,177
I'm just being… humanistic.

261
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,202
Let's call it even and put an end to it.

262
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,829
Put an end to what, sir?

263
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,123
Being extremely polite,

264
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,125
being cold, and talking formally.

265
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,337
This isn't the military.
I'm too scared to work with you.

266
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,422
What's it to you if I talk that way?

267
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,884
I don't like it.
It's prohibited at my restaurant. Got it?

268
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,345
That's what you call, "bullying."

269
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,640
I'd say I'm the pitiful owner
who gets bullied by his employees.

270
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,267
No way.

271
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,476
That's my line.

272
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,395
Wow, this one is so big.

273
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,439
Just because it's big,
it doesn't mean it's good.

274
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,527
The skin has to be smooth.

275
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,778
That one has better color.

276
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,655
What do you think?

277
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,533
Looks good. Find one not as skinny.

278
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,742
This one is good enough.

279
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,370
-How about this one?
-Potatoes with sprouts…

280
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,039
I prefer larger ones.

281
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,833
My mom prefers ones like this.

282
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,963
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

283
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,092
-Let's buy this too.
-Looks tasty.

284
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,804
This is a popular ingredient these days.

285
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,475
Here you go. Enjoy.

286
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,563
Are they dating?

287
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,689
They look chummy.

288
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,773
Eggs.

289
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,608
Here you go.

290
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,861
You've got lots of strength. Use it.

291
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,447
-That's chummy?
-I guess not.

292
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,283
That's delicious.

293
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,202
It's good indeed.

294
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,721
Are you the one who beat him up?

295
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,517
You can't answer me right away.
I guess I'm right.

296
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,313
-Why do you think that?
-Because…

297
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,692
you would do that.

298
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,582
You bastard!

299
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,631
Stop it. I'm fine now. That's enough!

300
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,424
Darn you!

301
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,888
Please stop. Please! Stop!

302
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,517
Please don't do this.

303
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,727
Please don't.

304
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,688
I said, don't!

305
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,773
Ji Wontak!

306
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,917
I feel… a bit sad.

307
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,211
That's all you remember?

308
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,549
That scumbag kept hounding you

309
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,677
and he deserved a beating.

310
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,554
Don't you remember that?

311
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,055
But you can't cross the line.

312
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,808
An ordinary person wouldn't be so violent.

313
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,395
Besides, it's not your job to punish him.
Leave it to the law.

314
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,899
I don't really believe in the law.

315
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,942
Ji Wontak.

316
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,780
-Officer Ji.
-I'll still follow the law.

317
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,616
And more importantly, it wasn't me.

318
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,909
-Hey.
-If…

319
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,246
you find me guilty,
I'll readily accept the punishment.

320
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,375
So, you try to catch the culprit.

321
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,424
But you won't be able to catch me.

322
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,218
I just need to keep his mouth shut.

323
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,444
If that man is still alive,

324
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,155
you have no reason
to hide from the police.

325
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,157
You're not a murderer.

326
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,453
You're right.

327
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,457
That's irritating.

328
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,251
That's so irritating.

329
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,191
I'll take it.

330
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,782
Are you…

331
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,243
Eun Gyehoon?

332
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,830
Eun Gyehoon, the son of Dr. Eun?

333
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,793
Yes, I am.

334
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,093
This is so tedious.

335
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,221
I guess you'd never feel hungry.

336
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,056
You keep eating something.

337
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,141
I know. It's fascinating.

338
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,645
Hi, there.

339
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,856
Did you not get a bite to eat?

340
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,483
You look pallid.

341
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,282
You're all blind.

342
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,242
Why are you provoking us?

343
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,660
Your brains don't work.

344
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,328
-Are you picking a fight?
-Gosh.

345
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,167
That kid is him.

346
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,712
Who?

347
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,755
Eun Gyehoon, Dr. Eun's son.

348
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,641
Oh, my gosh! How in the world?

349
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,857
So that young man is…

350
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,819
See? Didn't I tell you
that you'll be in trouble?

351
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,157
No, you didn't!
Did anyone hear her say anything?

352
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,659
It'll take a few more deaths
for you to come to your senses.

353
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,328
Watch what you say.

354
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,662
Darn you.

355
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,624
You lost your mystic power.
You're just selling wigs now.

356
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,125
Stop that nonsense!

357
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,461
She thinks she's still a shaman.

358
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,006
Why does the doenjang stew
smell like shoes?

359
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,846
That's nice.

360
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,932
Why don't you have a glass too?

361
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:27,020
You know that I've been
battling addiction my entire life.

362
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,146
Please go ahead.

363
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,523
SOLYI'S MOM

364
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,901
Hello?

365
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,111
Yes.

366
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,156
What?

367
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,826
Okay.

368
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:48,041
What was that? You basically said nothing.

369
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,335
You know that new place opening up

370
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,129
in front of the stew place?

371
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,258
The one in front of that awful stew place?

372
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,510
Yes, I do.

373
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,054
That kid…

374
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,933
is him.

375
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,850
What?

376
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,075
God of war told me. I'm sure of it.

377
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,244
It's one of you!

378
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,205
One of you is the culprit!

379
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,501
DR. EUN'S SON HAS RETURNED

380
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,629
There's more than one!

381
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,712
The whole neighborhood…

382
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,550
is stirred up.

383
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,888
He came back to take revenge.

384
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:27,932
Revenge?

385
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,435
It's so obvious.

386
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,605
He has no other reason to come back
to this backward neighborhood.

387
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,816
Do you think
he is trying to kill that suspect?

388
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,321
He was just a suspect.
You can't be sure that he was the culprit.

389
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,823
Of course not. So many were investigated.

390
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,034
He is the culprit!

391
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,371
He is the one.

392
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,835
December 4th, 2004.

393
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,838
I even remember the date of the incident.

394
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,424
I'll go home now.

395
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,680
The weather,

396
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,975
the scent in the air…

397
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,480
I remember everything from that day.

398
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,656
Around 2:30 p.m.,
Eun Gyeyoung was confirmed to be missing.

399
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,241
Gyeyoung!

400
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,160
Approximately 30 minutes later,
at around 3 p.m.,

401
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,079
she was last seen.

402
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,250
Since then, 18 years have gone by.

403
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,711
But no one has seen
Eun Gyeyoung even until now.

404
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,424
The owner of that car was the suspect?

405
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,721
It was Han Euichan,
Eun Gyeyoung's piano teacher.

406
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,142
The victim knew him, however…

407
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,688
There is a witness, I tell you!

408
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,523
Let me ask you again.

409
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:04,153
From 3 p.m. until midnight of the 4th,
where were you and what were you doing?

410
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,991
I've never seen anyone so stubborn.

411
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,411
He held out without confessing,

412
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,830
and in the end…

413
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,697
FOUR SEASONS PIANO

414
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,616
Where is Gyeyoung?

415
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,417
Say it.

416
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,003
I said, say it!

417
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,006
Please tell me!

418
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,343
Say it!

419
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,429
Say it!

420
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,723
I said, say it!

421
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,870
Why do you keep lingering around here?

422
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,338
Do you have something to tell me?

423
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,883
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,555
About what?

425
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,724
Because of me,

426
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,435
Gyeyoung died.

427
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,153
That day…

428
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,321
What in the world…

429
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,491
happened that day?

430
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,207
It's okay,

431
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,709
so please tell me.

432
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,588
Gyeyoung wanted to ride my car.

433
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,301
And?

434
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:37,181
I was supposed to take Gyeyoung with me…

435
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,064
I'm so sorry.

436
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,277
You must've been in so much pain.

437
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,864
It must've been hard for you too.

438
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,785
She wanted to ride your car.

439
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,538
You were supposed to take her.

440
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,207
What happened next?

441
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,668
I don't know either.

442
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,465
What did you say?

443
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,966
I just wanted to tell you

444
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,887
that I'm sorry.

445
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,930
I let Gyeyoung die--

446
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,349
Stop the nonsense and tell me straight.

447
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,143
What happened next?

448
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,979
What in the world happened that day?

449
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,150
Please.

450
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,361
Just this once…

451
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,700
Can you please tell me
what happened this once? Please?

452
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,913
Say it.

453
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,956
Say it.

454
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,583
I said, say it.

455
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,794
Say it. Say something!

456
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,796
-Say something!
-What are you doing?

457
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,797
Get off!

458
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,426
Please go now.

459
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,640
I said, go now!

460
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,901
Taking personal revenge
is a serious crime.

461
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,117
Personal revenge? Says who?

462
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,413
I guessed it right then.

463
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,167
What about you?
Were you carrying out official duties?

464
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,213
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

465
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,638
I'll be watching you.

466
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:55,111
Chef Eun's sister's name is Eun Gyeyoung?

467
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,405
Yes. Why do you ask?

468
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,906
Have you heard of her name?

469
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,492
No, I haven't.

470
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,952
I see.

471
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,165
You haven't.

472
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,128
Eunjung.

473
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,756
That's why he said that.

474
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,842
I know…

475
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,468
who you are.

476
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,349
Are you… also back to kill me?

477
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,851
What if I am?

478
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,021
Of course, he should kill him.

479
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,317
If anyone hurts my little brother,
I wouldn't have any mercy.

480
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,360
I'd punish them brutally.

481
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,447
Until they cry and beg
saying they'd rather die,

482
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,824
I'd grind, chew, and tear them to pieces

483
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,577
making every single cell
in their body scream in pain.

484
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,538
I'd dedicate my entire life
to getting revenge.

485
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,231
I'll go now.

486
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,267
-Two, three, four.
-Let's get that apple butt.

487
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,270
Breathe out. One more time!

488
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,271
Breathe out.

489
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,189
Blow out.

490
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,483
-That hurts.
-Breathe in.

491
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,883
Thank you for everything.

492
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,385
Take care now.

493
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,971
They're leaving this place after all.

494
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,270
I'm going to catch the culprit myself.

495
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,149
I'm going to come back

496
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,610
to catch the culprit

497
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,447
and kill anyone
who took my sister Gyeyoung!

498
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,335
For an apple butt!

499
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,588
Thank you.

500
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:49,845
We meet again.

501
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,766
No way.

502
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,268
The third floor. I'm moving in today.

503
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,107
You said you'll be watching me.
But isn't this a bit too close?

504
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,402
Don't make things up. I signed the lease
without knowing you lived here.

505
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,612
Now that you know,
why don't you break the contract?

506
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,365
I want to, but I can't afford the penalty.

507
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,325
I can consider lending it to you.

508
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,411
Why would you go that far?

509
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,787
That's how much I'm against it.

510
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,872
I bet I hate the idea more than you do.

511
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,835
Then let's try not to run into each other.

512
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,336
Or just ignore each other.

513
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,587
-Deal.
-Deal.

514
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,107
Do you two remember
that missing child case?

515
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,866
We had just moved here

516
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,786
at the time,
so we aren't too familiar with it.

517
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,330
-Right?
-Right.

518
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,499
Is that right?

519
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,918
What I could remember…

520
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,595
I hadn't made any friends
in the neighborhood yet.

521
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,556
I felt like an outcast,
and she played with me.

522
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,393
Do you want to play with us?

523
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,523
I have a dim recollection
of the kids' faces and voices.

524
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,694
I remember the boys I hated…

525
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,075
and the boy I liked.

526
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,453
And…

527
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,371
And…

528
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,960
How is it that I can't remember
the missing child case at all?

529
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,963
Do you want more rice?

530
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,799
No thanks.
I don't have much of an appetite today.

531
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,384
May I be excused first?

532
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,969
-Okay.
-Sure.

533
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,105
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

534
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,815
And you?

535
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,272
Why are you leaving?

536
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,318
Come inside.

537
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,285
You got here early.

538
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,204
Yes. I wanted to water them.

539
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,540
The sun rises earlier now.

540
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,712
You're right.

541
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,255
It sure does.

542
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,010
What should I do?

543
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,232
Ask away.

544
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,530
This is rosemary, isn't it?

545
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,282
It's lavender.

546
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,661
-This one is mint.
-Lemon balm.

547
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,955
Chicory?

548
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,750
Rucola.

549
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,545
I got them all wrong.

550
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,255
No kidding.

551
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,592
I was wrong about this too.

552
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,723
I truly thought you liked me.

553
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,892
But that wasn't it.

554
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,728
You just thought
I could've been your sister, didn't you?

555
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,690
That's why you said that.

556
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,609
Keep your word.

557
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,862
Don't let your heart flutter
and fall for me or like me like in soaps.

558
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,448
-Promise.
-I promise. Satisfied?

559
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,658
Even if I treat you so well--

560
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,369
I won't fall for you or like you. But--

561
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,121
How can I keep that kind of promise?

562
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,790
I already like…

563
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,046
Darn it.

564
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,257
The sunshine is glistening.

565
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,762
That wasn't directed to you.
The sun feels so hot.

566
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,475
I made you

567
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,103
get the wrong idea.

568
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,190
I can't say I'm not upset at all,

569
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,442
but it's okay.

570
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,864
Anyway, I guess
your little sister was really pretty.

571
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,869
-She was.
-I guess she looked a lot like me?

572
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,204
Not really.

573
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,081
Okay.

574
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,167
Let's go downstairs.

575
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,796
I'm not good at consoling people.

576
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,091
But sometimes people feel comforted

577
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,052
by seeing others who are
in a worse position than they are.

578
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,472
-So look at me and cheer up.
-Why would you say that?

579
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,433
My life is the worst.

580
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,310
Making a living is difficult enough,

581
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,479
but on top of it,
I nearly got killed by a stalker

582
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,524
and almost ended up a murderer.

583
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,988
Now I'm living in fear each and every day
thinking he might show up any moment.

584
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,116
And why does the sun keep shining
making me feel more confused?

585
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,911
I must've done something terrible.
Maybe I committed treason in a past life.

586
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,538
Don't do that.

587
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,585
Even if you lower your guard a little,
people jump on to blame you.

588
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,463
"It's all your fault."
"It's all because of you."

589
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,089
But,

590
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,508
if you blame yourself too…

591
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,764
it would be unbearable.

592
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,267
I hope you don't do that, Ms. Noh.

593
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,020
Although I've failed.

594
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,940
Look at this. Step aside!

595
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:17,983
What?

596
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,110
Stop it! Leave him alone.

597
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,280
It's his fault.
Why is he taking it out on us?

598
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,073
It's all because of you.

599
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,701
Don't stop me. Let go.

600
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,372
Isn't it true? Your sister is missing
because you didn't look after her.

601
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,501
Everyone is saying it's your fault.

602
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,085
It's all because of you!

603
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,399
The mood in the neighborhood
is quite gloomy.

604
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,652
Because everyone is
thinking about the past.

605
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,278
I feel like we're all guilty.

606
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,864
What do you mean?
Why should we feel guilty?

607
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,283
-What I'm trying to say is--
-To put it bluntly,

608
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,993
we're all victims.

609
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,162
After that,
the whole neighborhood was in turmoil,

610
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,499
and so many people got investigated.
Don't you remember?

611
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,126
Who wouldn't remember that?

612
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,881
He should've
kept an eye on his little sister.

613
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,968
It was their fault. Why doubt
and bother other innocent people?

614
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,555
Are you breaking something?

615
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,265
What is she doing over there?

616
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,391
Who knows?

617
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,477
Dahyun! Are you going to get a job?

618
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,606
Of course, she is. Very soon.

619
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,275
I already have a job.

620
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,360
Large corporations aren't
the only place to work.

621
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,239
Youngsters are all like that nowadays.
Dahyun isn't the exception.

622
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,699
That's the problem.

623
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,869
They quit their jobs on a whim.
They're not determined.

624
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,329
It's because they're spoiled.

625
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,708
Back in the day,
students studied to death at school

626
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,585
and workers worked themselves to death.

627
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,920
Our hearts were overflowing
with love for our school,

628
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,298
love for our company,
and love for our country.

629
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,133
Youngsters are different nowadays.

630
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,718
Our generation is different.

631
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,845
Why would you die for your company?

632
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,181
And you always talk badly
of our country. Patriotism, my foot.

633
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,267
She talks badly about it
because she cares!

634
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,268
That's right!

635
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,815
Gosh, seriously.
This darn, nosy neighborhood!

636
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,860
Have you lost your mind?

637
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,074
You see?
I really care about our neighborhood.

638
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,049
My little brother, where are you?

639
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,854
Where are you?

640
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,113
Jingeun will turn up.

641
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,824
He will eventually
if I wait by Noh Dahyun.

642
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,577
He was with her
right up to his disappearance.

643
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,580
If he doesn't?

644
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,462
I'll choke that wench if I have to

645
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,049
and make her spill where she hid him.

646
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,727
Did they go out of business?

647
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,824
There it is. Choonok Stew.

648
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,285
We have nothing to offer
even though we run a restaurant.

649
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,662
-Please.
-Thank you.

650
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,873
-Thank you for that.
-Sure.

651
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,750
I came to give her this.

652
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,214
I researched some companies
Dahyun can work again.

653
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,845
My goodness. Thank you so much.

654
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,555
Thank you.

655
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,474
Did you go to college with Dahyun?

656
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:23,270
Yes, I'm her friend from college
as well as her former supervisor.

657
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,188
-Really?
-Yes.

658
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,442
When Dahyun got fired, had nowhere to go,
and was a total mess,

659
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,651
I took her in.

660
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,446
My goodness. Thank you so much.

661
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,282
It wasn't an easy decision,

662
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,576
ever since I was little,

663
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,162
I was taught to help the needy

664
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,997
and be warm-hearted and generous.

665
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,584
Oh, I see.

666
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,837
Please tell Dahyun to apply at least.

667
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,547
Sure, okay.

668
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,299
I know Dahyun's my senior, but

669
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:56,344
she shouldn't have her youth and future
held hostage at a place like this, right?

670
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,443
I just remembered.
Have you met that person?

671
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,779
-Pardon?
-Who do you mean?

672
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,573
The person who went into that restaurant.

673
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,494
She is Mr. Lee Jingeun's family.
She came to look for him.

674
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,662
Lee Jingeun?

675
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,131
That dead guy.

676
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,975
How long do I have to stay like this?

677
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,770
They're coming out.

678
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,901
Oh, that's her! That person--

679
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,320
Ma'am? Wait--

680
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,048
I'm on my way to buy seedlings.

681
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,509
That's too bad. See you next time.

682
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,719
Okay, Dahyun.

683
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,514
By the way, your mother
and grandmother are very strange.

684
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,932
They're like you.

685
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,559
What?

686
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,518
Pardon?

687
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,562
It's nothing.

688
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,236
I'm sorry.

689
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,638
That darn humanism.

690
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,312
I didn't say anything. Thank you.

691
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,940
MOTHER

692
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,322
-Hello?
-Gyehoon?

693
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,032
I saw Gyeyoung.

694
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,035
It was definitely Gyeyoung.

695
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,788
What do you mean, you saw Gyeyoung?

696
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,000
What on earth are you talking about?

697
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,129
That picture you have. I saw it.

698
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,893
It was definitely Gyeyoung!

699
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,312
-It looks pretty on you.
-You wear it.

700
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,147
Just try it on.

701
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,399
Go put it on. I'll pick out some pants.

702
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,609
Go put it on, okay?

703
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,003
Dahyun, I'm sorry.
Please take a taxi and go back.

704
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,632
I'll look for her with you. I can help.

705
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,663
Aunt, she isn't there either?

706
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,332
Where is she?

707
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,839
I found her.

708
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,967
Okay, I'll hang up now.

709
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,512
Gosh, seriously.

710
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,820
Mom.

711
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,530
Mom.

712
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,494
Please get up.

713
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,011
I'll take you home.

714
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,183
This is all because of you.

715
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,477
What did I tell you?

716
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,146
I told you to look after Gyeyoung.

717
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,900
I asked you repeatedly
to look after your little sister!

718
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,155
It's my fault.

719
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,117
You did that to her.

720
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,161
It's all because of you.

721
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:17,457
You took my daughter away from me!

722
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,043
Go now.

723
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,962
Go away.

724
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,133
Not you. My daughter Gyeyoung.

725
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,595
Bring back my daughter Gyeyoung.

726
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,598
Gyeyoung.

727
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,018
Gyeyoung.

728
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,146
Gyeyoung!

729
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,820
Gyeyoung.

730
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,538
FAILURE IS THE 5G TO SUCCESS

731
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,833
LEE JINGEUN: LONG TIME NO SEE

732
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,671
What are you doing?

733
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,924
I'm making a late-night snack.

734
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:32,842
A late-night snack?

735
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,599
What in the world are you making?

736
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:44,145
I stole some rice cakes and fish cakes
from my mom's restaurant.

737
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,481
I haven't met anyone who hates tteokbokki,

738
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,107
so I wanted to bring you some.

739
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,568
Me?

740
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,153
Why?

741
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,156
When I was feeling down before,

742
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,034
you cooked me Michelin-level
late-night snacks every night.

743
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,454
I felt much better after eating good food.

744
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,082
So I wanted to return the favor.

745
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,173
But you put chopped onions in tteokbokki?

746
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,301
You taught me how to chop.

747
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,136
I like to use what I learn.

748
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,346
But…

749
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,683
are you supposed to put
bell peppers in tteokbokki?

750
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,519
I'm not sure.

751
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,230
Well, I tried chopping that too.

752
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,233
-You know how to make it, right?
-I can't say I do for sure.

753
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,944
But there is a first time for everything,

754
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,863
and it's good to challenge oneself.
So I try various things--

755
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,907
-So you don't know how.
-Bingo.

756
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,411
Would you be upset if I were to help you?

757
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:42,829
What do you mean?

758
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,832
I've been waiting for you to say that.

759
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,336
-Did you taste it properly?
-Yes.

760
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,842
You can't dump them all…
Should we add some more water?

761
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:56,843
I'll manage it.

762
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,469
-I should put in noodles, right?
-Yes.

763
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,763
-How much? This much?
-A little more, please.

764
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,438
Put some over here too.

765
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,909
What do you think?

766
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,456
Given my career, I'm particularly picky
when it comes to taste.

767
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,835
It's surprisingly good. It's delicious.

768
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,213
-Try it.
-It's good, right?

769
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,340
Yes.

770
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:02,617
Did something bad happen?

771
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:05,703
Why do you ask?

772
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,248
Just asking.

773
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,376
No, nothing happened.

774
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,504
I'm relieved.

775
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,758
That's a lie.

776
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:24,889
The feeling I've been sensing from you
for a while now is…

777
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,891
sadness.

778
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,776
I was right.

779
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,405
I'm sorry. I keep remembering something.

780
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,908
It's my fault.

781
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,743
It's all because of you.

782
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,247
You took my daughter away from me!

783
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,502
Are you okay?

784
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,214
How about you?

785
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,634
I'm fine.

786
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,971
How could you be fine? You shouldn't be.

787
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,027
You don't have to worry.
It happens all the time.

788
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,863
I'm used to it.

789
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,032
I'm perfectly fine.

790
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,368
That's even more heart-breaking.

791
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,706
Dahyun--

792
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,890
It's just because
her feelings are linked to me.

793
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,186
She's crying because of me,

794
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,646
and her feelings are
just being transferred to me.

795
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,982
I'm definitely not crying

796
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,527
because I feel sad.

797
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,447
Because I…

798
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,617
am fine.

799
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,484
LINK

800
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,988
I can sense your feelings.

801
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:30,449
Why is my heart fluttering again? Why?

802
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,909
Have you still not seen him?

803
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:35,621
I don't like the way
that girl's looking at Dahyun.

804
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,124
And I have no plans
to become closer to anyone either.

805
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,836
I don't want to get close to you anymore.

806
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,214
Once again, I'm watching you
from somewhere nearby.

807
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,092
Just ignore it. It's not me who's afraid.

808
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,510
Lee Jingeun is alive.

809
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,220
Dahyun.

810
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,263
Noh Dahyun!

811
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,269
