EXCHANGING LETTERS WITH FRIENDS
MAILBOX OF LOVE

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,933
GRADE 3, CLASS 7, FRIENDSHIP MAILBOX

4
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,854
I doubt there are any for you.

5
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,570
-I'm so envious.
-You got so many letters.

6
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,155
-How many did you get?
-By the way…

7
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,491
How many? Six? Twelve?

8
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,076
-I got 13.
-Wow.

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,786
-Hey, Eun Gyehoon!
-You got 12?

10
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,954
Are you happy
that you got so many letters?

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,040
-Perhaps I am
-You can't get me!

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,708
dreaming.

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,211
It's a little embarrassing, but maybe

14
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,421
it's a happy dream.

15
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,020
No way.

16
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:58,409
MISSING CHILD
EUN GYEYOUNG, AGE 10

17
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,253
It was probably the day

18
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,839
that I got the most letters in my life.

19
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,675
"Cheer up."

20
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,926
"I'll pray for you."

21
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,594
"Don't lose hope."

22
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,430
On that day, all those consoling words

23
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,724
made me feel nauseous,

24
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,688
and I ended up
only remembering two of the letters.

25
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,023
One of them was…

26
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,277
To my brother Eun Gyehoon
from Eun Gyeyoung.

27
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,031
I know you told on Mom
that I skipped my piano lesson.

28
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,993
I'm very angry, but I'll forgive you.

29
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,537
However, there are a few conditions.

30
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,748
First. Don't ever tell on me again.

31
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,712
Second. If I get scolded by Mom and Dad,
take my side no matter what.

32
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,255
Third.

33
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,425
The letter that Gyeyoung wrote me
before she disappeared.

34
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,553
And another letter.

35
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,264
I have something to confess.

36
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,185
You really have to keep this a secret.

37
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,437
The day Gyeyoung disappeared…

38
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,939
Actually…

39
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,278
Someone's… confession.

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,656
CONFESSION

41
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,962
Why did I dream that?

42
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,135
The body…

43
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,095
disappeared.

44
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,231
Did you find what you were looking for?

45
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,126
Did this guy… move it?

46
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,878
No.

47
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,505
What really happened?

48
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,510
Did you hear what I said?

49
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,015
Well, nothing happened. The thing is that…

50
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,352
I was walking by,
and your store door was opened.

51
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,896
So I came inside
to check up on it, but it's fine

52
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,898
and now that you're here too,
I'll get going--

53
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,649
You want me to believe that lie?

54
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,615
Yes.

55
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,583
Ms. Noh.

56
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,345
Maybe I'm on your side.

57
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,028
Seriously, what happened?

58
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,240
EPISODE 3

59
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,713
Is your husband competing in the Olympics?

60
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,216
Why does he exercise so hard?

61
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,261
I have no idea. Perhaps he's having
a midlife crisis. He's odd these days.

62
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,055
It's better than being weak and frail.

63
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,893
Stop wasting time looking at him,
and look over there.

64
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,697
My goodness.

65
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,449
You're sweating so much.

66
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,243
-Would you like some water?
-No thank you.

67
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,577
-Some misu shake?
-No.

68
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,578
-Juice?
-Bread?

69
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,956
-No thank you.
-If you need anything living here…

70
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,916
-I'm fine.
-There's a free aerobics class at night.

71
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,876
-I'm not going.
-Here you go.

72
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,253
-Thank you,
-Oh come on.

73
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,672
but it's okay. See you later.

74
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,007
-Wait… Young man!
-Juice…

75
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,259
Young man, just drink one cup!

76
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,178
He's the rudest of all, for sure.

77
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,536
Don't worry about your mom at all.

78
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,415
She said the flowers are beautiful
that butterflies will fly over.

79
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,875
She's still young at heart.

80
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,210
Thank you, Aunt.

81
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,212
Thanks to you,
I don't have to worry about being here.

82
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,717
Your mom throws a fuss at you because
she's sick, not because she hates you.

83
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,094
Her mind is ill. You know that, right?

84
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,512
Yes, I do. Of course.

85
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,515
Okay. Take care.

86
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,392
Bye.

87
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,023
This is your place?

88
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,650
Completely moving out?

89
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
I'll go back and forth from my mom's.

90
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,033
It's also an employee lounge.
Feel free to use it.

91
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,786
You want me to rest here?

92
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,747
That's like saying,

93
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,000
"Skip class and have fun
in the teachers' office."

94
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,084
Be quiet.

95
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,004
How can you…

96
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,133
Why is he making me rest here?

97
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,803
I don't want to…

98
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,599
Oh, check out this view.

99
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,019
Gyehoon, you can see the entire alley.

100
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,358
Wake up!
Aren't you going to eat breakfast?

101
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,485
Not eating.

102
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,529
I set up the table a long time ago.
You're still sleeping? Hey!

103
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,575
I didn't get any sleep last night
and just fell asleep.

104
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,370
Why does she keep locking the door?

105
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,373
The rice and soup are
getting cold, you brat!

106
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,999
I don't feel like eating!

107
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,585
Sleep more after eating. Eat!

108
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,546
-Eat!
-Jeez.

109
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,175
I told you that the soup is getting cold!

110
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm going to knock the door down!

111
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,764
Hey, get up. I said, get up!

112
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,433
Get up! Hey!

113
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,686
Get up and come out
while I'm still being nice.

114
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,063
-Seriously, you brat.
-Okay.

115
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,483
-I'm up. I said, I'm up!
-Hey!

116
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:37,154
Gosh, seriously. That darn food!

117
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,955
Gyehoon, are you really her stalker?

118
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,917
-No.
-Yes, you are.

119
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,339
No, I am not.
I've never opened this window before,

120
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,550
and I had no idea
who lived in front of me.

121
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,427
-So it's a coincidence?
-Of course.

122
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,347
Who checks who the neighbors are
before renting a place? Of course, I--

123
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,142
Some people do check
before they rent a place.

124
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,394
Who?

125
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,603
Stalkers.

126
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,107
He shouldn't be doing this.

127
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,819
Hey.

128
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,870
You said the rice was ready
a long time ago.

129
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,663
You said the soup is all cold now!

130
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,249
Delicious steamed rice is now ready.

131
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,209
-Please stir it well.
-It says it's ready now.

132
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,102
Since that day…

133
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,288
my entire family had developed trauma.

134
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,228
I'll leave the package
in front of your door.

135
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,026
Why is he delivering
so early in the morning?

136
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,986
He's so diligent. How nice.

137
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,907
That's true. It's admirable
that he's working hard.

138
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,659
We've also become afraid

139
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,453
of being arrested at any moment.

140
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,541
I can't keep living like this anymore.

141
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,793
We have to put an end to this right away.

142
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,671
I'll get it back from that sly chef--

143
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,714
That's not necessary.
It's not there anyway.

144
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,801
What's not there?

145
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,135
The refrigerator?

146
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,306
No. That guy…

147
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,017
disappeared.

148
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,229
What?

149
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,439
The refrigerator is empty.

150
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,026
How would you know that?

151
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,195
Because I opened it.

152
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,281
When? Tell us. How?

153
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,535
I snuck in last night and opened it--

154
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,082
-Mom.
-How is that you have no fear?

155
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,502
You snuck in there in the middle
of the night? On top of it, by yourself?

156
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,130
But nothing happened. Why did you hit me?

157
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,215
What nonsense! Should I just kill you?

158
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,175
Just kill me then.
I'm an eyesore to you anyway.

159
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,052
Is that right? Fine. Let's do that. Great.

160
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,180
Stop it. Grandma!

161
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,932
How can you have an appetite after that?

162
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,058
You told me to eat, Mom.

163
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,477
And I can always eat whenever
and under any circumstance.

164
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,897
-That's just how I am. I can't help it.
-Are you proud of it?

165
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,440
No, I'm not. It's just how I am.

166
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,983
Shameless. Who does she take after?

167
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,359
Who else, but you?

168
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,611
Seriously, you brat!

169
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,698
Gosh, be quiet. That's enough.

170
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,410
You, you, and me.
Even if we combined all our intelligence,

171
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,705
it still isn't as good as one person's.
So what should we do then?

172
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,374
Should we continue to fight like this
or combine our strengths?

173
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,127
Answer me!

174
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,632
-Combine our strengths.
-Combine…

175
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,009
Come and eat now.

176
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,145
So we must think carefully

177
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,106
step by step.

178
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,067
The body disappeared…

179
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,820
The body disappeared?

180
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,702
Unless we're all having the same dream,
it must be…

181
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,540
-Jinhoo. Taste this.
-Yes?

182
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,418
-It's hot.
-Either that guy moved it

183
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,255
or someone else did.

184
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,174
-Good.
-Okay.

185
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,851
Gyehoon, I think I have superpowers now.

186
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,895
I can feel things like you.

187
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,148
Ever since we came to this neighborhood,
something changed.

188
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,360
How should I describe it? It feels like
the dead cells in my body are awake.

189
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,915
I feel like people keep watching us.

190
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,004
It's like we're trapped inside of a jail
with constant surveillance.

191
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,801
It's like The Truman Show.

192
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,014
Gosh.

193
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,024
Even now, they're all looking at us.

194
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,860
It's because
we're walking around like this.

195
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,742
Jeez, get off of me.

196
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,327
But this neighborhood is scary.

197
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,293
-By the way, I have a question for you.
-Don't ask.

198
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,963
Is that Wi-Fi girl from the stew place

199
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,674
really your long-lost sister?

200
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,970
Is that really the case?
She's your sister?

201
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,725
I don't think she is.

202
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,018
But she could be.

203
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,314
There is always a chance.

204
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,943
But if…

205
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,571
she isn't Gyeyoung…

206
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,206
how did I sense all those feelings?

207
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,625
Why don't you confirm it?

208
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,920
You can just ask her directly
or go run some tests.

209
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,549
-I'm afraid.
-That she might not be your sister?

210
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
That she might be your sister?

211
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,763
Or both?

212
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,682
Perhaps.

213
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,270
Does she look a bit like her?

214
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,231
What did your sister look like?

215
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,738
When we were kids, we made fun
of each other saying the other was ugly.

216
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,157
But objectively speaking, she was pretty.

217
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,535
More than anything, she was smart.

218
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,914
Although she was very timid,
she was always cheerful.

219
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,627
Our relatives and elders
in the neighborhood

220
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,296
said she looked so neat and elegant
even though she's a kid--

221
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,888
What?

222
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,101
Why are you staring at me?

223
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,187
I'm not sure.

224
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,482
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

225
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,568
Darn it.

226
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,988
Those women are suspicious indeed.

227
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,281
Are they?

228
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,618
Oh, right. Ma'am.

229
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,661
Do they visit our patrol unit for fun?

230
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,247
The entire family came by
to turn themselves in.

231
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,541
But in the end,
they said they just stopped by.

232
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,419
-Does that make sense to you?
-Is that the case?

233
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,299
-Ma'am.
-Make sure you show me respect.

234
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,634
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,719
Jihwa Apartment, Jihwa 3-ro.

236
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,221
A woman's scream next door.

237
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,223
"A woman's scream next door.
Domestic violence."

238
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,974
-Are you available?
-It's near.

239
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,017
Turn right next.

240
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,646
This is patrol 11.
Report number 852. We'll go.

241
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,108
Ma'am!

242
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,069
Is anyone inside?

243
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,529
Ma'am!

244
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,490
I said, you're mistaken.

245
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,117
We received a report, so we must check.

246
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,248
How many times do I have to tell you?

247
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,958
Nothing happened. I'm home alone.

248
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,295
If you need our help discreetly,

249
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,297
can you nod gently?

250
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,594
No, I don't. Please leave.

251
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,304
Please go on.

252
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,476
Excuse us. We're going to check.

253
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,436
Nothing is going on!

254
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,400
-Who are you guys?
-We're the police.

255
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,569
We came to check after receiving a call.
We ask for your cooperation.

256
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,239
-Did you call them?
-No, I didn't.

257
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,866
I guess something did happen.

258
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,080
Come on, don't do that.

259
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,625
I said, nothing is going on.
Please leave now.

260
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,461
Officer Ji, you stay out of it.

261
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:37,963
Look, sir.

262
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,257
Look, police lady.

263
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,509
I'm not a "police lady."
Please call me officer.

264
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,677
I think

265
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,805
there has been a misunderstanding.

266
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,977
Any unnecessary physical contact
should be done to me.

267
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,363
What are you doing?
Why don't you dress properly, rookie?

268
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,074
I'm sorry, ma'am. It's a habit
not to put on clothes after showering.

269
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,367
I'm aware of that habit.

270
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,203
-Can you move out of my way?
-Sure.

271
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,420
For cases like earlier,

272
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,797
is there anything else we can do?

273
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
Domestic violence
can't be punished over objection,

274
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,052
so if the victim doesn't want
to punish the offender,

275
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,386
there is nothing we can do.

276
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,514
Why isn't she reporting him?

277
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,891
She doesn't trust the law.

278
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,812
By the way, we're off duty tomorrow.
Do you have plans, ma'am?

279
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,105
I don't have any plans,

280
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,317
but my credo is
not to spend time with subordinates.

281
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,361
So no thanks
to eating or going out for drinks.

282
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,280
-I guess you seek people with power.
-Yes, very, extremely so.

283
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,032
I'm a very ambitious woman.

284
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,825
I'm heading out now.

285
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,704
Bye, ma'am.

286
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,582
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

287
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,882
You came to spy on us again?

288
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,177
No, I just came to eat.
I missed a home-cooked meal.

289
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,137
Wow, it looks delicious.

290
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,727
What? It doesn't taste good?

291
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,146
It does. It's good.

292
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,565
By the way, where is your daughter?

293
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,567
Why? So you can harass her again?

294
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,694
No, I want to get to know her.

295
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,073
There aren't many people my age
around here, so it's nice to see her.

296
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,286
And I'm supposed to believe pigs can fly?

297
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,427
Ma'am, I have a question for you.

298
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,719
Yes, go ahead.

299
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,392
Have you seen him before?

300
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,686
Let's see.

301
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,397
He does look a little familiar.
Right, Mom?

302
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,565
Yes, he does.

303
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,402
But… maybe not.

304
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,945
You're right.

305
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,781
Who is he? Does he owe you money?

306
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,242
He's my younger brother.

307
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,537
Did he run away from home or something?

308
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,330
I suddenly lost touch with him.

309
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,542
I'm sorry we couldn't be of much help.

310
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,587
We have so many customers that come and go

311
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,797
that we can't remember everyone.

312
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,049
It doesn't look like
you have that many customers.

313
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,217
Pardon?

314
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,636
How much is the bill?

315
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,347
Sure, yes. It's 24,000 won.

316
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,640
-Insert your credit card.
-Okay.

317
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,144
Did you enjoy the food?

318
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,938
I can't say it was good
even if I wanted to be polite.

319
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,859
It tasted like you didn't use any MSG.

320
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,112
That's right. I cook the food
as if I'm feeding my own child.

321
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,491
If that's the case,
you should put in a little more effort.

322
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,950
It was a little problematic.

323
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,246
The stir-fried spicy pork had
the smell of freezer burn,

324
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,210
and you generously put all sorts of herbs
in the boiled pork wraps for good health.

325
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,045
You shouldn't have.

326
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,589
I'd rather take herbal medicine
if that was the case.

327
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,342
And how did you steam
the mung bean sprouts?

328
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,219
Please take your card.

329
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,720
Please throw away the receipt.

330
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,139
You just need to quickly
blanch the sprouts in boiling water.

331
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,057
Sure, sure.

332
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,810
-Just quickly. Not too long.
-Okay, go on.

333
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,625
LEE JINGEUN

334
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,339
Hello?

335
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,840
Hello--

336
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,847
The phone is switched off.

337
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,974
Transferring to voicemail--

338
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,123
Oh, my.

339
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,208
-I'm sorry.
-Are you all right?

340
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,501
You're so kind.

341
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,086
Don't mention it.

342
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,219
You're so pretty.

343
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,263
You're totally my type.

344
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,438
I'm sorry. I went too far
when we just met, right? I'm sorry.

345
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,522
It's okay.

346
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,775
-Bye then.
-Bye.

347
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,029
Bye.

348
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,125
She's right. I'm so pretty.

349
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,502
So pretty…

350
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,795
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

351
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,982
Jeez, the police are everywhere.

352
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,531
Those women are suspicious indeed.

353
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,035
Hello.

354
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,162
You know who I am, right?

355
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,580
You came to the patrol unit a lot.

356
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,791
We saw each other so often.

357
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,209
Right?

358
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,378
I know you can hear everything.

359
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,465
Pardon me.
I just need to talk to you briefly…

360
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,139
Why is she always anxious? It's annoying.

361
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,440
If you were attacked

362
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,735
by someone like I was,

363
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,654
what would you do?

364
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,490
If this happened to my younger sister,

365
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,118
that attacker would've died by my hand.

366
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,375
Gosh, why are you doing this to me?

367
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,254
I'm just checking to see if you're okay
since you're making me worry.

368
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,172
Am I? Why?

369
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,634
It's not common for the entire family
to visit the patrol unit.

370
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,138
Oh, my! I thought that was quite common.

371
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,057
I believe the patrol unit is
like a guest lounge,

372
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,976
a very welcoming place for the citizens--

373
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,812
I can tell from your eyes
that you're lying.

374
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,897
Are you interrogating me?

375
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,150
No, I'm just greeting you.

376
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,485
I see. That was enough of a greeting.
See you later.

377
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,778
Wait a minute.

378
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,157
-I apologize if I offended you or--
-Are you all right?

379
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,245
-Is he the one?
-Pardon?

380
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,956
-Who the heck are you?
-Is he the one?

381
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,666
Can't you hear me? Who the heck are you?

382
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,168
What do you think you're doing?

383
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,587
What did I do? Do you even know who I am?

384
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,339
-It's not what you think.
-You're afraid of him. You're scaring her!

385
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,258
No, it's not like that!

386
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,595
He's a policeman.
We were just saying hello.

387
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,017
He misunderstands
and doubts people easily.

388
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,852
Apologize to the police officer now.

389
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,813
-But I--
-Do it now.

390
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,232
I apologize too. I'm sorry.

391
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,487
This was clearly assault.

392
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,995
I misunderstood the situation
since you were being suspicious,

393
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,581
but I apologize.

394
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,627
It's not common to feel upset
after receiving an apology.

395
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,254
My name is Eun Gyehoon.

396
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,758
Eun Gyehoon, I see.

397
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,345
No thanks.

398
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,347
Apology not accepted.

399
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,017
-See you around again.
-Bye.

400
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,527
Well, I'll get going too.

401
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,571
Hey.

402
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,910
What's wrong with you?
Why do you meddle in my affairs?

403
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,622
You really don't know?
I was trying to help--

404
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,166
After helping, did you think
that I'd be impressed

405
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,961
and fall for you like in a soap opera?

406
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,338
-That's not the case.
-What a relief.

407
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,298
What did you say?

408
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,425
Keep your word.

409
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,344
Don't let your heart flutter
and fall for me

410
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,637
or like me like in soaps.

411
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,391
Jeez, why would I like you?

412
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,642
I like you.

413
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,769
Look here! Look at me!

414
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,939
I like you.

415
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,443
I did like you. I did, but…

416
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,489
Did you just dump me saying I shouldn't
like you anymore? You're so heartless.

417
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,782
What am I saying?

418
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,871
I knew you were lying.

419
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,081
I meant it,

420
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,501
but since you're rejecting me like this,
I'll let you go. I'll stop liking you.

421
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,462
Make sure you keep your word.
Even if going forward, I…

422
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,718
Even if I mistake you for my sister and…

423
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,263
…treat you well, don't like me. Ever.

424
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,474
-Okay, got it.
-Promise.

425
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,393
I promise. Satisfied?

426
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,688
Yes. See you later then.

427
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,493
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

428
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,464
I can't live being so anxious like this.

429
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,635
She didn't really know anything.

430
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,179
But if the police keep coming here
and we talk to them,

431
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,181
we'll get nervous
and end up making a mistake.

432
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,515
That's true.

433
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,728
Should we send her abroad?

434
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,357
Or should all three of us go?

435
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,026
I'll be fine with that,
but how will you argue abroad?

436
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,611
You won't be able to communicate.

437
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,866
Why is life so difficult?

438
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,660
Darn it.

439
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,370
ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION ACT

440

LEE JINGEUN'S WHEREABOUTS, WHERE?
I'M LOSING MY MIND!

441
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,303
LOOK FOR A PART-TIME JOB EASILY

442
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,222
JIHWA-GU, JIHWA-DONG

443
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,975
The body disappeared?

444
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,477
Either that guy moved it

445
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,605
or someone else did.

446
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,524
Or if not,

447
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,360
that body walked out alive.

448
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,115
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

449
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,882
I couldn't sleep,
so I snuck out a bottle of soju.

450
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,885
I couldn't sleep either.

451
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,971
Well…

452
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,353
Do you…

453
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,900
need a snack to go with it?

454
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,657
I…

455
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,825
Just in case, let me make it clear.

456
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,453
Don't fall for me because I cook for you--

457
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,747
I won't fall for you or like you. Okay?

458
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,749
Okay.

459
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,060
The phlorotannins found in seaweed
are good for insomnia.

460
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,854
Oh, I see. Thank you for the food.

461
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,779
That…

462
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,564
Gosh, it's cold.

463
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,786
No need to be formal.

464
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,352
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

465
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,359
-Is it good?
-It's so soft.

466
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,653
-Pardon?
-I said, it's so soft.

467
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,505
I'm really curious.

468
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,007
Why are you doing all this for me?

469
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,970
I'm testing the menu items
that I'm preparing,

470
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,098
and I also want
to get a good night's sleep.

471
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,602
Because someone has trouble sleeping,
I can't sleep either.

472
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,980
-So I'm trying to help them.
-Pardon?

473
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,523
You wouldn't understand.

474
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,528
I thought about it, but the fact

475
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,281
that you're cooking
such heartfelt dishes for me--

476
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,908
You promised.
Even if I treat you so well--

477
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,618
I won't fall for you or like you. But--

478
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,120
But what?

479
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,456
But it seems strange from my perspective.

480
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,836
Then how about this reason?

481
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,131
It just came to my mind.

482
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,757
Jeez, that's ridiculous.

483
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,219
A long time ago,

484
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,389
I owed a friend five packs of ramyeon.

485
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,019
I ended up
only remembering two of the letters.

486
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,187
Third.

487
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,981
Cook ramyeon for me
when I'm hungry five times.

488
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,026
Fourth.
Bring an umbrella when it's raining.

489
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,652
Promise me, okay?

490
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,741
Cook ramyeon for her
when she's hungry five times.

491
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,785
But…

492
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,789
now I'll never be able to do it for her,

493
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,376
and perhaps I'm doing it for you instead.

494
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,800
I see.

495
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,723
That's why we shouldn't
take people for granted.

496
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,188
You're right.

497
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,963
-Grandma.
-My goodness. Studying is tough, isn't it?

498
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,839
Yes, it is.

499
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,469
The chef of that restaurant over there

500
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,430
doesn't seem like a bad person.

501
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,933
He wouldn't move a body
out of the refrigerator.

502
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,852
What happened to you wasn't because
you were a bad person either.

503
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,105
That's true.

504
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,899
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

505
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,109
Take an umbrella.

506
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,902
Based on your knee
or the weather forecast?

507
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,613
-From Good Morning News.
-I'm not taking it then.

508
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,323
I said, take one.

509
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,368
Jeez.

510
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,413
-No dieting for you, sir?
-No.

511
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,457
Do you know
how many calories tteokbokki has?

512
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,710
Keep that information to yourself.
I'd rather not know.

513
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,545
You can burn it off.

514
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,047
Officer Ji, you said you do jujitsu?

515
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,215
WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES STRANGLED TO DEATH

516
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,385
Yes, just a little.

517
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:27,855
Are you guys…

518
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,483
-dating?
-Already?

519
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,735
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

520
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,863
Officer Ji, have you lost your mind?

521
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:40,326
I used to do that
for my ex-girlfriend. I'm sorry.

522
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,208
Did you see
the news article on Geumdo Villa?

523
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,543
It was a murder per the autopsy.

524
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,840
The case in which the woman
living alone was found dead.

525
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,801
They're coming out!

526
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,305
They haven't narrowed down the suspects,

527
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,850
but they're searching through
the people she knew and ex-convicts.

528
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,769
But that's not our unit's work.

529
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,771
Right. We shouldn't worry about it.

530
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,897
But still--

531
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,234
Darn it. I need to interrogate that punk.

532
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,029
-"That punk"?
-You don't need to know.

533
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,282
Don't accuse the wrong person.

534
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,575
"The wrong person"?

535
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,996
You guys don't know?

536
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:31,418
A long time ago. A very long time ago,

537
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,921
a murder took place in this neighborhood.

538
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,590
Not a murder, a missing person's case.

539
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,551
A child disappeared
and we couldn't even find the body.

540
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,679
Clearly, it was a murder case.

541
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,972
-It's an unsolved case.
-Gosh.

542
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,477
At the time, there was a prime suspect.

543
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,564
He had no alibi
and it was certain that he did it,

544
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,859
but we didn't have conclusive evidence,
so we let him go.

545
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,987
He was the culprit.

546
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,447
Are you serious?

547
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:05,035
The most notable thing is that the culprit
still lives in this neighborhood,

548
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,456
shamelessly living his life
acting like "catch me if you can."

549
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,169
Right before my eyes.

550
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,422
And…

551
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,007
right before your eyes.

552
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,932
Why don't we finish up?

553
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,143
Sure. Go ahead and eat.

554
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,441
The cost of ingredients
and labor is very high.

555
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,861
If possible,
I don't want to sacrifice on ingredients.

556
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,239
Try to think of a way to increase profits
even a little bit based on this.

557
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,083
I've done some research.

558
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,170
-Already?
-Not work. About the girl.

559
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,173
Do you think she's really your sister?

560
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,843
Don't you dare do anything I didn't ask.

561
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,428
So I asked her.

562
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,974
My birthday? It's October 19th.

563
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,309
Are you sure?

564
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,479
Do you remember you were born that day?
Are you sure about that?

565
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,273
No.

566
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,738
What are you two, dumb and dumber?
What about you?

567
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,240
Do you remember when you were born?

568
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,370
Gyehoon, it's raining hard.

569
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,707
The Wi-Fi girl didn't
even take an umbrella.

570
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,501
I saw her earlier.

571
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,972
They both don't carry around umbrellas.

572
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,270
FOUR SEASONS PIANO

573
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,649
Bring an umbrella next time. I couldn't
even go to the arcade because of you.

574
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,818
I'm going to tell Mom
you're playing video games again.

575
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,486
I won't give it to you then.

576
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,873
Hey, wait for me!

577
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,585
Fourth.

578
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,421
Bring an umbrella when it's raining.

579
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,180
Gosh, I should've listened to Grandma.

580
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,710
I just happened to be walking by.

581
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,712
But you have…

582
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,672
two umbrellas.

583
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,070
It's Jinhoo's. Gosh, that kid.

584
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,225
By any chance…

585
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,311
I won't fall for you or like you. Okay?

586
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,730
Okay.

587
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,162
Well, thank you.

588
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,997
Go on home.

589
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,714
Oh, no.

590
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,437
I'm sorry.

591
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,983
Wait for me!

592
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,115
I have something to confess.

593
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:57,869
You really have to keep this a secret.

594
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,752
One more time.

595
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,088
The day Gyeyoung disappeared…

596
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,341
Actually…

597
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,183
my dad had…

598
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,437
blood on his clothes.

599
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,315
…BLOOD ON HIS CLOTHES

MIJIN REAL ESTATE

604
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,807
A murder case?

605
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,767
What was that area called again?

606
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,229
It happened in the area
that Dahyun moved out to live alone.

607
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,647
My goodness. How terrible.

608
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,441
Whoever it is should be stoned to death.

609
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,361
This is what you refer to
as a blessing in disguise.

610
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,404
A blessing in disguise?

611
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,949
You were so upset
when Dahyun got fired and came back home.

612
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,368
The heavens helped her after all.

613
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,996
What if she had kept working
and lived in that area?

614
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,873
Who knows what could've happened to her?

615
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,541
That makes sense.

616
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,501
-She got lucky.
-Yes.

617
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,172
What nonsense are you babbling away?

618
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,760
What? Did we say something wrong?

619
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,347
Yes, you did. What you said is wrong.

620
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,932
What did I say?

621
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,769
Dahyun didn't get fired.
She is just switching industries.

622
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,190
"You need a big playing field to
be successful. This field is too small.

623
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,067
Mom, I want to pursue something greater."
"Sure, go for it!"

624
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,528
That's why she's taking a break.

625
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,614
So that she can gear up
for something greater.

626
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,326
Don't babble away nonsense
without knowing what's going on.

627
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,753
Ninth grade civil servant isn't okay.
Seventh grade isn't okay either.

628
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,463
Get fifth grade.
That's the highest, right?

629
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,383
-Mom.
-You quit to do something greater.

630
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,220
So that's what you'll need to do.
Now go prep for it.

631
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,143
What are you doing?
Go study more instead of doing this!

632
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,737
Aren't you going?

633
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,496
I won't take the exam.
I'm not good enough for it.

634
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,830
Why not?

635
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,793
You even got a job offer
from a large corporation. Be confident!

636
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,670
-I lied.
-Sure, you lied--

637
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,218
-What did you say?
-I was a contractor, not a full-timer.

638
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,178
I lied about my salary too.

639
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,348
I worked as an intern and a contactor,
then got fired unfairly.

640
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,101
You brat.

641
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,979
How dare you deceive me!

642
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,440
But I couldn't tell you the truth.
You would've been so upset at me.

643
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,317
I worked so hard to raise you.

644
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:43,029
I sacrificed my whole life just for you.
How could you betray me like this?

645
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:49,411
Gosh, I'd rather just die.
I'm too ashamed to live now.

646
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,957
She was the only thing I was proud of,
but she tells me she's a fraud.

647
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,918
I feel so wronged. How will I live now?

648
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,170
I…

649
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,674
I feel so sorry
for my own life. Seriously.

650
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,968
I wasn't born to make you proud, Mom.

651
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:06,886
What?

652
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,764
I wasn't born for dreams
you weren't able to achieve.

653
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,809
She is still talking back.

654
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,395
How can you say that?

655
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,855
I'm so sorry,

656
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,943
I want to live my life however I want to
whether it's good or bad.

657
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,155
I want to make decisions myself
and be responsible for my actions.

658
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,575
You…

659
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,100
Would you like some food?

660
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,146
I can't eat right now.

661
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,232
But you said you feel better
when you eat good food.

662
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,277
But it's amazing.

663
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,697
You always manage to find me
when I'm feeling this way.

664
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,449
As if you know something.

665
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,119
Perhaps it's a coincidence.

666
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,792
I feel like I'm acting on impulse…

667
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,631
but can you… give me a job?

668
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,010
I'm quite good at serving food
and doing all sorts of chores.

669
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:31,596
Please…

670
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,100
hire me.

671
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,567
FAST AND ACCURATE,
THE BEST GENETIC CENTER IN THE COUNTRY

672
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,285
DA

673
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,579
A fly on your hair.

674
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,500
GYE

675
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,627
A mosquito on your hair.

676
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,531
Not bad. It's good.

677
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,035
Is this eel skin?

678
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,413
Yes, I dried the eel skin in the oven

679
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,165
and made it crispy like a chip,

680
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,876
but crushed it finely
and sprinkled it on top not to overdo it.

681
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,461
Oh, you're here.

682
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,841
It's you, right?
We met right outside of the store before.

683
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,760
You're the pretty and kind one,
who is my type, right?

684
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,847
-Pardon?
-Oh, right. Hello.

685
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,765
Do you work here?

686
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,895
Yes.

687
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,190
Do you two know each other?

688
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,275
We passed by once outside.

689
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,653
Awesome. I'm interviewing here right now.

690
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,323
I hope I get hired.

691
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,034
You look even prettier
and sweeter this time.

692
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,953
-You're so my type.
-What?

693
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,288
Thank you.

694
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,545
This is ridiculous.

695
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,673
Her family runs a restaurant,

696
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,551
yet she goes to work
at a restaurant across the street?

697
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,095
I'm so dumbfounded.

698
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,766
Then would it be better if
it were a restaurant a bit farther away?

699
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,396
Just let her be. I'm sure she has a plan.

700
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,316
If so, how can she work
at the place with the refrig--

701
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,570
How can she go work at the place
with the refrigerator disaster?

702
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,072
She must've lost her mind.

703
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,786
It's time for dance lessons. Let's go!

704
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,080
Dance, my foot. No thanks.

705
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,958
Let's go and shake it off.

706
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,502
Get your mind off of things.

707
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,587
My mind is having tremors.

708
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,339
I'm not going. You go ahead, Mom.

709
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,423
Let's go.

710
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,425
I'm not going.

711
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,886
JIHWA COMMUNITY CENTER
SPORTS PROGRAM REGISTRATION

712
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,806
Good morning! Let's go!

713
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,849
Good morning! Let's go!

714
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,142
Let's go!

715
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,478
Four beats!

716
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,572
Three, four, action! That's it!
Like you're kicking your husband!

717
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,283
Action. All right!

718
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,493
-Those abs.
-I don't have any.

719
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,745
I have a favor to ask.

720
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,372
A favor? What favor?

721
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,251
Tell me now. This is exhausting.

722
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,795
Can you…

723
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:51,796
kill someone for me?

724
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,093
I saw everything.

725
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,474
Mom.

726
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,602
Go inside.

727
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,998
It looks delicious.

728
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,299
You already repaid
the five packs of ramyeon you owed.

729
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,467
But you still cooked for me.

730
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,386
I want you to sleep well.

731
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,473
So I'm bribing you.

732
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,851
How do you know that I don't sleep well?

733
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,772
Because people recognize others
who are similar to themselves.

734
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,941
So, you can't sleep well either.

735
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,032
Have I ever thanked you?

736
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,160
No, you haven't. But you don't need to.

737
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,704
Another glass?

738
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,833
Since we're celebrating my hiring,
I'll have another.

739
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:40,715
From time to time,
the kid back then crosses my mind.

740
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,811
I wonder why

741
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,814
he revealed his own dad's secret.

742
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,699
FOUR SEASONS PIANO

743
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:16,626
Perhaps it's because of…
the burden of carrying a secret.

744
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,631
I have something to confess.

745
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,471
It keeps getting heavier to the point

746
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,683
you feel like you'll die from suffocation
unless you let it out.

747
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:37,271
There comes a moment you can no longer
carry the burden of keeping a secret.

748
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,108
Like this very moment.

749
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:43,778
I…

750
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,908
killed someone.

751
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,456
And the moment we reveal our secret…

752
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,427
we end up regretting it.

753
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,516
Like how I feel

754
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:16,936
this very moment.

755
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,386
LINK

756
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,097
To a guy who makes my heart flutter
for the first time in years,

757
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,515
I confessed today

758
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,309
that I killed someone,

759
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,436
and I threatened
to kill him too if need be.

760
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,439
What? What is it?

761
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,482
-What did you do to Mr. Lee Jingeun?
-What?

762
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,527
Someone came by.
I think they said they were family.

763
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,821
If we say no…

764
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,364
She'll report us to the police.

765
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,158
-Mom, where are you going?
-Just go, both of you!

766
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,036
Anyone that knows about the incident
or gets in the way of Dahyun,

767
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,121
I'll get rid of them.

768
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,129
