2
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,935
So here you were.

3
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,317
Mom!

4
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,445
Dahyun! Oh, gosh!

5
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,698
Dahyun. Wake up, sweetie.

6
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,618
My mom killed the culprit to save me.

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,165
However…

8
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,666
There is more than one person.

9
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,128
There was more than one culprit.

10
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,325
And they're among us.

11
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,000
Disguised as normal people.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,217
AN ORDINARY EVIL

13
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,520
It's just one matter.

14
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,816
It keeps lingering in front of me.
That thing.

15
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,363
Do you see her?

16
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,033
No, I don't see her.

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,203
But I think I know who she is.

18
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,540
Eun Gyeyoung, right?

19
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,711
You're seeing her, aren't you?

20
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,048
Was it you?

21
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,258
Were you…

22
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,344
the one who killed her?

23
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,350
Answer me. I'm asking if you did it.

24
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,604
She left.

25
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,608
She was definitely there
until just a while ago.

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,026
But she left.

27
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,363
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
Who was there?

28
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,454
It's nothing.

29
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,665
Wait.

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,510
Didn't you come here
because you had something to tell me?

31
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,929
Why would I?

32
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
What about Eun Gyeyoung?

33
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,238
Mom, what happened to Eun Gyeyoung?

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,073
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,076
But I don't know.

36
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,745
What?

37
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,831
I had no idea that she was there as well.

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:15,088
I should've turned myself in.

39
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,092
If I turned myself in,
we could've found her too.

40
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,052
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,429
I'm truly sorry.

42
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,963
Hey, it's been a while.

43
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,925
Hello.

44
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,595
Is something wrong? Are you okay?

45
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,473
It's nothing. I'm okay.

46
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,934
Sorry, I shouldn't have said hi.

47
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,979
I should've just passed you by.

48
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,984
Do you really not need me to walk you home
with everything that's been going on?

49
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,485
It's okay.

50
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,530
Then let me just
walk with you until there.

51
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,707
What brings you to this neighborhood?

52
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,418
Do you live nearby?

53
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,712
No, I don't.

54
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,506
I just came by to check something.

55
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,808
Dahyun's memories are almost all back.

56
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,728
She'll remember you soon enough.

57
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,937
Or maybe…

58
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,523
she already does.

59
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,072
Someone I knew told me something.

60
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,034
So I came here to check

61
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,244
if they were telling the truth.

62
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,332
I see.

63
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,924
Your shoelaces have come undone.

64
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,512
You can go first.

65
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,361
They'll come undone again
if you tie them like that.

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,781
I can do it.

67
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,493
They won't come undone
if you tie them like this.

68
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,540
This way, you'll be able to run

69
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,750
if you need to.

70
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,763
Thank you.

71
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,184
I should get going now.

72
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,352
I think that person lied.

73
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,354
I did expect it though.

74
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,232
Go home safely then.

75
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,234
Goodbye.

76
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,324
By the way…

77
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,542
Have we…

78
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,966
ever met in the past?

79
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,974
As in when you were little?

80
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,317
Never mind.

81
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,778
Goodbye.

82
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,447
It's unlike you to call me first.

83
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,165
What's wrong?

84
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,959
What's going on?

85
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,138
Grandma.

86
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,973
Where's your mom?

87
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,142
She's still drinking.

88
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,085
That can't be.

89
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,172
How could Dahyun and Gyeyoung
have been together?

90
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,090
That's ridiculous.

91
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,925
It doesn't make any sense.

92
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,599
How's Dahyun?

93
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,935
We don't know yet.
The doctor needs to watch her for now.

94
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,274
Brace yourself for
what I'm about to tell you.

95
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,901
That man died.

96
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,738
What?

97
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,573
He's dead.

98
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,661
Did I… kill him?

99
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,790
What should I do?

100
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,084
Just don't do anything.

101
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,710
What do you mean?

102
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,130
Answer me.

103
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,883
I got rid of his body.

104
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,927
What?

105
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,721
So pretend like nothing happened.

106
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,058
No, that's not right.

107
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,477
That's not right, Jungho.

108
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,980
Just arrest me. I'll tell them everything.

109
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,649
He attacked us first.

110
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,275
Don't be ridiculous.

111
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,528
No one would deem your murder

112
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,488
as an act of self-defense.

113
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,616
-Still.
-You'll be put behind bars.

114
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,245
You'll be incarcerated,

115
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,622
and Dahyun will be all alone.

116
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,837
What's it to you?

117
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,548
This had nothing to do with you,
so why did you do that?

118
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,717
Of course, I'm involved in this.
I did it all for you.

119
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,343
I never asked you to!

120
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,264
No. I'm going to do it.
I'm going to turn myself in.

121
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,265
What about me then?

122
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,309
What'll happen to me?

123
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,187
Your decision will affect all of us.

124
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,524
It'll be the end for you, me, and Dahyun.

125
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,117
Then what about her?

126
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,578
Dr. Eun's daughter.

127
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,455
That case is irrelevant to this.

128
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,167
I found no trace of her anywhere.

129
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,213
So let's put an end to this.

130
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,593
Let's forget everything, okay?

131
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,431
I searched everywhere for Gyeyoung.

132
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,349
I searched his house, workplace,

133
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,562
and everywhere else he went.

134
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,355
His alibi even checked out.

135
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,065
But we were still wrong.

136
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,653
Had we reported it
and done a thorough search,

137
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,323
we could've found her.

138
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,468
Bokhee, come here.

139
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,887
Let me go.

140
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,806
We caught the culprit.

141
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,518
-What?
-The kidnapper was apprehended.

142
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,563
I told you that Gyeyoung's case
had nothing to do with Dahyun's.

143
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,275
So stop trying to turn yourself in, okay?

144
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,071
I…

145
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,700
will never forgive myself. And…

146
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,287
I'll never forgive you either.

147
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,749
You shouldn't have dissuaded me.

148
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,669
You should've let me be.

149
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,463
-It was all for you.
-Why would you do that?

150
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,090
Who do you think you are?

151
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,762
Never mind.

152
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,389
This isn't your fault.

153
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,474
It's all mine.

154
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,853
You see,

155
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,772
karma always bites back.

156
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,693
We're paying for what we did in the past.

157
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,493
Your mom

158
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,914
only found out later,
and she tormented herself.

159
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,419
She tried to turn herself in
several times but always couldn't.

160
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,842
Dahyun.

161
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,678
You must be struggling so much.

162
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,763
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,850
I'm truly sorry.

164
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,269
Don't be.

165
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,062
Why would you apologize?

166
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,065
And I don't resent Mom either.

167
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,119
But I don't know what to tell Gyehoon.

168
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,705
Even I'm in so much pain.

169
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,626
I can't imagine how he must be feeling.

170
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,504
That's why I feel terrible for him.

171
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,019
What in the world is going on?

172
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,569
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

173
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,619
Dahyun, are you okay?

174
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,663
Why are you
suddenly asking me if I'm okay?

175
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,752
I was worried about you,
so I called to check.

176
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,587
Why would you worry about me?

177
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,881
I'm…

178
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,801
always worried about you.

179
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,389
I'm always concerned about you.

180
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,601
Yes. I'm okay.

181
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,311
Don't lie.

182
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,313
You're not okay.

183
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,315
What's wrong?

184
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,318
Let's meet right now. Are you outside?

185
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,529
I'll come to you.

186
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,323
There's no need.

187
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,244
I'm really fine.

188
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,370
No.

189
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,208
You're…

190
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,462
crying right now.

191
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,216
What's going on, Dahyun?

192
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,707
Have you been waiting for me?

193
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,847
Here. Drink this.

194
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,349
Thanks.

195
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,102
You don't look too well.

196
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,696
You don't have a fever.

197
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,615
Do you want to eat something?

198
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,492
Do you crave anything?

199
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,286
It's okay. Don't bother.

200
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,167
These days, I often think that I was born

201
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,044
to cook for you.

202
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,962
I'll make some soup.

203
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,425
I don't know what's going on.

204
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,928
But if you force yourself to eat

205
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,641
no matter how much pain you're in,

206
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,684
you can endure it one day at a time.

207
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,896
I have something to tell you.

208
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,029
It's about my mom.

209
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,331
This was what she told me.

210
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,254
Her mom killed one of the culprits

211
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,798
and kept the case a secret

212
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,134
so she wouldn't get caught.

213
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,553
That means…

214
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,639
Had she reported it back then…

215
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,309
Had I not lost my memory…

216
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,563
Are you saying

217
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,316
we could've found Gyeyoung?

218
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,449
I really am.

220
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,079
I'm sorry, Gyehoon.

221
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,336
I don't know what to do.

222
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,423
Should I be mad at you?

223
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,260
Or should I wipe away your tears?

224
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,530
Hey.

225
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,073
Hey.

226
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,201
Hey, are you okay?

227
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,704
Thanks.

228
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,164
You don't look too well.

229
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,504
-Have you checked out some neighborhoods?
-What?

230
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,925
-I'm going to close down this restaurant.
-What?

231
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,553
Once I'm done taking care of some matters,

232
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,013
let's leave right away.

233
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,139
Why?

234
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,810
What do you mean?
You've been eager about moving.

235
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,895
But still.

236
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm just sick and tired
of this neighborhood.

237
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,404
Everything here disgusts me.

238
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,992
In hindsight,

239
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,496
it was wise to leave this place.

240
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,249
Coming back was the worst decision ever.

241
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,585
Then what about Dahyun?

242
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,842
Speaking of which,
she's late to work today.

243
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,887
Did something happen to her?

244
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,139
What is she doing right now?

245
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,692
She's crying.

246
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,867
Hey, is that her?

247
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,243
What?

248
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,540
Hello.

249
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,219
Well done.

250
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,103
I don't deserve

251
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,313
to say anything.

252
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,606
Then don't.

253
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,609
I've already heard everything.

254
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,696
And I don't see the need
or have the desire to hear more.

255
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,286
You killed someone and covered it up?

256
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,498
It doesn't surprise me.

257
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,710
I've always thought
you'd be capable of doing that anyway.

258
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,550
-I just--
-If you're going to

259
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,303
justify your actions
on the pretext of motherly love,

260
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,222
I don't want to hear it.

261
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,810
I came here to apologize,
not to justify myself.

262
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,728
Apologize?

263
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,481
Why?

264
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,570
-Is the guilt eating away at you?
-That's not why.

265
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,029
Don't you even dare.

266
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,782
I have no desire

267
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,410
to alleviate your guilt.

268
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,373
If I shouted and expressed
my resentment toward you right now,

269
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,128
that would only make you feel better.

270
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,464
That's why I won't do that.

271
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
I want you to live forever…

272
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,513
with regret and guilt.

273
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,017
So…

274
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,895
please leave.

275
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,772
Okay.

276
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,580
What is it?

277
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,061
Ji Wontak.

278
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,272
Officer Ji.

279
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,566
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

280
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,401
Do you think this would cut it?

281
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,111
Of course not.

282
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,363
I won't run away.

283
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,615
Feel free

284
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,034
to sue or arrest me.

285
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,132
I'm sorry, sir.
Please cut him some slack this once.

286
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,801
What's it to you? Why would you apologize?

287
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,846
I failed to teach him properly
as his mentor.

288
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,431
-So--
-Hwang Minjo!

289
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,018
He should apologize to me first

290
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,729
if I were to even forgive him.

291
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,480
You think I have no pride?

292
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,441
I'm sorry, sir.

293
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,401
Darn it.

294
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,488
Wontak, wait!

295
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,665
Are you really going to be like this?

296
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,543
Sorry.

297
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,962
Let's ask him for his forgiveness.

298
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,548
I'll apologize too, okay?

299
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,384
That'll never happen.

300
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,136
Why are you doing this?

301
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,847
What in the world happened?

302
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,059
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,944
-Hello, ma'am.
-Did something happen again?

304
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,322
I had something important to ask.

305
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,490
What is it?

306
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,910
I'm sorry,
but can I talk with Dahyun for a minute?

307
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,250
First of all,
I'd like to say that I'm sorry.

308
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,129
I'm truly sorry, Dahyun.

309
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,052
I heard you and Gyeyoung
were together that day.

310
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,057
-That's right.
-Can you tell me what you remember?

311
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,646
I'd like to compare
your answers to the things I know.

312
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,648
Sure.

313
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,069
Do you remember where you girls

314
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,447
were locked up?

315
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,743
We were in the basement of a house.

316
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,746
And right now,

317
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,125
Ms. Yang lives there.

318
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,885
It was Ms. Yang's basement?

319
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,182
That's the house
from your nightmares, right?

320
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,268
Do you know that house?

321
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,062
Yes. You started having nightmares

322
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,857
not too long after the incident.

323
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,152
You kept dreaming of a red gate,
so I looked for the house,

324
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,195
just in case it existed.

325
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,337
But it didn't seem like
anyone was living there.

326
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,089
It was empty.

327
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,216
I see.

328
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,512
I'll go upstairs now.

329
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,766
Eat something.
You haven't had anything all day.

330
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,683
That's okay.

331
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,059
By the way,

332
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,146
what about you and Gyehoon?

333
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,485
I know you two are dating.

334
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,658
I don't have the right to choose.

335
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,726
Don't abandon me.

336
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,770
I don't mean to abandon you…

337
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,856
I can't abandon you.

338
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,112
And I can't hold onto you either,
even if you abandon me.

339
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,699
Do you remember the day

340
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,911
we almost broke up then reconciled?

341
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,417
I do.

342
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,842
I only realized this
after deciding to break up.

343
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,677
There isn't much that we've done.

344
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,555
I have so many things
that I want to do with you.

345
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,765
Then let's do them.

346
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,060
I want to sing at a karaoke room.

347
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,230
I rarely sing.

348
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,149
I want to play tag
by the ocean like they do

349
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,068
in movies and dramas.

350
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,737
I hate cheesy things.

351
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,657
And I also want to go
to an amusement park.

352
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,033
I'm terrified of those rides.

353
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,703
I want to wait in line
and eat delicious food.

354
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,246
But I'm a chef myself.

355
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,873
We haven't taken any selfies either.

356
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,416
I really hate taking photos.

357
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,051
But I'm going to do all of them.

358
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,804
Of course, I will.

359
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,183
What do you want to do?

360
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,064
I really liked arcade games growing up.

361
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,817
I want to go to an arcade together.

362
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,068
What else?

363
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,781
I also want to go to a cart bar

364
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,950
and have udon and soju.

365
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,869
Sounds good. Let's do them all.

366
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,878
We can do anything we want
as long as we don't break up.

367
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,963
You're right.

368
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,471
Will we really be able to do them all?

369
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,058
Yes.

370
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,101
As long as…

371
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,731
we don't break up.

372
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,246
Are you here, sir?

373
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,211
What bad timing.

374
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,047
He must be around here.

375
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,595
Hey.

376
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,728
What was that last melody?

377
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,521
I guess it's just

378
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,232
a memory.

379
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,048
Gosh, I repeatedly told you
that public urination is prohibited here.

380
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,135
Can you believe the guy
who urinates publicly did it?

381
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,471
A suspect of a cold case?

382
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,265
It's pretty difficult
for someone to turn over a new leaf.

383
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,518
Get branded once, and it's over for good.

384
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,228
In this neighborhood,

385
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,146
do you accuse people without any evidence?

386
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,357
Where were you and what were you doing
yesterday and the day before that?

387
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,483
Come on. Say it!

388
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,028
Why are you doing this?

389
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
Why can't you just tell me?

390
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,537
So that was why.

391
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,211
You scumbag.

392
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,298
You jerk.

393
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,846
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,517
SEWOON POLICE STATION

395
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,539
Excuse me, sir. I'm here to testify.

396
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,124
This way, please.

397
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,130
The current time is 2:23 p.m.

398
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,259
The interrogation will commence now.

399
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,721
First, tell us about your relationship
with Mr. Lee Jingeun

400
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,848
and how you got to know him.

401
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,312
What brings you here at this hour?

402
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,858
I just wanted to see you.

403
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,901
Come in.

404
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,658
How are you?

405
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,201
Good.

406
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,704
Is everything really okay?

407
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:58,085
I just missed you and Dad.

408
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,505
You sound like a little kid.

409
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,424
Do I?

410
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,390
-Gyehoon.
-Yes?

411
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,687
You can call Dad if you want.

412
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,859
You don't need to worry about me.

413
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,780
I don't.

414
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:31,327
Your dad and I aren't on good terms
since we fought so much.

415
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,413
But it's okay.

416
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,959
Don't worry about me.
You can contact him as much as you want.

417
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,589
-Really?
-Of course.

418
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,134
So call him.

419
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,930
Okay. I'll call him later.

420
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,751
Didn't we search

421
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,754
all the vacant houses that day?

422
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,757
What are you talking about?
Be more specific.

423
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,052
I'm talking about that day 18 years ago
when Eun Gyeyoung went missing.

424
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,972
Didn't we search
all the empty houses in Jihwa-dong?

425
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,266
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

426
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,018
Just tell me. I'm curious.

427
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,813
Yes, we did. We all split up
and searched all the areas.

428
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,106
Why are you asking?

429
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,067
Dongnam's house
was in Jihwa 3-dong, right?

430
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,236
Who was in charge of that area?

431
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,739
-Dongnam's house?
-Yes.

432
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,993
I can't remember that.

433
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,998
-Is that so?
-What is it?

434
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:42,666
Why do you ask?

435
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,835
I'd like to take the day off.
Please process my leave.

436
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,212
What?

437
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,297
I'm not your secretary.

438
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,467
Do you want to drink?
I need to or else I'll go insane.

439
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,970
Unbelievable. No, thanks.

440
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,764
Bye.

441
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,058
That little…

442
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,685
What's this about?

443
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm the one to blame.

444
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,912
I'm the jerk.

445
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,251
I don't deserve to live.

446
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,383
What is it this time?

447
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,301
What's going on?

448
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,722
I deserve everything
that I'm going through.

449
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,101
I'm getting punished
for doing something I shouldn't have.

450
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,076
It's even raining.

451
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,956
What a great day to get drunk and die.

452
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,293
Jeez.

453
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,071
JURISDICTION MAP

454
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,838
CHIEF SEO

455
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,302
What is it?

456
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,762
It was you.

457
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,846
What?

458
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,434
You were the one
who searched Dongnam's area.

459
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,686
It was you. Don't you remember?

460
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,355
Are you positive?

461
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,149
Yes. I just checked.

462
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,735
By the way, what are you up to right now?

463
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,445
Are you really taking a leave?

464
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,199
I'm having a drink with Younghoon.

465
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,368
I'll process my leave then.

466
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,498
Who was that?

467
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,167
What's going on?

468
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,127
Let's go.

469
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,964
Jungho, are you okay?

470
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,760
Jeez.

471
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,430
-Excuse me.
-I…

472
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,352
I was the one who searched that house?

473
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,732
Stay there. I'll help you walk.

474
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,901
Jeez.

475
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,279
Let me help you.

476
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,657
Sober up, will you?

477
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,666
Jungho.

478
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,252
Let me help you.

479
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,586
Younghoon.

480
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,130
I heard.

481
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,757
You can't search
all the vacant houses by yourself.

482
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,926
Let me help, okay?

483
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,178
I'll search that house.

484
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,222
Okay. I'll move on to the next alley.

485
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,266
Shout if you find anything, okay?

486
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,268
-Don't worry.
-Okay. Go on.

487
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,121
Jungho, come here.

488
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,790
What?

489
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,293
What are you doing there? Come here.

490
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,510
Hop in.

491
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,596
Hurry up. The seat's getting drenched.

492
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,016
I'm okay. I can walk home.

493
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,101
I didn't drink
because I wanted to drive you home.

494
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,437
Go on.

495
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,106
Okay.

496
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,085
Younghoon.

497
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,216
You know I love you
and think the world of you, right?

498
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,427
I love you a lot too.

499
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,222
After all, I moved here because of you.

500
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,975
I was also really glad

501
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,478
when you moved here.

502
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,454
Jungho.

503
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,289
Yes?

504
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,334
You remembered, didn't you?

505
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,978
You shouldn't have remembered.

506
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,495
That's enough.

507
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,331
Please stop!

508
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,792
Stop torturing me.

509
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,670
Stop showing yourself in front of me!

510
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,106
Please…

511
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,069
Please help me.

512
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,786
I'm sorry.

513
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,873
But I have no energy
or desire to talk to anyone

514
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,417
at the moment.

515
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,715
Your sister…

516
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,553
She just won't disappear.

517
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,682
I beg of you.

518
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,060
Please…

519
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,271
Please get rid of her for me.

520
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,610
What brings you here at this hour?

521
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,862
I'm sorry for barging in this late,

522
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,781
but can I speak with Dahyun?

523
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,075
-What?
-What? Why her?

524
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,961
Dahyun, didn't you come
to our house last time?

525
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,172
Well…

526
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,051
-Yes.
-Why did you?

527
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,260
Why do you ask?

528
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:36,139
Was it because of my husband?

529
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,769
You know something, don't you?

530
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,939
Your husband?

531
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:52,239
Is it too difficult to talk about?
Then let me ask you instead.

532
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,658
Did you come that day

533
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,913
because of Eun Gyeyoung?
You did, didn't you?

534
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,081
What are you talking about?

535
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,210
I think

536
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,879
my husband…

537
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,633
killed her.

538
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,563
What do you mean?

539
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,524
My sister won't disappear?

540
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,152
What does that mean?

541
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,738
It means exactly that.

542
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,198
She just won't disappear.

543
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,076
So exactly what are you talking about?

544
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,457
My wife told me to come clean with you.

545
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,751
She said that would help me.

546
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,047
So I'm going to tell you everything.

547
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,634
Go on.

548
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,813
The day your sister disappeared

549
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,941
eighteen years ago,

550
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,780
people thought I wasn't in Jihwa-dong.

551
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,783
But I was.

552
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,377
I'm home.

553
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,592
I was always away from home due to work

554
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,220
and had returned home after a month.

555
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,432
But my wife wasn't home,
and I couldn't reach her either.

556
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,393
Where is she? It's getting late.

557
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,062
The house was a mess.

558
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,439
I was about to explode.

559
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:50,899
Then suddenly…

560
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,280
Hello?

561
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,493
You should've told me in advance
if the machines were faulty.

562
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,885
Hey!

563
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,346
Darn it.

564
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,851
Come on. Who is it?

565
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,564
-What?
-Please help me.

566
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,690
What?

567
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,775
Sir, please help me.

568
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,444
Back then,

569
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,073
I didn't know who she was.

570
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,368
I only found out later
that she was your sister.

571
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,996
And then?

572
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,624
What happened after that?

573
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,760
Why?

574
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,722
Why would you?

575
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,933
Younghoon.

576
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,979
Tell me why!

577
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,647
I'm sorry.

578
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,984
Deny it. Tell me it wasn't you.

579
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,613
Tell me you didn't do it.

580
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,157
You may have taken the girls.

581
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,243
But you didn't harm them, right?

582
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,288
They ran away.

583
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,874
Dahyun returned home, and Gyeyoung…

584
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,505
Gyeyoung…

585
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,220
What in the world happened that day?

586
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,389
Then who was that man that I buried?

587
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,308
That guy…

588
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,938
was just a scapegoat of mine.

589
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,191
I was going to
dispose of him later anyway.

590
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,321
But you did me a favor.

591
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,739
Also,

592
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,950
as for Gyeyoung…

593
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,578
You're right.

594
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,081
-She had escaped.
-Are you okay?

595
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,715
Darn it.

596
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,429
-Soonchul, hurry up.
-What is it?

597
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,764
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

598
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,808
They ran away! Darn it!

599
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,230
We can find them.

600
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,281
Gyeyoung.

601
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,120
Girls.

602
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,466
Where are you?

603
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,553
I will find you.

604
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,476
Where are you?

605
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,938
Where could you be, Gyeyoung?

606
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,992
Come on. Who is it?

607
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,203
Please help me.

608
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,333
-What?
-Sir, please help me.

609
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,293
What did you say?

610
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,712
A bad man is following me.

611
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,675
Dongnam and Gyeyoung were together?

612
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,469
Yes.

613
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,724
So I thought it was the end for me.

614
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,561
But there was a surprising twist.

615
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,357
What did you do with her?

616
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,569
I…

617
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,075
left her there.

618
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,998
I didn't help her

619
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,168
and just left her behind.

620
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,645
-What?
-He just left.

621
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,067
Despite her plea for help,
he just left her there.

622
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:45,985
A bad man?

623
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,613
Where is he?

624
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,157
Where is that bad man?

625
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:56,204
He was following me until just now.

626
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,540
Jeez, just my luck.

627
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,666
Please help me.

628
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,960
Please let me get in your car.

629
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,170
Please take me home.

630
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,465
Come on.

631
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,684
Darn it.

632
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,476
Please let me go.

633
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,564
Please let me go, sir.

634
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,108
Please, sir.

635
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,986
So?

636
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,741
Did you harm her?

637
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,335
Let me ask you

638
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,295
just one question.

639
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,300
You went into that house instead of me.

640
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,136
That day when you offered to help.

641
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,349
If it was me…

642
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,520
who had gone in there instead,

643
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,650
would she have lived?

644
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,530
Would I have saved her?

645
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,246
Why are you curious about that?

646
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,288
Just tell me!

647
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,002
She was alive.

648
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,134
Kill me.

649
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,389
Kill me, Younghoon.

650
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,109
How…

651
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,238
How could you do that?

652
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,535
That little girl was begging
for your help, but you…

653
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,039
How? How could you?

654
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,210
Why should I have helped?

655
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,338
Do you even know
how tired I was that night?

656
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,883
Why should I have helped her

657
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,262
when I was going through hell myself?

658
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,477
Why are you looking at me like that?

659
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,232
What did I do so wrong
for you to judge me?

660
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,568
All I did was mind my own business.

661
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:17,739
So why does your sister
torture me all the time?

662
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,326
And why are you looking at me
with those judgmental eyes?

663
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,712
It felt like the world

664
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,257
had abandoned me.

665
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,426
Darn it.

666
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,736
Is he sleeping already?

667
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,238
I need to tell him.

Something happened to you, right?

675
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,014
What is it?

676
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,353
Say something!

677
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,065
Dahyun.

678
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,609
Yes, I'm listening.

679
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,656
I miss you.

680
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,537
Where are you?

681
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:33,875
I'll go there.

682
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:36,669
Okay?

683
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,755
Where are you?

684
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,800
Where are you?

685
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,396
LINK

686
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,022
You were right.

687
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,191
Time has a different meaning to me now.

688
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,110
You were right, Dahyun.

689
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,528
Let's break up.

690
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,823
I know now why we're linked.

691
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,950
I have to tell you.

692
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,326
But how did you know?

693
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,870
How did you remember me?

694
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,872
This feeling I have

695
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:39,500
is the same fear that I felt
the day Gyeyoung disappeared forever.

696
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,586
Dahyun!

697
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,254
Please help.

698
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,715
Please don't let me
lose anyone ever again.

699
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,096
