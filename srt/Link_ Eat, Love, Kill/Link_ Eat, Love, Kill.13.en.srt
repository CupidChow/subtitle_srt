LINK

2
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,645
Gyeyoung, hang in there, okay?

3
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,482
How did I make it back?

4
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,446
And what happened to Eun Gyeyoung
who escaped from that place with me?

5
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,665
Dahyun!

6
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,459
Dahyun!

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,511
What really happened that night

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,264
eighteen years ago?

9
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:45,563
MOM'S SECRET

10
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,328
I've regained my memories, Mom.

11
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,914
Not completely,

12
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,874
But a big part of it.

13
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,211
I had a dream
for the first time in a long time.

14
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,546
A dream?

15
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,840
About that day 18 years ago

16
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,092
when Dahyun disappeared.

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,055
She keeps throwing a fuss
saying if there's anything

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,349
we need to tell her
or are keeping from her,

19
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,434
so I can't sleep well.

20
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,233
So much time has gone by,

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,945
but I still remember it so clearly

22
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,282
as if it happened just yesterday.

23
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,966
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,643
What are you going to do now?

25
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,480
I have no idea.

26
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,450
AN JUNGHO

27
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,077
I wonder what's going on.

28
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,800
Was it you?

29
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,261
-What?
-Was it you?

30
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,222
What are you talking about?
Explain yourself.

31
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,598
That stalker Lee Jingeun.

32
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,183
Did you kill him?

33
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,646
-What?
-Who? He died?

34
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,688
It wasn't you?

35
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,899
No?

36
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,367
Her hand slipped.

37
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,498
Her hand slipped through mine.

38
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,212
I left her behind, Gyehoon.

39
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,382
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,558
Let's break up.

41
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,981
Let's break up,

42
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,234
Gyehoon.

43
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,583
I can't talk right now--

44
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,594
Okay.

45
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,644
What's going on?

46
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,813
They found…

47
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
Jingeun.

48
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:17,900
Where?

49
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,529
The refrigerator.

50
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,032
What?

51
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,203
His body was found
inside of the refrigerator.

52
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,836
My goodness.

53
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,341
A body was found in a refrigerator?
How could this be?

54
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,885
Who is it? Who died?

55
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,219
Who knows?

56
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,180
What's the point of this?

57
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,391
-There is no evidence left here.
-We still need to follow protocol.

58
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,644
But you already know that all the CCTVs
in this neighborhood are broken or fake.

59
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,774
Who in the world broke that?

60
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,069
If that was working,
we could've caught the killer right away.

61
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,739
Lee Jingeun.
He probably didn't see this coming.

62
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,616
You never know what's around the corner.

63
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,700
-Excuse me.
-What's wrong?

64
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,202
What are you talking about?

65
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,829
It was Lee Jingeun?

66
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,456
He died?

67
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,336
He died… I see.

68
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,837
Do you know Lee Jingeun?

69
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,215
How do you know him?

70
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,383
What?

71
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,676
How else?

72
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,722
-He's Dahyun's stalker.
-What?

73
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,682
Most of the townsfolk know about him.

74
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,184
-Right, honey?
-Yes.

75
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,728
-Everyone knows, right?
-Yes, of course.

76
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,272
-Is that right?
-No, I didn't know.

77
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,524
-Me neither.
-No.

78
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,402
You guys should care more
about our neighborhood.

79
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,070
-There was a stalker?
-A stalker?

80
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,196
Gather around.

81
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,782
To catch the culprit,

82
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,076
we have to find someone with a motive.

83
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,036
-Are you saying Dahyun did it?
-Jeez.

84
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,832
I think the chef is
more suspicious than Dahyun.

85
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,252
That makes sense. There's
something going on between the two.

86
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,586
-That's right.
-Yes.

87
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,713
They might even be accomplices.

88
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,757
-No way. That's ridiculous.
-My goodness.

89
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,551
Yes, they could be accomplices. Seriously.

90
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,511
-How terrible.
-In this neighborhood,

91
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,263
do you accuse people without any evidence?

92
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,063
Raise your hand if you had laid a finger
on that refrigerator even once.

93
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,902
I can identify you
by checking the fingerprints.

94
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,404
-Put your hand up.
-No, not me.

95
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,364
-I saw you.
-No, I didn't.

96
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,700
-Just raise your hand.
-But…

97
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,869
All of you with your hands up
are suspects.

98
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,203
-What?
-Suspects?

99
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,415
Sorry, my bad. You're all references.
Please keep that in mind.

100
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,586
A detective will come see you individually
or call you to the police station.

101
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,173
-Are you calling us criminals?
-How can you do that to us?

102
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,800
-I only touched it once.
-That's ridiculous.

103
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,229
Gyehoon.

104
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,023
The light is green now.

105
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,774
What?

106
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,652
Oh, sorry.

107
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,616
Are you okay?

108
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,204
No.

109
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,629
Let me stop for a second.
I have too much on my mind.

110
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,384
Lee Jingeun's killer…

111
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,512
was probably him.

112
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,972
He was probably the one
who took Gyeyoung and me.

113
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,183
Right.

114
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,976
And maybe

115
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,771
I'll become the prime suspect.

116
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,856
Why?

117
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,945
I was the last person who saw Lee Jingeun,

118
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,907
and I also beat him up that day.

119
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,619
They'll find my DNA on him.

120
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,332
But don't worry.

121
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,795
I filed a report with the police,
and the investigation can't be so sloppy.

122
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,964
You're right.

123
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,299
Nothing is going to happen to you.

124
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,350
No wonder you have a lot on your mind.

125
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,812
On top of that,

126
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,940
you want to break up.

127
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,660
I'll start driving.

128
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,252
-My goodness.
-Please step aside.

129
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,796
-He is inside.
-The ambulance is here.

130
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,673
How can this happen?

131
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,967
-Unbelievable.
-Seriously.

132
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,845
-I know.
-Here they come.

133
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
-Jeez.
-He really is dead.

134
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,955
It was like a scene from a movie.

135
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,958
The past events flashed before my eyes.

136
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,251
Is there someone else now?

137
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,210
-Boo!
-Oh, gosh!

138
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,216
Mom!

139
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,433
The person who I really wanted
out of my life the most…

140
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,776
actually disappeared.

141
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,266
Gyehoon.

142
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,188
Did you hear that the stalker is dead?

143
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,149
Did you hear, Dahyun?

144
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,568
Yes.

145
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,320
Yes, we heard.

146
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,198
How is that he was in our refrigerator?

147
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,325
Right here… Right under our noses?

148
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,577
It's completely ridiculous.

149
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,912
I'm so scared, Gyehoon.

150
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,871
Gosh, darn it.

151
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,999
What? What now?

152
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,418
The fish.

153
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,086
The fish?

154
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,505
My octopus and shrimp.

155
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,467
Seriously…

156
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,529
I know what you're all thinking.

157
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,364
You might be thinking that

158
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,409
this isn't the time to worry about scallop
and prepare octopus and shrimp.

159
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,369
But he has reached his limit.

160
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,289
That's what happens every time.
He creates work for himself.

161
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,582
Anyway, he is out of his mind.

162
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,501
That works. I'm like that too.

163
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,714
My head hurts,
which tells me that I'm at my limit too.

164
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,134
Oh, no. It's all melted.

165
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,679
We can't refreeze them anyway,
so let's just eat them.

166
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,931
We have to postpone the opening again.

167
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,937
I'll send a cancellation message
to the guests first.

168
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,856
Okay, let's get busy.

169
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,254
"I will inform you later."

170
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,623
Why isn't she picking up?
She's ignoring my texts too.

171
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,124
What's the point of having a phone?

172
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,505
She's driving me crazy.

173
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,883
You're making me feel dizzy.

174
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,301
My head is spinning.

175
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,553
Isn't yours?

176
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,513
No, because I'm out of my mind.

177
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,722
Let's just go.

178
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,015
Go where?

179
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,059
Let's go check the restaurant

180
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,728
or wait for her in the alley.
That'll be better.

181
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,188
Why couldn't I think of that?

182
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,610
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

183
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,030
-I think she's back.
-Where?

184
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,574
You're right.

185
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,662
You brat! Why don't you pick up--

186
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,914
Mom.

187
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,042
What's all this?

188
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,627
Perfect timing.

189
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,712
Please join us.

190
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,174
This is the most expensive one here.
It's my treat.

191
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,559
By the way,

192
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,230
you all know
what's going on out there, right?

193
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,524
You know Lee Jingeun died, right?

194
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,444
Yes, we all know.

195
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,195
That's why we're celebrating.

196
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,657
But is it okay to do this
because he's a bad guy?

197
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,827
Do you think it's okay we have a feast

198
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,495
and celebrate that he died?

199
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,414
Some even hand out celebratory rice cakes.

200
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,708
If this was a movie,

201
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,794
it'd be equivalent to the death
of the greatest villain.

202
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,423
So why can't we have a feast

203
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,799
or enjoy some flowers?

204
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,344
We have no use for these ingredients
and the flowers anyway.

205
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,473
Of course, we can have a feast.

206
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,724
Don't you agree, Mom?

207
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,351
I don't know about that,

208
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,103
but it'll be a shame to let
such fancy food go to waste.

209
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,021
Absolutely.

210
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,274
It's not much, but I hope you enjoy.

211
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,903
It is a lot.

212
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,196
We're the ones who cooked.

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,990
I know. I said it out of habit.

214
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,325
Let it go.

215
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,743
Please go ahead and eat.

216
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,582
What's this?

217
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,129
What's this? It's so delicious.

218
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,382
What's this? What is this made from?

219
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,093
-Wow--
-Wait.

220
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,723
By any chance,

221
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,227
it's not one of us, right?

222
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,818
I'll be honest.

223
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,157
I wish I were the one who killed him,

224
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,034
but sadly, it wasn't me.

225
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,455
-What about you?
-No.

226
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,501
Unfortunately, it wasn't me either.

227
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,669
What about you two?

228
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,756
No.

229
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,760
Then who on earth was it?

230
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,737
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

231
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,668
Are we taking too much home?

232
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,837
-It's okay.
-Bye.

233
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,172
Are you okay, Eunjung?

234
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,090
Of course. I'm totally fine.

235
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,594
I don't think so.
Just stay over at our place.

236
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,679
I can go home. I'm not that drunk.

237
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,225
Hey, but…

238
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,187
Don't worry about me, everyone.

239
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,438
Bye!

240
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,774
Get home safely.

241
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,283
Gosh.

242
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,446
I thought I was almost there.

243
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,742
I know who took your sister.

244
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,077
How is your father?

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,788
Just tell me who ordered you
to bring Gyeyoung there.

246
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,414
Who was he?

247
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,084
The person you're looking for is…

248
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,051
I had so many chances.

249
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,594
So many chances!

250
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,895
It really…

251
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,774
wasn't you, right?

252
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,403
No. Why would I?

253
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,114
If one of us killed him,
it'd be either you or Grandma, not me.

254
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,031
Hey.

255
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,749
Eunjung must be crying so much right now.

256
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,176
Dajung, you look more beautiful today.

257
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,553
I felt great today,

258
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,347
so I had a drink.

259
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,520
Because Lee Jingeun died.

260
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,527
So you should

261
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
rest in peace now.

262
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,783
Forget how you were wronged,

263
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,162
and don't be hurt…

264
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,957
or be afraid anymore.

265
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,672
Just rest in peace, Dajung.

266
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,432
I miss you.

267
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,190
What should I do now?

268
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,903
I've only been living
to catch and kill that scumbag.

269
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,114
What do I do now?

270
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,160
How can I live on…

271
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:38,672
How many secrets
have been buried with you?

272
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,726
Tell me, Lee Jingeun.

273
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,812
Who…

274
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,148
killed you?

275
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,628
You know what?

276
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,173
It's useless killing me now!

277
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,467
Why is it useless?

278
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,926
It's almost all back.

279
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,888
Dahyun's memories are almost all back.

280
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,223
She'll

281
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,476
remember you soon enough.

282
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,313
Or maybe… she already does.

283
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,742
Then I should go see Dahyun.

284
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,160
For what?

285
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,703
I'll know once I see her.

286
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,290
Whether she really remembers me,

287
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,833
or

288
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,711
you're just lying to me.

289
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,007
What if she does remember you?

290
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,634
If she does…

291
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,268
You like Dahyun, don't you?

292
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,232
I'll let you reunite with her soon.

293
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,308
Let's break up.

294
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,227
Let's break up.

295
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,438
It's hitting me now

296
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,815
that I broke up with Gyehoon today.

297
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,779
Because of Lee Jingeun, I had no chance
to feel sad about my break-up.

298
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,575
He's a nuisance to the end.

299
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,708
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

300
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,625
Are you asleep?

301
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:23,879
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

302
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,965
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

303
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,555
I guess you're still up
since you checked my message.

304
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,561
No, I'm sleeping.

305
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,607
It's been a while
since I've heard you lie.

306
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,025
What?

307
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,110
Can you come by the restaurant?

308
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,280
Why?

309
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,407
We still need to resolve something.

310
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,767
You said we need to resolve something.

311
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,355
I'm not breaking up with you.

312
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,900
-What?
-That's all I had to say.

313
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,988
Do you want some tea or coffee?

314
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,574
Maybe it's too late for coffee.

315
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,493
Wine, then.

316
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,371
You can't just decide that on your own.

317
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,710
What about you?

318
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,630
-What?
-You did the same thing to me earlier.

319
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,801
But I thoroughly explained my reasons.

320
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,969
Your reasons?

321
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,640
Your reasons, I see.

322
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,147
I didn't know you for 20 something years.

323
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,316
I've known you only for a few months.

324
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,485
But those few months have been…

325
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,824
more meaningful to me than those 20 years.

326
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,784
Time has a different meaning to me now.

327
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,789
Before I met you, everything was a blur.

328
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,918
I just felt like I was barely surviving.

329
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,046
I know I sound weak-minded to say this,

330
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,757
but even if my life were to end
wherever any moment,

331
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:39,055
I wouldn't have cared at all
except for leaving my mother behind.

332
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,517
That's how I felt.

333
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,811
But

334
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,814
everything changed after meeting you.

335
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,568
In such a brief period of time,

336
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,946
I've become someone
who cannot live without you,

337
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,783
and I even thought

338
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,413
that life

339
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,041
could be quite enjoyable.

340
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,085
So,

341
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,298
don't abandon me.

342
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,801
I don't mean to abandon you…

343
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,355
But will you really be okay?

344
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,526
Wouldn't you feel tormented
every time you see me?

345
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,780
No.

346
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,531
I'll be okay.

347
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,742
It'll be painful.

348
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,119
I'll manage.

349
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,000
To be honest,

350
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,712
I didn't want to break up either.

351
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,968
I know.

352
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,810
I'm sorry.

353
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,481
Me too.

354
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,133
Gyeyoung, you go first.

355
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,848
What are you saying?

356
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,225
I can't hear you.

357
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,562
What?

358
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
Again, Gyeyoung.

359
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,024
Say it again. Eun Gyeyoung.

360
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,009
Grandma.

361
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,219
Are you up? Let's go eat breakfast.

362
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,433
What's wrong?
Did you have a nightmare again?

363
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,809
Yes.

364
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,062
What did you dream about this time?

365
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,733
I dreamed about the time
I got kidnapped 18 years ago.

366
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,156
It's okay.

367
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,827
Not completely, but I've regained
a big part of my memories.

368
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,248
I'm not sure why you and Mom

369
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,417
are keeping that incident
a secret from me,

370
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,045
but I'm looking into it on my own.

371
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,256
-Dahyun.
-Now it makes sense why you told me

372
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,050
not to turn around.

373
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,137
You were worried that I'd be hurt
and wouldn't be able to move forward.

374
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,393
But Grandma,

375
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,356
I'm okay. So please don't worry.

376
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,447
In any case,

377
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,951
Eun Gyeyoung definitely told me something.

378
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,371
What? Eun Gyeyoung?

379
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,498
Yes.

380
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,544
When Gyeyoung and I
were kidnapped together,

381
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,464
she definitely told me something.

382
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,925
But that memory is so blurry.

383
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,469
What on earth did she say?

384
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,527
-Bokhee.
-Yes?

385
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,993
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

386
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,666
My heart sinks whenever
I see that expression on your face.

387
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,168
What's going on?

388
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,507
What do we do?

389
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,438
Get up.

390
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,315
It's almost lunch time already.

391
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,192
Get up now and distribute
the leftovers to the neighbors.

392
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,110
We have so much left.

393
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,077
What's wrong? Are you crying?

394
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,496
I couldn't show it yesterday
given the celebratory mood,

395
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,707
but our soft opening got postponed again.

396
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,084
I'm so sad about it.

397
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,755
How is it that every time we try to open,
someone wields a knife

398
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,007
or shows up dead? This is ridiculous.

399
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,469
You know how some locations

400
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,471
always have a new store
every time you go, right?

401
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,473
It doesn't do well there
no matter who runs it.

402
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,557
This place is like that.

403
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,808
Don't jinx it.

404
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,560
It's already jinxed.

405
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,645
So let's leave.

406
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,648
You, me, and Gaehoon.

407
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,566
We're a family.
Let's start afresh elsewhere.

408
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,361
How are you, me, and him a family?

409
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,655
What do you think?

410
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,199
Tell me, Eun Gaehoon.

411
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,786
Hey, that's not his name.
Why does he get my last name?

412
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,871
Because you're his dad and I'm his mom.

413
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,206
I don't think so.

414
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,796
Gyehoon. Think about it carefully.

415
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,975
Yes.

416
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,559
Yes, that's right.

417
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,272
Please text me the date and time.

418
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,482
Thank you.

419
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,987
I've been asked
to be questioned as a reference.

420
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,863
They'll call me soon too then.

421
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,576
I'll go give this to someone.

422
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,078
To whom?

423
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,456
The suspect from a long time ago.

424
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,125
What?

425
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,376
I want to…

426
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,671
apologize to him first.

427
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:31,134
POLICE
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

428
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,150
Say it straight.

429
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,614
Where were you and what were you doing
yesterday and the day before that?

430
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,409
Don't make me repeat it!

431
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,995
Why aren't you saying anything?

432
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,872
Come on. Say it!

433
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,461
I'm telling you!
Han Euichan is the killer!

434
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,591
Seriously.

435
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,138
What? Hey, Ji Wontak.

436
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,515
What are you doing here?

437
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,392
Hey!

438
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,564
Have you lost your mind?
What's the matter with you?

439
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,238
You punk. What's wrong with you?

440
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,786
You little…

441
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,013
Se…

442
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,630
RESCUE

443
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,370
Tell me.

444
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,122
What's going on?

445
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,833
Why are you doing this?

446
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,214
Why can't you just tell me?

447
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,852
We'll transfer you to a hospital
for further treatment.

448
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,899
Are you okay?

449
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,155
That punk sneaked up on me
and attacked from behind.

450
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,286
Hey, Jungho. You know how good I am.

451
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,289
I wouldn't be beaten up
by a little punk like that.

452
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,293
I'm still strong and healthy.

453
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,961
I don't need this!

454
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,087
Come on, Younghwan.

455
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,218
Where do you think you're going?
Just go to the hospital.

456
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,304
Hey, I'm stronger than I look.

457
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,224
I don't need to go to the hospital
for a minor injury like this, okay?

458
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,143
See? I'm completely fine.

459
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,086
What are you doing here?

460
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,629
What do you want?

461
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,216
Why did you pop out of nowhere
and follow me around?

462
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,511
I'm checking just in case.

463
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,225
I wouldn't want you to collapse
from a concussion.

464
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,396
Don't underestimate me.

465
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,445
Wouldn't you be happy?

466
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,829
Don't you wish
that I just collapse and die?

467
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,124
Maybe that's what Ji Wontak wants.

468
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,293
But why would I?

469
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,266
Gone missing?

470
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,769
She's gone missing in broad daylight?

471
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,440
The thing is that
I can sense how Gyeyoung feels.

472
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,735
She is so scared right now.

473
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,571
I'm sure
something terrible happened to her.

474
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,408
My goodness. You little punks.

475
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,451
Don't joke around.

476
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,995
-I'm not joking.
-He's really not joking.

477
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,747
Hey, the police station
isn't a playground.

478
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,165
Go find a playground, okay?

479
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,376
Let's go.

480
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,212
Okay.

481
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,935
Forget it.

482
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,022
Ji Wontak and I…

483
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,233
are looking for the culprit

484
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,196
who took my sister 18 years ago.

485
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,741
What?

486
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,620
And Lee Jingeun's killer…

487
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,123
is probably him from 18 years ago.

488
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,378
I'm saying that you got…

489
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,756
the wrong guy.

490
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,698
Let's go.

491
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,996
Did everything go well?

492
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,790
Yes.

493
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm not busy, so I'm taking a walk.

494
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:23,838
Should I come along?

495
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,756
I'd like that.

496
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,385
Let's go, Gaehoon.

497
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,726
GGOMJIRAK BAR

498
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,154
Stop walking on eggshells around me.

499
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,406
It's a part of my job.
To catch the bad guys,

500
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,992
I beat them up
and get beaten up too in the process.

501
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,410
It's no big deal.

502
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,872
So who beat you up?

503
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,415
Hey!

504
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,168
Let's just drink.

505
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,722
Sejin, please stop. Okay?

506
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,724
Sejin, please stop.

507
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,436
Han Sejin.

508
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,355
Isn't that Dongnam?

509
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,357
Yes, it is.

510
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,402
Dongnam, I called you,
but you didn't pick up.

511
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,112
What's going on? Are you guys drinking?

512
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,322
Join us for a drink.

513
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,493
I'll go first then.
Have a quick drink and come home.

514
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,869
Jeez.

515
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
Why don't you join us
for a drink too, ma'am?

516
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,665
Ma'am, it's been so long.

517
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,709
-One more glass, please.
-Okay.

518
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,422
Someone was found dead.

519
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,300
You shouldn't be sitting around
and drinking here.

520
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,595
The detectives are taking over from here,
so it doesn't matter.

521
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,140
But how is that people keep dropping dead?

522
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,060
Tell me about it.

523
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,067
But he deserved to die.

524
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,029
-What?
-He was a stalker.

525
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,658
He was a bad guy, you know?

526
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,285
Do you know who killed him?

527
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,703
How would we know that?

528
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,123
Oh, come on. You're the police.

529
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,543
But don't you have possible suspects?

530
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,710
Who?

531
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,631
Of course, Eun Gyehoon or the stew place.

532
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,132
What?

533
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,134
That's ridiculous.

534
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,803
Stop spewing nonsense. Got it?

535
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,012
He didn't say anything wrong.

536
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,435
The refrigerator that the stalker was in
belongs to Eun Gyehoon.

537
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,937
The stew place is suspicious too.

538
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,190
It's understandable they'd want
to kill him since he was stalking Dahyun.

539
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,776
Those ladies always
carry around tools to begin with.

540
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,320
He didn't say anything wrong.

541
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,947
That's enough, sir.

542
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,199
Okay?

543
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,910
We did the same thing 18 years ago.

544
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,329
We kept doubting each other
over and over again.

545
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,539
Do you want that again?

546
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,166
Of course you don't.

547
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,086
You. Watch your mouth.

548
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,713
Jeez, okay.

549
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,135
Looking back to that time 18 years ago…

550
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,847
Only Dongsook was happy.

551
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,559
What do you mean?

552
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,770
We were all considered potential suspects.

553
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,899
Dongnam was the only one
with a solid alibi. Right?

554
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,069
Because he was
living in the countryside for work.

555
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,574
I barely remember it.

556
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,711
Since I had a drink, I'll get going.
Don't drink too much.

557
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,686
My goodness.

558
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,148
What were they rambling on?

559
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,401
They talk so much.

560
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,490
What do they even know?

561
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,826
They talk so much. So annoying.

562
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,205
Did you drink a lot?

563
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,458
They were so ridiculous.

564
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,168
What are you talking about?

565
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,961
Did you hear what they said?

566
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,255
They said, I must've been happy

567
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,883
since you weren't in Jihwa-dong
when Eun Gyeyoung went missing.

568
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,718
What about it?

569
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,182
You were in Jihwa-dong that day.

570
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,443
I'm your wife.

571
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,071
I can tell
just by smelling the air in the house

572
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,532
whether you've been home or not.

573
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,617
What is it that you want to say?

574
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,620
You've been drinking every day
ever since Eun Gyehoon returned.

575
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,499
You had never been this pathetic.
You hadn't totally given up like this.

576
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,376
You keep drinking every day

577
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,337
and saying nonsense to yourself.

578
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,223
I… am your wife.

579
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,891
I'm on your side.

580
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,103
So tell me.

581
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,689
Just tell me everything. I'll help you.

582
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,485
You'll help me?

583
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,738
I'll be understanding of everything.

584
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,905
Really?

585
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,616
Will you still understand and help me…

586
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,245
even if I killed someone?

587
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,168
Yes.

588
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,627
I…

589
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,298
do have a big worry.

590
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,009
It's just one matter.

591
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,721
It doesn't go away

592
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,767
and keeps lingering in front of me.
That thing.

593
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,644
What is it?

594
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,442
It's right behind you.

595
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,554
What was she trying to tell me?

596
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,970
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

597
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,638
A drink?

598
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,100
I'll wait for you downstairs. Come down.

599
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,037
Dahyun.

600
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,374
-Yes, Grandma?
-Come here for a second.

601
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,792
What's wrong?

602
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,221
No matter what your mom says,
try to be understanding.

603
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,890
Okay?

604
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,861
Why aren't we just drinking
at home or at our restaurant?

605
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,404
I'm trying to set the mood.

606
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,659
The owner lets you drink as long
as you want if there are no customers

607
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,036
and leaves the place to you.

608
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,288
It's nice and quiet.

609
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,960
-A soju and beer mix?
-Sure, sounds good.

610
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,767
Once you taste this,

611
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,520
you'll never be satisfied
with anyone else's mix, you know?

612
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,649
I guess you've never tasted mine.
Mine's great too.

613
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,525
It's not something to be proud of.

614
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,571
It's not surprising. You take after me.

615
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,032
Of course, I take after you.

616
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,621
I can't believe you're all grown-up.

617
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,752
It's quite good.

618
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,798
I don't know about your cooking,
but your drink is quite good.

619
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,216
Don't be a smart mouth.

620
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,802
Feel free to drink as you wish.

621
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,804
Thank you. Good night.

622
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,391
-See?
-She is so cool.

623
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,116
I'll tell you

624
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,244
everything that happened
on that day 18 years ago.

625
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,084
I was much younger than you are now.

626
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,798
I became pregnant with you
and was living with your dad.

627
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,801
Those times…

628
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,346
were pure hell for me.

629
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:21,601
I somehow managed
to get away from your dad.

630
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,272
But I didn't have
an education or any skills.

631
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,442
I had a pathetic job

632
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,987
and no money. My life…

633
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,365
was so miserable.

634
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,163
You were

635
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,500
my source of hope

636
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,587
as well as despair.

637
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,424
Taking care of myself
was difficult enough.

638
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,386
You were so little,
and I didn't know how to provide for you

639
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,140
and protect you
from the dangers of this world.

640
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,519
I was getting exhausted little by little.

641
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,941
The day you went missing…

642
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,575
I didn't even realize that you were gone.

643
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,215
I'm home.

644
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,221
Are you sleeping already?

645
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,016
Dahyun, I'm leaving.

646
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,977
You brat,
aren't you going to say bye to me?

647
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,858
Where did she go so early in the morning?

648
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,236
I'M GOING TO WORK…

649
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,117
I'M GOING TO WORK. MAKE SURE YOU EAT

650
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,583
Dahyun, I'm home.

651
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,137
Dahyun!

652
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,097
Okay, teacher.

653
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,225
I'll call you back. Okay.

654
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,940
Excuse me, one second.

655
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,234
Yes? May I help you?

656
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,404
Have you seen my daughter Dahyun?

657
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,322
Is she at your house playing again?

658
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,741
No, she isn't. I haven't seen her.

659
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,785
She isn't there either?

660
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,744
Why?

661
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,747
Oh, no! Dahyun's missing too?

662
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,250
What do you mean?

663
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,003
Dr. Eun's daughter is missing too,
so it's total chaos.

664
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,546
The police and the neighbors

665
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,798
are all out looking for her,
so the whole town is empty.

666
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,008
You didn't know about it?

667
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,803
My goodness.

668
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,436
Mother, it's me.

669
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,023
Jungho, please find Dahyun for me.

670
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,524
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

671
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,700
Jungho, Dahyun is gone.

672
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:24,784
What?

673
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,163
What are you talking about?
What do you mean, Dahyun is gone?

674
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,665
Mother, I don't know what happened.

675
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,626
What do you mean, Dahyun is gone?

676
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,795
Dahyun.

677
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,051
Dahyun!

678
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,220
Dahyun.

679
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,473
Dahyun!

680
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:51,019
Dahyun.

681
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,020
Dahyun!

682
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:54,981
Dahyun!

683
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,275
Dahyun!

684
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,213
I was out of my mind
looking for you everywhere.

685
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,549
And a miracle happened.

686
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,719
I found you a lot sooner

687
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,639
than I had expected.

688
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,849
Do you remember?

689
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,060
The last memory I have

690
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,105
is after escaping from that place,

691
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,068
running together with Gyeyoung
holding hands.

692
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,529
We kept running and running,

693
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,825
but Gyeyoung's hand slipped through mine.

694
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,164
After that, I fell
after running as fast as I could.

695
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,584
But I have no memories
of what happened next.

696
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,753
When I found you,

697
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,257
you were lying on the ground.

698
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,759
And

699
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,346
you weren't alone.

700
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,739
Wake up.

701
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,161
Let's go home.

702
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,125
Dahyun! Oh, gosh!

703
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:40,962
Who the heck are you?

704
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,133
Get out of my way.

705
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,552
If you don't want to die.

706
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,636
Why are you doing this?

707
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,554
Out of my way.

708
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,472
Hey!

709
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,307
Damn it…

710
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,230
Dahyun.

711
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,608
Dahyun.

712
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,613
Dahyun.

713
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,115
Wake up, sweetie.

714
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,658
Oh, my daughter.

715
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,357
But

716
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,401
that person…

717
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,528
died.

718
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,281
I killed…

719
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,830
I killed a person.

720
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,344
My mom killed the culprit?

721
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,723
Then who killed Lee Jingeun?

722
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,601
There is more than one person.

723
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,936
What?

724
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,731
There is more than one person outside.

725
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,247
There was more than one person.

726
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,462
What about Eun Gyeyoung?

727
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,300
What happened to Eun Gyeyoung?

728
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,445
When will you stop following me around?

729
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,499
Please help me.

730
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,125
What?

731
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,045
Sir, please help me.

732
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,842
Seriously, when will you
stop following me around?

733
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,695
I'll head out first.

734
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,034
Don't worry. I'll go home
after taking a walk.

735
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,598
Noh Dahyun.

736
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:17,947
I wonder if she is okay.

737
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,725
There is more than one person.

738
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,837
There is more than one person outside.

739
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,634
LINK

740
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,553
Tell me you didn't do it.

741
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,470
I'm sorry.

742
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,680
Why?

743
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:07,765
You shouldn't have remembered.

744
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,352
If I turned myself in,
we could've found her too.

745
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,272
If you're going to justify your actions
on the pretext of motherly love,

746
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,940
I don't want to hear it.

747
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,152
I want you to live forever
with regret and guilt.

748
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,779
It was wise to leave this place.

749
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,781
Coming back was the worst decision ever.

750
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,450
Then what about Dahyun?

751
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,202
I can't break up with you.

752
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,165
But I can't hold onto you either,
even if you break up with me.

753
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,587
