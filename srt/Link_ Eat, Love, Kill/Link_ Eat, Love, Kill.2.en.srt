2
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,679
All right.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,893
He has an amazing talent.

4
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,561
Let's find out.

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,022
He just needs to lift it up.

6
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,232
Will he manage?

7
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,359
How amazing!

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
EXCLUSIVE!
FASCINATING WORLD

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,913
Talent shows and tricks
were popular back in the day.

10
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,166
Some were truly talented and eccentric.

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,627
But there were also scammers

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,796
who brazenly lied in front of the cameras.

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,216
How long have you two
been living together?

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,637
Next up are an adorable set of twins.

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,971
Please come to the stage!

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,897
I heard that you guys are telepathic.

17
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,733
It's not telepathy.

18
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,944
He-- I mean, my brother

19
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,863
can feel exactly what I feel.

20
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,157
I see. Give me an example.

21
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,245
If I'm afraid or in pain,

22
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,831
he's also afraid or in pain.

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,458
It doesn't happen all the time.
It comes and goes.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,296
Can you prove that you're special?

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,049
-Not really--
-Yes, we can.

26
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,719
Our father, an overly eager man,

27
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,889
turned us into eccentric twins.

28
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,478
Twin telepathy?

29
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,773
Stop teasing us.
You don't have that superpower.

30
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,192
-That's not a superpower.
-Stop it.

31
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,318
I don't want to.

32
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,572
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

33
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,495
I don't need it.

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,122
I wish I never had it.

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,375
Why do you say that?

36
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,003
I'm pretty jealous.

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,048
There must be a good reason…

38
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,304
for your abilities.

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,724
No.

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,143
There was no reason, Father.

41
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,941
-All I could do was feel.
-Gyeyoung.

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,402
-I couldn't do anything.
-Gyeyoung.

43
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,237
Gyeyoung!

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,793
So what use was this ability?

45
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,435
Hello?

46
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,395
Hello--

47
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,145
Jeez.

48
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,109
About that woman from the restaurant…

49
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,654
-I'll come back another time. Bye.
-What? Tell me your address.

50
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,739
-Hello.
-Wait.

51
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,992
You two may be questioned…

52
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,159
Do you think she's okay?

53
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,121
I'm not sure.
But she'll come back if she isn't.

54
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,876
Ma'am.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,712
Right. Probably.

56
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,549
Back then,

57
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,720
we had no idea whom we had sent.

58
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,432
And I bet he has no idea

59
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,892
what's in that fridge either.

60
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,231
Because we never thought

61
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,109
he'd take our fridge.

62
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,498
ROSE RESTAURANT

63
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,375
Hello.

64
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,835
Can I help you?

65
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,211
Well…

66
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,673
Is everything okay?

67
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,970
I'd like to ask you the same.
Are you okay?

68
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,055
Sorry?

69
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,389
Of course.

70
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,308
I'm fine.

71
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,853
I'm totally fine.

72
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,646
Don't be ridiculous.

73
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,732
I'm jobless
and have nothing to worry about.

74
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,776
You look pretty concerned about something.

75
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,197
You see, I was just passing by

76
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,866
and thought I should say hi.

77
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,493
We were never close enough to say hi.

78
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,121
-And I wondered if you had dinner already.
-When were you so interested in my dinner?

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,376
That's why I came.

80
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,462
I simply came to say hi
and see if everything was fine.

81
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,553
You came to say hi at 2:30 a.m.?

82
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,264
What a great question.

83
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,559
-Shouldn't you be clocking out?
-That's also a great question.

84
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm going to. We were just about to leave.

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,026
Wait.

86
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,532
What did you have for dinner?

87
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,200
What am I saying?

88
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,454
-Gimbap.
-I had jjajang ramyeon.

89
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
What am I talking about?

90
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,211
What did you have for lunch?

91
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,005
What's wrong with me?

92
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,551
For lunch, I had…

93
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,014
Let's be honest now.

94
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,686
-About what?
-You know you're being very suspicious.

95
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,104
Am I?

96
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,359
You're talking nonsense.
Your face is pale, and you're sweating.

97
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,945
Your hands are trembling,
and your mouth is dry.

98
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,615
Why did you come here?

99
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,118
You see…

100
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,704
I…

101
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,041
Did something…

102
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,503
happen a while ago?

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,052
Don't look back.

104
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,763
Look here! Look at me!

105
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,274
What should I do now?

106
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,985
What are you doing?

107
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,320
I like you.

108
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,283
What am I spewing?

109
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,995
I like you.

110
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,043
LIES

111
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,632
You look glum.

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,512
When someone tells me
that they like me, I feel happy.

113
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,721
Not you?

114
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,348
No.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,766
I see.

116
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,229
What if…

117
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,813
Just what if…

118
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,068
there's a 0.1% chance that it's her?

119
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,030
-Then what should I do?
-What do you mean?

120
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,032
Your Wi-Fi?

121
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,493
No.

122
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,163
That she's my sister, Gyeyoung.

123
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,671
EPISODE 2

124
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,720
SIMMER ON LOW HEAT FOR TWO MINUTES!

125
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,413
HOW DOES THEIR TELEPATHY WORK?

126
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,893
Hi, son.

127
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,525
Didn't I tell you not to skip your meals?

128
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,527
Nagging me already?

129
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,112
You're making me do it.

130
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,035
What should I do? I love hearing you nag.

131
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,580
I'll get it ready soon, so come and eat.

132
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,348
Look here! I like you.

133
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,146
Are you insane?
Why would you let him take the fridge?

134
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,606
Do you want a loudspeaker?

135
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,191
Trying to let all the neighbors know?

136
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,193
This is driving me crazy.

137
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,029
This is driving me nuts.

138
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,825
Here comes our heroine.

139
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,455
You must've encouraged him
to take it, didn't you?

140
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,375
What could I do? It was his to begin with.

141
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,044
Not anymore if he had thrown it away.

142
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,712
You're making no sense.

143
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,255
It doesn't matter if it does or not.

144
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,758
Have you already forgotten
what's inside that fridge?

145
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,594
Then what? He would've suspected me
had I stopped him.

146
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,263
You should've carried it
on your back and run away!

147
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,474
-Can you carry it on your back?
-Why not?

148
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,726
-You're ridiculous.
-What did you say?

149
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,522
Why did you have to put
that thing in there?

150
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,982
You caused all of this, you know?

151
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,026
I know that. I'm the one to blame. Happy?

152
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,361
You little--

153
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,863
Code zero.
They're at the nearby intersection…

154
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,324
I don't want to hear it.
What's your plan now?

155
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,826
I'll have to get it back.

156
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,161
Exactly how?

157
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,123
I'll have to think about it first.
Leave it up to me.

158
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,624
Grandma, leave it up to me.

159
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,963
What can you do on your own?

160
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,550
It doesn't matter.
I did this, so it's my responsibility.

161
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,136
Don't be ridiculous.
This is no longer about you.

162
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,763
I need to take care of this, not you.
Remember that.

163
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,599
-Grandma.
-Mom?

164
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,271
Mom!

165
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,735
Mom!

166
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,996
-What should we do?
-Let's just go!

167
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,539
-Wait!
-Hurry!

168
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,347
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

169
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,851
Go!

170
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,317
CHURCH OF GOD'S WAY

171
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,866
Charlie Chaplin once said

172
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,869
that life was a comedy
when seen from afar.

173
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,413
He also said

174
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,874
that when seen up-close,

175
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,503
life was a tragedy.

176
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,409
It smells nice.

177
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,039
It feels like yesterday
was just a nightmare.

178
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,167
What will you do now?

179
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,794
We'll get it back at all costs.

180
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,921
When?

181
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,923
Tonight.

182
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,507
What if he opens it before then?

183
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,179
I'll stop him even if it means
I'll have to chop his wrists off.

184
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,097
And if he still opens it?

185
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,395
-I'll make sure he doesn't tell anyone.
-Shouldn't you chop its head?

186
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,857
Yes. I should.

187
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,525
Chop the head off.

188
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,034
My god!

189
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,162
Why were you standing there
without saying anything?

190
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,914
Don't shout at her.

191
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,333
Her mind is troubled enough already.

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,963
Why are you staring at me?

193
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,007
Did you…

194
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,053
and Grandma…

195
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,224
go through something similar in the past?

196
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,900
Come on. Why are you still in here?

197
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,903
-What?
-Hurry up.

198
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,029
What is it?

199
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,157
This is a high-tech surveillance camera.

200
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,285
Infrared rays with two million pixels.

201
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,747
It'll cover almost
all the nooks and crannies.

202
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,457
Everything that it records

203
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,836
will be sent
to the control tower in real-time.

204
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,546
-Twenty-four hours a day.
-Real-time…

205
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,715
-It'll be monitored.
-Twenty-four hours…

206
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,882
Any questions?

207
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,973
When will it start recording?

208
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,143
As soon as it gets installed.

209
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,104
They just had to be a day late.

210
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,484
What are you getting at? Tell me.

211
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,575
She means we could've caught
who broke the window.

212
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,420
What?

213
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,423
It wasn't locked.

214
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,633
Thank you.

215
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,638
Gyehoon, they'll replace the glass today.

216
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,849
That's a relief.

217
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,559
Gyehoon, did you see her?

218
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,353
I did.

219
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,315
She couldn't even look at you.

220
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,027
Confessing to you must've made her shy.
She doesn't look the type, though.

221
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,738
Maybe that's why.

222
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,949
Or…

223
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:56,909
Or?

224
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,794
-Tell me.
-Okay.

225
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,588
Does she look sane to you?

226
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,674
-Hello, they're under construction.
-Hey.

227
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:21,975
Mom!

228
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,685
No, she doesn't.

229
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,565
I thought so too.

230
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,278
This looks good.

231
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,158
This is pretty fresh.

232
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,993
Sir, did you make this yourself?

233
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,662
Of course, I did.

234
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,249
GOBLIN UNDERWEAR
3 FOR 10,000 WON

235
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,626
Bye. I think you could cook this
for five more minutes.

236
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,587
That shop over there--

237
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,846
Nice to meet you.

238
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,347
Same here.

239
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,308
Hello.

240
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,980
I was going to invite you guys
to our restaurant.

241
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,939
Right.

242
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,275
-Us?
-Why…

243
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,985
I wanted to cook for you.

244
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,864
We're pretty much family
since we live so close. Right?

245
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,157
No, I don't think so.

246
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,867
Right. I agree.

247
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,497
Then how about today?

248
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,208
-Let's have a welcoming party.
-Thank you but--

249
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,877
Come if you're thankful.

250
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,089
I have a busy schedule today so--

251
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,759
Come on. Life doesn't always go our way.

252
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,721
Things suddenly come up at times.

253
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,347
Maybe next time--

254
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,684
There's no guarantee there will be
a next time for an old lady like me.

255
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,312
She's right. What time suits you?

256
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,067
-How about 1 o'clock--
-See you at 11:30.

257
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,914
What will you do when they come?

258
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,041
I'll prevent them
from opening that fridge.

259
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,959
They're the ones who stole our fridge.

260
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,669
It wasn't ours to begin with.

261
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,504
They said to keep our enemies closer.

262
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,050
They're not our enemies.
It's the other way around.

263
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,719
Who are you talking about?

264
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,638
-Someone.
-Someone.

265
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,316
Can you debone two of these?

266
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,654
CLOSED FOR LUNCHTIME

267
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,249
We just prepared
what we normally eat. Dig in.

268
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,180
What's your drink of choice? Makgeolli?

269
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,975
-Or soju and beer?
-I'm good. Thank you.

270
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,979
Come on. It's okay.
Let's have a drink together.

271
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,065
Let's just close
our restaurants for the day.

272
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,279
We'll make them drink so much
that they'll pass out

273
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,114
and leave the fridge unattended.

274
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,448
JIMYUNG MAKGEOLLI

275
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,953
Then this?

276
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,205
I see.

277
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,835
What's wrong? This is just…

278
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,630
We don't need to drink.

279
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,590
This is a fail.

280
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:47,264
All the residents in this neighborhood
treat each other like family.

281
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,310
We step in and look after
each other's business.

282
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,478
We know each other's passcode.

283
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,355
We share keys too.

284
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,028
Are you asking me
to hand over the keys to my restaurant

285
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,197
and tell you the passcode?

286
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,204
-Don't be ridiculous.
-This is a fail too.

287
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,168
They do it all the time online.

288
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,670
Bartering.

289
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,548
-Exchanging items.
-Right, that's the one.

290
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,134
It'd be nice to exchange goods

291
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,929
that you have plenty of
or sell something you don't need.

292
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,265
We have many plates.

293
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,726
We have two fans too. Do you want one?

294
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,354
Right. We need a new fridge too.

295
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,441
I wonder if I can get one secondhand.

296
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,863
So you want me to sell my fridge.

297
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,701
I never said that.

298
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,954
I wasn't directly asking you for a fridge.

299
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,207
This is also a fail.

300
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,960
I heard you're a famous chef.

301
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,754
How's our food?

302
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,173
Yes, evaluate our dishes.

303
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,636
Well…

304
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,976
The meat still smells.

305
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,479
The dried radish greens are limp.

306
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,482
-This is tasteless.
-What? Is it bland?

307
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,067
No, I don't taste anything.

308
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,277
Fried food can't be this soggy.

309
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,405
This mushroom pancake is
almost like coffee.

310
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,532
It's bitter, sweet, sour,

311
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,659
and salty as well.

312
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,787
Fascinating.

313
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,582
Your choice of ingredients,
storing method, and cooking skills

314
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,043
are all just terrible.

315
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,878
Then don't eat--

316
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,132
Everything is a fail today.

317
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,220
Going out to eat?

318
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,139
Me? Yes. Why?

319
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,891
You're going to Choonok Stew, right?
You're a regular.

320
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,477
Why are you tagging along?
I thought you didn't like their dishes.

321
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,188
Come on. I can't always eat what I want.

322
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,774
I also need to speak with them.

323
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,651
You do?

324
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,161
Come on. You better not pee there.

325
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,259
What?

326
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,510
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

327
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,887
Are they closed today?

328
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,600
This is sour?

329
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,149
Are you not open?

330
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,486
-Hello.
-Yes, we are. Come in.

331
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,570
Sit here.

332
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,989
-We're done eating.
-No, you're not.

333
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,741
Hello.

334
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,050
Did you get home safe last night?

335
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,971
Me?

336
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,519
-Yes.
-Yes. Of course.

337
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,981
It's a bit late to ask,
but why did you visit us last night?

338
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,733
Do you mind me asking?

339
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,859
She came to us?

340
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,699
You must have a lot of free time.

341
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,285
Why would you worry about her
when she's just fine?

342
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,457
Someone that's fine wouldn't visit
the police in the middle of the night.

343
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,708
That's common sense.

344
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,338
And victims aren't the only ones
who come to the police.

345
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,506
Perpetrators come too.

346
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,719
Then shall we finally have a talk?

347
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,098
I…

348
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,519
I'm sorry, but I have to be somewhere.

349
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,981
There's someone I agreed to meet,
and it's…

350
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,232
Well…

351
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,361
You have business with me.

352
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,365
I was first, so…

353
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,330
Did you hear him? I'm a bit busy.

354
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,082
All right.

355
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,989
By the way, who was that guy?

356
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,074
He looked familiar.

357
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,200
Beats me.

358
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,287
He's apparently a famous chef.
But who knows?

359
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,748
-Really?
-Yes. He's incredible.

360
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,626
He tasted bitter, sweet, sour, and salty

361
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,044
all in this one food.

362
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,671
He sure is incredible. Try some yourself.

363
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,008
Bitter, sweet, sour, salty…

364
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,639
-I think they're out to get her.
-I can't hear you.

365
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,766
-They're out to get her.
-I said I couldn't hear you.

366
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,142
I think the police are after her.

367
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,894
That's not true.

368
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,355
I need to go to the toilet.

369
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,866
Are you okay?

370
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,452
Of course, I am.

371
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,373
You don't even know what I'm asking about,
so how could you say that?

372
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,668
That's because

373
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,587
I'm really fine about everything.

374
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,843
Excuse me.

375
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,017
Mom!

376
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,286
What's wrong with me?

377
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,540
You're not okay.

378
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,084
Sorry?

379
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,671
What happened…

380
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,258
last night?

381
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,302
I said nothing happened.

382
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,847
Who did this to you?

383
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,351
-Answer me.
-Why do you care?

384
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,437
Because I do! So who did this?

385
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,154
Let me take a look.

386
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,408
-Does it hurt?
-My arm is okay.

387
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,578
You're in a lot of pain
for this to just be a bruise.

388
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,374
Let's take a CT scan
and see if you have any fractures.

389
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,795
JOINT CENTER

390
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,869
I'm only saying this
in case you're worried.

391
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,247
I only have a mild fracture,
and it'll heal in a month or two.

392
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,540
So don't worry.

393
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,667
That means it'll take eight weeks to heal.

394
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,170
That's a serious injury.
You shouldn't take it lightly.

395
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,133
I won't ask who he is.
Just end it with him.

396
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,303
If it's your boyfriend, break up.

397
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,763
If it's a family member,

398
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,765
move out.

399
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,268
Who in the world is he?

400
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,522
Didn't you say you wouldn't ask?

401
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,399
Report him.

402
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,692
There's nothing to report.

403
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,112
Someone once said
people lie three times a day.

404
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,572
Another psychologist claimed

405
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,991
people lie 200 times a day.

406
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,328
I'm guessing that's including
the lies you tell yourself.

407
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,746
That many?

408
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,623
The average number doesn't matter.

409
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,669
One thing for sure is that
you're well above the average.

410
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,504
Everything you say is a lie.

411
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,173
I don't lie all the time.

412
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,218
And even if I did,
I must have a good reason for it.

413
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,555
But if that reason hurts you like this…

414
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,601
don't just take it.

415
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,562
Ask someone for help.

416
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,191
You can even ask me.

417
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,075
How long have you lived in Jihwa-dong?

418
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,785
Since I was little.

419
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,996
-Exactly how little?
-Are you interrogating me?

420
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,458
I'm just curious.

421
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,086
I don't remember.

422
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,840
Why can't you remember?
What's your earliest memory?

423
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,384
Why are you asking these questions?

424
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,013
You said you liked me.

425
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,515
Shouldn't you be happy
that I'm interested in you?

426
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,810
Yes, I am happy.

427
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,812
I'm getting butterflies.

428
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,356
All you do is lie.

429
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,777
Let me ask you something.

430
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,573
If you were attacked

431
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,161
by someone like I was,

432
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,413
what would you do?

433
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,248
Let's say it was someone close to me.

434
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,419
If this happened to my younger sister,

435
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,631
that attacker

436
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,966
would've died by my hands.

437
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,318
I've been having
the same nightmare ever since that day.

438
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,954
The weather is lovely.

439
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,636
It became harder and harder
to retrieve the fridge.

440
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,817
But thankfully

441
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,945
and strangely enough,

442
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,407
they haven't opened the fridge yet.

443
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,786
PROS OF TURNING YOURSELF IN

444
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,330
REDUCED SENTENCE?

445
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,539
PUNISHMENT FOR CHANGING TESTIMONY

446
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,708
LENIENCY FOR TURNING YOURSELF IN

447
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,503
PRISONER'S DILEMMA THEORY

448
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,254
EVERYTHING ABOUT TURNING YOURSELF IN

449
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,179
It's only a matter of time
until they find out.

450
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,584
HWA PATROL UNIT

451
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,674
Hello?

452
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,760
Delivery?

453
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,599
You see, I moved.

454
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,685
Yes.

455
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,646
Okay, I'll go pick it up.

456
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,356
Thank you.

457
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,441
She came back again.

458
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,112
Yesterday, and the day before too.

459
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
Why did you join the police?

460
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,840
To make ends meet.

461
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,217
Did you come here
because you knew I was here?

462
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,679
I would've never become a police officer
had I known I'd come here.

463
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,556
You're good at offending others.

464
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,228
Wait. I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

465
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,314
I wasn't trying to offend you.

466
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,859
I don't regret our past

467
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,528
or dislike seeing you again--

468
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,280
Forget it. Just stop talking.

469
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,573
Okay.

470
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,783
I'm your superior.

471
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,870
Answer me if you understand.

472
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,496
Yes, ma'am.

473
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,003
What is that? Whatever.

474
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,046
Oh, come on.

475
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,089
-No, thanks.
-I'm hungry.

476
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,758
-What do you want to eat?
-Pasta.

477
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,760
I knew it. I bought some already.

478
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,845
-Really?
-Yes.

479
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,305
No way.

480
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,704
Look.

481
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,419
Back then--

482
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,340
Geumdo Villa, Mangwon-dong.

483
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,509
People have reported
a foul smell from there.

484
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,427
Tell him we'll go.
We're probably the closest.

485
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,513
Which unit is available?

486
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,265
This is patrol 11. We'll go.

487
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,130
Are you the one who sent them?

488
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,798
You didn't like them?

489
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,759
I was really curious

490
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,595
why you kept throwing them away.

491
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,743
-I can't believe this.
-Me neither.

492
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,870
There's been a murder.

493
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,039
-Goodness.
-Unbelievable.

494
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,674
By the way, where do you live?

495
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,260
Do we live in the same neighborhood?

496
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,388
That one.

497
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,479
I live on the third floor.
The one with the white curtains.

498
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,857
I see.

499
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:35,331
GEUMDO VILLA

500
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,589
They're coming out!

501
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,097
Excuse me.

502
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,740
Where are you going?

503
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,576
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

504
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,958
Is Ms. Noh here?

505
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,877
Dahyun?

506
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,129
Dating abuse, domestic abuse,

507
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,089
stalking, and revenge porn.

508
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,758
The number of abuse cases against women

509
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,594
has been increasing every year.

510
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,722
A man in his thirties, who had fled

511
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,933
after murdering a restaurant owner,
was apprehended yesterday.

512
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,144
The police found out that the perpetrator

513
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,022
had stalked his victim since last July.

514
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,316
At the time, the perpetrator was given

515
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,110
a restraining order to stay
at least 100 m away from her.

516
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,446
He was also banned
from contacting the victim

517
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,616
and was warned about stalking her.

518
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,743
About 30% of murder cases

519
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,453
and 20% of sexual assaults against women

520
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,331
are reported to have started off
with stalking.

521
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,084
The women could file
for a restraining order.

522
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,421
But would a 100m restraining order

523
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,964
truly keep them safe?

524
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,467
It'll only take 20 seconds
for the perpetrator to reach them.

525
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,720
And the perpetrator will only be fined
for breaking the restraining order.

526
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,600
Dahyun?

527
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,395
She could be at the coffee shop
near the main road.

528
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,272
She goes there once in a while.

529
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,995
What am I doing?

530
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,923
Ms. Noh.

531
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,636
-Are you okay?
-Sorry?

532
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,431
I mean…

533
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,560
It was a simple greeting.

534
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,186
I was wondering how you were doing.

535
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,315
Yes, I'm fine.

536
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,276
Because I survived.

537
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:00,911
I was…

538
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,747
a survivor.

539
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,753
I came out alive.

540
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,472
I'll take care of the rest.
You should go wash up.

541
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,224
Make me some coffee.

542
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,771
What is this…

543
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,690
Hey.

544
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,444
-What is this smell?
-It's the smell of a rotting body.

545
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,698
Can you please take a shower, Minjo?

546
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,117
Jeez. How could a woman--

547
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,706
Go.

548
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,541
-Take those out of your nostrils!
-Come on.

549
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,087
Officer Ji, how was it?
It was your first time seeing a body.

550
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,964
I almost died, sir.

551
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,884
Good work.

552
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,771
It seems to have been quite a while
since it rotted. Stay outside.

553
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,898
I'm okay, ma'am.

554
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,692
Seeing a decaying body is tough.
It's your first time.

555
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,069
I'm really fine.

556
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,563
Is this instant coffee?

557
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,232
Enjoy.

558
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,530
Here you go.

559
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,865
Thanks.

560
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,287
Here you go.

561
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:12,292
Look at this. I haven't been served coffee
in a very long time.

562
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,338
Nowadays, my subordinates
don't make me any coffee.

563
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:20,342
They're so heartless and indifferent
toward those older than them.

564
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,262
I bet Confucius and Mencius
are turning in their graves.

565
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,306
But they're Chinese, and we're Korean.

566
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,644
Thanks, my dear rookie.

567
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,646
Be careful, sir.

568
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,277
What if I put poison in there?

569
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,162
That was a blood-chilling joke.

570
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,957
Anyway, thank you.

571
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,927
Mom.

572
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,475
Mom?

573
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,685
Grandma.

574
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,397
Where are they?

575
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,166
BANKBOOK

576
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,044
To Noh Dahyun, my beloved daughter.

577
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,006
I've never written you a letter before.

578
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,675
So I'm sorry that this first letter
has to be like this.

579
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,055
But I hope you won't be sad.

580
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,474
I'm…

581
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,392
going to turn myself in.

582
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,897
I was the one who killed
that scumbag in the fridge.

583
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,441
I put him in there single-handedly.

584
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,361
So I am solely responsible.

585
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,615
Don't worry about me
and live a good life with Grandma.

586
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,328
I do have one favor.

587
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,792
I hope

588
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,212
you will live a better life

589
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,590
-than I have.
-Are you serious?

590
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,058
I'd also like to make this clear.

591
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
Don't be sorry.

592
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,982
Don't forget

593
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,987
that one worry for you
means a thousand more for me.

594
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,030
I LOVE YOU, MOM
THANK YOU FOR RAISING ME

595
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,365
Done.

596
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,617
Thank you for raising me.

597
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,910
I love you, Grandma.

598
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,413
My baby.

599
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,833
I love you so much.

600
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,501
What's wrong? You can fold this.

601
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,045
Who folds their school uniform?

602
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,381
I can't believe
she'll be in middle school.

603
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,552
Let's take another one. One, two, three.

604
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:12,222
It's my first time wearing this. My baby.

605
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,016
Thank you so much

606
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,311
for being my daughter.

607
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,647
I hope you know that.

608
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:26,236
I will always love and adore you.

609
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,448
Love, Mom.

610
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,451
Hong Bokhee.

611
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,333
SAFE JIHWA, RELIABLE POLICE

612
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,837
How may I help you?

613
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,464
You killed whom?

614
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,300
Whom did you kill, ma'am?

615
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,343
Mom?

616
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,136
Goodness.

617
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,930
Why are you here?

618
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,766
Have you gone insane?

619
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,725
Why are you here?

620
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,394
This has nothing to do with you. Go home.

621
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,063
Mom.

622
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,814
Didn't you hear me?

623
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,527
Please calm down, both of you.
Please continue what you were saying.

624
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,405
You said you killed someone.

625
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,531
Yes, I did.

626
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,661
I killed that man.

627
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,998
So exactly who are you talking about?

628
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,210
Sorry? He's…

629
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,337
He's…

630
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,799
So… I…

631
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,718
My father.

632
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:35,931
She…

633
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,433
killed my father.

634
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,068
The sound of his beating her
is still so vivid.

635
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,572
You can't relate, can you?

636
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:58,203
Even after all these years,
I still can't forget it.

637
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,582
I'll remember it until the day I die.

638
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,960
It's so vivid.

639
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,421
She's been dreaming

640
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,133
of killing him every night.

641
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,635
And in the morning,

642
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,721
she'd say

643
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,223
that she had killed him.

644
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,602
But he died ages ago.

645
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,564
She still dreamed of getting beaten.

646
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,732
She wanted to survive.

647
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,654
I know you're out of it,
but this isn't right, Mom!

648
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,449
You're just dreaming!

649
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,326
Please don't do this. Mom.

650
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,204
Don't do this!

651
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,499
Is it Alzheimer's?

652
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,754
Mom.

653
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,383
Grandma.

654
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,052
Dahyun.

655
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,011
Dahyun.

656
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:11,943
Are you insane?

657
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,572
Why would you turn yourself in?

658
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,990
Then what about you?

659
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,410
You were going to do the same.
Why did you do that?

660
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,913
Were you really going to?

661
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,122
What choice did I have?

662
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,208
They were bound to find out.
I had to save her.

663
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,336
She still has so much to look forward to.

664
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,712
So I should be the one.

665
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,464
That's why I went.

666
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,342
Not you, Mom!

667
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,260
I won't be able to live if you go!

668
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,720
Bokhee.

669
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,555
Neither of you is going.

670
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,934
No. None of us are going.

671
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,811
I won't allow it.

672
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,773
I did nothing wrong.

673
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,610
Grandma… I'm the victim here.

674
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,073
I thought long and hard.

675
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,034
Even if I went back in time, I would…

676
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,079
No!

677
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,914
Mom!

678
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,961
I'll strive to survive.

679
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,133
And if my only choice is by killing him,

680
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,885
I will do it again.

681
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,930
So let's not give up.

682
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,268
Okay? Let's find a way to stay together.

683
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,729
Okay. Let's do that.

684
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,870
It's okay.

685
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,456
-It's okay.
-Of course, it's okay.

686
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,543
-It's okay.
-I'm okay too.

687
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,545
I'm okay.

688
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,843
It's okay.

689
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,738
All right, then.

690
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,489
What do we do now?

691
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,378
If push comes to shove, we'll have to…

692
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,131
kill him.

693
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,773
You guys can't take a joke, can you?

694
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,153
Jeez, Mom.

695
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,571
Seriously, Grandma.

696
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,116
You're still so strong.

697
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,494
I'll look for a way.

698
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,415
I'll try to find out the passcode
or whatever to get the refrigerator back.

699
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,252
At all costs.

700
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,601
We're not open yet.

701
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,436
It's me.

702
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,447
What are you doing here so early?

703
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,285
What was that yesterday?

704
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,622
What do you mean?
It's exactly what I said.

705
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,418
Don't you know me? You can't fool me.

706
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,754
Come on. I'm not fooling anyone.

707
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,430
We'll open in a bit.

708
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,234
I'm also suspicious of that young chef.

709
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,446
He rented the restaurant downstairs
and even the floor above far in advance.

710
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,448
-The one above too?
-Yes.

711
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,074
But he left it vacant for a while.

712
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,952
He only moved in
three months into the contract.

713
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,872
What about the rent? Did he pay on time?

714
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:34,789
Yes.

715
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,584
He must be loaded.

716
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,463
MIJIN REAL ESTATE

717
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,019
-Goodness! Let me help.
-What?

718
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,645
-Let me help a neighbor out.
-It's okay.

719
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,481
-This is heavy.
-I'm surprisingly strong.

720
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,775
It runs in the family. Let me.

721
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,361
But you have a fracture. Give that back.

722
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,112
-Let me.
-I'm really okay.

723
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,324
-Give them to me.
-Don't worry and just come.

724
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,160
-But you're worrying me.
-No, I'm perfectly fine.

725
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,050
Do you want to exchange numbers?

726
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,677
We can do that as neighbors, right?

727
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,346
Does this restaurant have a number?

728
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,722
What is it? And your birthdays?

729
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,724
Mine is--

730
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,683
Don't tell her.

731
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,811
-Why not?
-Why not?

732
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,647
She's being suspicious.
Who knows what her motives are?

733
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,485
That's rich coming from you
who asked me where I used to live.

734
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,623
I'll tell you if you play
rock-paper-scissors with me.

735
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,420
What?

736
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,841
All right, fine.
You better keep your word.

737
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,596
Okay.

738
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,891
Rock-paper-scissors.

739
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,561
Rock-paper-scissors.

740
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,813
Rock-paper-scissors.

741
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,190
Rock-paper-scissors.

742
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,817
They look like fools.

743
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,528
Rock-paper-scissors.

744
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,865
Rock-paper-scissors.

745
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:37,036
It wasn't fun or fascinating.

746
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,581
It was just childish.

747
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:44,544
Our so-called superpower
had only turned us into a laughingstock.

748
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:49,174
Rock-paper-scissors.

749
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:54,304
Shoot. Shoot.

750
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,728
This can't prove anything.

751
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:04,814
But still…

752
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,237
No.

753
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,700
But now I know that I'm linked…

754
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,245
to you.

755
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,790
That's enough.

756
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,960
Yes. Please stop.

757
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,879
That was unbelievable.

758
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,423
We're both so competitive.
Neither of us lost.

759
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,218
The emotions I've been feeling all along

760
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,637
belonged to you.

761
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,306
So what's your number? Birthday?

762
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,354
MISSING CHILD
EUN GYEYOUNG, AGE 10

REPORTED MISSING BY EUN GYEHOON

764

MISSING PERSON DETAILS
NAME: EUN GYEYOUNG

RELATIONSHIP WITH MISSING: SIBLINGS

767
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,383
It's you, the famous chef.

768
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,721
Right. We met at Choonok Stew.

769
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,348
You have a good memory.

770
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,767
Goodbye, then.

771
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,102
The weather is lovely.

772
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,106
Right.

773
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,233
Why did you come back?

774
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,252
Why did you come back
to this neighborhood?

775
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,558
It's one of you!

776
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,812
One of you is the culprit!

777
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,415
They're in this neighborhood.

778
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,918
It's the truth.

779
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,070
Because rent was cheap.

780
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:41,864
That's why.

781
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,617
Is that so?

782
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,787
The rent…

783
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,456
is cheap indeed.

784
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,385
"Everyone lies."

785
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,056
Why are you eating in the dark?

786
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,520
How dare you come here?

787
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,565
Get out.

788
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,734
Get out this instant!

789
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,612
It's your fault.

790
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,075
It was you! You killed Gyeyoung.

791
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,745
You're the killer.

792
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,538
You should've died instead.

793
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,207
My poor Gyeyoung.

794
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,334
What will you do about her?

795
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,467
Mom… Dad…

796
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,099
My poor Gyeyoung.

797
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,729
Bring her back!

798
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,195
Not you.

799
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,655
My daughter.

800
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,491
Bring my baby back.

801
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:10,369
Bring back my dear Gyeyoung.

802
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,208
Bring her back! Bring my baby back!

803

"The most often said lie
among both men and women…

804
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,531
is this."

805
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,866
"It's…"

806
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,301
Gyehoon.

807
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,143
Are you okay?

808
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,121
Yes.

809
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,499
I'm okay.

810
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,503
"I'm okay."

811
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,756
THEY LIE AND SAY, "I'M OKAY."

812
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:49,552
"The most often said lie is,

813
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,804
'I'm okay.'"

814
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,182
-Are you okay?
-Of course, I am.

815
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:59,103
You don't even know what I'm asking about,
so how could you say that?

816
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,314
That's because…

817
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,233
I'm really fine about everything.

818
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,985
Yes, I'm fine.

819
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,780
It's okay.

820
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,782
It's okay.

821
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,870
Gyehoon, are you okay?

822
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:19,874
Yes.

823
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,418
I'm okay.

824
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,199
Let's try one at a time.

825
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,368
First, his birthday.

826
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:58,621
My birthday is…

827
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,585
What?

828
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,047
Gosh, that was easy.

829
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,698
Did you find what you were looking for?

830
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,334
All right.

831
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:30,963
What lie…

832
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,175
will she tell this time?

833
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,209
LINK

834
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,420
The body disappeared?

835
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,130
Either that guy moved it

836
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,882
or someone else did.

837
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:18,302
Or that body walked out alive.

838
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,888
Have you seen him before?

839
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,015
-Who is he?
-He's my younger brother.

840
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,683
I suddenly lost touch with him.

841
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,019
Why is she always anxious?

842
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,145
It's annoying.

843
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:31,941
You always manage to find me
when I'm feeling this way.

844
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,069
As if you know something.

845
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,530
Is that Wi-Fi girl from the stew place

846
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,990
really your long-lost sister?

847
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,910
Even if I mistake you for my sister

848
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:44,620
and treat you well,

849
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,747
don't be happy.

850
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,415
Never.

851
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,837
