2
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,945
Eun Gyeyoung?

3
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,366
Gyeyoung.

4
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,680
I wasn't a witness.

5
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,604
I was a victim just like she was.

6
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,580
Gyeyoung, hang in there, okay?

7
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,721
It was just me…

8
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,517
who got out of there.

9
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,563
I was the only survivor.

10
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,986
It was just me…

11
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,409
I'm sorry.

12
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,496
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,207
I'm sorry…

14
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,387
And you call yourself human?

15
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,640
Do you?

16
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,351
How could you do that to her? How?

17
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,564
How could you do that to her?

18
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,233
-How?
-Hold on.

19
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,778
There's something you need to know.
Your sister didn't make it out.

20
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,114
So how did Dahyun survive?

21
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,993
Hey, will you be okay?

22
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,414
Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.

23
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,541
Will you be okay with that?

24
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,971
That's enough.

25
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,558
Just tell me who ordered you
to bring Gyeyoung there.

26
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,185
Who was he?

27
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,396
The person…

28
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,858
The person you're looking for is…

29
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,403
It's just like then.

30
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,365
It feels unfamiliar and strange.

31
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,576
Did something

32
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,871
happen to Gyehoon?

33
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,522
STEW PLACE

34
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,748
The number you have dialed cannot--

35
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,664
STEW PLACE

36
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,881
Hello?

37
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,217
Where are you?
Do you know how many times I called?

38
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,427
Are you okay?

39
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,720
Why won't you answer me?

40
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,141
Give me some time to answer.

41
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,644
I was worried sick.

42
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,813
I'm sorry.
I had something to take care of.

43
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,148
What was it?

44
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,483
Don't worry and go home.

45
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,276
I'll call you back again.

46
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,569
Wait--

47
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,804
THE PREMONITION

48
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,099
EPISODE 12

49
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,103
You were blindsided by someone
while speaking to Lee Jingeun?

50
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,023
Yes. I was knocked unconscious
and just came to.

51
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,277
The both of them had disappeared by then.

52
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,863
Does Lee Jingeun have an accomplice?

53
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,949
That could be possible, but I think--

54
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,035
It could be the very person
I've been looking for.

55
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,371
No, I'm sure it was him.

56
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,582
I'll look around.

57
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,584
Let me help.

58
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,544
Don't bother. You're not well.

59
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,671
You won't be of any help in that state.

60
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,341
It's all my fault.

61
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,222
You're not the only one after him.
I am too.

62
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,766
I can't wait to catch him myself.

63
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,311
So, don't be sorry.

64
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,170
I thought something had happened to you.

65
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,840
I told you not to worry.

66
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,886
I felt something ominous.

67
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,222
It felt like
something had happened to you.

68
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,768
Is that so?

69
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,564
You were with Lee Jingeun, weren't you?

70
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,442
Yes.

71
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,780
You're insane.
Why would you follow him? He's dangerous.

72
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,615
You know he's not
in his right mind, right?

73
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,951
Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.

74
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,203
Will you be okay with that?

75
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,624
Are you listening to me?

76
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,584
Are you?

77
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,671
Yes.

78
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm sorry.

79
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,852
What's this?

80
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,231
It's all my fault.

81
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,024
If you apologize like that
out of the blue,

82
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,943
I don't know what to say.

83
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,654
I'm sorry.

84
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,585
Hey, Mom.

85
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,879
I told you not to worry.

86
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,007
I'm at the restaurant.

87
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,176
Okay. Bye.

88
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,475
I've been updating her
for the past hour at ten-minute intervals,

89
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,643
letting her know I'm safe.

90
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,231
An hour? You weren't home?

91
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,526
Well…

92
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,195
I was…

93
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,993
-What happened to your neck?
-What?

94
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,412
Well…

95
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,456
It's nothing.

96
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,584
Jingeun, that bastard.

97
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,045
I can't believe
he did the same thing to you.

98
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,922
Me neither.

99
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,390
Did he give you
the answer you were looking for?

100
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,602
Half of it.

101
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,855
I see.

102
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,401
It's raining.

103
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,869
Do you want a hot cup of tea?

104
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,663
Sure.

105
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,719
I need to tell him…

106
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,350
that I regained parts of my memory

107
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,102
and that

108
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,481
I was the only one who made it out alive.

109
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,234
I should apologize.

110
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,369
I need to tell her

111
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,247
that she was a victim
just like Gyeyoung was

112
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,083
and that she was hurt.

113
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,335
Also,

114
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,297
I need her to know
that I don't want her to get hurt.

115
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,555
Here you go.

116
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,989
-Look. Gyehoon--
-Dahyun.

117
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,369
I'm a bit tired today.

118
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,914
Can we talk tomorrow?

119
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,961
Okay. Sure.

120
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,213
Tomorrow sounds good.

121
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,316
I can't believe
we don't have any umbrellas.

122
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,651
I live right across the street.

123
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,032
Let's run across together.

124
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,451
You don't need to come with me.

125
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,410
Bye.

126
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,014
I'm sorry.

127
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,727
I'm sorry, Gyehoon.

128
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,615
I couldn't hear you.

129
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,912
I said happy birthday.

130
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,165
It's not midnight yet,
so I still had time to say it.

131
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,043
Thanks.

132
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,588
-Bye.
-Bye.

133
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,865
In the end,

134
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,618
I failed to tell him.

135
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,052
Eventually,

136
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,015
I couldn't tell her.

137
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,196
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

138
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,116
Have some bellflower roots, Mom.

139
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,242
They're too bitter.

140
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,286
No, they're not.

141
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,788
You can have them all.

142
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,207
I think it's just you.
They taste fine to me.

143
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,584
Then you can have them all.

144
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,545
Do you two remember
that missing child case?

145
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,841
We had just moved here at the time,
so we aren't too familiar with it.

146
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,676
-Right?
-Right.

147
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,221
-Bitter means it's good for you.
-Why did they hide the fact

148
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,266
that I had gone missing?

149
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,685
Is it really that bad?

150
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,442
Simply because I had lost my memory?

151
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,028
I'll take care of everything,

152
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,781
so just do as I say.

153
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,285
I'll kill them all.

154
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,828
One or two makes no difference.

155
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,414
Only the first time was hard.
I can do it again.

156
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,337
What in the world happened to them?

157
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,671
Why are you staring at us?

158
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,840
Do you have something to say?

159
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,676
What? Oh, it's nothing.

160
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,762
Don't lie. Your face says it all.

161
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
Gosh, I'm walking on eggshells
nowadays because of her.

162
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,642
Maybe you feel guilty about something.

163
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,436
Not at all.

164
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,482
Just say it.

165
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:42,704
I have one question
I'm dying to ask you two.

166
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,041
Can I?

167
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,668
What is it?

168
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,420
Don't be so serious. You're scaring me.

169
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,422
Go on.

170
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,926
Well…

171
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,639
Did you guys…

172
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,982
Forget it.

173
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,318
I'm too scared to find out the truth.

174
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,653
Thank you for the meal.

175
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,073
Hey, you're piquing our curiosity.

176
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,783
What is it? Hey.

177
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,911
What's with her?

178
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,123
She's going to be the death of me.
I'm going to meet an untimely death.

179
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,419
You're going to live a long life. Eat up.

180
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,718
The soft opening is finally
around the corner.

181
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,471
I'm so nervous. Everything will pan out
this time around, right?

182
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,765
Right, Gyehoon? Right, Gaehoon?

183
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,893
I'm not sure.

184
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,437
Don't jinx it. Take that back.

185
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,980
Are you really our boss?

186
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,732
By the way,

187
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,650
what will we do with that?

188
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,569
-With what?
-The fridge.

189
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,237
Should we just sell it?

190
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,198
Sell that?

191
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,909
To be honest, people are eyeing it.

192
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,370
-What?
-It was a hectic day yesterday.

193
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,005
It's nice and big.

194
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,300
Can you put this in a normal family home?

195
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,137
Your house is tiny.
This won't fit in there.

196
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,932
-My house is better.
-Yours is no different.

197
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,267
Maybe I should put it in my office.

198
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,854
Well… I think I could place it
in my living room.

199
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,439
It's pretty nice.

200
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,316
-It is.
-It's quite nice.

201
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,594
What I'm getting at is
that we should get rid of it soon.

202
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,304
I'll sell it.

203
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,307
Don't bother.

204
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,184
They can take it if they want.

205
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,937
Why would you give it away for free?
We need all the money we can get.

206
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,230
Are you broke?

207
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,691
He's spending all the money he has.

208
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,985
Be quiet and walk the dog.

209
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,696
Let's go, Gaehoon.

210
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,531
That little…

211
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,866
-That's his name?
-No.

212
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,369
Gaehoon!

213
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,207
Gaehoon, let's go.

214
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,342
I looked for him all night long
but to no avail.

215
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,677
Good work.

216
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,095
Sit down.

217
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,810
I need a warrant to check the CCTVs,

218
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,979
so I'm looking for other options.

219
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,274
I'm checking all the nearby dashcams.

220
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,735
But as you already know,
there aren't many cars around.

221
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,572
Right.

222
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,081
Where in the world

223
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,584
could Jingeun be?

224
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,088
Why are you still here?
You haven't left yet?

225
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,006
I was checking the dashcams.

226
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,260
You must be tired.

227
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,930
But… what are you doing?

228
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,891
I pulled an all-nighter yesterday
thanks to someone.

229
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,601
And it wasn't even my shift.

230
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,729
Do you think it's easy
to maintain such good skin?

231
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,314
I put in all this hard work

232
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,526
for people to compliment my skin
and say that I look young.

233
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,361
The latter is a surprise to me.

234
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,991
You've just offended me enough
to keep me awake.

235
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,284
I'm just kidding.

236
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,453
You're plenty beautiful.

237
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,413
That's enough.

238
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,374
I've been going too easy on you.

239
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,419
I meant what I said.

240
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,395
I'll tell him today no matter what.

241
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,992
We'll be doing a deep clean for two days.

242
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,036
Then I'll check our final menu.

243
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:00,081
Jinhoo, double-check and make sure
our ingredients are coming on time.

244
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,876
I'll go to the morning market
for the flowers and seafood a day before.

245
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,377
All right, let's get going.

246
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,462
-Okay.
-Okay.

247
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,303
-Okay. One, two, three.
-Three.

248
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,996
I'm going grocery shopping later.
Come with me.

249
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,206
Okay.

250
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,841
I have a few things to buy.
Who wants to come with me?

251
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,052
-I will--
-Okay.

252
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,269
We'll be back.

253
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,324
I have something to tell you.

254
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,495
I do as well.

255
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,248
About meeting Lee Jingeun yesterday?

256
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,250
Yes.

257
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,587
I'll go first.

258
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,632
I…

259
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,306
If it's too difficult to talk about,
you don't need to.

260
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,850
Let's just do that.

261
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,686
Let's not force ourselves
to talk about uncomfortable things.

262
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,397
Are you saying
we should just keep it a secret?

263
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,734
Are we to play dumb

264
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,069
and feign ignorance?

265
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,156
-If I could, I'd like that.
-Me too.

266
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,284
But would it work?

267
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,249
I'll just go first.

268
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,709
No.

269
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,795
I need to take you somewhere first.

270
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,094
SEWOON-SI, JIHWAMADANG-RO

271
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,580
It's the place

272
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,333
where Gyeyoung and I were 18 years ago.

273
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,408
NAKYANG STATIONERY

274
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,076
Let's go.

275
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,412
Okay, let's go.

276
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,764
GOMI BREAD

277
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,143
-No regrets?
-No. I have a good feeling about this.

278
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,484
We'd like to buy these.

279
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,828
What a bummer. What about you?

280
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,581
What is it? What did you get?

281
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,833
Ta-da!

282
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,000
Let's switch.

283
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,752
-No. Why should I?
-Come on.

284
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,296
-Let's switch.
-I don't want to!

285
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,215
Gyehoon, let's go. They're playing soccer.

286
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,341
Okay.

287
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,386
I'll be back soon. Keep this.

288
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,638
I won't be long!

289
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,099
Wait for me!

290
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,852
This…

291
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,189
This was it.

292
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,151
You were here, Gyeyoung.

293
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,176
Eun Gyehoon.

294
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,303
Why are you here?

295
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,305
What brings you here?

296
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,892
Do you want me to take you to your mom?

297
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,976
Yes.

298
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,940
I have something to ask.

299
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,086
I'm sorry for asking,

300
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,297
but may I ask when you first moved here?

301
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,091
Why?

302
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,842
Am I being too rude?

303
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,596
I remember it being 2005.
I'm probably right.

304
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,140
-In 2005?
-Yes.

305
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,603
Gyeyoung had gone missing in 2004.

306
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,985
Then do you know
who used to live here before then?

307
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,237
I'm not too sure.

308
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,700
From what I know,
this house used to be vacant for a while.

309
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,329
Can you tell me why you're interested

310
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,873
in this house?

311
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,712
I remembered something

312
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,006
from my past.

313
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,884
I remember my sister and I…

314
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,931
coming here

315
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,851
before.

316
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,453
Do you

317
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,456
remember my sister?

318
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,208
I had to go on business trips often,

319
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,502
so I don't remember much
about you nor her.

320
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,507
I see. I'm sorry for barging in here.

321
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,702
LOG IN OR PROCEED AS A NON-MEMBER

322
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,669
COPY OF REGISTRATION

323
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,255
OWNERSHIP
MARCH 25, 2005

324
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,591
OWNER
CHO DONGNAM

325
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,689
I'm back.

326
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,733
I met the current owner of the house

327
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,443
and checked the house registration.

328
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,321
But he didn't own the place 18 years ago.

329
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,367
Now, I need to find out
who the former owner was.

330
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,329
Are you okay?

331
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,957
To be frank, I was scared.

332
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,543
Even a grown-up like me felt afraid.

333
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,044
I can't even fathom

334
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,755
how you two must've felt.

335
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,967
I'm okay.

336
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,262
I'm glad to hear that.

337
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,931
I wish I could remember it all.

338
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,059
But I just don't remember
the culprit's face.

339
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,856
All that I remember

340
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,611
is his damp touch…

341
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,031
and the sound of his breath.

342
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,783
I have to remember.

343
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,120
Anything at all.

344
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,664
-Dahyun.
-I must…

345
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,166
Noh Dahyun.

346
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,877
Yes?

347
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:55,922
Are you all right?

348
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,798
I'm sorry.

349
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,509
I'm sorry I can't remember.

350
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,014
Why would you apologize?
That's nothing to be sorry about.

351
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,933
Don't you ever feel that way again, okay?

352
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,602
Okay.

353
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,438
That's what I told her,

354
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,690
but all I could think about was…

355
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,777
Your sister didn't make it out.
So how did Dahyun survive?

356
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,707
Let's go. I'll cook you something tasty.

357
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,670
I promised that
I'd always cook you delicious food.

358
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,508
No matter what,
nothing will change between us.

359
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,928
Let's go.

360
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,451
You should fold your own laundry.

361
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,786
You're no longer a kid.

362
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,622
Just leave them there,
and I'll do it eventually.

363
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,332
Sure, you will.

364
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,505
You're acting weird these days.
You know that?

365
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,466
You're always acting weird. You know that?

366
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,679
You always have to have the last word.
Gosh, seriously.

367
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,888
Jeez.

368
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,932
But I think

369
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,477
I can understand why you're so weird.

370
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,770
What are you getting at?

371
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,149
You and Dad got a divorce
when I was little.

372
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,528
I was always alone
because you had to work to make ends meet.

373
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,156
I didn't have many friends

374
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,241
and waited for you all day long.

375
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,536
I really hated you back then.

376
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,039
But come to think of it,
you were my age back then.

377
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,875
You were too young.

378
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:00,421
So I'd like to sincerely apologize

379
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,923
for how I felt back then.

380
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,095
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?
Don't act like you're all grown up now.

381
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,557
I know I was lonely back then,

382
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,643
but you also went through so much
at such a young age.

383
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,355
That's why

384
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,816
I think I can understand
anything that you went through

385
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,612
no matter what it was.

386
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,033
What do you mean?

387
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,250
I've regained my memories, Mom.

388
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,840
Not completely.

389
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,385
But a big part of it.

390
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,221
That's why I'm asking you this.

391
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,349
Is there really nothing
that I need to know

392
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,602
about you and Grandma?

393
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,901
Not at all. There's nothing.

394
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,116
All right, then.

395
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,952
-Where are you going?
-What? The grocery store.

396
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,870
-Do you need anything?
-No.

397
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,816
What's wrong, Bokhee?

398
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,067
Mom.

399
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,281
Dahyun regained her memory.

400
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,993
I see. Did she?

401
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,455
She asked me if I had anything to say

402
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,792
or if there was anything
she needed to know about us.

403
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,378
So did you tell her?

404
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,547
How could I?

405
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,759
How could I possibly tell her

406
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,804
about that heinous incident?

407
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,147
Bokhee, you just did everything
you could do at the time.

408
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,858
It's okay.

409
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,153
It's okay.

410
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,864
It's okay.

411
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,118
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

412
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,975
Hello.

413
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,652
Do you need to speak with Dahyun?

414
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,948
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

415
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,038
I just asked you a question.

416
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,417
I don't have to answer you.

417
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,002
I'll be frank with you.

418
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,381
I don't like your expression.

419
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,550
It looks like you're up to no good.

420
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,720
-Is that so?
-Yes.

421
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,360
You know what?

422
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,113
You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.

423
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,240
There's a reason for that.

424
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,624
Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.

425
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,043
What was it
that you were talking about last time?

426
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,419
What?

427
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,921
You were considering leaving Jihwa-dong.

428
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,882
Oh, that?

429
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,885
I've lived here long enough.

430
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:02,139
I had only planned
to stay for a while because I liked you.

431
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,515
Exactly.

432
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,727
Why would you consider leaving
when I'm still here?

433
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,021
I've done many wrong deeds here.

434
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,564
Is this about Mr. Han?

435
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,900
That and then some.

436
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,030
We're in the same boat.

437
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,032
I feel the same way.

438
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,785
Why would you?

439
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,455
No one in this world is fully innocent.

440
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,332
We're all just carrying our guilt with us.

441
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,918
You're doing well compared to me.

442
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,419
So don't worry.

443
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:36,882
Thanks, Jungho.

444
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,766
Hey.

445
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,935
-Hey.
-You're here early.

446
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,145
-Yes, we are.
-What took you so long?

447
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,189
Come on, now.

448
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,817
-Here.
-You know what?

449
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,529
I thought spring was around the corner,
but it already feels like summer.

450
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,782
The weather is crazy, I tell ya.

451
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,329
Jeez, I'm sorry.

452
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,999
Filling up empty glasses
is second nature to me.

453
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,670
Let me have a glass.

454
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,255
-What?
-What?

455
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,174
I'll drink a bit today. Please.

456
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,845
Sure, then.

457
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,932
Hey, this is the first time
I'm seeing you drink.

458
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,518
-So what?
-Are you sure? You quit drinking.

459
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,896
It's okay. I'm going to give myself
a free pass just for today.

460
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,189
-Sure, why not?
-Let's drink.

461
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,066
That won't be a problem.

462
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,698
Gosh, that's refreshing.

463
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,491
That's good.

464
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,994
-You drink well.
-He's right.

465
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,013
-Let's go.
-Thank you for the meal.

466
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,019
Younghwan,
what has been on your mind today?

467
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,689
Well, you see…

468
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,900
Last time…

469
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,622
Never mind. Don't mind me.

470
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,875
What? You got us all curious. Jeez.

471
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,975
Have you been well?

472
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,615
Don't forget our promise.

473
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,673
You've done enough.

474
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,092
Let me go.

475
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,845
Fine. You're right.

476
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,639
I did make a promise back in that alley.

477
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,683
I'm sorry I failed to keep it.

478
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:22,190
I promise never to set foot
in Jihwa-dong ever again, okay?

479
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,943
I won't come back here again,

480
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,653
so just let me go.

481
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,491
Also, I won't tell anyone
about what happened in the past.

482
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,621
Yesterday,
I was just teasing Gyehoon a bit.

483
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:39,833
Why would I tell him the truth?

484
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,129
It would do me no good. Right? So--

485
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,380
The past?

486
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,426
You know…

487
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,138
About Eun Gyeyoung.

488
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,599
It was you.

489
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,100
Who said that?

490
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,394
It wasn't me.

491
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,898
All right.

492
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,108
Let's say it wasn't you then.

493
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,654
So just let me go!

494
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,074
It's not like you can do anything to me.

495
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,909
Isn't that right?

496
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,870
You don't want to leave
any incriminating evidence by doing that.

497
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,957
That's true. You're right.

498
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,376
But you know what?

499
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,171
Objectively speaking,
you're completely right.

500
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,590
But the problem is…

501
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,972
my instincts tell me otherwise.

502
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,729
Good judgment should come
before your instincts.

503
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,106
That's what you call "civilized."

504
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,774
I agree with you.

505
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,360
That's how
I've been lying low all this time.

506
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,361
Right?

507
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,530
But for how long?

508
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,668
How long should I have to keep that up?

509
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,387
One day, you'll cave into your instincts.

510
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,682
But I'm certain that it's not today.

511
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:20,934
-Is that so?
-Yes.

512
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,439
You've grown up well.

513
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,900
You…

514
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,363
I still remember the boy
from 18 years ago.

515
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,075
I gave you a game console,
and you demanded a game cartridge.

516
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,954
You were adorable back then.

517
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,876
It's a pity you turned out like this.

518
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,337
What…

519
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,964
What do you mean?

520
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,050
How?

521
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,702
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

522
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,923
If it's too difficult to talk about,
you don't need to.

523
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,301
Let's not force ourselves
to talk about uncomfortable things.

524
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,596
Can I really do that?

525
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,100
Do I really not need
to tell him everything?

526
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,274
Come with me to the morning market?

527
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,907
CHEF EUN GYEHOON
SURE

528
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,168
How about this one?

529
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,503
-This?
-Yes.

530
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,839
I prefer one of these two.

531
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,466
How often do I need to water these?

532
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,761
-Once a week is enough.
-Once?

533
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,390
Don't these look so pretty?

534
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,808
Yes.

535
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,199
-Look at this.
-Take a look.

536
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,160
-How about this one?
-Sure.

537
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,205
Look, snappers. Don't we need any?

538
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,041
-How much is it?
-It's 20,000 won.

539
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,168
Twenty thousand?

540
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,048
I can't help but feel…

541
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,760
something bad is going to happen.

542
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,893
Thank you.

543
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,150
Should we drop them off
at the restaurant and play hooky?

544
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,360
That's not something
the boss should be saying.

545
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,571
A short stroll should be fine.

546
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,114
All right.

547
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,420
Darn it. Our fridge is broken.

548
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,671
It's not cold.

549
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:40,383
I doubt our budget can cover a new fridge.

550
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,678
Jeez. This summer
is going to be pretty painful.

551
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,721
Right, the fridge.

552
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,892
Someone threw away
a pretty nice fridge outside.

553
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,144
Who?

554
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,147
Where?

555
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,901
Jeez, look at that.

556
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,319
Let's take this.

557
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,738
Isn't it too big?

558
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,823
Don't you know how many of us there are?

559
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,951
-It's perfect.
-It sure is.

560
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,285
Indeed.

561
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,373
Wontak, go borrow that thing.

562
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:15,001
That thing you can pull.
What's it called again?

563
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,586
A handcart?

564
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,755
That's right. A handcart.

565
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,674
Where could I possibly find one?

566
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,386
There's one over there.

567
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,890
Nice.

568
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,908
Hello.

569
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,745
Excuse me.

570
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,585
May I borrow your handcart?

571
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,631
It's not for me.
My superior ordered me to get one.

572
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,219
It's over there. Feel free to use it.

573
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,934
Thank you.

574
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,654
Check this out.

575
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,323
It's perfect.

576
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,450
-It's wonderful.
-It is.

577
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,120
We should clean it first
since it was disposed of.

578
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,414
Wait. You better not order

579
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,750
the youngest member
or the only female to do it.

580
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,877
Let's do it fair and square.

581
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,337
-Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!
-Shoot!

582
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,380
-Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!
-Thank you!

583
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,882
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

584
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,134
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

585
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,096
Real men always go with their fists.

586
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,059
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

587
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,610
Didn't he say men use their fists?
God damn it.

588
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,070
Talking to me?

589
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,489
No, I was talking to myself.

590
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,157
Right? Okay.

591
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,827
I feel great.

592
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,288
All right.

593
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,608
All the flowers are gone.

594
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,611
It must've been due to the rain.

595
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,321
I guess so.

596
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,199
But they'll always bloom again.

597
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,332
Gyehoon.

598
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,297
Why won't you ask me?

599
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:08,716
About what?

600
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,344
Why won't you ask me
why I was the only one

601
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,930
who made it out alive?

602
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,642
Be careful.

603
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,276
Don't cry.

604
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,334
Gyeyoung, hang in there, okay?

605
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,390
Her hand slipped through mine.

606
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,564
I ran away by myself.

607
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,114
I left her behind, Gyehoon.

608
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,036
I'm sorry.

609
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,501
And then?

610
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,672
What happened after that?

611
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,343
I don't know. I just can't remember.

612
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,722
I'm truly sorry.

613
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:23,977
It's okay.

614
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,438
I understand. You were little.

615
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,149
Is that what you really believe?

616
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,735
Yes.

617
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,614
I'm fine. I mean it.

618
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,825
I'm reminded of it
every time I look at you.

619
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,164
I can't forget the fact
that I left your sister behind.

620
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,544
It was a memory
I had forgotten for the past 18 years.

621
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,171
And though it just came back to me…

622
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,676
it's so vivid

623
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,013
that I'm consumed by it.

624
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,600
So how could you be any different?

625
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,895
How would you feel
every time you look at me?

626
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,815
-I said I was fine.
-Don't lie. I know you're not fine.

627
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,112
-So?
-So…

628
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,657
Don't say it.

629
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,161
Don't say another word.

630
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,456
Our premonitions

631
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,500
are always proven right.

632
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,340
Let's break up.

633
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,428
Let's break up,

634
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,431
Gyehoon.

635
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,141
I can't hold myself back anymore.

636
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,095
LINK

637
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,889
Lee Jingeun's killer…

638
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,350
He was probably the one
who took Gyeyoung and me.

639
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,644
I'm saying that you got the wrong guy.

640
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,479
Who in the world broke that?

641
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,981
Lee Jingeun.
He probably didn't see this coming.

642
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,108
Looking back to that time 18 years ago…

643
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,237
Dongnam was the only one
with a solid alibi.

644
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,322
Will you still understand and help me

645
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,407
even if I killed someone?

646
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,577
How many secrets
have been buried with you?

647
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,037
Dahyun's memories are almost all back.

648
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,373
She'll remember you soon enough.

649
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,791
I'll know once I see her.

650
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,585
Whether she really remembers me or not.

651
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,716
