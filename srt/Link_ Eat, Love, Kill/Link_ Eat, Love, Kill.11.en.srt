RECOMMENDED PRODUCT OVERVIEW

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,068
I'm busy doing a translating gig.

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,987
I'll finish up and go home safely,
so don't worry.

5
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,159
She's making me blush.

6
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,661
STEW PLACE

7
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello?

8
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,251
Yes, I reviewed it.

9
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,797
But the most important aspect
of the meal kit business is a heart--

10
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,760
I mean, convenience is very important.

11
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,761
What you've sent…

12
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,272
Something happened to Dahyun.

13
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,297
I had no idea…

14
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,842
Lee Jingeun was still after you.

15
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,095
I thought he had disappeared,
so I let my guard down.

16
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,555
It's all my fault.

17
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,686
-From now on--
-No. Don't apologize.

18
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,104
I'm at fault.

19
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,649
To be honest…

20
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,865
I know your sister.

21
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,577
What?

22
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,788
I think I know her.

23
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,000
What do you mean?

24
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,837
Words are powerful.

25
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,590
What had been mere speculation

26
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,842
becomes certain

27
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,012
the moment it is verbalized.

28
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,849
I think I have…

29
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,271
something to do with Gyeyoung.

30
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,779
Why do you think that?

31
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,365
Lee Jingeun said this to me.

32
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,119
What's wrong?

33
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,621
You know everything too.

34
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,415
He said I know everything too.

35
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,335
That's all there is to it?

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,630
Who cares
what that attention-hogging punk says?

37
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,965
You're right.
That's what I thought at first too.

38
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,218
-But it's still strange.
-What is?

39
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,638
I have no recollection whatsoever
of your sister going missing.

40
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,724
Something so horrendous occurred
in this small neighborhood.

41
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,604
So how's it possible that I don't remember
a single thing? Isn't it strange?

42
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,941
It happens.

43
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,193
No, I don't think so.

44
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,988
I'm certain something happened to me.

45
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,993
After I met you and Lee Jingeun showed up,

46
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,330
I'm regaining my memory bit by bit.

47
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,498
Then remember it.

48
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,876
Remember it this second.

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,294
It doesn't work like that.

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,796
Then don't think at all until then.

51
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,130
What?

52
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,633
Don't act so rashly like this

53
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,886
ever again.

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,805
I said I didn't mean to.

55
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,391
I made a mistake while pondering over it.
I didn't mean to meet Lee Jingeun.

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,977
Before pondering over it
and making such a mistake,

57
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,479
why couldn't you discuss it with me?

58
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,900
It's just a mere memory.

59
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,778
Mere memory? It might have
something to do with your sis--

60
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,737
So what?

61
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,993
I don't want to look for my sister…

62
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,706
if it means you'll be in danger.

63
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,549
It's a fact that
you looked for Lee Jingeun

64
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,218
because I was feeling anxious
not being able to find him.

65
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,178
-That's…
-Do you even know

66
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,016
how I felt as I rushed over here?

67
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,187
You said you wouldn't disappear.

68
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,280
But nothing

69
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,782
happened.

70
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,284
Nothing…

71
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,620
happened?

72
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,699
I'm sorry for getting angry.

73
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,203
No, I should apologize.

74
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,048
You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.

75
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,675
There's a reason for that.

76
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,470
And you'll find out soon enough.

77
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,426
THE WITNESS

78
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,812
All right.

79
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,318
Lee Jingeun.

80
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,403
Eighteen years ago,

81
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,782
did we go to a certain house together?

82
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,576
The red gate.

83
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,420
I searched everywhere.

84
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,635
But it's been such a long time.
I'm sure things have changed.

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,787
Dahyun, hurry up.

86
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,455
Wait for me!

87
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,790
It's fascinating.

88
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,128
How does he know
every time I have a nightmare?

89
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,784
What? Where are they?

90
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
Mom.

91
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,998
Grandma!

92
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,588
Why are they
at the restaurant at this hour?

93
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,797
What?

94
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,757
Say it again.

95
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,470
That scumbag showed up again?

96
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,388
So she didn't tell you.

97
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,100
How did Dahyun seem earlier?
Do you remember?

98
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,395
Was she hurt at all?

99
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,689
Nothing serious,

100
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,149
but he strangled her a little.

101
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,819
My goodness.
She must've been so frightened.

102
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,033
What's wrong with you?
You'll wake up the neighbors.

103
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,952
-Bokhee.
-Don't you dare call my name!

104
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,163
I'll kill them all.

105
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,998
He'd better not show his face.

106
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,459
Don't even joke about it. It scares me.

107
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,338
Joke? Does it sound like I'm joking?

108
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,091
One or two makes no difference.

109
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,718
Only the first time was hard.
I can do it again.

110
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,888
Be quiet. I told you
not to bring that up ever again.

111
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,307
I mean every word.

112
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,059
I'll never

113
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,395
lose Dahyun ever again.

114
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,439
Never.

115
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,792
Eun Gyehoon,

116
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,169
how is your father?

117
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,338
Be happy, Gyehoon.

118
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,341
Like others.

119
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,602
Lee Jingeun said this to me.

120
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,855
He said I know everything too.

121
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,607
I think I know her.

122
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,694
Just stay right here, okay?

123
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,371
EPISODE 11

124
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,463
Thank you for the food.

125
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,766
Why aren't you telling us about yesterday?

126
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,476
What happened yesterday?

127
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,395
You really don't know?

128
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,105
No, I don't.

129
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,983
I heard that Lee Jingeun showed up again.

130
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,529
I heard that scumbag found you
at the library and hurt you.

131
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,490
-So what?
-"So what?"

132
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,326
You need to tell us
about such things right away.

133
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,452
Then what?

134
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,245
What?

135
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,538
If I tell you,

136
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,793
will you and Grandma
find Lee Jingeun and bury him?

137
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,422
Will you find him and kill him?

138
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,676
Dahyun, that's…

139
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,428
What are you talking about?

140
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,764
Why are you spewing nonsense?

141
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,141
What I meant was

142
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,936
that you should tell us
if anything is going on.

143
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,688
So that Grandma and I can help you!

144
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,273
Okay, I got it.

145
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,610
Then what about you guys?
Don't you have something to tell me?

146
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,280
Is there anything
that I don't know or can't remember,

147
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,990
but should know?

148
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,493
There's no such thing.

149
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,620
Me too then.

150
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,041
It wasn't anything serious
that you should worry about, Grandma.

151
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,001
I'll tell you if I need any help,
so don't worry.

152
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,045
Okay.

153
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,974
I said I'm fine.

154
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,977
Okay. Get going then.

155
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,812
I'll be back.

156
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,575
She left.

157
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,916
-What?
-You should control your temper.

158
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,293
Don't blame me.

159
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,752
I was just upset.

160
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,046
Of course, I know.

161
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,969
But Mom, I think she sensed something.
Don't you think?

162
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,679
I don't know.

163
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,519
For our spring seasonal menu,
how does sea squirt sound?

164
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,313
We can put it in the carpaccio sauce too.

165
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,772
I'm sure it will taste good.

166
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,025
But it's hard to store
and difficult to cook.

167
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,234
We can cook it sous vide.

168
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,444
Dahyun.

169
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,070
Can you help me?

170
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,614
Yes, sure.

171
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,870
Please put each ingredient
into separate pans.

172
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,121
Yes, chef.

173
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,171
Is your neck okay?

174
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,215
It's just slightly bruised.

175
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,095
How are you feeling?

176
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,098
Thanks to you, I feel fine.

177
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,145
Charlie Brown said,

178
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,774
we should "only dread one day at a time."

179
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,777
I'm going to become simple-minded
and not worry unnecessarily.

180
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,655
Good idea.

181
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,618
-By the way…
-Yes?

182
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
Dating secretly has its thrills.

183
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,040
You're right.

184
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,671
Just pretend you can't see or hear, okay?

185
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,507
Why do we have to suffer
when they're the ones dating?

186
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,009
But it's entertaining to watch.

187
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,219
That's true.

188
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,892
It smells good.

189
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,892
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

190
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,521
Hey, there.

191
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,778
What?

192
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,237
Why are you glaring?

193
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,132
You punk.

194
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,593
What's wrong with you?

195
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,553
Lt. An was looking for you, sir.

196
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,930
I think it's urgent.

197
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,268
That darn punk.

198
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,772
Follow me.

199
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,406
What's wrong with you?
Did something happen? What is it?

200
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,243
Nothing.

201
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,746
Of course, there's something.
Just now and yesterday too…

202
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,458
Let's stay like this for a while.

203
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
Hey.

204
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,007
Don't get ahead of yourself.

205
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,677
Even though I hugged you yesterday,

206
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,263
there is almost no chance
our relationship will change.

207
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,765
So it's not a zero chance.

208
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,601
What? Yes, it is.

209
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,111
I have a favor. I need access
to CCTV footage off the record.

210
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,113
-CCTV?
-Yes.

211
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,615
I need to find a person named Lee Jingeun.

212
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,409
Lee Jingeun…

213
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,161
Oh, that one?

214
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,121
How do you know him?

215
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,664
What about you?

216
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,252
Hello?

217
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,671
Oh, really?

218
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,424
When?

219
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,801
I see.

220
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,386
Okay.

221
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,770
Dahyun.

222
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,233
Can you come with me somewhere?

223
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,611
Sorry?

224
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,243
We're going to a supermarket
instead of a market?

225
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,247
Yes. I need various ingredients today.

226
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:08,957
Why?

227
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,083
Because

228
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,629
I have no idea what he likes.

229
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,926
So, Korean, Western, Chinese,

230
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,387
Japanese, Asian, African, and more.
I'll cook dishes from all over the world.

231
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,184
You didn't do that for me.

232
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,692
Of course, you're my priority.
He's just benefitting on the side.

233
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,362
I'm telling the truth.

234
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,912
Wait.

235
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,375
What's that?

236
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,336
It's called kohlrabi.
I want to try putting it in a salad.

237
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,381
-Have you seen bell peppers like these?
-Wow, never.

238
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,840
They're huge.

239
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,177
Meat!

240
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,388
You carry meat scoring marble nine?

241
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,807
-Yes, we do.
-It looks fresh.

242
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,186
If the meat is glossy overall
and is marbled evenly like this,

243
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
the more umami--

244
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,736
You look so excited.

245
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,239
Do I? Let's look around.

246
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,037
Are you looking for dessert wine?

247
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,372
Oh, yes.

248
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,834
That winery was established
in 1737 in London.

249
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,877
It has a very long history.

250
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,421
Then in 1831--

251
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:41,842
It made its way to Porto, Portugal, and
started producing port wine thereafter.

252
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,678
The wine you're holding
is strong and full-bodied,

253
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,138
and has caramel, mocha--

254
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,225
It has a mixed aroma of pepper, walnut,
and wood spice, and in particular…

255
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,729
This is a 2016 vintage port.

256
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,856
A good mix of balsamic and spicy scents--

257
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,775
It has an intense and complex aroma,

258
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,862
so you can truly enjoy
the vintage port wine.

259
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,030
Were you jealous?

260
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,575
I wasn't jealous.

261
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,578
I was just trying
to share my expert knowledge.

262
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,788
Never mind. I'll play along.

263
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,749
Play along?

264
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,626
He was handsome.

265
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,630
-Who? Who was handsome?
-What?

266
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,049
No, never mind.

267
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,175
Open up.

268
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,346
I'll take one, please.

269
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,919
Still a long way to go?

270
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,837
No, it's almost done.

271
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,048
-Do you want to taste it?
-Yes.

272
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,133
Here you go.

273
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,805
It's delicious.

274
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,936
-What else should I do?
-What? Nothing. It's almost done.

275
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,493
I'm not the owner, but please have a seat.

276
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,453
Make yourselves comfortable.

277
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,500
What an awkward gathering.

278
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,338
Officer Ji is looking for Lee Jingeun too.

279
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,464
That's right.

280
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,091
Let's share information.

281
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,135
What on earth did Lee Jingeun do

282
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,928
and why is he stalking you?

283
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,308
It's a long story.

284
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,065
I see. You mean,

285
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,111
you almost died,
so you attacked back and killed him.

286
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,613
No, I didn't kill him.
He's still alive after all.

287
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,908
Right. You didn't kill him.

288
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,787
You put Lee Jingeun in the refrigerator
thinking he was dead, right?

289
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,291
I was really torn, Officer Ji.

290
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,669
I wasn't sure if I should let someone
so dangerous roam around freely.

291
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,504
It's understandable.

292
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,013
That must've been hard.
You suffered so much.

293
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,973
I'll help you as much as I can.

294
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,725
Thank you.

295
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,311
Then let's eat now.

296
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,276
By the way, this tastes good
if you wrap it in dried laver. Try it.

297
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,447
Okay. I'll figure it out.

298
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,040
-What's between you two?
-Tell me about it.

299
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,215
He used to follow me around
all the time when we were kids.

300
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,341
Hey.

301
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,468
No, it wasn't like that.

302
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,678
I never did that.

303
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,182
He's talking nonsense.

304
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,896
By the way, it's been a while
since I've had such fancy food like this.

305
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,564
Me too.

306
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,651
The last time I had it was
when we were dating. Not since then.

307
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,278
Seriously? You eat it all then.

308
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,072
What's between you two?

309
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,872
Nothing between us two.

310
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,833
-Yeah. You can handle it yourself.
-Okay.

311
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,876
Do you buy that?

312
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,045
No way.

313
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,390
What about you two?

314
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,730
We're just in lov--

315
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,607
-What?
-We're just work colleagues.

316
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,863
It's delicious.

317
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,094
-Well…
-Well…

318
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,430
-You can go first.
-No.

319
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,681
You go ahead.

320
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,350
Well…

321
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,562
I really enjoyed the food. Thanks.

322
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,899
Thanks for enjoying it.

323
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,443
Don't thank me.

324
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,070
I should be thanking you.

325
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,122
Did you go see your father?

326
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,208
How could I?
That would be so shameless of me.

327
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,546
About ten years ago,

328
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,258
my dad came to see me.

329
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,187
Do you remember me, Sejin?

330
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,813
What are you doing here?

331
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,734
Well, the thing is…

332
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,986
If you have nothing to say, just leave.

333
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,780
I…

334
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,577
I didn't hurt anyone.

335
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,955
I've never hurt anyone, Sejin.

336
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,252
I'm telling the truth. Please believe me.

337
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,884
I have a favor.

338
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,223
Tell me. I'll do anything for you.

339
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,225
From now on,

340
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,521
if we happen to run into each other
whenever and wherever,

341
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,648
please don't act like you know me.

342
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,403
Don't come see me like this ever again.

343
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,032
Please.

344
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,455
Looking back, perhaps my dad

345
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,667
came to see me

346
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,337
hoping that I would
understand him more by then

347
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,967
since I had become a grown-up.

348
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,596
But I…

349
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,267
But I still

350
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,728
envy you.

351
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,775
Isn't it odd?

352
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,652
It makes no sense.

353
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,864
Someone took the refrigerator?

354
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,282
Yes, exactly.

355
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,869
It was left outside to be recycled,
but it was gone before being picked up.

356
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,036
Why would anyone take it?

357
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,788
What refrigerator?

358
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,123
The one that Lee Jingeun was in.

359
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,876
It was left in front of the restaurant,
and it disappeared. Right?

360
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,210
Yes.

361
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,795
By any chance,

362
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,090
was it really big

363
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,427
with many doors?
It used to be right out in the front?

364
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,179
-Yes.
-That's the one.

365
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,272
You seemed happy earlier.

366
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,401
Did I?

367
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,321
Yes. You two seemed to get along well.

368
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,658
We used to be such close friends.

369
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,744
But…

370
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,539
many things happened.

371
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,584
And more than anything, I feel so bad.

372
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,837
I hope Ji Wontak

373
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,799
can become happy now.

374
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,967
I hope so too.

375
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,929
-So I'm thinking about it.
-About what?

376
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,889
I observed earlier

377
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,309
that he seemed awkward and uncomfortable
eating really fancy food.

378
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,730
He might've felt that way.
I felt like that too at first.

379
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,023
Right?

380
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,609
So,

381
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,113
I want to create a menu
that Wontak can eat comfortably.

382
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,450
If it were up to me, I would want him
to come eat here whenever he wants.

383
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,035
But knowing him, I doubt he would.

384
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,123
I should create a more casual menu
suitable for this business district.

385
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,503
Creating an ambience where one can
drink alone at night may be good.

386
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,463
-That sounds good.
-Doesn't it?

387
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,422
Yes, totally.

388
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,716
So I have another idea.

389
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,927
Yes, what else?

390
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,179
I'm thinking about revising the wine list.

391
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,014
Do I have to revise it?

392
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,724
-Well, hear me out first.
-Okay.

393
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,435
There are a lot more wines out there

394
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,479
that are more economical
and customer-friendly.

395
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,275
And to go with such wines,
I should create a simpler snack menu.

396
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,652
For example, gambas

397
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,655
or a simple cheese platter.
Something like that.

398
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,662
I finally feel better.

399
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,914
Let me.

400
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,543
What's wrong? Did something happen?

401
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,961
Not much.

402
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,505
What about you?

403
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,675
You don't look good either.
Is something going on?

404
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,970
Eun Gyehoon came to the market
to see me not too long ago.

405
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,096
Why?

406
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,308
Because I was the witness
who saw Han Euichan a long time ago.

407
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,601
What did you tell him?

408
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,186
I just told the truth

409
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,772
that I testified because of Chief Seo
even though I wasn't sure.

410
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,693
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell Eun Gyehoon,

411
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,820
so I told Dahyun instead.

412
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,949
I see.

413
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,410
How will I face Chief Seo now?

414
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,497
Should I just leave Jihwa-dong?

415
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,790
-What?
-Darn it.

416
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,585
-Hey, what's going on? You got here early.
-Hello.

417
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,211
Did you start drinking already?

418
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,631
I needed a drink badly.

419
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,759
-Let's talk again later.
-Okay.

420
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,510
What? Is something going on?

421
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,512
Not really.

422
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,891
What about you?
It seems like you're up to something.

423
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,684
-Me?
-Yes.

424
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,855
My goodness. You're so nosy.

425
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,900
What now? What's bothering you this time?

426
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,363
The thing is that the stalker
showed up at the stew place again.

427
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,281
-The stalker?
-Yes.

428
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,076
-That guy from before?
-He showed up again?

429
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,994
Yes. Do you remember him?

430
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,665
Of course. We saw him
sitting over there last time.

431
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:42,043
Right, I remember him too.
The guy with a scar on his face.

432
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,920
-We saw him.
-Right.

433
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,047
Just tell them to report him.

434
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,091
The laws are better nowadays.

435
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,467
I guess

436
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,428
the situation is a bit complicated.

437
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,721
Is that right?

438
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,060
Then there isn't much we can do.
Our hands are tied.

439
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,750
The refrigerator keeps coming back.

440
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,336
I know.

441
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,383
You don't think
there is anything inside, do you?

442
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,721
I doubt it.

443
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,057
Shall I open it?

444
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,124
-Sorry.
-Jeez.

445
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,294
I…

446
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,464
didn't have a fridge,
so I had brought it up.

447
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,091
It looked nice.

448
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,432
My goodness. But it's huge.

449
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,558
What floor does he live?

450
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,642
Third…

451
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,643
On the third floor…

452
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,360
The restaurant is free today,
so feel free to use it as you wish.

453
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,653
You can study there.

454
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,701
Is something going on at home?

455
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,578
Why would he be there all day?

456
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,130
Zero, four, two, three.

457
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,800
Zero, four, two, three?

458
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,512
I thought the passcode was his birthday.

459
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,639
APRIL 23

460
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,266
It's Gyehoon's birthday today.

461
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,521
How could I not realize
my own boyfriend's birthday?

462
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,607
Why didn't he say anything?

463
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,651
He should've told me it was his birthday.

464
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,281
It's Gyeyoung's birthday too.

465
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,558
Mother, I'm home.

466
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,107
You're here.

467
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,653
Yes.

468
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,636
What's the point of all this?

469
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,681
I don't even know
if my daughter is dead or alive somewhere.

470
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,944
That's enough, Gyehoon.

471
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,618
Are you hungry? Wait just a little longer.
I'm almost done.

472
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,259
Is everything well with you?

473
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,680
Yes, it is.

474
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,516
What about the restaurant?

475
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,978
It's going well.

476
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,897
Which neighborhood did you say it was?

477
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,568
Don't worry about it.

478
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,326
How about you, Mom?
Are you feeling okay these days?

479
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,661
Yes.

480
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,792
Are you making sure to take your medicine?

481
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,003
I'm trying.

482
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,759
Does the food suit your taste?

483
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,429
Yes, it's delicious.

484
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,265
That's good to hear.

485
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,225
You should get going.

486
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,480
I want to stay longer.

487
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,527
You don't have to say
things you don't mean.

488
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,658
Even though I'm doing my best,
I still feel suffocated.

489
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,787
It's your birthday too.

490
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,414
I'm sure you have your own plans.

491
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,462
Even though I believe she isn't,

492
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,424
I can't help but think
she is blaming me saying,

493
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,971
"You're off and well by yourself."

494
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,985
Then I'll get going.

495
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,571
What about Dad?

496
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,743
Has he contacted you?

497
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,834
No.

498
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,212
But I think he's doing fine.

499
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,297
So please don't worry.

500
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,383
I'll go now.

501
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,427
And

502
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,179
I'm getting used to telling lies.

503
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,423
I miss you.

504
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,259
Who?

505
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,308
Who do you miss?

506
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,942
What are you doing here?

507
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,986
Well, the thing is

508
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,739
I came here
knowing that it was your birthday,

509
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,409
but I wondered if you wanted to be alone.

510
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,286
I missed the right timing to pop out.

511
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,956
Have you been waiting for me
since I was at my house?

512
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,582
Yes.

513
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,425
Should I leave?

514
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,261
No.

515
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,814
Thank you for coming.

516
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,989
It's so pretty.

517
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,700
Yes, it is.

518
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,243
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

519
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,706
But you're prettier.

520
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,167
You even know how to give compliments?

521
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,754
-To be honest…
-Yes?

522
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,632
I'm surprised at myself too.

523
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,552
What?

524
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,900
Don't you know?

525
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,445
If you catch a falling flower petal,
your wish will come true.

526
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,746
I'm not a little kid.

527
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,832
I don't believe in
such childish, unscientific superstitions.

528
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,502
But I didn't have enough time
to buy you a gift,

529
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,922
so I was hoping
that your wish would come true.

530
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:01,972
But the thing about belief is that
it can change at any moment,

531
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,809
and I think today is the day to do so.
I believe it now.

532
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,356
I'll give you your real gift soon.

533
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,442
This is more than enough.

534
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,867
-Go on in.
-Okay. Good night.

535
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,231
Gyehoon, happy birthday.

536
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,400
Look inside the refrigerator.
It's not homemade though.

537
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,409
It looks similar.

538
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,333
Why do I get such a bad feeling?

539
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,910
Happy birthday, Gyeyoung.

540
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,455
I promise…

541
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,085
I'll find you.

542
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,550
Surprise.

543
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,844
Happy birthday.

544
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,765
Lee Jingeun.

545
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,892
Well,

546
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,521
-I came to give you a gift.
-From this moment on,

547
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,815
if you spew a single word of nonsense,

548
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,819
I'll kill you.

549
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,320
Jeez, I'm terrified.

550
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,367
Shall we go somewhere first?

551
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:19,313
My goodness, don't glare at me like that.

552
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,647
You missed me too, didn't you?

553
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,319
Yes, you're right.

554
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,863
I missed you a lot for a different reason.

555
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,702
Oh, right.

556
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,706
You and Noh Dahyun
looked so chummy earlier.

557
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,875
What?

558
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,669
That's why I came.

559
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,006
I believe now is a good time to tell you.

560
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,010
I'll tell you everything
you want to hear, Eun Gyehoon.

561
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,057
Fine.

562
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,186
That day, the night you disappeared,

563
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,940
-the person that was with you--
-No. Gosh, seriously.

564
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,692
Much before that.

565
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,696
Eighteen years ago,
the day Eun Gyeyoung disappeared.

566
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,532
Let's start from what happened then.

567
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,160
Eighteen years ago?

568
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,664
I told you. I know
what happened to Gyeyoung in the end.

569
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,959
What? You're not that curious?

570
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,047
Of course, I am. But why now?

571
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,218
You've kept it to yourself all this time.
Why are you bringing it up now?

572
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,180
Well,

573
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,432
it's your birthday gift.

574
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,559
Consider it that.

575
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,605
Although I suppose it's not a gift
you wanted to receive.

576
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,320
Do you remember this?

577
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,294
I really wanted it so bad.

578
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,633
So I had been eyeing it for days.

579
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,263
-Bye.
-Okay, take care.

580
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,472
Bye.

581
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,516
YEONNAE STATIONERY

582
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,476
But one day,

583
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,937
someone approached me

584
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,773
and asked me a question.

585
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,359
"Do you want that?

586
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,237
Do you want me to get it for you?"

587
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,281
Of course, I said yes.

588
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,160
But the person said he had a favor to ask,

589
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:42,831
and I had to do it
to get this game device.

590
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,963
The favor was…

591
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,684
Do you want to come to my house?

592
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,106
What…

593
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,693
What are you talking about?

594
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,614
Tell me.

595
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,452
I'm asking you what happened!

596
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,416
Do you want to come to my house?

597
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,126
Why?

598
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,630
It's nearby. I'll give you medication.

599
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,549
If you put that on, it'll heal right away.

600
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,125
Is this really your house?

601
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,817
Hey, Lee Jingeun!

602
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,111
Where are you?

603
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,492
Don't joke around!

604
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,466
It was me.

605
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,969
I was the one…

606
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,722
who took your sister Eun Gyeyoung.

607
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,270
I got that game console
that you're holding

608
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,064
from that person back then.

609
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,373
You…

610
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,337
did that to Gyeyoung

611
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,923
over this?

612
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,387
You took Gyeyoung over this? Did you?

613
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,098
How could you…

614
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,476
How could you?

615
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,739
Who was it?

616
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,742
Who told you to bring Gyeyoung?

617
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:06,785
Who was it?

618
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,412
Noh Dahyun didn't tell you?

619
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,962
She also knows who it was.

620
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,005
Oh, right.

621
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,966
Maybe she doesn't remember it yet.

622
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,427
Or maybe she's pretending not to know
even though she does.

623
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,889
Aren't you curious

624
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,934
how she knows that person?

625
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,312
I already know that Dahyun
was a possible witness as well.

626
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,982
What?

627
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,024
A witness?

628
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,026
A wit…

629
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,301
This is it.

630
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,497
A witness?

631
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,797
My goodness. You're mistaken.

632
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,800
Dahyun wasn't a witness.

633
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,638
The game…
I didn't have any game cartridges.

634
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,556
What?

635
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,143
I thought the console
surely came with a game,

636
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,520
but it didn't.

637
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,522
So I…

638
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,746
Do you want to play with me?

639
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,794
We're all playing together over there.

640
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,671
You don't want to come?

641
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,969
So I took another.

642
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,389
Eun Gyeyoung.

643
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,948
Gyeyoung. Are you there?

644
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,616
I chose her.

645
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,453
I chose Noh Dahyun.

646
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,414
But

647
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,416
we met again like this.

648
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,004
This is what you call fate, okay?

649
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,135
This is what you call fate, Eun Gyehoon!

650
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,192
Eun Gyeyoung.

651
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,989
Gyeyoung.

652
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,824
LINK

653
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,494
Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.

654
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,662
Will you be okay with that?

655
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:10,249
I remember my sister and me
coming here before.

656
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,044
This was it. You were here, Gyeyoung.

657
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,632
Her hand slipped through mine.

658
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,426
Why don't you ask me
why I was the only one

659
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,552
who made it out alive?

660
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,097
I left her behind, Gyehoon.

661
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,516
I'm reminded of it
every time I look at you.

662
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,311
I can't forget the fact
that I left your sister behind.

663
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,566
