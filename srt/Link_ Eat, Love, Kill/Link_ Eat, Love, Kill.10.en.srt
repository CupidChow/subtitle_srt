LINK

2
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,606
I came back because…

3
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,525
for some reason…

4
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,279
I had this strange feeling.

5
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,714
This isn't why I returned…

6
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,759
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,095
For what?

8
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,890
-What?
-What?

9
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,183
I mean…

10
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,144
What's there to be sorry about?
You did well.

11
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,271
-What?
-What?

12
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,524
I mean… The kiss was nice.

13
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,113
It was indeed nice. Well done.

14
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,924
What's wrong? You know everything too.

15
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,138
When did I first come

16
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,975
into your life?

17
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,230
At times,
a memory hits you out of nowhere.

18
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,609
Just like right now.

19
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,736
We met

20
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,281
right in this alley a very long time ago.

21
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,117
Right here in this neighborhood.
Don't you remember?

22
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,393
Dahyun, hurry up.

23
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,645
Lee Jingeun?

24
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,371
Dahyun, hurry up.

25
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,622
Wait for me!

26
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,295
The moment I saw Jingeun and me as kids,

27
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,381
a memory hit me.

28
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,315
In my dream…

29
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,822
I wasn't alone.

30
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,242
What is this?

31
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,829
Why now?

32
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,083
In what may have been
the happiest moment of my life,

33
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,295
the scariest memory resurfaced.

34
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,575
Hello?

35
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,954
What's going on? Are you okay?

36
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,832
-What?
-Is everything okay?

37
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,170
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

38
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,880
That's good.

39
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
Thanks.

40
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,386
But we just parted ways.
Isn't it too soon to call?

41
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,723
Well… That's not why I called.

42
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,640
Then?

43
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,477
Never mind.

44
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
It's fine as long as you're okay.

45
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,522
-Good night.
-Wait.

46
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,110
Can we talk until I get--

47
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,280
Can we talk until I fall asleep?

48
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,700
Sure.

49
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,619
You can talk.

50
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,621
Can you talk instead?

51
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,997
What…

52
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,791
should I say?

53
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,752
Anything.

54
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,505
Well…

55
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,883
I'm not the type who calls
without anything to say.

56
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,260
I don't think I've ever tried.

57
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,890
Then just keep the phone
next to your ear. Can you do that?

58
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,935
Sure. I can do that.

59
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,286
Are you still not sleepy?

60
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,497
I'm almost sleepy.

61
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,876
Thanks to you, I'm not scared anymore.

62
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,588
Are you in your room right now?

63
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,174
Yes. Why?

64
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,930
I think we can hang up now.

65
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,475
Good night.

66
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,018
Good night.

67
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,752
THE RED GATE

68
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,558
Was it a lost memory or just a nightmare?

69
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,687
Lee Jingeun and I were there together.

70
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,522
Hi, I'm Eun Gyeyoung.

71
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,691
GYEYOUNG

72
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,029
Maybe I knew Gyeyoung from the start.

73
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,281
What's wrong? You know everything too.

74
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,409
What is it that I know?

75
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,957
He could've been provoking me.

76
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
GYEYOUNG, RED GATE

77
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,836
Or…

78
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,883
Could there be a link
between Gyeyoung's case and me?

79
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,511
Forget it.

80
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,139
There's no solid proof
to back that up as of yet.

81
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,436
They said thinking too much
was harmful to your body.

82
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,194
Think about only the things
you know for certain, Dahyun.

83
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,863
The good things.

84
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,034
The good things.

85
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,898
I thought about it all night long.

86
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,275
EPISODE 10

87
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,361
Has he really been single all his life?

88
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,946
How is he so good?

89
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,032
-At what?
-Kissing.

90
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,452
-Who?
-Not just me, but him--

91
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,246
-What?
-What?

92
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,666
Who's the guy? Who's that good kisser?

93
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,126
It was in my dream.

94
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,585
Dream, my foot!

95
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,171
When you're desperate for something,
you dream about it.

96
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,923
Has that never happened to you before?

97
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,845
Don't try to shift focus on me.

98
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,222
-Answer me.
-Why won't you believe me?

99
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,683
-Would you if you were in my shoes?
-I would not--

100
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,729
Thank you for the meal.

101
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,522
Is it that chef?

102
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,235
That cocky guy? Over my dead body.

103
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,404
It's not him.

104
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,823
I better not catch you two!

105
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,160
Darn it. Why is this soup so salty?

106
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,453
You made it.

107
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,249
But why not?

108
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,543
So it is him.

109
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,795
No, it's not.

110
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,882
I just don't get it.

111
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,677
Why are you so against that?
What's your reason?

112
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,055
I told you. He's cocky.

113
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,310
-That's it?
-Yes.

114
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,748
What was that? What's wrong with her?

115
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,962
It's time to go to work.

116
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,009
Why is everything so rusty?

117
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,054
Expired in 2019?

118
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,597
I should give this to Mom.

119
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,108
One's hairstyle can make or break a look.

120
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,458
Sweatpants are a no-go.

121
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,710
Isn't this Mom's?

122
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,047
Pants. Skirt? Pants.

123
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,178
I would've had nothing to wear
if Eunjung didn't get me this.

124
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,182
You look so pretty. How soft.

125
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,310
Let's go!

126
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,410
LEE JINGEUN

127
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,583
You're here.

128
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,129
Hello…

129
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,093
Hey--

130
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,553
Is your hand okay?

131
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,724
That was nothing.

132
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,147
I think…

133
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,400
We're really going to open
this time, right?

134
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,652
Yes, as long as
no one's wielding a knife again.

135
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,072
Don't say that.
I could really have a heart attack.

136
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,158
We won't be marketing on social media.

137
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,869
I don't want to grovel and give free food

138
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,663
to those so-called celebrities
just to promote our restaurant to say…

139
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,707
He has chosen to run away.

140
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,875
"That place is nice."

141
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,668
If not, who'll come all the way here?

142
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,046
All that we have here
is a hair salon, a hardware store,

143
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,923
a tacky restaurant with bad food--

144
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,383
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,553
Even those who enjoy
the retro vibe wouldn't come here.

146
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,721
How about we change the style…

147
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,140
He must have no courage

148
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,309
to become happy.

149
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,936
Then they'll come out of curiosity.

150
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,812
Where's my phone?

151
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,023
I'll call you.

152
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,441
Okay.

153
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,325
And to him, I'm…

154
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,161
Stew Place?

155
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,886
You look like a grandpa.

156
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,891
Are you finally back to work?

157
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,353
You looked so out of it.

158
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,605
Your mind was miles away.

159
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,899
I'm glad you're back.

160
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,485
You shouldn't abuse your paid vacation.

161
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,113
Then you should hurry up and open--

162
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,242
You couldn't because of me.

163
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,954
By the way,

164
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,666
have you heard
about Lee Jingeun's whereabouts?

165
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,546
Seeing how the police
are still looking for him,

166
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,506
he must be in hiding once again.

167
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,884
There are only two possibilities.

168
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,638
Either he's hiding,
or something happened to him.

169
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,682
I'm with someone right now.

170
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,810
I coincidently ran into this person
after such a long time.

171
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,354
This person has a question for you.

172
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,772
Eun Gyehoon,

173
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,234
how is your father?

174
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,278
What do you mean?

175
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,989
What could've happened to him?

176
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,617
I'm just saying we need to find him soon.

177
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,744
Hey, Chef Lee.

178
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,997
What is this dog doing here?

179
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,915
-Are you guys raising him here?
-Yes.

180
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,002
It just barged in here like someone.

181
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,128
Does it have a name?

182
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,756
Not yet. How about Sta?

183
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,467
-Sta? How adorable.
-And its surname, Pa.

184
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,260
In Korean, it's Pa Sta.

185
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,928
In English, that's Sta Pa.

186
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,222
Sta Pa. Pa Sta.

187
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,266
I like that, but any other names?

188
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,559
Gaehoon.

189
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,021
Not "gye", but "gae".

190
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,856
"Gae". Gaehoon.

191
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,332
Why are you so mad?

192
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,626
Mad? Who me?

193
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,003
Gaehoon?

194
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,756
She wanted to hear suggestions,
so I gave her one.

195
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,016
Don't just stand there. Talk.
I already know everything.

196
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,727
What do you mean?

197
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,773
You rejected me once again.

198
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,903
Option one.
I'll brush it off and let you go.

199
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,448
Option two. I'll curse you
for being a coward after kissing me.

200
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,825
What's your pick?

201
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,245
There's also option three.
I'll spray you with this.

202
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,329
Wait.

203
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,540
It's definitely not option three.

204
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,961
I should've just hit you first
and rejected you.

205
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,881
What can you do?

206
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,969
You don't dare to be happy
because you feel bad for your family.

207
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,762
So just be a coward and run away.

208
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,724
So you know that I'm a coward.

209
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,268
I've known that for a while now.

210
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,820
As you know,

211
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,823
I came here to find my dad.

212
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,369
"What in the world happened to him

213
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,123
and my sister?"

214
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,875
Finding out the answer

215
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,043
was going to be my top priority.

216
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,755
And I had no intention
of becoming close to anyone.

217
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,926
However, something unpredictable happened.

218
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,061
You came into my life.

219
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,899
You'll still see the coward in me

220
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,693
from time to time.

221
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,030
I'll probably think
about my family and feel guilty

222
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,991
whenever I eat something tasty
or go somewhere nice.

223
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,910
But…

224
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,663
I'll try my best

225
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,584
not to feel that way
or make it so obvious.

226
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,171
If you're okay with that…

227
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,261
Then I'll continue

228
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,473
to make delicious food

229
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,226
for you.

230
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,151
You call that a love confession?

231
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,282
You kept frowning
and avoiding eye contact,

232
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,284
so I thought
you were pushing me away again.

233
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,664
That was because Jinhoo was there.

234
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,873
I was embarrassed.

235
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,625
Plus…

236
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,210
Plus?

237
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,754
You're quite…

238
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,384
beaming today.

239
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,641
You do have good taste.

240
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,234
I accidentally cut off a leaf.

241
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,820
It's okay.

242
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,238
It's for you.

243
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,161
Have you smelled lavender before?

244
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,163
Once spring came into my life…

245
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,915
Should I cut that too?

246
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,084
It was spring in the world as well.

247
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,286
That's hot.

248
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,617
Let me tag along and work out with you.

249
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,536
What if that fridge guy comes back?

250
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,122
He's in hiding right now.

251
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,499
Hiding?

252
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,417
Yes. It's a long story.

253
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,630
And you know what?

254
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm going to dig into it.

255
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,674
Dig into what?

256
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,718
My nightmare.

257
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,474
Letting my imagination run wild

258
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,102
makes me want to run away
in fear even more.

259
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,686
I'm done with that.

260
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,148
I'm going to take the bull by the horns
and see if it's real or not.

261
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,402
-Go on.
-Okay. I'll be back later.

262
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,821
-All right.
-Bye!

263
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,818
It looks similar.

264
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,243
It's not this one.
It's the wrong color too.

265
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,798
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

266
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,092
Goodbye.

267
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,302
I heard

268
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,555
you were the last person
to see Gyeyoung alive.

269
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,309
I was waiting for you to recognize me.

270
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,312
-We met when you were a kid.
-I know.

271
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,856
I guess you didn't come here for the fish.

272
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,733
Not the only reason, I guess.

273
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,529
If it's all right with you,
could you tell me what happened?

274
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,865
-Well--
-I'm busy today.

275
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,492
Do I need to wait for long?

276
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,036
I wouldn't let a valuable customer wait.

277
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,622
I'll stop by your restaurant later.

278
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,582
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

279
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,334
What would you like?

280
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,211
-I'd like a flatfish.
-Sure.

281
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,215
LEE JINGEUN

282
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,643
The call can't be connected.
Transferring to voicemail…

283
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,148
Grocery shopping?

284
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,193
Yes. Were you exercising?

285
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,487
-Yes.
-I see.

286
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,991
You're smiling from ear to ear.

287
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,120
That can't be.

288
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,290
You're the one
with a big smile on your face.

289
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,792
Really?

290
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,627
Let's go.

291
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,762
It's finally spring.

292
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,348
You're right. It is.

293
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,526
The weather is lovely.

294
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,778
You're right.

295
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,197
It's lovely.

296
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,303
Dahyun, can you hand me the sugar?

297
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,733
-Dahyun, can you put this in the oven?
-Sure.

298
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,002
I'll upload them
to our restaurant's social media.

299
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,505
Stop taking photos and have a bite.

300
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,340
Okay.

301
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,645
Is it just me, or do we keep adding
sweet desserts to the menu?

302
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,563
I think it's just you.

303
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,151
Are you guys seeing each other?

304
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,528
-Yes.
-No.

305
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,571
Then are you official?

306
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,656
-Yes.
-No.

307
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,746
Aren't you guys leaving?

308
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,499
Why is no one leaving?

309
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,627
Jeez. Are you waiting for me?

310
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,587
Let's go.

311
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,382
Gyehoon, want to grab a drink?

312
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,427
Then we should hurry.

313
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,679
The bars close early these days.

314
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,223
Follow me.

315
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,433
Where?

316
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,941
We need to go.

317
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,693
-Where?
-Anywhere.

318
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,279
-But I live here.
-Just follow me.

319
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,743
How could you say that we're official?

320
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,705
What? You were the first one
to admit that we were seeing each other,

321
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,831
so I thought we could.

322
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,625
I was only trying to cover up
a bigger lie with a small one.

323
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,628
Seeing each other and being official
are totally different.

324
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,005
Everything you say is a lie--

325
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,345
Let's just tell everyone--

326
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,431
No. Never.

327
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,602
It'd be a headache if my mom finds out.
You know that, right?

328
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,255
Thanks.

329
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,180
-Have some coffee.
-Thanks.

330
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,474
It's been a while
since I got a part-time translating gig.

331
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,100
Then I won't bother you.

332
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,271
This is a raspberry tart.

333
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,525
And this is
a lemon madeleine with icing on top.

334
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,611
And this one is custard cream.

335
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,614
I like it.

336
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,741
How does it taste?

337
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,508
Are you eating well on time?

338
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,720
I'm going to stop by and check
if you've been having my side dishes.

339
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,931
What about your medication?
Make sure you take them on time too.

340
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,564
Why would you be sorry, Mom?

341
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,484
I'm the one who should apologize.

342
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,906
Why are you crying again? Please don't.

343
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,251
What's with that deep sigh? What's wrong?

344
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,087
It's about Eun Gyehoon.

345
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,092
I'm not comfortable about how
he and Dahyun are close.

346
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,178
What if…

347
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,306
Never mind.

348
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,393
Everything will go the way it should.
There's nothing we can do.

349
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,147
Then what's wrong with you?

350
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,984
You were dancing halfheartedly back there.

351
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,795
Mom.

352
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,338
What?

353
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,469
Be honest with me.

354
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,429
You're concerned too, aren't you?

355
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,196
What are you doing?

356
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,199
You startled me.

357
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,828
-What's that?
-It's nothing.

358
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,496
Are you coming back from aerobics?

359
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,706
Yes.

360
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,085
Jeez. I told you
not to carry around tools.

361
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,173
Oh, this? This isn't a tool.

362
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,273
What's this for?

363
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,649
I finally found out

364
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,029
the reason why you two
were carrying around those tools.

365
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,905
So a guy was stalking Dahyun?

366
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,409
Had I known sooner,
I wouldn't have scolded you so much.

367
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,369
I would've taken measures as well.

368
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,664
Took you long enough.

369
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,126
How would I have known
when you didn't report it to us?

370
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,299
It's so good.

371
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,384
It's so fresh.

372
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,552
-Eat up, Mom.
-Okay.

373
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,888
Is this a token of your apology?

374
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,931
Thank you.

375
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,067
What is this?

376
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,985
I understand your situation,

377
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,905
but it's still illegal
to carry around those tools.

378
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,364
Put them around your necks.

379
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,372
What do I do with this?

380
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,168
Blow it whenever
you feel you're in danger.

381
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,712
I'll run over to you whenever
and wherever you are.

382
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,430
So you'll come if we blow this whistle?

383
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,766
Really?

384
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,726
Come here. Right now.

385
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,271
-Get ready.
-Thanks for the laugh.

386
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,108
I'm serious here, you know?

387
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,944
Thanks. I mean it.

388
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,157
Thank you more for the sushi.

389
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,999
Our food costs shouldn't exceed 20%.

390
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,627
You've been consistently exceeding
your initial budget.

391
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,254
Even if you have sufficient funds--

392
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,797
LEE JINGEUN

393
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,881
One minute.

394
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,311
What is this? Is this really your phone?

395
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:53,901
There's no lock on the phone
or any saved numbers.

396
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,403
What's that phone for?

397
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,697
-Don't you have any friends?
-Where did you find this?

398
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,616
In a corner of some alley.

399
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,619
Here. Sign this, and you can go.

400
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,663
-Which alley?
-Does that matter?

401
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,249
It does.

402
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,545
It was near the cart bar. Happy?

403
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,510
-What are you doing?
-It's not mine.

404
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,304
Hey--

405
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,890
We need to talk.

406
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,309
-No, thank you.
-It's important.

407
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,520
Officer Ji.

408
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,523
Han Se--

409
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,660
I'll come by later. Okay?

410
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,340
What happened? Did you find it?

411
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,885
It was a lost phone.

412
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,511
Lost?

413
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,805
The phone was reset
to factory settings and discarded.

414
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,891
That means…

415
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,809
He didn't lose it. He threw it out.

416
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,480
It'll be even more difficult
to locate him.

417
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,991
Gosh, how pretty.

418
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,997
I dragged you here
so you could get some fresh air.

419
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,750
-Me?
-Yes.

420
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,169
You've been looking troubled all day.

421
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,838
Have I?

422
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,466
What's wrong?

423
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,052
Well, you see…

424
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,139
There's something that only I can do.

425
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,516
However,

426
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,936
I don't think I should.

427
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,606
I don't know what to do,
so I'm in a dilemma.

428
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,942
What is it?

429
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,699
You don't need to tell me
if you don't want to.

430
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,127
Let's talk on the way.

431
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,470
That was Lee Jingeun's phone.

432
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,473
And he's nowhere to be found.

433
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,391
So?

434
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,395
We need to check all CCTVs and dashcams
around the area where the phone was found.

435
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,981
-What?
-He met someone afterward

436
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,108
and disappeared on the night we all met.

437
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,987
I think…
No, I'm sure that person is the culprit.

438
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,030
So…

439
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,492
So you want me to catch that individual?

440
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,748
First of all, it's illegal
to check the CCTV without a warrant.

441
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,377
But sure, I could still check them
if I really wanted to. But…

442
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,341
I don't want to.

443
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,302
I don't care
about what happened in the past.

444
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:10,181
And I most definitely
don't want to get involved with you again.

445
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,936
When will you stop running away?

446
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,652
-What?
-How long will you remain a coward?

447
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,654
-You know nothing.
-Then what do you know?

448
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,617
Just come with me
and find out for yourself

449
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,243
about what happened

450
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,580
to Mr. Han Euichan, your dad,

451
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,041
eighteen years ago.

452
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,510
Perhaps…

453
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,720
Call me.

454
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,182
…I could find Jingeun.

455
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,193
DO YOU REMEMBER?

456
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:11,784
YOU TOLD ME TO REACH OUT TO YOU,
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. CALL ME

457
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,623
NEW POST

458
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,465
No.

459
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,008
DELETE

460
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,514
I'm here to meet Chef Eun Gyehoon.

461
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,725
He's away at the moment.

462
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,358
I have a favor.

463
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,819
Could you relay this message to him?

464
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,406
I don't think
I can bear telling him this in person.

465
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,869
I may have made a huge mistake.

466
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,462
Eun Gyehoon, who do you think you are
telling me to come and go…

467
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,340
What?

468
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,384
Why is he here?

469
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,268
I have some questions
about Mr. Han Euichan's case.

470
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,479
I was wondering why you called.

471
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,315
I fully understand

472
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,359
why you think
he's the culprit and resent him.

473
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,652
No, it's actually the opposite.

474
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,572
I don't think it was him.

475
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,449
What?

476
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,710
First and foremost,
I don't think he did it either.

477
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,213
Why?

478
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,549
Why do you think that way?

479
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,302
I have one question.

480
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,846
What is he doing here?

481
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,522
I'd appreciate it
if you could just answer.

482
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,283
Eighteen years ago,

483
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,578
we believed the culprit
must've known your sister.

484
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,915
So we interrogated everyone who knew her.

485
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,292
And Mr. Han was one of them.

486
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,963
He was her piano teacher after all.

487
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:33,050
Then we received two crucial statements.

488
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,219
One statement

489
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,722
was from a boy who saw
his dad washing bloody clothes.

490
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,058
The other statement

491
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,895
was from an individual
who last saw Gyeyoung.

492
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
I was

493
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,237
the last person

494
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,323
to see Gyeyoung alive.

495
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,927
I told the police that I saw her
going into Mr. Han's car.

496
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,222
But to be frank, I wasn't sure

497
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,852
whether she did step into his car

498
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,770
or not.

499
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,690
Then why did you say that?

500
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,073
That was because…

501
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,247
You need to be exact.

502
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,709
Your words could either
put him behind bars or acquit him.

503
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,130
Did Gyeyoung
get into Euichan's car or not?

504
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,216
Answer me!

505
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,016
And that's how
he became the prime suspect.

506
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,810
So we arrested him.

507
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,567
He denied the charges.
He claimed he never put her in his car

508
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,361
or took her with him.

509
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,197
And like he said,

510
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,533
we couldn't find her DNA in his car.

511
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,329
The only other lead we had
was the bloody clothing.

512
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,626
But he had thrown it away.

513
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,505
We were never able to find it.

514
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,424
So we asked him about that blood.

515
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:38,926
"Whose blood was it?

516
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,303
Why did you throw it away?"

517
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,305
But he remained tight-lipped.

518
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,808
Then later on,

519
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,852
we found out what he was up to that day.

520
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,194
His piano academy wasn't doing too well.

521
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,678
JAWS ROOM CLUB

522
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,687
-Hello, I'll be serving you today.
-Hey.

523
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,982
-Let's hear some music.
-Go on and sing a song.

524
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,373
He refused to tell us
due to his reputation as a teacher.

525
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,210
He was embarrassed
about working at a karaoke bar.

526
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,212
He was humiliated.

527
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,215
But how could he choose that
over being acquitted?

528
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,471
Then what about

529
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,266
the bloody clothing that he had?

530
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,603
It's obvious.
He had fought with a customer.

531
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,024
But he couldn't prove it
because too much time had passed.

532
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,650
No one could testify for him.

533
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,694
You found nothing in his car,

534
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,571
and his alibi checked out.

535
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,407
Then why is he still being treated
as if he's guilty?

536
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,369
People's impressions of others

537
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,456
don't change that easily.

538
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,459
Who'd be understanding of a man
who had once been arrested

539
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,835
as a murder suspect?

540
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,295
He should've been vindicated.

541
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,507
If you were a true police officer,

542
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,759
you should've told everyone
that he was innocent

543
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,969
and that the police had made a mistake.

544
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,095
I tried.

545
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,517
I tried to get him back on his feet.

546
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,894
Darn it!

547
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,524
I'm telling you!
Han Euichan is the killer!

548
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,404
We had to let go of that cunning scumbag

549
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,658
because he had gotten rid of all evidence.

550
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,159
But just wait and see.

551
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,578
I'll catch him at all costs!

552
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,873
That's how rumors are.

553
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,794
The more widespread it is,
the stronger their impression

554
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,796
of him becomes.

555
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,967
Hey, what's your deal today?

556
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,013
What's with him?

557
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,266
That's Han Sejin.

558
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,269
Mr. Han's son.

559
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,521
What? Officer Ji?

560
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,473
Let's go, Sejin.

561
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,375
Ji Wontak!

562
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,713
Let me go. Let go!

563
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,839
What will you do?

564
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,966
What are you trying to do?

565
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,179
I'm going to kill Chief Seo myself.

566
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,599
What? Can't I?

567
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,392
Hey.

568
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,729
You know that's ridiculous, right?

569
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,439
Do you know

570
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,400
what kind of life I've had?

571
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,113
Do you know how I've been treating him?

572
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,575
Do you know…

573
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,580
how miserable his life has been?

574
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,832
Do you?

575
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,714
I won't let this slide.

576
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,549
Step aside.

577
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,135
-I can't.
-Move.

578
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,306
Don't do anything you'll regret, okay?

579
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,933
Regret?

580
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,144
Regret…

581
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,063
What do you know? Tell me.

582
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,357
What makes you think you can say that?

583
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,485
-What do you know?
-I know one thing for sure!

584
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,739
You still have a chance.

585
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,032
What?

586
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,660
You can still apologize.

587
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,958
You can still say that you're sorry
and ask for your dad's forgiveness.

588
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,627
You can do that.

589
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,759
As for me…

590
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,807
I really want to do that as well.

591
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,187
But I can't. It's too late.

592
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,402
But you still have time.

593
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,993
Do you volunteer
to do duty often these days?

594
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:41,329
Yes, I'm lonely, have a lot of free time,
and want more money.

595
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,664
Should I go on?

596
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,251
No, ma'am. That's enough.

597
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,504
Why doesn't anyone
want to hang out with me?

598
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,594
I'm busy.

599
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,765
-Let's park here tonight.
-Yes, ma'am.

600
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,356
Look at that.
Who'd throw away such an expensive piano?

601
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,358
No one would take that.

602
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,111
-The owner had to pay to dispose of it.
-Right.

603
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,238
Let me stop by the restroom.

604
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,449
-Enjoy your time.
-Thank you.

605
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,113
THE PIANO ON THE LAKE

606
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,579
What was that last melody?

607
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,372
I guess it's just

608
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,916
a memory.

609
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,550
Ji Wontak?

610
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,140
Speak of the devil. I was just thinking--

611
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,310
No, I wasn't thinking of you.

612
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:12,105
I was contemplating music and art.

613
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,068
Wontak.

614
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,239
Is everything okay?

615
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:26,953
I'm glad you're here.

616
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,585
I actually wanted to see you.

617
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,880
What's wrong? What's going on?

618
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,223
Let's stay like this for a while.

619
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,931
He's still not home.

620
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,891
I'm here.

621
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,812
What?

622
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,152
Why are you sitting here?

623
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,923
Did something happen?

624
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,343
Yes. Something did.

625
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:07,929
Is it about--

626
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,099
It's not about Lee Jingeun.

627
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,851
Then who?

628
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,645
My heart breaks

629
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,231
for a childhood friend of mine.

630
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,861
By the way,

631
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,405
you dropped the honorifics.

632
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,619
Do you dislike it?

633
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,997
No.

634
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,166
I was going to do it gradually.

635
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,835
But I couldn't.

636
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,463
Let's just drop it right now.

637
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,549
Let's use honorifics at work

638
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,093
and drop them once we clock out.
What do you say?

639
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,179
Okay.

640
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:50,847
I like that.

641
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,267
I like that you like it.

642
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,619
What could've happened? I'm worried.

643
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,627
I'm worried but…

644
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,632
He dropped the honorifics.

645
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,097
How is he so good at dating
when I'm his first girlfriend?

646
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,016
What if I'm not?

647
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,355
Thinking about it kept me up all night.

648
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,149
Having butterflies isn't always good.

649
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,611
How exhausting.

650
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,281
-Did something else happen in your dreams?
-What?

651
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,366
Nope.

652
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,536
Why are you smiling like that?
Are you a pervert?

653
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:58,790
Mom, I'm not perverted. I'm unpredictable.

654
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,210
Unpredictable? What is she spewing?

655
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,339
She's unpredictably perverted
just like you.

656
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,053
Jogging again?

657
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,681
Of course. I need to get
to the bottom of this.

658
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,392
-Bye.
-Be careful.

659
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,480
I haven't seen a single red gate yet.

660
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,030
Could it just have been a nightmare?

661
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,882
I'm busy doing a translating gig.

662
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,510
I'll finish up and go home safely,
so don't worry.

663
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,476
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

664
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,306
Lee Jingeun.

665
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,064
I'm going to scream.

666
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,857
Do it, and you'll regret it.

667
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,654
Let's get rid of those.

668
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,114
People will come.

669
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,658
Of course, they will.
This won't take long.

670
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,036
First of all, you're the one
who reported me, wasn't it?

671
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:43,913
What?

672
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,125
I decided to finally go home,
and I saw cops there.

673
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,751
It was you, right?

674
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,547
I would've reported you sooner
if I was going to. Why now?

675
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,341
It has to be you.

676
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,761
Because you're the only one
who's still alive.

677
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,681
Forget about that.

678
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,476
I'll cut to the chase.
Why did you want to see me?

679
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,313
I'm excited to find out why.

680
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,068
You saw that?

681
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,946
Of course. It was you of all people.

682
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,492
What happened that night?

683
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,330
You disappeared
right after speaking with Gyehoon.

684
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,583
Why did you have
to get rid of your phone and run away?

685
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,087
Who did you meet that night?

686
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,256
Was all this because of Gyehoon?

687
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,051
Did you reach out to me

688
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,721
to tell Gyehoon
about the person I met that day?

689
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,931
Tell me who it was.

690
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,160
You know what?

691
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,705
You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.

692
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,541
There's a reason for that.

693
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,795
You'll find out soon enough.

694
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,927
Lee Jingeun.

695
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,350
Eighteen years ago,

696
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,646
did we go to a certain house together?

697
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,322
No, right?

698
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,076
Do you finally remember?

699
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,630
The red gate.

700
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,469
Dahyun, hurry up.

701
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,479
This is getting interesting.
See you around.

702
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,707
We'll be able to easily locate him
with the CCTV footage,

703
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,459
so don't worry. We will catch him.

704
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,753
Are you hurt?

705
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,629
No.

706
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,592
Why did you drop the honorifics?

707
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,470
We were schoolmates.

708
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,433
Here comes another one.

709
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:14,081
I had no idea
Lee Jingeun was still after you.

710
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,502
I thought he had disappeared,
so I let my guard down.

711
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:18,795
It's all my fault.

712
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:25,426
-From now on--
-No. Don't apologize.

713
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,012
I'm at fault.

714
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,974
To be honest,

715
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,313
I had left him a message
on my social media.

716
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,862
While debating whether to post it or not,
I accidentally posted it.

717
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,240
I panicked and deleted it right away.

718
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,492
But I think he saw it.

719
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,371
You reached out

720
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:55,873
to him?

721
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,709
I'm sorry.

722
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,384
Because of me, right?

723
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,971
You knew I was looking for him,

724
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,681
so you wanted to help. Right?

725
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,558
That's not why.

726
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,560
It's okay.

727
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,313
It's my fault. I was being careless.

728
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,690
That's really not why.

729
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,442
Then why would you reach out to him?

730
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,246
I had my reason.

731
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,834
It was because…

732
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,046
I know your sister.

733
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:49,886
What?

734
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,097
I think I know her.

735
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,975
What do you mean?

736
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,978
Lee Jingeun once said

737
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,607
that he was the last one
to see Gyeyoung alive.

738
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,110
Perhaps

739
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,905
I also saw.

740
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:12,992
Saw what?

741
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,872
Your sister alive for the last time.

742
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,628
I might have witnessed it as well.

743
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,532
LINK

744
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,701
Something so horrendous occurred
in this small neighborhood.

745
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:40,162
So how's it possible that I don't remember
a single thing? Isn't it strange?

746
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:43,249
I don't want to look for my sister
if it means you'll be in danger.

747
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,500
I'll kill them all.

748
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,460
Only the first time was hard.
I can do it again.

749
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,088
I'm certain something happened to me.

750
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,674
After I met you and Lee Jingeun showed up,

751
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,510
I'm regaining my memory bit by bit.

752
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,929
I already know that Dahyun
was a possible witness as well.

753
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,433
What? Dahyun wasn't a witness.

754
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:03,102
I'm asking you what happened!

755
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,274
