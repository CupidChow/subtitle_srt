00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,854
A refrigerator tells you
a lot more than you think.

3
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,481
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

4
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,482
Enjoy.

5
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,027
It shows if you're having a balanced diet

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,362
or not,

7
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,405
CHICKEN, CHINESE
DELIVERY

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,116
if you are dirty or clean,

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,160
or if you are a neat freak.

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,370
Some give up
their refrigerator space for skincare,

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,915
and some enjoy alcohol more than meals.

12
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,043
Family relations, hobbies,

13
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,338
places they have traveled,
health conditions,

14
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,090
financial situations, and more.

15
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,051
Every refrigerator in the world is unique.

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,011
And…

17
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,479
A refrigerator tells you
a lot more than you think.

18
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,073
EPISODE 1

19
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,923
Great. Please serve it
to table number two.

20
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,050
For tables number three and four.
Go ahead.

21
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,511
Make the beef tartare more voluminous.

22
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,555
Chop vegetables the same width.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,889
-Two centimeters.
-Yes, Chef.

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,307
Great. Looking good.

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,102
-Please check the taste.
-Yes, Chef.

26
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,444
He got dumped.

27
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,825
Put down the knife.

28
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,246
Stay out of the dinner shift today.

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,247
Yes, Chef.

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,082
Your depressed mood affects the food.

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,544
No personal feelings are permitted
in this kitchen. Keep that in mind.

32
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,670
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,566
The dish we have prepared is bonito…

34
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,333
Gyehoon.

35
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,126
Gyehoon!

36
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,380
-Oh, gosh!
-Eun Gyehoon!

37
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,881
What's wrong?

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,596
Are you really all right?

39
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,766
You're not ill?

40
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,229
"I'm not ill. I'm fine."

41
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,691
How many more times do I have to answer
for you to stop asking?

42
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,906
Good. It's great.

43
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,450
Then have you gone mad?

44
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,580
-No.
-Then what's the problem?

45
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,084
You've been acting totally strange
ever since you collapsed that day.

46
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,838
Fresh ingredients and high-quality meat.

47
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,049
On top of it, you have the skilled chef
who has one Michelin star.

48
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,261
Now you can enjoy the food
from the comfort of your own home.

49
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:08,141
It's so delicious that it makes you cry
from overwhelming happiness.

50
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,352
You cried marketing the meat on TV.

51
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,063
Tender snapper prepared via sous vide…

52
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,777
using butter sauce
with the highest quality beluga caviar…

53
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,780
It's a dish that we put in
a lot of time and effort.

54
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,699
I really hope
that you enjoy the food. Everyone…

55
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,659
-It'll taste great.
-You cried while describing the dish.

56
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,370
No.

57
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,372
You sob for no reason.

58
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,042
It's okay. You'll find someone better.

59
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,884
No, no.

60
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,886
I'm not laughing at him.

61
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,847
No, I'm not. I'm sorry.

62
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,725
I'm so sorry.

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
But then you laugh
when you're supposed to cry.

64
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,188
How is that normal? You tell me.

65
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,190
You're usually not like this.

66
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,816
You don't care about anything.

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,944
You're like a robot
that is indifferent about everything.

68
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,406
How is it normal for someone like that
to get so emotional at everything?

69
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,410
Seriously, what is the matter?

70
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,788
Let me explain.

71
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,963
As the psychiatrist
and analytical psychologist Carl Jung says

72
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:26,677
meaningful coincidence through a concept
called synchronicity, or synchronization,

73
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,514
two or more meaningful emotions or events…

74
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,815
A mobile phone connects to Wi-Fi, right?

75
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,234
A mobile phone and a computer
can be synchronized too.

76
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,444
In the same way,
my brain waves or feelings

77
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,863
connect to another person's--

78
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,370
More simply put,

79
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,331
it's like telepathy between twins.

80
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,499
Like telepathy? And?

81
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,084
So, what I mean is…

82
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,178
Forget it.

83
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,055
Forget what?

84
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,973
Why?

85
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,602
You won't understand anyway.
What's the point of explaining?

86
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,481
What do you mean, I won't understand?

87
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,191
I know what twins are, you punk!

88
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,945
They say some twins have

89
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,782
a psychological connection at times
that's difficult to explain.

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,371
-Stop. I said stop.
-No.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,040
You little shrimp.
What are you making that for?

92
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,334
-You're an idiot, you little shrimp.
-Stop it.

93
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,879
Eun Gyeyoung, my younger sister…

94
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,633
and me. Like us.

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
Stop it.

96
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,686
Gyeyoung!

97
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,148
Go faster. Let's ride it now!

98
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,735
From time to time,
I can feel her joy, sadness,

99
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,571
or fear.

100
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,656
Stop it.

101
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,825
Gyeyoung.

102
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,537
Even if we're far apart, it feels so real.

103
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,582
-I told you to get out of my way.
-We were here first.

104
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,958
Jeez.

105
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,293
Hey!

106
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,796
Hey!

107
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,549
Why did you bully my sister?

108
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
I didn't bully her!

109
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,472
Get off me!

110
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,765
Hey!

111
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,143
That was a very long time ago.

112
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,190
But it started again…

113
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,943
after 18 years.

114
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,783
-You're going to buy it for me, right?
-Yes.

115
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,784
-Me too, Mom.
-Okay.

116
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,160
Could it be that Gyeyoung…

117
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,163
is alive?

118
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,416
No way.

119
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,849
If not, then who on earth can it be?

120
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:13,821
LINK - CONNECTION

121
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,839
PAYMENT OVERDUE NOTICE

122
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,137
NOTICE

123
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,221
MAINTENANCE FEE OVERDUE

124
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,139
UNPAID RENT!

125
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,188
Gosh, this is so annoying.

126
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,778
RESET YOUR LIFE
FAILURE IS THE 5G TO SUCCESS!

127
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,044
Aren't you supposed to be at work?
Why are you opening the door?

128
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,089
A lot of people
work from home these days, Mom.

129
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,174
-Really?
-Yes.

130
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,801
No, I'm lying.

131
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,721
A good company is certainly different.

132
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,348
It's not a good company.

133
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,058
You should work there forever.

134
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,603
I already quit long ago.

135
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,024
I said you don't need to
bring me anything.

136
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,568
I can cook my own food. Why do you
keep barging in unannounced?

137
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,822
Am I not welcome here?
What am I, a debt collector?

138
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,367
-What? Barging in?
-Gosh. Seriously.

139
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,916
Put that in the refrigerator.
It might spill.

140
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,043
-I said I'll take care of it.
-Gosh.

141
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,006
Don't waste your salary
and move to a nicer and bigger place.

142
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,633
I'm going to move.

143
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,720
I lost all of my deposit
since I couldn't pay rent.

144
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,182
Don't act so conceited
and always be humble, okay?

145
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,893
I am humble.

146
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
No, actually I'm cowardly.

147
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,865
There is… an odd smell.

148
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,619
Did you wash up?

149
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,584
I didn't get to because I was so busy.

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,171
I ran three kilometers
to come home because of you.

151
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
You can't be too good at what you do.

152
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,508
Don't overdo it,
so that they can relate to you.

153
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,220
Don't try to be the best even at work.

154
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,389
You're so ridiculous.

155
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,600
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

156
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,186
This is comfy.

157
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,524
Mom.

158
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,318
Yes?

159
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,821
I'm not all that.

160
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,242
What? Say it.

161
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,453
Never mind.

162
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,060
Take a taxi. Don't take the bus.

163
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,645
It's okay.

164
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,021
Just take it.

165
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,774
Gosh, it's fine.

166
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,859
Just take it when I'm giving it to you.

167
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,654
-Be miserly. What's wrong with you?
-You're embarrassing me.

168
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,489
But 20,000 won is too much. Hey.

169
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,782
It's two stations away by bus.

170
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,576
-Just take a taxi. I'll hail one.
-No, it's okay.

171
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,538
Make sure you eat and wash up, okay?

172
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,289
Okay, Mom. Go now.

173
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,791
Sir, we can leave now.

174
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,085
-Bye.
-Get home safely.

175
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,982
Thank you for coming to Seoul Gourmet Fair
despite the cold weather.

176
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,109
At today's event,
you'll be able to taste dishes

177
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,612
by chefs from various restaurants
as introduced in advance.

178
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,447
You can enjoy food from the market

179
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,826
and live cooking shows
by famous chefs from top restaurants.

180
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,369
Ta-da.

181
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,122
Everyone, look at this long line.

182
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,457
I'm in front of the booth

183
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,919
of the famous Chef Eun Gyehoon.

184
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,089
-It's also the reason why I came.
-Chef Cha, it's too thick. Make it watery.

185
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,091
Kadaif needs to look
more golden brown overall.

186
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,384
Yes, Chef.

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,892
Please enjoy.

188
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,330
I know you've all waited long for this.

189
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:19,168
Today's main event,
Chef Eun Gyehoon's food show starts now!

190
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,298
Hello.

191
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,218
-This is nice.
-Even Europe isn't that great these days.

192
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,136
Too many Koreans.

193
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,472
But Northern Europe is a bit different.

194
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,140
Really? What part of Northern Europe?

195
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,559
Either Sweden or Denmark.

196
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,228
-I just came back from Sweden.
-I'm so envious.

197
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

198
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,450
The food is so tasty here.

199
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,035
-Not bad.
-It's good.

200
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,621
The chef here is from San Sebastián.

201
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,498
-Oh, I see.
-No wonder. It melts in your mouth.

202
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,583
-Shall we toast?
-Sounds good.

203
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,335
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

204
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,172
Dahyun.

205
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,590
Hey, Ms. Yoon.

206
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,300
You disappeared
during the event last time.

207
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,345
Oh, it's because my mom
showed up at my place unannounced.

208
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,223
Do I really have to put up
with such nonsense excuses?

209
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,308
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

210
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,435
I feel uncomfortable
hiring someone like you

211
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,689
who is highly educated, has no experience
in this field, and old. You know, right?

212
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,024
Of course, I know
and I'm very grateful to you.

213
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,111
My goodness, Ms. Yoon.
You have such beautiful skin.

214
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,737
Like a computer graphic image. No pores.

215
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,322
Don't flatter me. I feel sorry for you.

216
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,991
No, I mean it.

217
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,535
I'll believe you, so please work hard.

218
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,328
Your salary that covers your expenses

219
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,664
is all coming out of my pocket.
Please don't forget that.

220
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,541
Of course, I know it.

221
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,292
You have to be determined too, okay?

222
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,378
You got fired
because you weren't determined.

223
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:57,224
Chef Eun Gyehoon has prepared
squid ink rosé pasta today.

224
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,436
I wonder what it'll be like.
What an exciting moment.

225
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,546
You're sensing something? Wi-Fi?

226
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,466
Gosh, I feel irritated and stuffy.

227
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,135
It's suffocating.

228
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,435
-Where is he going?
-What's going on?

229
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,943
Oh…

230
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,821
I'm sorry. I thought no one would be here.

231
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,200
Then I'll go now not to bother you.

232
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,536
I didn't rent this out.

233
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,331
-Pardon?
-I mean…

234
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,625
I don't own this place.
Please go ahead and rest.

235
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,628
You came up here
to get away from people like me.

236
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,342
Well…

237
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,177
Then,

238
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,389
I'll stay quiet not to bother you.

239
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,808
I'll stay quiet too.

240
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,852
Sounds good.

241
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,396
Great.

242
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,429
Would you like some?

243
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,641
Thank you. I'll just take one.

244
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,483
It's so pretty.

245
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,410
It's so delicious.

246
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,790
Now I know what it tastes like.

247
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,417
I only served food.
It's my first time eating it.

248
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,131
What you just ate was

249
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,841
crispy seaweed cracker
topped with tapioca,

250
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,218
abalone sauce, and salmon roe.

251
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,429
And this is fermented halibut apple wrap.

252
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,808
And this one is carpaccio
with seasonal seafood.

253
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,060
Oh, then…

254
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:10,978
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

255
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,106
Based on your fancy words,
I suppose you're a famous chef.

256
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,234
I can't deny it.

257
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,237
Just one more then?

258
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,490
If you insist, I won't decline your offer.

259
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,867
I didn't really insist…

260
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,792
Drink this.

261
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,552
Thank you. I'm not usually this shameless.

262
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,643
I see. Good food can make people happy.

263
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,035
I felt so sorry for myself today.

264
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,621
I don't particularly
hate my life, you know?

265
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,209
Because I myself shouldn't hate it,
at the very least.

266
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,628
But today, I wanted to be

267
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,716
among those fabulous people
just for a day.

268
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,595
Thinking that,

269
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,431
it made me feel
so pathetic and discouraged.

270
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,976
But thanks to you, I feel better.

271
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm so ridiculous.

272
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,403
Why am I telling you all this?
We just met.

273
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,243
Sometimes you feel
more comfortable with a stranger.

274
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,497
You're right.

275
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,304
By any chance… is she the one?

276
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,975
Wait.

277
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,062
I have a question for you.

278
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,273
Go ahead.

279
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,991
By any chance…

280
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,831
The thing is…

281
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,212
I usually don't give it out so easily.
I swear, this is my first time.

282
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,635
Give me your phone.

283
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,679
Pardon? Why do you need my phone?

284
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,930
I'll input my number.

285
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,557
Why would you do that?

286
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,352
Weren't you trying
to ask for my phone number?

287
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:40,937
No, I wasn't.

288
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,150
Then what?

289
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,820
The thing is…

290
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,742
Would it be rude to ask
where you used to live as a kid?

291
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,702
Pardon?

292
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,081
I know this is also rude to ask,
but how old are you?

293
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,169
Why do you need to know that?

294
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,591
I know it sounds weird, but can we play
rock-paper-scissors just once?

295
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,343
My goodness.

296
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,596
Thank you… for the food.

297
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,350
Gosh, is he a lunatic?

298
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,819
He doesn't want my number,
but he asks about my neighborhood and age?

299
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,156
Let's smile.
They say, smiling brings blessings.

300
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,249
Do you know him?

301
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,756
-No.
-Oh, I see. You don't.

302
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,178
Why is he talking down suddenly?

303
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,767
Thank you for your hard work today.

304
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,103
Eunji, I look forward to
working with you again tomorrow.

305
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,189
Minyoung, you're off tomorrow?
See you at next week's event.

306
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,899
Great work today.

307
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,913
What?

308
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,624
It looks like it's used.

309
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,711
Ms. Yoon, what's all this?

310
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,423
Chef Eun Gyehoon wanted
to give it to you, so I put it there.

311
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,799
Why would he give this…

312
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,260
But he's quite a famous chef.

313
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,429
I guess you were
hitting on him while working.

314
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,390
It's not like that.
Besides, I don't hit on men.

315
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,767
You didn't even hit on him,
but that chef just fell for you.

316
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,102
I'm not interested in men.

317
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,646
It was proven again today,

318
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,399
but I'm not very lucky with men.

319
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,157
It was hard work, wasn't it?

320
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,783
Great work today.

321
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,410
-Go home safely!
-See you later!

322
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,578
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

323
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,592
We meet again.

324
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,596
I'm glad I ran into you.

325
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,973
Pardon?

326
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,351
This… What's this for?

327
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,518
Oh, that.

328
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,230
It looked like you enjoyed the food.

329
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,733
I didn't mean much by it,
so you don't need to refuse.

330
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,319
Since you didn't mean much, I'll refuse.

331
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,197
But it's no big deal.

332
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,574
Maybe I gave you room to misunderstand me

333
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,159
by opening up to you and laughing.

334
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,869
No, I didn't misunderstand you.

335
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,123
Why would you give me something like this
if you didn't misunderstand?

336
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,459
But I didn't give you anything fancy.

337
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,294
Look.

338
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,547
It's just the food you ate earlier
and a slice of cake.

339
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,965
And…

340
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,218
a scarf…

341
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,095
Scarf? Why is the scarf in here…

342
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,682
That's my point. Why did you give me that?

343
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,893
I think there is a misunderstanding.

344
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,270
Who gives a used scarf as a gift?

345
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,898
Are you a pervert?

346
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,358
Pervert?

347
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,985
Wait. I'm not like that. Wait!

348
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,032
Gyehoon, what's that?

349
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,159
I'm the one who wants to ask.
What is this?

350
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,080
Where is the trash can?

351
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,329
-Boo!
-Oh, gosh!

352
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,373
Dahyun, it's me.

353
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,792
You startled me.

354
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,087
Did I startle you?
Sorry, I thought you'd know it was me.

355
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,298
How would I know that?

356
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,966
You're so weird.

357
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,844
Why wouldn't you know? We've been
living in the same neighborhood.

358
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,804
Is that right?

359
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,015
Gosh, you said the same thing last time.

360
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,224
I'm about to feel very sad.

361
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,768
Please don't do that again, okay?

362
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,519
It's a terrible hobby.

363
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,439
Okay. I won't do it again. Sorry.

364
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,200
Don't walk around alone at night.
It's very dangerous.

365
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,747
The night air feels refreshing.

366
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,223
RECIPIENT: NOH DAHYUN

367
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,867
Seriously, is someone stalking me?

368
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,011
FANTASTIC
FANTASTIC EVENT

369
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,990
RECIPIENT: NOH DAHYUN

370
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,000
Chef Eun Gyehoon wanted
to give it to you, so I put it there.

371
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,335
I didn't mean much by it,
so you don't need to refuse.

372
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,758
What's wrong with him? Seriously.

373
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,928
Would it be rude to ask
where you used to live as a kid?

374
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,929
How old are you?

375
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,098
Can we play rock-paper-scissors just once?

376
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,852
He did seem kind of strange.

377
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,442
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

378
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,570
LESS THAN 900, SEASON FOOD WITH TEARS
CHEF OF TEARS, CRYING AGAIN

379
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,448
There is a rumor that Chef Eun Gyehoon
lost his mind. Is that true?

380
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,908
He keeps laughing and crying.

381
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,076
-I'm disappointed in him.
-He kept asking where I live.

382
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,370
-He's not sane.
-I saw him laughing like a crazy person.

383
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,205
He asked me to play
rock-paper-scissors today.

384
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,874
I'm not sure, but he doesn't seem normal.

385
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,959
So he is actually crazy.

386
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,795
Gosh.

387
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,263
ELECTRONICS, COMPUTERS WHOLESALE

388
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,548
If she had become a grown-up,
she would look like this, right?

389
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,593
Yes. She'd look 70 to 80% similar to that.

390
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,743
Gyeongnidan-gil, Mangridan-gil,
Songridan-gil, Bamridan-gil,

391
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,955
Yeontral Park, Gongtral Park,
Ikseon-dong, Seongsu-dong,

392
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,873
Seorae Village, Bukchon,
Seochon, and Hongdae.

393
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,335
You're at the crossroad.
You can be fired anytime.

394
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,964
You keep laughing and crying
like a crazy person. I'd fire you too.

395
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,510
So what I mean is that we should
just open our own restaurant.

396
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,432
JIHWA-DONG

397
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,642
Jihwa-dong? I've never heard of it.

398
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:41,978
That's the place.

399
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,355
Is it the latest trendy spot?

400
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,069
Sure. I suppose it's better to do it
in an up-and-coming neighborhood.

401
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,698
Jihwa-dong. Jiridan-gil.

402
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,658
I'm excited about it.

403
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,827
Jihwa-dong. Jiridan-gil.

404
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,997
JIHWA-DONG

405
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,457
Please go to Jihwa-dong.

406
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,422
Is this your first time here?

407
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,259
Or it's the opposite.

408
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,218
Why, sir?

409
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,970
Who looks out the window these days?

410
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,556
Everyone's always staring at their phones.

411
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,434
You look familiar.

412
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,062
What brings you to Jihwa-dong?

413
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,314
I'm going to live here.

414
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,817
I just came empty-handed today,

415
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,486
but my belongings will arrive soon too.

416
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,030
But you look like you came here to die.

417
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:34,989
Pardon?

418
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,158
Nothing.

419
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,955
Welcome to our town, Jihwa-dong.

420
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,798
I'm policeman Ji Wontak. I was
just transferred to the Jihwa Patrol Unit.

421
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,342
I'm very happy to join
the Jihwa Patrol Unit.

422
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,468
I'll work hard.

423
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,095
All right!

424
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,013
A SAFE COUNTRY FOR CITIZENS,
THE POLICE WILL MAKE IT SO!

425
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,102
Assistant Inspector Hwang.
His name is Ji Wontak, a new probationer.

426
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,311
And she is…

427
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,358
She'll be your mentor
for the next six months.

428
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,610
-She's Jihwa Patrol Unit's--
-I'm not the centerpiece.

429
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,073
Right, she's not the centerpiece.
She's just an assistant inspector.

430
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,783
You just met, right?

431
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,035
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,623
Perhaps it's love at first sight.

433
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,292
After looking at your aged faces daily,

434
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,795
it's refreshing to look at his face.

435
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,046
Does that explain things?

436
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,507
Follow me.

437
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,968
You're already talking down to him?

438
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,137
It'll happen eventually anyway.

439
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,973
-Do you have a problem with that?
-Not at all, ma'am.

440
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,308
Great. Follow me. I'll show you around.

441
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,022
She's good at disciplining.

442
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,318
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

443
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,946
Here is police car number 11.
We'll take this to patrol today.

444
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,056
Get in. We'll be patrolling
for the next two hours.

445
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,477
I never thought we'd meet again like this.

446
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,533
Has it been three years since we broke up?

447
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,661
You look different like this.

448
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,622
Nothing changed.

449
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,916
You're used to seeing me naked.
I'm wearing clothes now.

450
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,627
Put on your seatbelt.

451
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,589
That's right. We were quite passionate--

452
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,760
If you bring up the past
and talk down to me one more time,

453
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,178
I'll kill you.

454
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,848
But this is the only place
we can talk privately--

455
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,142
Answer me.

456
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,938
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,538
FREE SAMPLE EVENT

458
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,456
Mom.

459
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,503
Let me explain.

460
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,963
These are…

461
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,339
PAYMENT OVERDUE NOTICE
UNPAID RENT!

462
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,806
Mom!

463
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,031
ROSE RESTAURANT

464
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,088
Hey, outta the way.

465
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,263
Gosh, seriously.

466
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,355
What? What's going on?

467
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,232
Mom, people can see us.
It's so embarrassing.

468
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,276
-Be quiet, you brat!
-Mom!

469
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,903
-Where are you going? Get back here.
-I can't hear them.

470
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,072
-Look at them.
-What a mess.

471
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,158
-Be quiet.
-Shouldn't we stop them?

472
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,409
I said be quiet. I can't hear.

473
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,412
You'll open a restaurant
for European contemporary cuisine

474
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,373
bistronomy, right?

475
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,292
-What are they saying?
-At a place like this?

476
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,878
-Shouldn't we go in and stop them?
-Enough already.

477
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,213
-What are they still doing?
-My goodness.

478
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,841
ROSE RESTAURANT

479
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,556
It looks like a haunted attraction.

480
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,321
Even in broad daylight.

481
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,782
This place is awesome.

482
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,952
It's the best, Gyehoon.

483
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,346
Gosh, I repeatedly told you
that public urination is prohibited here.

484
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,813
DEATH SENTENCE IF CAUGHT URINATING

485
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,566
This is the public urination prime zone.

486
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,236
Both people and dogs like urinating here.

487
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,197
A hot spot… for public urination?

488
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,408
Over here, police lady!

489
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,329
Why haven't you fixed the streetlamp yet?

490
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,666
Don't you know that the streetlamp
with the surveillance camera is broken?

491
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,377
Right, but that's not
our patrol unit's responsibility.

492
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,172
We submitted complaints everywhere.
You're all ignoring us.

493
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,508
I guess it'll take another dead body

494
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,926
for them to take action at once.

495
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,429
Don't say something so horrible.

496
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,057
As I've told you before,
the district office handles that.

497
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,018
But if I can, I'll check it for you.

498
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,562
-Do it now.
-We already told you.

499
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,730
-How come you don't listen?
-What's going on?

500
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,191
-Are you ignoring us?
-Are we not important to you?

501
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,110
-What's the issue?
-We asked already.

502
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,736
This is so ridiculous.

503
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,287
-How long do we have to wait?
-It's so terrible.

504
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,955
They didn't change at all.

505
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,833
-Fix it right away.
-I have to bring it up again.

506
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,626
Gyehoon, wait for me!

507
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,796
-Gyehoon, you have to wait for me!
-Jeez!

508
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,632
-I said, wait for me.
-Hurry up.

509
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,136
Gyehoon, you have to wait for me.

510
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,222
-I said, wait for me!
-What do you want?

511
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,640
-Gyehoon, hurry up!
-Seriously.

512
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,934
Mom and Dad told you to look after me.

513
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,812
You can just watch me play then.

514
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,606
You have to keep your promise.

515
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,233
My sister Gyeyoung was timid.

516
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,693
Stop crying.

517
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,280
I told you so many times that if you cry,
it makes me cry too since we're twins.

518
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,658
Because you're such a chicken,
it makes me look like one too.

519
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,577
I was annoyed
by my sister who was like that.

520
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,874
You can eat this while you wait for me.

521
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,292
Just stay right here, okay?

522
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,045
As a ten-year-old,
I cared more about my friends

523
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,214
than a promise I made
to my parents and my sister.

524
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,633
It was bound to happen.

525
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,593
I have to score!

526
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,060
Gyehoon.

527
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,461
Gyeyoung.

528
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,765
Don't fool around.

529
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,102
Gyeyoung.

530
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,063
Gyeyoung! Where are you?

531
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,858
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.

532
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,569
Gyeyoung!

533
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,239
That's how… Gyeyoung disappeared.

534
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,075
-Gyeyoung!
-Eun Gyeyoung!

535
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,661
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

536
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,997
-Gyeyoung! Where are you?
-Gyeyoung!

537
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,165
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

538
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,793
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

539
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,421
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung! Where are you?

540
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,548
-Where are you?
-Gyeyoung!

541
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,467
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

542
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,054
What's going to happen to Gyeyoung, honey?

543
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,974
Don't worry too much.
Gyeyoung is going to be fine.

544
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,767
-Gyeyoung!
-Eun Gyeyoung!

545
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,353
-Eun Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

546
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,981
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

547
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,608
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

548
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,402
-Gyeyoung, can you hear me?
-Gyeyoung!

549
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,529
-Can you hear me?
-Gyeyoung!

550
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,616
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

551
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,201
-Gyeyoung, where are you?
-Gyeyoung!

552
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,454
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

553
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,997
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

554
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,666
Are you all right?

555
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,856
What do you think, Gyehoon?

556
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,068
Can you sense

557
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,531
Gyeyoung's feelings?

558
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,244
Gyeyoung is…

559
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,916
very scared right now, Dad.

560
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,919
It's okay.

561
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,881
That's evidence that Gyeyoung is

562
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,592
still alive and safe.

563
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,178
Don't cry.

564
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,139
Gyehoon,

565
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,559
I know it's hard for you right now,
but you have to keep telling me

566
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,231
how Gyeyoung is doing

567
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,276
and what she is feeling.
You have to keep telling me, okay?

568
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,964
I was just ten years old,

569
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,426
but I could tell…

570
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,096
that Gyeyoung died.

571
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,147
What? What's wrong? Is she scared again?

572
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,192
It's okay.

573
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,528
That means Gyeyoung is…

574
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,031
Gyeyoung is still alive.

575
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,617
It's okay.

576
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,672
Since then, I could
no longer sense Gyeyoung's feelings,

577
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:05,554
and the police couldn't find
Gyeyoung's body or the culprit.

578
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,140
It became one of many unsolved cases.

579
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,521
But what does this phenomenon mean,
which is starting again

580
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,940
after 18 years?

581
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,277
Come here. You think you can run away?

582
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,238
-Either you die or I die, you brat!
-Gosh, Mom!

583
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,073
Don't you dare come back in!

584
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,618
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

585
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,796
Oh, my goodness. Lunatic.

586
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,339
Pardon? "Lunatic"?

587
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,257
Did you follow me all the way here?

588
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,511
What do you mean, I followed you here?

589
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,682
You live in this neighborhood?
What a coincidence.

590
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,018
"You live in this neighborhood?"

591
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,354
Coincidence, my foot.

592
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,772
Listen. You're caught red-handed.

593
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,358
What do you mean,
caught red-handed? I don't get it.

594
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,110
He kept asking about my neighborhood,
and ends up following me home.

595
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,570
Gosh, please don't exaggerate.

596
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,572
-Jeez.
-What's wrong with him?

597
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,616
I only asked once--

598
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,617
Forget it.

599
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,495
Don't you dare send me weird packages
and prowl around me again.

600
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,872
I guess you don't know.
Stalking is no longer a misdemeanor.

601
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,084
You may face up to three years in prison
or a maximum of 30 million won in fines.

602
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,879
I'll put you away,
you pervert stalker. Got that?

603
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,674
Mom!

604
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,679
Why is she calling me a pervert stalker?
I really don't get it.

605
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,640
That explains why we came here.

606
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,975
No, it's not like that.

607
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,520
-Gosh, he's putting all men to shame.
-No, it's not like that.

608
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,147
-How pathetic.
-No, it's really not like that.

609
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,482
-My goodness.
-Don't deny it.

610
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,276
Never!

611
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,528
-Yeah, right.
-Hey, come back here.

612
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,612
-My goodness.
-Hey.

613
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,490
-Take care.
-See you later.

614
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,909
You need to be careful.

615
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,911
He seemed normal.

616
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,289
Oh, gosh.

617
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,713
How is it that I run into her here?

618
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,107
Gyehoon,

619
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,610
are you really stalking that woman?

620
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,861
No, I'm not.

621
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,327
I'll start…

622
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,122
my restaurant here.

623
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,000
Gyehoon.

624
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,502
Let's do it together, Chef Cha.

625
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,254
Do you really need me?

626
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,423
You'll be fine alone.

627
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,509
I…

628
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,720
really need you, Jinhoo.

629
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,765
Gyehoon, why would you need
someone like me?

630
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,814
Clear out of the studio
and come back home.

631
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,570
We're going to eat dinner together.
Join us if you're free, Dahyun.

632
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,865
She's busy. Why are you so oblivious?

633
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,242
You're right. She's totally busy.

634
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,870
Who? Me?

635
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,715
Bus number 46 will be arriving shortly.

636
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,682
Are you looking for me?

637
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,688
Everyone knows that you're
secretly dating Mr. Lee Jingeun.

638
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,064
What?

639
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:47,651
He asked so earnestly not to spread rumors
and pretend as if I didn't know about it.

640
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,486
He said dating
among coworkers may look bad.

641
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,824
What is all this?

642
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,325
DATE ON OUR WAY HOME

643
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,035
You're really not dating?

644
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,913
Are you pretending as if you aren't dating
so that you can break up?

645
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,456
That's really wrong.

646
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,208
I said no.

647
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,585
We're really not dating.

648
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,967
There is a weird rumor going around.
Do you know about it by any chance?

649
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,468
The rumor that we're dating?

650
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,016
Aren't you dumbfounded?
What a ridiculous rumor.

651
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:19,975
Don't you think?

652
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,652
By any chance…

653
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,612
I'm asking just in case.

654
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,866
-The items--
-The gifts.

655
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,954
Are you the one who sent them?

656
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,124
You didn't like them?

657
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,501
I was really curious

658
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,879
why you didn't wear them

659
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,300
and why you kept throwing them away.

660
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,846
Are you also the one who spread

661
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,057
such a nonsense rumor that we're dating?

662
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,934
But we are dating.

663
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,397
No, we're not.
There's nothing between us. You know that.

664
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,192
You know it clearly. Why do you
keep saying such nonsense?

665
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,319
Then why did you smile at me?

666
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,362
Pardon?

667
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,950
You're the one
who always smiled at me first.

668
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:19,868
Have some coffee.

669
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,912
Let's smile.
They say, smiling brings blessings.

670
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,873
Here comes coffee.

671
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,750
I never smiled at you.

672
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,251
Here is your coffee, Ms. Yoon.

673
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,046
We had a meal together too.

674
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,508
No, everyone ate together.

675
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,303
I never knew that you could eat so well.

676
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,971
We also had a date on our way home.

677
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,432
We just ran into each other a few times
heading the same way.

678
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,269
Dahyun, you aren't generally like this.
I'm about to feel disappointed.

679
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,523
You're giving me goosebumps.
Have you lost your mind, Mr. Lee?

680
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,734
You seem upset. What's wrong?
What are you upset about?

681
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,070
It's okay. I'm very understanding.

682
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,697
-Just tell me, please.
-Mr. Lee Jingeun.

683
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,367
Please listen carefully
while I'm being nice.

684
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,411
I'm not interested in you at all,
and it'll remain that way going forward.

685
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,874
So please don't say crazy things
like we're dating ever again. Okay?

686
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,547
-Is there someone else now?
-So what if there's someone else?

687
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,340
-It's none of your business.
-See? I'm right.

688
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,259
Let go of me!

689
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,054
You lunatic.
I don't ever want to see your face again.

690
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,767
What? What's wrong with her?

691
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,228
Why is she doing this…

692
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,904
I never should've moved back in.

693
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,159
How am I going to live with my mom?

694
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,511
I think there is a misunderstanding.

695
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,096
Are you a pervert?

696
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,682
Don't you dare send me weird packages
and prowl around me again.

697
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,227
I'll put you away,
you pervert stalker. Got that?

698
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,900
Why is she calling me a pervert stalker?

699
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,930
She said he's a pervert.
It's okay to watch him then, right?

700
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,932
Is it? I'm not so sure.

701
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,892
Perverts have their rights too.
Don't you think?

702
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,145
-Rights, my foot.
-What kind of food will it be?

703
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,606
-Chinese food? Snacks?
-I doubt it'll be Korean food.

704
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,816
I hope it's a bakery.

705
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,944
-A bakery sounds good.
-Yes, a bakery.

706
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,363
-I like soboro bread.
-Bakery?

707
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,491
It's not going to be a bakery.
I'm opening a bistronomy.

708
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,493
-A what "nom"?
-Oh…

709
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,998
A "bistronomy" is
an intermediate form between bistro,

710
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,918
which means casual dining, and gastronomy,
which means authentic gourmet.

711
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,546
It means a restaurant where you can enjoy
high-quality food in a casual atmosphere.

712
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,967
Originally, I was going to do
French contemporary fine dining…

713
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,179
What? I couldn't even understand.
It's just a restaurant after all.

714
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,808
Who told you to do that?

715
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,559
I asked her to do it.

716
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,814
Why can't you just leave her alone?

717
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,065
Gosh, what an eyesore.

718
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,484
Hey, don't hang around at the restaurant.

719
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,403
Don't do anything here. Put that down.

720
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,905
Get out now.

721
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,117
Go to the library and study.
You'll take the civil service exam, right?

722
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,868
Yes.

723
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,585
-Go get me some radish before you go.
-But you told me to go to the library.

724
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,671
Go after getting the radish.

725
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,257
You just told me not to do anything here.
Make up your mind.

726
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,719
Stop grumbling, okay? That brat.

727
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,096
Get soybean sprouts and water celery too.

728
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,848
And an energy drink too!

729
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,100
I need money.

730
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,781
Wait!

731
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,034
I wasn't prowling around you.
It's a coincidence.

732
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,660
I'm really not a pervert stalker.

733
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,455
Of course, I know that you're not.

734
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,789
You do? What a relief--

735
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,000
Wait. You do know?

736
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,254
That was my misunderstanding, sir.
You weren't the stalker.

737
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,340
I'm very sorry.

738
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,220
-No thanks.
-Pardon?

739
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,138
Apology not accepted.

740
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,643
Can you just accept it? I had a situation
that caused the misunderstanding.

741
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,770
Not accepted.

742
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,314
We'll keep running into each other.
It'll be very uncomfortable.

743
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,859
It's already, very, terribly,
and indescribably uncomfortable.

744
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,653
Why? Everyone in the entire neighborhood
thinks that I am…

745
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,699
a pervert stalker.

746
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,494
Gosh, you must be feeling so upset.

747
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,416
I'll repair the damages as best as I can.

748
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,211
I'll go around and tell everyone
that you're not a pervert.

749
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:25,006
Sir, can you let it slide just this once
like your generous-looking face?

750
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,466
Please don't try to flatter me.

751
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,093
And don't call me "sir."

752
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,095
I'm not trying to flatter you.
I mean it, Chef.

753
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,471
So stop being upset and forgive--

754
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,145
Gosh.

755
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,815
You didn't have to kneel down.

756
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,317
It's not what you think.

757
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,655
I see. It wasn't.

758
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,117
Gosh, he's so heartless.

759
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,792
-You must be in pain.
-You got your revenge.

760
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,377
Not really.

761
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,839
What goes around comes around.
Good triumphs over evil. That's all.

762
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,468
Can you help me?

763
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,310
It's not broken.

764
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,021
You seem saddened by that.

765
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,024
Just a little.

766
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,554
Are you able to walk?

767
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,640
Yes, of course.

768
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,730
You're accepting my apology then, right?

769
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,191
-No.
-Come on, please accept it.

770
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,068
-I don't want to.
-You hold grudges, don't you?

771
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,613
-Yes.
-But I even hurt my leg.

772
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,407
I think you're faking it.

773
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,470
Why is this town so small?

774
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,693
Not that leg.

775
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,445
The other leg.

776
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,866
-Pardon?
-The other day,

777
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,409
you were limping on the other leg.

778
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,332
You have to have a good memory
to deceive people, you know?

779
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,857
Sir, we want to…

780
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,736
throw away everything here.
So please put them outside.

781
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,823
The plywood and all the little items.

782
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,283
Please throw them all out.

783
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,571
Dahyun.

784
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,121
Dahyun!

785
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,248
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

786
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,333
Mom!

787
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,460
Wait. Dahyun.

788
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,255
I.

789
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,468
-Gosh. Mom, you laugh at everything.
-I am.

790
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,136
Just watch it.

791
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,057
Dahyun, let's talk. Please?

792
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,850
Dahyun, let's talk.

793
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,940
Seriously!

794
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,653
Grandma!

795
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,738
I said, let's talk. Okay?

796
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,949
-Get off of me.
-Come on!

797
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,701
Mom!

798
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,142
After that, my memory is hazy.

799
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,866
When I woke up,

800
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,201
he was…

801
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,621
dead.

802
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,807
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

803
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,309
-One moment, please.
-Let go of me.

804
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,479
-May I help you?
-Sir,

805
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,190
-please lie down here.
-You said, 24 years old?

806
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,983
-Yes, 24 years old.
-Okay.

807
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,862
Sir, drink this and wake up, okay?

808
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,405
You have to drink this, okay?

809
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,742
You've been waiting, right?

810
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,371
We usually handle things on-site nowadays,
so the station doesn't get so busy.

811
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,289
But it's so hectic today.

812
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,582
It's a wild Friday night.

813
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,334
It's okay.

814
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,380
So how may I help you?

815
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:05,800
The thing is…

816
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,513
Well… I…

817
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,474
-Let go! I said, let go!
-What are you gonna do about it?

818
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,102
-Ouch, that hurts.
-I said, let go!

819
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,188
-I said, let go of me.
-What's wrong with you, punk?

820
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,816
-Let go of me!
-Did you just hit me?

821
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,317
Why don't you sell cigarettes?

822
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,152
He was collapsed on the street.

823
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,572
Uncuff me. Uncuff me, you punk!

824
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,824
You're all dead meat. Uncuff me!

825
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,451
Hey, uncuff me now!
Why aren't you taking it off?

826
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,579
-Darn it.
-Gosh, seriously.

827
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,873
-Let go of me.
-You're here.

828
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,919
-Gosh. Hey!
-Let go.

829
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,339
-Gosh. Hey!
-Both of you, put your hands down.

830
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:48,134
-Please stay still.
-Darn it!

831
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,261
-Sir.
-Hey, let go.

832
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,180
I'll come back another time. Bye.

833
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,267
-Put your hands down.
-We'll do it right away.

834
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,562
-Let go of me.
-That's enough. Come over here.

835
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,796
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

836
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,056
Mom.

837
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,058
Grandma.

838
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,279
What happened?

839
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,365
The thing is…

840
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,368
it was self-defense.

841
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,287
That scum was trying to kill me.

842
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,456
Oh, my goodness.

843
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,129
So where did you go just now?

844
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,384
-I went to turn myself in, but--
-What?

845
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,638
Did you do it?

846
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,641
No, I couldn't.

847
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,563
What am I going to do now?

848
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,819
It's okay.

849
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,823
I don't remember this moment
very clearly either.

850
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,043
Stop crying and listen to me carefully.

851
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,462
I'll take care of everything,

852
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,048
so just do as I say.

853
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,011
Pull yourself together!

854
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,887
Got it?

855
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,514
Okay.

856
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,403
Only later, did it come to mind.

857
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,712
That day, my mom and grandma…

858
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,548
seemed quite adept at it.

859
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,930
I'll go get the truck.

860
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,474
Don't worry and go.

861
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,863
They seemed as if they've done
something like this before.

862
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,101
-Jinhoo.
-Yes?

863
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,728
-Go sleep comfortably now.
-Okay.

864
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,117
Why did they throw this out?

865
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,786
Wait a second. Why is it out here?

866
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,000
No, I only asked them to throw away
cupboards and things like that.

867
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,212
We can just put it back inside.

868
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,595
-Are you pulling it?
-Yes. Are you pushing it?

869
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,513
Why is it so heavy?

870
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:06,851
Oh, it's moving now.

871
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,609
You aren't pushing, are you?

872
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:16,986
Turn here.

873
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,655
We have to bring it inside the store.

874
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,491
Pull it.

875
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,140
Slowly.

876
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,368
LINK

877
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,122
Hello.

878
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,999
-Can I help you?
-Pardon?

879
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,212
-Go!
-What will you do now?

880
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,838
We'll get it back at all costs.

881
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,801
I'll try to find out the passcode
or whatever to get the refrigerator back.

882
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,345
And victims aren't the only ones
who come to the police.

883
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,638
Perpetrators come too.

884
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,349
What happened last night?

885
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,059
Who did this to you?

886
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:13,227
Why do you care?

887
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,895
Because I do! So who did this?

888
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,565
If this happened to my younger sister,

889
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,901
that attacker would've died by my hands.

890
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,987
I'm going to turn myself in.

891
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,781
If push comes to shove, we'll have to

892
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,408
kill him.

893
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,039
