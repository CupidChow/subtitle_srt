2
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:58,558
Thinking back, it began a long time ago.

3
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,937
I, Noh Dahyun,
have always suffered because of men.

4
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,440
-I told you to get out of my way.
-Some people

5
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,941
grew up in the same neighborhood

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,319
-as those who became celebrities.
-Jeez. Stop it.

7
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,945
But as you can see…

8
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,283
Despite all the decent men in the world,

9
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,576
the ones I ended up with were…

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
Let's mix them together.

11
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,831
…filthy.

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,875
My mom told me to break up. Sorry!

13
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,377
-Mom…
-A mama's boy.

14
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,796
I'm here.

15
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,468
-A cheater.
-Hey, Dahyun.

16
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,053
You crazy…

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,890
And I was continuously
surrounded by perverts.

18
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,935
And plenty of them at that.

19
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,775
I thought I had a decent superior.

20
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,861
But he turned out to be
a habitual molester.

21
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,821
Mom!

22
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,156
And that crazy stalker
turned me into a murderer.

23
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,537
So I promised myself…

24
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,586
that I would never get involved
with another man ever again.

25
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,590
But then…

26
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,226
You came into my life.

27
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,478
Who did this to you? Answer me.

28
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,192
Would you like some food?

29
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,589
What should I do?

30
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,148
I think…

31
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,945
I've developed feelings for you.

32
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,409
Perhaps, this was the confession
that I wanted to make.

33
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,245
But instead, I said…

34
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,039
I killed someone.

35
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,676
It's safe to say

36
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,221
that I've gone insane.

37
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,394
CHEESY, BUT DESTINY

38
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,025
Can you kill someone for me?

39
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,675
Hey, what will you do
about your belly fat?

40
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,969
Dance to the beat. Come on!

41
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,346
One, two.

42
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,898
Am I dreaming?

43
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,734
How can we have the same dream?

44
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,820
Damn it.

45
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,072
-Watch your language.
-Don't hit me.

46
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,782
So we're not dreaming.

47
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,200
No, we're not.

48
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,677
Did I go too far with my joke?
Was that too terrifying?

49
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,433
Don't take it so seriously.

50
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,436
I'm terrible at reading the room.

51
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,729
I talk nonsense at times.

52
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,230
And I'm a bit drunk too.

53
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,483
-And you killed someone too.
-That's right.

54
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,194
No, I didn't.

55
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,280
How did it happen?

56
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,865
I said it was a joke.

57
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,491
Who else knows about this?

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,495
I tend to make
a slip of the tongue at times.

59
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,039
We all make mistakes.

60
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,875
Of course. I know that very well.

61
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,002
You lied about having feelings for me.

62
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,545
You trespassed into my restaurant.

63
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,381
I see you and your family
peeking in here all the time.

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,342
You hide or run
whenever you see the police.

65
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,344
I'm sure they're all honest mistakes.

66
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,762
That's just--

67
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,680
Sure, I can understand everything
up to that.

68
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,309
But how could you… kill someone?

69
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,940
How will you take care of this?

70
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,151
What if people get wind of this?

71
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,154
They won't.
You're the only one who knows about this.

72
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,281
So you acknowledged it.

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,535
I didn't.

74
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,914
In any case, I'd appreciate it
if you could keep this a secret--

75
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,292
Secrets spread like wildfire
the moment you talk about it.

76
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,795
It's not a secret anymore
once you open up to someone.

77
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,588
I only did it because I trusted you.

78
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,383
Why would you trust me?
Don't trust anyone.

79
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,138
If you continue telling others about this,

80
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,265
it's only a matter of time
the police get you.

81
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,642
Do you understand me?

82
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,188
Yes, I do.

83
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,524
Great.

84
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,402
You're threatening me
and saying you'd expose it.

85
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,032
-This isn't a threat--
-You know what?

86
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,829
The first time is always the hardest.

87
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,623
Then it gets easier from then on.

88
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
Did you see it?

89
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,721
I did.

90
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,934
When a married woman has wounds
on her body, it's pretty obvious.

91
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,186
Eight out of ten times, the culprit is…

92
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,857
Shut up! Will you just shut up?

93
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,654
Honey, please!

94
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,659
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I got the hang of it.

95
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,665
I feel bad but still…

96
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,667
This isn't right.

97
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,253
How dare she threaten us? I'm speechless.

98
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,713
If we say no…

99
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,506
She'll report us to the police.

100
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
Darn it.

101
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,596
I won't sympathize.

102
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,557
Anyone that knows about the incident

103
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,852
and gets in the way of Dahyun…

104
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,731
I'll get rid of them.

105
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,363
Are you threatening to kill me right now?

106
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,533
Of course not. I'm just saying. But…

107
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,451
But?

108
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,286
Sometimes what we say becomes true.

109
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,496
So you are threatening me.

110
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,332
I'm just saying we should both
be careful of what we say.

111
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,807
Gyehoon.

112
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,976
I…

113
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,020
-killed…
-Someone.

114
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,929
Gyehoon, I…

115
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,639
-killed…
-Someone.

116
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,349
Gyehoon.

117
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,103
-I killed…
-I killed someone.

118
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,815
-I killed someone.
-I killed someone.

119
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,393
To a guy who makes my heart flutter
for the first time in years,

120
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,437
I confessed today

121
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,856
that I killed someone,

122
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,358
and I threatened
to kill him too if need be.

123
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,975
Should we bury that scumbag?

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,936
We can't bury them
every time we become annoyed.

125
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,606
This country isn't that big to begin with.

126
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,734
You're right. It's a pity
that we live in a small country.

127
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,364
If push comes to shove, we must do it.

128
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,116
Dahyun…

129
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,411
should never find out.

130
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,250
Of course not. She should be in the dark.

131
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,602
EPISODE 4

132
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,561
Tell that thing to come and eat, Mom.

133
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,815
Jeez. That's no way
to talk about your daughter.

134
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
Dahyun, get ready for breakfast.

135
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,945
Please tell her
that this thing isn't hungry, Grandma.

136
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,072
Tell that thing to watch what she says

137
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,325
and to just eat while I'm being nice, Mom.

138
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,245
Tell her that this thing
is too terrified to eat, Grandma.

139
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,540
Ask that thing
to just zip it and eat, Mom.

140
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,209
Ask her how I'm supposed to eat
if I can't open my mouth, Grandma.

141
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,627
She can't eat with her mouth shut.

142
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,088
-That little--
-What? Are you going to bury me too?

143
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,641
I said I didn't want to eat.

144
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,352
Just leave me alone.

145
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,689
And if I do? Tell me.

146
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,609
-Will you manage on your own?
-Go away.

147
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,613
You weren't born to make your mom proud?

148
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,407
-You want to make your own decisions?
-That hurts!

149
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,701
Then you go
and part-time at his restaurant?

150
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,288
A passing dog would laugh.
Just keel over from laughing so hard.

151
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,008
Look here! Look at me!

152
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,760
We need a new fridge too.

153
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,054
I wonder if I can get one secondhand.

154
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,306
Did you find what you were looking for?

155
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,235
I remember it now.

156
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,196
That day,

157
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,657
I felt her fear.

158
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,256
What? What is it?

159
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,467
You startled me.

160
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,225
What did I do?

161
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,770
Why are you here already?

162
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,229
Should I be scolded for coming early?

163
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,277
I'm certain it was in here.
Where did it go?

164
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,946
What? What are you talking about?

165
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,616
Was it you?

166
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,910
Me? What do you mean?

167
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,329
Are you hiding anything from me?

168
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,208
Jeez. What could I possibly
be hiding from…

169
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,762
I'd like to know
if these two are brother and sister.

170
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,141
It's a matter of utmost importance.
The fate of someone is on the line.

171
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,648
-What is this?
-What?

172
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,776
What do you mean?

173
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,028
Come clean already.

174
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,531
I'm not hiding anything.

175
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,584
Tell me.

176
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,337
What have you done?

177
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,591
I'll come clean later.

178
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,635
Do it now.

179
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,555
Gyehoon, don't you trust me?

180
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,848
I'll tell you when it's time.

181
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,184
I don't trust you. I don't trust anyone.

182
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,773
Who is the most suspicious neighbor?

183
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,276
All of them. Every single one of them.

184
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,370
That's a good one.

185
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,042
-Bye.
-See you.

186
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,502
But the most suspicious ones are…

187
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,259
-Bye.
-Don't go. Hey.

188
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,931
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

189
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
-Bye.
-Just quit.

190
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,855
Take that hood off.

191
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,983
-Hello, ladies.
-Hey.

192
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,031
Hello.

193
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,993
You got a job?

194
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,370
Yes, I need to go back soon.

195
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,538
At a nearby restaurant?

196
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,373
Yes. Why?

197
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,460
Why would you get a job there
with your skills and academic background?

198
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,922
Life doesn't always go your way.

199
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,257
Forget about that. What's with your face?

200
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,009
What's going on?

201
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
Look at those dark circles.

202
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,888
It's unbearable to see.

203
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,724
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

204
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,105
-You see…
-Yes?

205
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,191
Never mind.

206
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,444
You see, there's this guy.

207
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,695
He treats me well.

208
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,448
But he says he doesn't like me
and tells me not to like him either.

209
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,367
-But he's still nice to me.
-That's sympathy.

210
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
But he's not the type
to sympathize with anyone.

211
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,124
He feels a bit dangerous, cold,

212
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,668
and terrifying.

213
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,878
He threatens me too.

214
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,755
-Just like you?
-Me?

215
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,133
Yes. What did you do to Mr. Lee Jingeun?

216
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,719
What?

217
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,680
Don't you have something to do with it?

218
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,977
What do you mean?

219
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,395
He said you guys were dating.

220
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,188
But you said he was stalking you.

221
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,524
After making different claims,

222
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,692
he disappeared.

223
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,945
He pretty much vanished into thin air.

224
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,825
Well… I'm pretty sure he's doing well.

225
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,034
Someone came by.

226
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,954
They said they couldn't reach him
and didn't even know if he was alive.

227
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,084
Who? Who was it?

228
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,335
I think they said they were family.

229
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
Why didn't it cross my mind

230
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,135
that Lee Jingeun had family?

231
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,013
I don't know the details.

232
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,348
But be careful.

233
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,643
That person looked a bit strange.

234
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,645
I sensed craziness in their eyes.

235
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,790
Hey, honey.

236
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,294
Honey!

237
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,297
Hello.

238
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,673
Are you guilty of something?

239
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,052
-Sorry?
-You just seemed pretty startled.

240
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,473
Jeez. You look a bit rough today,
but you're still beautiful.

241
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,266
Thank you.

242
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,186
Let's go. I passed the interview.

243
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,021
We'll be working together.
How great is that?

244
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,314
I see.

245
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,900
What do I do? I'm on cloud nine.

246
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,201
Let's see how this pans out
for the next three months.

247
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,911
Then we'll talk further.

248
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,289
Sure. That'll be more than enough time.

249
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,791
In many ways.

250
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,836
By the way,
what's the name of our restaurant?

251
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,005
I haven't come up with one yet.

252
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,884
When will we open?

253
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,430
I have no set date yet,
but it'll happen soon.

254
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,848
Your target customers?

255
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,351
My target customers?

256
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,853
I haven't decided on that yet.

257
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,898
But I'll probably target the epicures
who enjoy culture and art.

258
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,818
-There are none in this neighborhood.
-Exactly.

259
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,569
With these luxury ingredients?

260
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,780
-Can you even make a profit?
-Exactly.

261
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,326
I haven't calculated it yet,
but I'll try to fit the budget.

262
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,036
That's strange.

263
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,705
Most chefs move as a team

264
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,457
even when they find a new job
or open up their own restaurant.

265
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,584
But why is it just you two?

266
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,170
How could I bring

267
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,465
my beloved subordinates here
when I can't even guarantee our success?

268
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,468
Then what does that make me?

269
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,764
You're… You're here
because I just adored you too much

270
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,474
to let you be on your own.

271
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,811
You'll pay us, right?

272
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,187
Do you make enough profit?

273
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,814
He must be well-off.

274
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,607
From what I know, he's pretty comfortable.

275
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,484
Your parents must be wealthy.

276
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,903
This world is just so darn unfair.

277
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,196
You can say that again.

278
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,531
That was a nice one.

279
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,285
But why here of all places?

280
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,207
Why would you open a restaurant here
when you're well-off and famous?

281
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,460
Well…

282
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,172
I want to improve the neighborhood economy

283
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,467
and help the unemployed youth.

284
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,384
Are you a politician?

285
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,927
Are you running for office?

286
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,597
Ms. Noh, make sure
you thoroughly read the manuals.

287
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,224
Especially the cleaning manual.

288
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,227
Chef Lee, you have your own knife, right?

289
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,645
I need a new one.

290
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,357
If it's okay with you, you can use ours.

291
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,733
Sure. I'll take a look at it.

292
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,276
Right. The knife.

293
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,654
Excuse me. The knife.

294
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,947
Right.

295
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,368
This.

296
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,580
You bought these limited edition knives
made from olive trees from Sicily.

297
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,208
-Right.
-One of the knives is missing.

298
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,668
I can't find it anywhere. Where did it go?

299
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,754
What?

300
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,597
No, I didn't use a knife.

301
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,337
-Where are you?
-I'm here. Why?

302
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,300
What were you doing?

303
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,594
I was looking for this.
You're going to have some coffee?

304
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,804
Yeah, I will.

305
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,348
-I'll boil the water.
-I got it.

306
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,697
Have you gone crazy?

307
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,115
Sorry?

308
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,619
You threatened to kill me
if I didn't watch what I said.

309
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,663
But you're the one spilling everything.

310
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,291
-Right.
-And you didn't use a knife?

311
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,625
Then what did you use?

312
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,086
Right.

313
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,672
What's wrong?
Why don't you just tell everyone about it?

314
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,592
-Right.
-What's with this reaction?

315
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,764
Don't tell me something else happened.

316
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,685
"That dead guy's family
is looking for me."

317
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,521
"My mom and grandma
are scheming to kill someone else."

318
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,316
"Right. And you're not an exception."

319
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,861
I can't tell you that, can I?

320
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,406
Nothing happened. I'm completely fine.

321
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,954
Don't lie to me.
I know you're nervous and anxious.

322
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,707
-I'm not.
-You can't fool me.

323
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,584
Your thoughts and emotions can be--

324
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,421
What about my thoughts and emotions?

325
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,551
I can tell them
just by looking at your face.

326
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,514
-Really?
-Really.

327
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,390
You're very easy to read.

328
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,561
Anyway,

329
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,689
let's both be careful.

330
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,024
Okay?

331
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,989
I have a question.

332
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,574
What is it?

333
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,369
Why are you so…

334
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,122
concerned about me?

335
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,421
You're giving me the wrong idea.

336
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,238
What are you looking at?

337
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,033
Is there something going on between them?

338
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,910
Not at all. Never.

339
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,537
I see.

340
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,542
It should be that way.

341
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,295
You're Lee Jingeun's girlfriend after all.

342
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,425
Where in the world did you hide him?

343
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,468
Eunjung.

344
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,221
Do you have feelings for Gyehoon?

345
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,142
-No.
-Then do you have feelings for Dahyun?

346
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,394
You're funny.

347
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,564
Don't act so friendly toward me
all of a sudden.

348
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,983
You're making me flustered and happy.

349
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,111
What is it?

350
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,572
It's nothing.

351
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,961
"Hello, here is the result
of the DNA test you requested."

352
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,798
I'm so nervous.

353
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,026
You're a grown man. Why do you want me
to walk with you in this cold weather?

354
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,445
I told you.
This neighborhood creeps me out.

355
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,909
Just say it.
I know you have something to tell me.

356
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,121
Why did you move here?

357
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,917
What's the real reason?

358
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,338
Why are you so curious?

359
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,215
Was it really to find your sister?

360
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,762
No.

361
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,971
Then?

362
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,724
I am looking for someone.

363
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,018
But it's not her.

364
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,478
Then who is it?

365
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,815
Tell me.

366
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,239
You must be tired. Go rest up.

367
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,449
Okay. We'll talk again tomorrow.

368
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,492
Okay.

369
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,635
I know…

370
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,556
who you are.

371
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,045
You also

372
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,339
recognize me, don't you?

373
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,515
Yes.

374
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,185
I do.

375
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,145
Are you…

376
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,689
also back to kill me?

377
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,441
What if I did?

378
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,409
Do you know why…

379
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
I haven't acted on it yet?

380
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,625
If it really was you…

381
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,586
If I find proof that you did it…

382
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,921
Once I know for sure…

383
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,382
Then…

384
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,430
I'll kill you myself.

385
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,109
What's going on?

386
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,781
What are you doing?

387
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,080
He greeted me, so I said hello back.
Is that a problem?

388
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,419
Mr. Han, come with me.

389
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,421
And you, chef.

390
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,549
Go home.

391
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,266
I'm watching you.

392
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,809
With my eyes wide open.

393
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,155
Here you go, ma'am.

394
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,740
Thanks.

395
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,953
Has the Geumdo Villa killer
been caught yet?

396
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,831
I'm not sure. Beats me.

397
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,921
…Ma'am. And I'm not curious either, ma'am.

398
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,173
You have no sense of duty.

399
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,342
I would if they raised my salary.

400
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,927
I'm barely getting paid any right now.

401
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,975
Can you believe the guy
who urinates publicly did it?

402
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,645
A suspect of a cold case?

403
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,772
-Still--
-Jihwamadang-ro 31.

404
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,608
A drunk man got in an argument,

405
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,901
-vomited, and fainted.
-Again?

406
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,444
This is patrol 11. We're on it.

407
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,362
Let's go.

408
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,698
This is the third time
a drunk has vomited tonight.

409
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,075
Gosh, I'm already getting nauseous.

410
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,995
I won't be having an appetite
for some time.

411
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,833
Hey, damn it!

412
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,793
Do you know who I am?

413
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,796
Are you okay, sir? Wake up.

414
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,506
Open the door!

415
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,551
Who are you guys?

416
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,096
Don't do anything foolish.

417
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,183
Officer Ji.

418
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,731
Get up, sir.

419
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,108
Who are you?

420
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,113
Hey, it's you.

421
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,199
The police lady.

422
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,451
Wake up and go home.

423
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,497
Let's go. I should get home.

424
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,711
Officer Ji.

425
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,969
I'm sorry.

426
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,391
Sorry.

427
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,477
Gosh. I'm sorry.

428
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,605
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

429
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,497
We had no idea all these years.

430
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,626
In the past, I was able to hide my wounds.

431
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,087
But something
must've gotten to him lately.

432
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,715
He became even worse.

433
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,426
Hiding your wounds
doesn't change the fact that he beat you.

434
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,264
Why would you hide them
when he's the one to blame?

435
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,765
Have you reported him to the police?

436
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,518
And if they let him go?

437
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,355
"Let's die together.
I'll kill you then kill myself as well."

438
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,690
He always says that.

439
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,650
Then you could've just run away.

440
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,736
Do you think that didn't cross my mind?

441
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,365
You see, I have many family members.

442
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,160
My mom is still alive and well.

443
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,537
I have sisters,

444
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,873
a brother, and their kids.

445
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,876
It's obvious
that he'll harass them if I run away.

446
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,212
So how can I be selfish
and run away just to save myself?

447
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,922
How can I?

448
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,346
It'll break my mom's heart
if she ever finds out that he beats me.

449
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,643
She's the one person
who shouldn't know about this.

450
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,550
You gained weight.

451
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,636
You too, Grandma.

452
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,097
Have you been eating
tasty food without me?

453
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,266
I'm bloated from crying all night.

454
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,518
Why did you cry?

455
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,729
Because of you.
Because you're eating away at me.

456
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,441
Did someone come to our restaurant?

457
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,904
Who? What for? Did you do something?

458
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,157
Never mind.

459
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,368
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

460
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,871
What about you?

461
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,958
Did you hear anything?

462
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,711
About someone being hired
or threatened by anyone?

463
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,508
Hired or threatened to do what?

464
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,759
Is something going on?

465
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,595
-No.
-Something's going on.

466
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,805
-It's nothing.
-It's something.

467
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,973
I'm telling you it's not!

468
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,143
Just be quiet and eat.

469
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,105
What is it?

470
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,613
Hey, just leave that there.

471
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,866
I'm stronger than I look.

472
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,660
No, I don't need it.
I already have enough fertilizer.

473
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,038
Darn it. You could've told me sooner.

474
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,418
You do know that the market
is full of vegetables, right?

475
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,794
What's the point of all this?

476
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,798
All chefs dream of using good ingredients
that they grow themselves.

477
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,342
You might as well go fish too.

478
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,511
How did you know?
I fish from time to time.

479
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,096
Of course, you do.

480
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,605
I sense your dissatisfaction
by the way you're shoveling.

481
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,522
That's not true.

482
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,608
Let's make this clear.

483
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,443
No one told you to help me out.

484
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,362
The other two are busy downstairs
developing new recipes.

485
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,115
But as a waitress, I have nothing to do

486
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,825
since we're not even open yet.

487
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,245
It's like placing a desk
in the office hallway

488
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,749
and not giving me any work to do.
You're pushing me to quit.

489
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,376
So I should give this my all.

490
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,756
Speaking from experience?

491
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,469
I have lots of experience
with various things.

492
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,194
What a brat. How dare she?

493
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,449
I'm sorry to say this.

494
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,035
But you're the only hope I have.

495
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:32,124
I have no choice
but to threaten you with Dahyun.

496
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,919
She continued to threaten us
even while crying.

497
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,587
How infuriating.

498
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,630
Be the bigger person.

499
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,424
Just pity her, and that's that.

500
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,302
I do feel bad for her.

501
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,098
Of course, I do.
I know since I've been beaten before.

502
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,434
Of course. You were a victim as well.

503
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,144
Even still,

504
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,522
this is unacceptable.

505
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,983
What if Dahyun gets hurt?

506
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,151
Be the bigger person.
Nothing good comes out of anger.

507
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,028
You always say that.

508
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,905
You have to be the bigger person.
You must.

509
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,282
But I can't!

510
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,325
Be the bigger person.

511
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,493
You can do it.

512
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,662
Forget it. I can't.

513
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,999
Wait. Mom.

514
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,377
Mom, wait.

515
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,298
Let's not be reckless.
How about we think this over?

516
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,634
Wait. Mom. Hold on. Mom!

517
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,303
Darn it!

518
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,523
Jeez!

519
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,442
Come on!

520
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,820
Mom, where are you going? Hold on!

521
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,796
Damn it…

522
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,298
Hey!

523
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,178
Who the hell are you?

524
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,141
You little… Do you want to die?

525
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,166
Mom!

526
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,585
-Mom!
-Mom, where are you going?

527
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,004
-Why are you following us?
-Just go, both of you!

528
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,381
-Let's talk!
-Just go!

529
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,091
-Just stop!
-Grandma!

530
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,176
Tell me where you're going!

531
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,095
Mom, wait!

532
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,596
Mom!

533
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,978
Why am I looking for her?

534
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,108
Darn it.

535
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,698
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

536
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,285
We meet again.

537
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,005
Unfortunately, yes.

538
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,357
Mom!

539
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,780
Why…

540
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,751
I'm glad you came. There's--

541
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,130
Stay there! Put that down!

542
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,299
No, you got the wrong idea.

543
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,384
We need back up here.

544
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,553
-This is a misunderstanding.
-We need backup.

545
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,805
-Put that down!
-Come on.

546
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,724
I mean, I will put it down.

547
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,768
He's dying here. How frustrating.

548
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,577
-They're back again?
-Again?

549
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:42,333
Jeez, do you miss us that much? Do you?

550
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,001
You're regulars here.

551
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,504
What is it this time? Tell me!

552
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,297
Special assault.

553
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,302
Look at all those weapons.

554
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,346
Why did you do it?

555
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:56,847
It wasn't us.

556
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,683
I'm telling you.
He was already down when we arrived.

557
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,935
The whole time.

558
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,854
Then what's all this?

559
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:08,609
Well… You see… It just happened that…

560
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,029
You just found us
with these tools in our hands.

561
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,740
I know it's hard to believe,
but we're telling the truth.

562
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,534
So you do know. Yes, it's hard to believe.

563
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,496
All right. Did you resent the victim?

564
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,872
Perhaps, money issues?

565
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,124
No, I don't know that man.

566
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,543
What about you two?

567
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,547
So you do know him.

568
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,215
What? Do you?

569
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,638
We just barely know his face.

570
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,139
That's all.

571
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,945
Do you really not remember anything?

572
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,322
Anything will be helpful.

573
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,370
Yes, sir.

574
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,830
Okay.

575
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,081
Call us anytime.

576
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,041
What's going on?

577
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,795
I see. The regulars are here.

578
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,089
Hello.

579
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,549
-Be quiet.
-Yes, sir.

580
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,886
The victim is refusing to testify.

581
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,015
I just spoke with the one
who reported it. The witness.

582
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:21,932
Just cut to the chase.

583
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,060
The culprit…

584
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,692
was male.

585
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,155
He was tall.

586
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,617
He was wearing a black jacket
and a black hat.

587
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,746
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

588
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,338
Get up.

589
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:57,051
How could you bring us here
and threaten us when we were innocent?

590
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,928
Is this the true face
of the Korean police?

591
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,140
How dare you? Who do you think we are?

592
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,686
Minor Offenses Act,
article three, section two.

593
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,730
"The hiding and carrying of a weapon."

594
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,776
"Those who hide and carry tools
without a valid reason

595
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:18,322
can be fined a maximum of 100,000 won,
detained, or penalized."

596
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,492
That's right. We could fine each of you.

597
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,577
-Should I fine them?
-Hey!

598
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:28,165
Sir, we're so sorry. We truly are.

599
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,958
This won't ever happen again.

600
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,212
We'll be more careful.

601
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,255
-A hundred thousand won?
-Let's bow.

602
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,890
-Hello.
-Hello.

603
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,351
Why are they still following us?

604
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,815
And why is she there?

605
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,568
Just go. Don't be spotted. I'm humiliated.

606
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,695
She's a bit suspicious.

607
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,323
Here.

608
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,427
You were hired?

609
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,471
Then you should've told me so.

610
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,266
Nothing good
would've come out of telling you.

611
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,184
It's all my fault.

612
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:35,232
You were asked to be
a contract killer all because of me.

613
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,359
It's not your fault.

614
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,820
Those scumbags are to blame.

615
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,490
Let's stop arguing.

616
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,950
Here.

617
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,870
No more arguing, okay?

618
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,622
I'm really sorry.

619
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,543
I'm truly sorry
for what I'm putting you guys through.

620
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,545
Why are you sorry?

621
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,716
I'm too short-tempered for a mom.

622
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,594
I haven't matured one bit.

623
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,387
No, I'm sorry.

624
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,182
-No, I'm sorry.
-Mom…

625
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,644
Goodness.

626
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,189
You fools.

627
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,857
I'm sorry, Mom.

628
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,932
Don't be sorry.

629
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,689
What was that?

630
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,944
Why would you ruin the mood like that?

631
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,904
Jeez.

632
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
Gosh, you're ugly.

633
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,415
Wipe your nose.

634
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,709
Take a look in the mirror.

635
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,092
What's wrong with him?

636
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,767
What's going on?

637
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,978
Why is everyone here so weird?

638
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,116
DNA TEST

639
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,909
SAMPLE A: MALE, SAMPLE B: FEMALE

640
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,459
SIBLING PROBABILITY: N

641
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,212
I'm sorry I did it behind your back.

642
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,635
Do you want some coffee? Or tea?

643
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,387
Let me.

644
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,932
-It's okay.
-No, I'll--

645
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,142
I said I'd do it!

646
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,040
Are you okay?

647
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,586
I already knew.

648
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,673
I knew

649
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,509
she couldn't have been Gyeyoung.

650
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,305
They had nothing in common.

651
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,432
I knew long ago

652
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,935
that it wasn't her.

653
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,394
Gyehoon.

654
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,521
I was fooling myself.

655
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,942
I was thinking, "What if?"

656
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,987
Perhaps, I wanted to dream.

657
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,082
My parents were devastated.

658
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,211
My family was destroyed.

659
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,632
Honey, will we be able to eat today?

660
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,551
-Yes. I'm almost done.
-We're hungry.

661
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,304
Thank you for waiting.

662
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,891
-Let's eat.
-This looks good.

663
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,559
-No!
-Why not?

664
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,567
That looks pretty.

665
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,617
I had hope that maybe
we could all smile again.

666
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,633
I didn't want to wake up
from that dream, so I delayed it.

667
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,442
But it's time to wake up now.

668
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,291
Then who in the world is that Wi-Fi girl?

669
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,755
Why are you able

670
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,174
to feel her emotions?

671
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,638
Beats me.

672
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,098
But I'm no longer curious.

673
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,574
However, one thing bothers me.

674
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,284
I have a question.

675
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,744
What is it?

676
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,955
Why are you so…

677
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,375
concerned about me?

678
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,879
You're giving me the wrong idea.

679
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,215
That's when I felt

680
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,259
your feelings toward me.

681
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,600
Over here, honey.

682
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,061
Hey. Have you been waiting long?

683
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,938
No, I just came.

684
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,650
We'll pretty much be family from now on.

685
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,486
I asked you to come today
so we could get to know each other better.

686
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,071
You know it was love at first sight.

687
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,240
You have some refined taste in women.

688
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,368
You're funny.

689
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,537
-Sir.
-Yes?

690
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:08,208
Seriously?
You never had any luck with men.

691
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,294
"Unlucky" is my middle name.

692
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,380
And I have the worst luck with men.

693
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,298
A decent man means
one of these two things.

694
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,342
He's either taken or putting up a facade.

695
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,970
-You can say that again. Cheers.
-That's right.

696
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,898
So tell me.
Did you meet any guys recently?

697
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,525
No.

698
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,153
-Really?
-Yes.

699
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,790
You so did.

700
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,167
Who is it?

701
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:57,465
Why? I'm curious.
I wonder who your boyfriend is.

702
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,971
I really want to meet him.

703
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,639
Introduce him to me.

704
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,684
It's not what you think.

705
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,894
You can't meet him.

706
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,230
Why not?

707
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,733
What's the reason? Where did you hide him?

708
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,073
I'm so jealous.
On the other hand, I'm so lonely.

709
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,161
I talked way too much about myself.
What about you?

710
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,540
Is there anyone you like or miss?

711
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,628
Of course, I do.

712
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,798
My little brother.

713
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,062
I cry every night.

714
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,818
Because I miss him so much.

715
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,530
I truly do.

716
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,137
I'm glad you're here.
I bought this for you.

717
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,682
The eel was delicious.

718
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,394
Having creamy food all the time
makes you crave something spicy.

719
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,604
You should have
Korean food too if you're Korean.

720
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,815
-No, thanks.
-It's really scrumptious.

721
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,400
Didn't you hear me?

722
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,408
Aren't you leaving? I am.

723
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,662
I just wanted to give you something
as a thank you

724
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,872
for always treating me to good food.

725
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,588
Did I do something wrong?

726
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,173
No.

727
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,509
Then why are you being like this?

728
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,598
I'm trying to make things right.

729
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,350
Make what right?

730
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,144
The misunderstanding you have.

731
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,691
I've never been concerned about you.

732
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,862
But I definitely felt your concern.

733
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,905
What was that then?

734
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,992
I do admit
that I sympathized with you at times.

735
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,827
But that's it.

736
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,291
I'm going to…

737
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,460
put an end to that as well.

738
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,756
I won't be concerned about you…

739
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,509
ever again.

740
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,618
It's so mind-boggling.

741
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:16,081
If she's not your twin sister,
why do you feel her emotions?

742
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,918
Or maybe it's this. Destiny.

743
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,633
Destiny?

744
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,514
Isn't that word outdated?

745
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:37,060
Sure, it's a bit tacky.
But it's not outdated.

746
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,062
Destiny is eternal.

747
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,442
What a load of nonsense.

748
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,988
Right. I remember it now.

749
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,575
There was one decent guy in my life.

750
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,330
I hurt my head when I was little,
so I don't remember much of my past.

751
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,749
I rarely remember anything now.

752
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,585
But there's one thing I still recall.

753
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,674
This one boy shines brightly
among all the nasty guys I've met.

754
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,389
Just go home!

755
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,891
We were here first.

756
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,768
I told you to back off!

757
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,395
Jeez.

758
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,729
Hey!

759
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,692
There's this amazing boy,
but I don't remember anything about him.

760
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,695
Let me go! I said let go!

761
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,073
He always came to my rescue.

762
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,909
NOH DAHYUN

763
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,912
I think…

764
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,000
he must've liked me.

765
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,461
Hey! Come at me!

766
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,760
-Move!
-No, you move!

767
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,848
I think of him occasionally.

768
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,766
I wonder…

769
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,645
what that kid is doing now.

770
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,171
One of the knives is missing.
I can't find it anywhere.

771
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,506
Where did it go?

772
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,590
A missing knife.

773
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,927
A missing body.

774
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,267
It's none of your business.

775
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,977
Butt out.

776
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,216
JINHOO

777
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,556
Hey, when did you say
the knife went missing?

778
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,350
I never said I liked him.

779
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,937
I just had some butterflies. That's all.

780
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,611
How dare he dump me
when I didn't even confess my feelings?

781
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,488
How dare he pity me?

782
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,113
I have something to say.

783
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,489
Me too.

784
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,366
What is it?

785
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,410
You go first.

786
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,037
No.

787
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,413
Let me go first.

788
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,458
Maybe what I wanted to hear

789
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,209
was his apology.

790
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,379
But maybe what I wanted
to hear more than that

791
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,550
was that I was allowed to like him.
His permission.

792
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,303
But…

793
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,473
I think…

794
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,976
he's still alive.

795
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:48,978
What?

796
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,105
I know this is a strange neighborhood.

797
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,024
But why would someone take a body?

798
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,984
And why did my knife go missing?

799
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,445
That only leads to one answer.

800
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,406
I think that man…

801
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,120
is still alive.

802
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,888
So? And then?

803
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,350
I mean, why hasn't he shown up yet?

804
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,146
Had he been alive,
he would've wanted to retaliate.

805
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,773
I haven't thought that far yet.

806
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,736
We should look for an answer.

807
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,367
We later found out
the answer to this question.

808
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,579
You should've carried it
on your back and run away!

809
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,330
The night of the incident…

810
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,999
-Why not?
-You're ridiculous.

811
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:36,419
That moment when they panicked
after I had taken the fridge…

812
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:43,926
What was that?

813
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,065
Sir… Sir.

814
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,401
Sir.

815
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,281
Blood.

816
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,159
Something happened…

817
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,245
to Lee Jingeun.

818
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,799
What did I expect?

819
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,052
Are you okay?

820
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,681
That wasn't what I was expecting to hear.

821
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,188
But in any case, thank you for telling me.

822
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,611
My name is Noh Dahyun.

823
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,615
"Unlucky" is my middle name.

824
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,493
And I have the worst luck with men.

825
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,997
I am not destined

826
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,084
to be with a man.

828
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,633
If that man is still alive,

829
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,886
you have no reason
to hide from the police.

830
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,887
You're not a murderer.

831
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,265
You're right.

832
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,017
So he knows everything?

833
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,560
Our lives depend on him.

834
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,604
Then we need to get on his good side.

835
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,523
What's your name, Mr. Chef?

836
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,942
My name is Eun Gyehoon.

837
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,944
That kid is him.

838
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,196
Didn't I tell you
that you'll be in trouble?

839
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,158
I truly thought you liked me.

840
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,327
But that wasn't it.

841
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,871
You just thought
I could've been your sister, didn't you?

842
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,082
Can you please tell me
what happened this once?

843
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,543
What in the world happened that day?

844
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,465
