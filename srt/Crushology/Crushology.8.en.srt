00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,770
Please introduce yourself.

3
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,170
Hi.

4
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,610
I'm Cha Ji Won in the Sculpture Department.

5
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,840
How good-looking!

6
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,220
Do you two already know each other?

7
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,620
Yes.

8
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,090
I'm Bani's partner's junior.

9
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,090
Ji Won mustered up the
courage to come onstage.

10
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,460
It's a waste to let him
go just like that, right?

11
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,060
- Yes! - Yes!

12
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,030
In the hopes that Ji Won's feelings...

13
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,670
are delivered well to Hee Jin,

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,670
how about a ten-second eye contact?

15
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,510
- Yes! - Yes!

16
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,920
Let's all count down from ten.

17
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,460

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,560
- six, five... - six, five...

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,720
Three, two, one.

What's this?

24
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,890
Are you two going out starting today?

25
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,130
Well...

26
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,460
No wonder you hung out together every day.

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,030
It was weird you weren't dating each other.

28
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,600
Since it's late, let's tidy up
what's necessary today...

29
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,830
and continue tomorrow.

30
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,070
Let's go.

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,540
Wait for me.

33
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,940
Ji Won.

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,010
Why did you come up onstage?

35
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,250
That's because...

36
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,850
I wrote the card.

37
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,390
You're the one who actually wrote it?

38
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,070
You've been looking down since earlier.

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,870
Did something unpleasant happen?

40
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,810
Why didn't you tell me that
someone dropped by my house...

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,580
when I was asleep?

42
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,650
I did...

43
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,950
say that a friend came by.

44
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,990
Yeo Reum.

45

Your taxi is here.

46
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
I see.

47
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,560
- Okay. I'll be right there. - Great.

48
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,030
Sir. She's on her way.

49
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,550
Why are you still here?

50
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,960
You're not in the student council.

51

To help Bani out.

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,900
Why did you go up onstage earlier?

53
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,400
That card.

54
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,900
You didn't write it, did you?

55
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,140
Why do you think I didn't?

56
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,210
Or else what?

57
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,310
- Did you write it? - That's...

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,310
Whatever.

59
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,350
I don't need to hear it.

60
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,520
If you wrote the confession...

61
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,490
but didn't appear before Bani,

62
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,760
that'd mean your feelings
weren't that serious.

63
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,230
You've...

64
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,200
changed.

65
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,040
You're crossing the line a lot...

66
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
for a guy she's just friends with.

67
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,020
You're right.

68
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,420
I am crossing the line.

69
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,560
I saw you struggling to make up your mind.

70
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,360
I just can't let Bani date...

71
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,530
someone like you.

72
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,930
That's why...

73
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,570
I'll go to her.

74
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,310
To Bani.

75
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,630
Bani.

76
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,830
We need to talk.

77
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,470
About what?

78
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,900
It's something private.

79
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,340
Text me when you're free.

80
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,540

longer had you not helped us.

Yeol took it yesterday
to transfer the data.

For real? This is bad.

What's wrong?

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,810
The camera we used for our
social media photos is in there.

120

I'll call Yeol and have
him bring it over now.

Let me go get it.

Doesn't Yeol have to put together...

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,280
the festival footage by today?

124
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,450
With how busy he is,

125
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,120
having him come here for that feels wrong.

126
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,430
True. Then I'll leave it to you, Bani.

127

Bani.

128
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
But...

129
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,770
does it have to be you?

130
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,800
What?

131
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,270
The one getting the camera.

132
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,440
Someone else can do it.

133
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,550
He wanted to talk.

134
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,480
I might as well hear him out
while I'm getting the camera.

Bani.

136

Don't date anyone who makes
you wonder about his intention.

You looking down yesterday
bothered me too much.

You haven't eaten yet, right?

140
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,060
Your studio is better than I imagined.

Ho Dong told me.

And it seems like you've
wrapped up your work.

144
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,280
I came at the perfect time.

145
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,580
I've got nothing to say to you.

146
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,250
Leave.

147
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,680
Come on.

148
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,850
I'll leave after we eat this.

149
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,350
The festival was tiresome.

150
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,860
Think of this as our little after-party.

151
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,160
I'll leave if you won't.

152
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,630
Yeol.

153
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,670
Fine.

154
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,680
Let's hear it since you came willingly.

155
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,910
What was that reason of yours?

156
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,920
Weren't I a burden?

157
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,990
You and I together looked lousy, no?

158
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,520
I thought about what you meant
for ages, but I couldn't get it.

159
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,360
While my imagination ran wild,

160
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,260
you had left for your exchange program.

161
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,470
I realized that moment...

162
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,740
that you had already thought
of breaking up with me.

163
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,910
I had no idea, like some fool,

164
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,380
then got ghosted.

165
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,880
All right.

166
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,850
Tell me.

167
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,280
Why did you leave me like that?

168
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,190
What did I do that was so wrong to you?

169
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,260
I can finally breathe
after all that self-blame.

170
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,360
But why did you have to appear
now and make a mess of me again?

171
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,530
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,140
I had no idea you'd be in so much pain.

173
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,840
I just...

174
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,280
Back then, I just thought that
would protect our relationship.

175
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,740
So tell me, will you?

176
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,680
What is the reason?

177
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,090
See?

178
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,420
You're not going to tell me.

179
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,460
Even now, you're looking down on me.

180
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,830
And you planned to return to me?

181
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,640
Don't make me laugh.

182
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,210
I will never...

183
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,050
go back to that time.

184
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,310
We need to talk.

185
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,780
It's something private.

186
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,080
Text me when you're free.

187

I'm here to get something.

190

I see.

191
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,900
I came for this.

Do you...

195
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,520
have feelings for Yeol?

196
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,750
Sorry?

197
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,390
The two of us...

198
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,630
had to be apart for a reason...

199
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,660
and didn't break up for good.

200
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,530
Yeol.

201
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,430
He will come back to me soon.

202
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,740
I thought it'd be good for you...

203
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,410
to make it clear.

204
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,780
What if he doesn't go back?

205
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,720
- What? - It's just an assumption.

206
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,160
We'll handle it ourselves.

What brings you here?

217
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,330
I came to pick you up.

218
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,930
- All the way here? - Yes.

219
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
I want to go to school with you.

Yes.

223
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,220
Why? Do you not like it?

224
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,420
No, it's really nice.

225
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,860
That's a relief. I chose
it after much thought.

I couldn't meet him.

229
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Excuse me.

230
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,270
All good now.

231

Yes.

236
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,200
Did you borrow this book?
I was looking for it too.

237
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,270
I see.

238
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,870
Unfortunately, only
one person can borrow it.

239
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,640
Unlike humans,

240
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
books can only be read
by one person at a time.

241

What?

242
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,680
I believe I picked this up
a second earlier than you.

243
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,320
So I'm afraid I can't give it to you.

244
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,820
My self-respect won't allow me...

245
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,020
to give even this to you.

246
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,220
Goodbye then.

247
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,530
Gosh. But still,

248
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,570
don't worry too much.

249
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,070
I read fast.

250
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,540
I'll read it quickly and return it.

251

252
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,190

338
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Here.

339
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,090
What's this?

340
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,760
Open it.

341
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,240
Why?

342
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,270
Do you not like it?

343
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,210
Yes. It's pretty.

344
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,650
Oh, gosh. I thought you didn't like it.

345
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,760
But Yeol,

346
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,560
what do I do?

347
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,830
I forgot to bring the gift.

348
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,730
I'll give it to you next time.

349
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,930
Yes. Next time.

350
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,040
Did you come to school to say this?

351
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,180
What do I do then? There's
nowhere else to get money.

352
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,010
You spent all the money I saved
from working part-time for a year.

353
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,180
I really have no money.

354
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,320
You have a boyfriend called Yeol.

355
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,690
You said he was rich.

356
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,750
Mom!

357
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,760
I'm just saying.

358
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,660
What do you take me for?

359
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,870
Thank you for helping me every time.

360
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,700
It's because I'm thankful.

361
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,470
Don't worry about it.

362
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,510
I don't know how I can repay your kindness.

363
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,010
No worries.

364
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,190
Mom.

365
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm sorry.

366
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,760
Come on.

367
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,730
- My goodness! - Are you out of your mind?

368
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,500
You said you were just saying it.

369
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,410
Mom.

370
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,810
I'm going to break up with Yeol.

371
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
So...

372
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,510
if you borrow money from his mother...

373
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,920
just one more time,

374
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,850
we're over too.

375
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,290
Got it?

376
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,820
Don't you ever...

377
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,560
contact his mother again.

378
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,600
I don't understand.

379
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,730
We were fine until yesterday.

380
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,370
- How can you break up with me now?
- It's just...

381
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,240
that you're...

382
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,710
too much for me.

383
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
What?

384
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,190
I don't like who I am...

385
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,920
when I'm with you.

386
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,400
I left Seoul after that...

387
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,810
to study for the exam and work part-time.

388
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,140
What about the exchange student thing?

389
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,250
It was an excuse.

390
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,560
If you were struggling that much,

391
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,260
- why didn't you tell me even once?
- Because I didn't want you...

392
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,200
to find out about it.

393
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,770
At least to you,

394
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,580
I didn't want to look pathetic.

395
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,810
If I did,

396
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,980
it would've killed me.

397
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,730
Don't look at me with pity in your eyes.

398
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,630
I'm perfectly fine now.

399
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,540
I did nothing wrong,

400
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,580
so a clarification
statement will be released.

401
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,680
But what's even better...

402
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,080
is that you...

403
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,350
came to me.

404
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,060
I'm not the same person I used to be.

405
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,130
I won't leave you this time...

406
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,930
even though this blew up in my face again.

407
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,080
Gosh, I need to get out of here.

408
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,810
Yeol.

409
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,550
How about some fresh air?

410
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,050
Just this once.

411
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,390
Come on.

412
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,590
- Ten, nine, eight, - Ten, nine, eight,

413
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,760
- seven, six, five, - seven, six, five,

414
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,160
- four, three, two... - four, three, two...

415
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,190
What is it?

416
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,790
What?

417
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,460
What do you mean?

418
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,600
Bani, you were looking at me.

419
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,470
Well,

420
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,210
I still feel bad that you
got hurt because of me.

421
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,010
I'm also grateful.

422
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,010
If you're that grateful,

423
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,080
share a meal with me.

424
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,720
- What? - Let's...

425
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,120
eat something delicious this weekend,

426
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,820
Bani.

427
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,990
We were adorable back then,

428
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
weren't we?

429
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,430
(Yeol and Yeo Reum)

430
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,590
Yeo Reum, wait.

431
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,160
Can we come in here like this?

432
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,860
Why not? We'll soon go here, won't we?

433
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,470
Hey, over there. Come on.

434
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,650
We'll take classes together here...

435
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,820
and eat together afterward.

436
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,090
Will we have the time for that
when we're in different departments?

437
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,190
Hang on. Weren't you
going to follow me around?

438
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,460
That's what couples on TV shows do.

439
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,370
Well,

440
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,830
that depends on how you do.

441
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,500
What? Seriously?

442
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,040
I can't have that.

443
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm putting it in writing
so you can't say otherwise.

444
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,790
(Yeol and...)

445
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,160
(Yeo Reum)

446
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,730
What do you think?

447
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,800
Don't I have pretty handwriting?

448
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,540
It's not as pretty as you.

449
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:53,080
(Yeol and Yeo Reum)

450
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,750
It's late now.

451
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,520
Let's go.

452
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,970
Come on.

453
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,710
Are you sure about that?

454
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,910
Hey, come on.

455
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,180
(Art Hall)

456
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,240
Bani, let's go.

457
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,760
We should also go.

458
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,050
Stay here for the night.

459
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,420
You can help yourself to the
water and snacks in the fridge.

460
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
What about you?

461
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,990
I have work left to do for my project,

462
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,630
so I'll sleep at the studio.

463
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,810
Gosh, that's good.

464
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,580
- Bani, are you home? - Yes.

465
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,290
What's going on? Why are
you cooking for a change?

466
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,820
Oh, this?

467
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,990
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

468
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,230
Your father works hard every day,
preparing a nourishing dish for me,

469
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,760
so this is the least I can do.

470
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,660
I'm making a broth for
the hot pot in advance.

471
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,600
Dad would love it.

472
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,040
What?

473
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,210
My daughter.

474
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,140
What is it?

475
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,010
What do you mean?

476
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,850
Is...

477
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,820
something up?

478
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,020
What?

479
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,990
You don't sound like yourself...

480
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,360
and seem paler than usual.

481
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,830
Are you okay?

482
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,810
No.

483
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,680
Goodness, Bani.

484
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,380
I'm not okay at all.

485
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,350
This is way too painful.

486
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,540
Did you sleep this uncomfortably all night?

487
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,110
Now I feel guilty.

488
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,040
I thought we could have breakfast together.

489
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,480
I packed a few things.

490
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,420
From now on,

491
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,250
I'll be sleeping at home again.

492
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,360
- Will you be all right? - Yes.

493
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,830
A clarification statement was released.

494
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,030
Things died down, so I think I'll be fine.

495
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,070
That means you can
sleep in your own bed again.

496
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,420
(Bani...)

497
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,830
(Bani, I like you!)

498
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,110
There's somewhere I
wanted to go after breakfast.

499
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,940
Let's eat and head over there.

500
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,550
Why are we here?

501
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,050
You always wanted a turntable...

502
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,490
for your own studio.

503
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,260
I saw that you didn't have one.

504
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,330
- Forget it. - Why?

505
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,060
I wanted to get you
one for your birthday...

506
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,100
but never got around to it.

507
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,640
It's been eating away at me.

508
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
Excuse me.

509
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,650
Can this be delivered?

510
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,880
Yes, of course.

511
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,360
It's nice to be out on the weekend.

512
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,460
You can hit me up at any time.

513
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,040
This is so cute.

514
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,580
Umbrellas are over there.

515
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,950
Which do you prefer? This one?

516
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,260
Don't we only need one?

517
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,720
I doubt it'll rain all day.

518
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,160
Sure. We'll take this.

519
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,360
Okay.

520
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,130
- I'll get this for us. - Sure.

521
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,250
It's pouring outside.

522
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,080
You should wait here.
I'll buy us an umbrella.

523
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,020
You must be feeling hungry now.

524
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,690
Let's go eat.

525
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,630
- Sure. Sounds good. - Come on.

526
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,080
I hope steak is okay.

527
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,880
I booked a table...

528
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,750
at our usual place.

529
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,520
What's on your mind?

530
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,460
It's nothing.

531
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,050
This place is stunning.

532
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,980
- The food here is really good. - Really?

533
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,730
Hello.

534
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,160
We meet again.

535
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,930
I'm sorry.

536
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,240
We must have made a mistake.

537
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,570
I just checked our tables.

538
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,310
This four-person table is the
only one available right now.

539
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,450
It sounds like you know
each other. If you don't mind,

540
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:05,050
could you sit together?

541
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,590
If you're uncomfortable,
we can go somewhere else.

542
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,820
No.

543
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,160
I don't mind if we sit together.

544
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,480
Enjoy.

545
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,880
Bani, try this too.

546
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,420
Okay. Thank you.

547
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,220
You must be quite happy, Hee Jin.

548
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,760
Your boyfriend seems like a sweet guy.

549
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,100
This crossed my mind when I saw you before.

550
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,100
You two...

551
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,840
make a good couple.

552
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,140
In a way, I acted as a matchmaker for you.

553
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,710
So this feels rewarding.

554
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,550
When I look at you two,

555
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,590
you remind me...

556
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,960
of me and Yeol when we started dating.

557
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,470
- Are you okay? - Are you all right?

558
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,700
Wipe it with this.

559
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,170
My gosh, okay.

560
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,920
Excuse me. I'm going to use the restroom.

561
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,160
I'll need to use the restroom too.

562
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,300
What is this?

563
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,640
Ban Hee Jin.

564
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,280
You're so pathetic.

565
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,760
Are you dating him now?

566
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,830
Don't date him.

567
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,200
I don't want you to date him.

568
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,900
You're crossing the line right
now. You know that, right?

569
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,870
Why do you care whether
or not I'm dating Won?

570
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,880
- It's none of your business.
- No, it is my business.

571
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,750
Why do you keep torturing me like this?

572
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,320
Why do you keep stealing my attention?

573
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,120
Why did you come to a
place like this with him?

574
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,650
And why do you keep
bothering me in my head?

575
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,260
Seriously.

576
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,830
You're driving me crazy.

577
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,440
Exactly.

578
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,110
Let's not pay attention to each other now.

579
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,850
So we don't bother each other.

580
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,100
Are your clothes okay?

581
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,540
Yes. I think I can just wash them.

582
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,840
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

583
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,450
Don't be.

584
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,360
Bani, why don't we go?

585
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,530
Your clothes are ruined too.

586
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,460
Okay. Let's go.

587
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,140
We'll get going now.

588
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,730
You're not going to eat?

589
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,570
The food will get cold.

590
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,210
You should...

591
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,720
eat.

592
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,480
I don't have an appetite.

593
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,750
Why not?

594
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,220
Is it because of Hee Jin?

595
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,630
Am I wrong?

596
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,640
Your mind has been somewhere else...

597
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,240
the whole time you were with me today.

598
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,670
After running into Hee Jin,

599
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,710
you've been anxious the whole time.

600
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,490
Unbelievable.

601
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,560
Why did you have to
make me feel so unwanted?

602
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,530
If you were going to do this,

603
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,070
you shouldn't have come running to me then.

604
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,340
Right.

605
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,510
It was my fault.

606
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,890
I shouldn't have gone to you to begin with.

607
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,530
You're right.

608
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,000
I've been thinking about her...

609
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,200
the whole time I was with you.

610
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,810
I thought of her even
when I couldn't see her.

611
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,580
But when I saw her,

612
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,450
it was harder to stop thinking about her.

613
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,090
So...

614
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,060
I'll be honest with my
feelings starting now.

615
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,030
- Hey, Hwang Jae Yeol. - I...

616
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,600
can't put off...

617
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,470
going to her any longer.

618
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,910
If you leave now,

619
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,820
you know that it's really
over between us, right?

620
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,590
You know that...

621
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,530
things were over between
us a long time ago.

622
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,050
Yeo Reum.

623
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,050
Han Yeo Reum.

624
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,930
I'm sorry.

625
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,240
I didn't know you were
going through a tough time.

626
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,410
I only hated you for leaving.

627
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,110
But...

628
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,820
I can't go back to you now.

629
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,860
So...

630
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,000
let's break up for real this time.

631
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:52,510
Yes?

632
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,740
Is there an arcade around here?

633
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,770
How about the punching
machine? You're good at that.

634
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,340
Wait, no.

635
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,180
Why don't we call your friends
and hang out? It's been a while.

636
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,150
Bani!

637
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,360
Bani.

638
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,130
Don't go.

639
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,650
I'm sorry. I think I should go.

640
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,360
I'm sorry...

641
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,930
for being so harsh on you earlier.

642
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,470
I know I said awful things to you,

643
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,370
but there was only one thing I
have been meaning to tell you...

644
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,340
this whole time.

645
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,450
I like you.

646
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,010
Cut. Okay.

647
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,580
- Okay! - Two, three.

648
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,510
(Crushology 101)

649
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,510
Say hello to my girlfriend.

650
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,020
We have a lot in common.

651
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,920
So we click really well.

652
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,750
- What are you doing here? - Ban Hee Jin.

653
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:11,950
Your life should be ruined...

654
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,760
- like mine. - Jae Yeol! Over here!

655
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,330
What have you done?

656
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,860
- Bani. - But...

657
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,730
your boyfriend must be upset.

658
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,230
Everyone thinks Won is your boyfriend.

659
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,330
Why aren't you dating anyone?

660
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,670
Actually, there's someone I like.

661
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,000
Isn't that Bani?

662
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,310
Where did you see her?
