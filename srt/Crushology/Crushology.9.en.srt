This is my place.

2
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,690
I see.

3
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,370
That didn't take long.

4
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,140
When are you going to school tomorrow?

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,640
At two in the afternoon.

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,780
Then, why don't we go together?

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,050
I'll come pick you up here.

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,990
Okay.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,990
You should head inside now.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,460
Sleep tight.

11
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,730
Okay.

12
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,460
You too.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,070
Bye.

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,110

15
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,080
My heart was about to explode.

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,370
What's this?

17
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,540
Am I dreaming?

20
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,900
Did I keep you waiting?

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,570
No. I just got here.

22
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,479
Did you get some sleep last night?

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,509
I did.

24
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,179
I slept like a baby for
the first time in days.

25
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
Is that so?

26
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,880
I actually couldn't sleep well.

27
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,520
Because I missed you.

28
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,060
Let's go.

29
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,300
Okay.

30
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,600
Do you only have one class today?

31
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,440
Yes. What about you?

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,870
I'm free today.

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,609
What? Does that mean
you're going because of me?

34
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,040
Yes. I want to spend time with you.

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,180
Yeol. What's going on?

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,420
Are you two actually
holding hands right now?

37
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,349
- My gosh. - Hey.

38
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,250
What I'm seeing right now is real, right?

39
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,420
Is this a prank?

40
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,930

41
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,259
to my girlfriend.

42
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,860
For real?

43
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,169
Wait. Shouldn't there
be a storyline, so how?

44
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,600
Things just happened.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,640
We're leaving first.

46
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,010
I'll see you next time.

49

He did it.

50

I'm proud of you!

51

You're so cool, Hwang Jae Yeol!

52

Why are you the one crying?

53
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,289
Come on. Things didn't work out for him.

54
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,900
I see. It's okay. That's nothing new.

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Hey. You have us, Dong Ha.

56
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,339
- Stop crying. - Shall we get pork cutlet?

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Yes.

58
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,850
Had I known we'd date,

59
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,020
I would've chosen sculpture.

61

I didn't know you were here.

Hi.

63
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,230
I'll see you after class.

64
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,000

Yeol and I are dating.

68
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,810
I know you were worried about me. But...

69
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,210
now I know how Yeol really feels.

I won't need to worry anymore.

meet Won in private

150
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,170
Won and I haven't
talked to each other alone.

151

better but never got the chance.

of sincerity in that offer.

Excuse us first.

171
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,540
- See you tomorrow. - Bye.

172
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,160
- Taste it for me. - Okay.

173
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,060
Here.

174
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,240
It's...

175
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,770
quite, you know.

176
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,310
A masterpiece.

177
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,220
Are you a master from Italy?

178
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,779
It tastes like I'm literally in Italy.

179
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,050
Gosh, you sure are adorable.

180
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,660
Oh, right.

181
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,230
Yeol. I might be jumping the gun.

182
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,760
But my work might end
up being the main piece.

183
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,469
Was the final evaluation next week?

184
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,530
Yes.

185
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,840
If only exam week ends
quickly and our break starts.

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,569
I already have a list of things
I want us to do over the break.

187
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,240
- What are they? - First off,

188
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,109
going to the ice rink,

189
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,509
getting carp bread and
fish cakes from the streets,

190
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,380
and enjoying the first snow. And lastly,

191
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,150
spending Christmas Eve together.

192
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,319
My all-time wish is to spend...

193
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,030
Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

194
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Okay. Let's do that.

195
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,630
All right. I'm in.

196
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,040
I thought my dad's pasta
was the best in the world.

197
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,240
But...

198
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,410
you beat him.

199
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,950
- Really? - Yes.

200
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,510
Keep it a secret from my dad.

201
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,720
My dad sulks if I don't tell him...

202
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,719
the food he makes is delicious.

203
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,760
He only cooks that
dish until I say it's good.

204
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,760
Funny, right?

205
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,860
I've always been curious,

206
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,400
but how are you so close with your dad?

207
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,370
We have a lot in common.

208
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,540
That's why we get along very well.

209
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,380
It's really nice to see you getting
along well with your parents.

210
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,859
Are you busy, son?

211
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,489
I might forget your face.

212
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,730
Please come by sometime.

213
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,300
Is it your mother?

214
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,500
Yes.

215
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,440
Have you not seen her since that day?

216
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,180
It seems she misses you.

217
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,950
Why don't you visit her?

218
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,910
I just...

219
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,280
I want to try as well.

220
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,650
But honestly, it's not easy.

221
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,620
It's not like you don't
like her or anything.

222
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,820
Actually, I don't know...

223
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,290
how to make peace with my mom.

224
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,470
I was never close to her.

225
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,300
Well...

226
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,340
Then...

227
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,210
why don't you try approaching her?

228
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,880
Or...

229
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,450
- do you need my help? - What?

230
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
(Okay, I will. I miss...)

231
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,419
Wait.

232
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,889
(Okay, I will. I miss you too.)

233
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,089
Why did you send it?

234
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,190
What's the heart?

235
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,060
Trust me just once.

236
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,530
She'll love it.

237
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,030
Give it to me.

238
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,970
Let me unsend it.

239
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,470
This is unusual.

240
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,839
Your reply is so sweet.

241
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,910
It makes me happy.

242
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,170
I told you. I said she'd like it.

243
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,910
Well...

244
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,920
- Let me send her an emoji too. - No.

245
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,719
Nothing more.

246
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,489
Why? She likes it.

247
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,050
- Let me send it just once. - I said no.

248
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,360
I'll say yes to this.

249
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,940
Hey, Ko Bong Soo!

250
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,650
Hey!

251
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,380
I told you not to call
me by my name loudly.

252
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
Sorry.

253
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,090
That's why I said we should
meet outside the campus.

254
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,390
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,960
It's because people are
still talking about the past.

256
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,830
By the way,

257
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,760
it seems Hee Jin is doing well.

258
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,730
She is, unlike you.

259
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,370
Who is he?

260
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,780
Him?

261
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,910
He's the grandson of
the CEO of Chaon Group.

262
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Chaon Group?

263
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,709
Why is someone like him with her?

264
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,220
It was during the art festival.

265
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,520
This guy confessed his
feelings to her in front of people.

266
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,189
People from our department
said she dumped the trash...

267
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,820
and found a great guy.

268
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,090
You punk.

269
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,759
Here's the trash.

270
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,129
You know Ko Bong Soo, right?

271
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,670
He's Ko Bong Soo, the trash.

272
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,969
(The most romantic confession
ever in Yein University)

273
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,370
You little...

274
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,380
(Dogwon Industries Co., Ltd.)

275
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,740
Just a minute.

276
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,520
I was going to wrap up now.

277
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,150
Do you want to have dinner together?

278
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,490
Shall we?

279
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm not hungry today.

280
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,560
- You guys go ahead.
- You haven't had dinner yet.

281
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,500
I ate so many snacks that I
can still taste it in my mouth.

282
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,430
I have a lot of work too.

283
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,600
Go ahead and have dinner with her.

284
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,140
Okay then.

285
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,409
- See you tomorrow. - See you.

286
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,470
Let's go.

287
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,820
It's my first time to eat just with you.

288
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,550
If we were going to eat anyway,

289
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,920
I wish we'd gone somewhere
better than the cafeteria.

290
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,660
No. I like cafeteria food.

291
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,630
That's a relief.

292
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,870
By the way,

293
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,140
why do you not date anyone?

294
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,120
So many people have a crush on you.

295
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,420
I wonder why you don't date anyone.

296
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,490
I...

297
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,630
actually like someone.

298
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,370
Hee Jin.

299
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,970
Bong Soo?

300
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,010
Why are you here?

301
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,850
No matter how much I
think about it, it's unfair.

302
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,020
That you're dating someone...

303
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,120
after ruining my life.

304
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,220
- What? - I knew it.

305
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,420
I wondered why you were so angry.

306
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,729
Was your goal from the start to dump me...

307
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,330
and find a rich guy?

308
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,230
Did you think making a fool out of me...

309
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,930
would help you attract a
rich guy and elevate your life?

310
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,569
What on earth are you talking about?

311
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,740
But what do I do?

312
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,370
I can't stand to see that
happen, no matter what.

313
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,880
What if you can't?

314
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,450
It seems you're mistaken.

315
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,250
It's not me who ruined your life.

316
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,460
It's you.

317
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,190
Gosh.

318
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,130
Here comes the main character.

319
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,430
Right. It's all my fault.

320
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,100
Everything you said is right.

321
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,240
It's all my fault?

322
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,870
Oh, yes.

323
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Hee Jin.

324
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,990
I'll ruin your life like you ruined mine.

325
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,799
(Yeol)

326
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,099
Hello, Bani. What are you doing?

327
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,970
Yeol! I'm in the department room!

328
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
Bani?

329
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,340
Hey, what's the matter?

330
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,880
Hey.

331
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,450
Oh, gosh.

332
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,890
You...

333
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,860
What are you doing?

334
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
So...

335
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,270
So what?

336
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,080
Darn it.

337
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,180
Are you okay?

338
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,750
Report to the police first.

339
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,630
Gosh.

340
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,060
You...

341
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,010
Oh, gosh!

342
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,410
Gosh, it hurts!

343
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,040
Wait. My goodness.

344
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,449
We might ask you...

345
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,280
to come to the police
station as a witness later.

346
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,550
Bani!

347
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,090
Are you okay?

348
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,360
Are you hurt?

349
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,390
This is unfair!

350
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,400
- I was just trying to talk. - That jerk.

351
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,930
That so-called boyfriend of hers
got the wrong idea all by himself.

352
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,800
Please be quiet.

353
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,539
- I mean... - Get in.

354
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,809
Let's talk at the police station.

355
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,339
- Wait. - Get in.

356
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,780
Hold on!

357
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,510
- Get in the car. - Wait.

358
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,380
Bani! Wait!

359
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,470
I'm sorry I'm late.

360
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,670
I came as soon as I could.

361
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,010
Why are you sorry?

362
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,450
You must've been surprised.

363
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

364
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Go inside and take a
rest. It was a rough day.

365
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,030
Yes. I'll go inside.

366
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay. See you later.

367
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,540
- Get home safe. - Yes.

368
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,400
You're here.

369
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,770
The cut.

370
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,970
- Are you okay? - What?

371
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,240
This?

372
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

373
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,650
Why are you sorry?

374
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,690
I didn't get injured much.

375
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,490
I put the Band-Aid just in case.

376
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,930
How about you? Are you okay?

377
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,000
You must've been shocked yesterday.

378
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,360
Honestly,

379
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,340
I still can't fathom what happened.

380
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,310
I don't know what I
should do about it either.

381
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,880
Let's try whatever we can.

382
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,050
I'll help.

383
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,120
Bani.

384
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,260
Are you all right?

385
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,560
My goodness.

386
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,900
He’s just trouble from start to finish.

387
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,760
He even ruined your work now.

388
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,830
Is there anything we can help you with?

389
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,600
I'm fine. I'll let you know
when I need any help.

390
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,010
You must tell us.

391
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,410
Okay?

392
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,550
What?

393
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,210
What's this now?

394
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,150
- Why? - Well...

395
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,550
On the community...

396
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,959
We need to stop people
from writing posts like that.

397
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,130
Can you recognize who it is?

398
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,929
It's all a lie.

399
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,029
It's destiny.

400
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,770
- What are you doing? - Oh, gosh.

401
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,869
You're here.

402
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,040
What's going on? Why are you so surprised?

403
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,769
- I'm not surprised. - Not at all.

404
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,780
No.

405
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,839
- What is it? - Nothing.

406
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,450
- Give it to me. - No. It's nothing.

407
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,780
Give it to me.

408
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,950
You shouldn't give it to him.

409
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,990
Recent updates on the Sculpture
Department's Confession Tree Couple.

410
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,089
- I want a prince too. - I saw them...

411
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,090
passing by the College of Art,

412
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:52,389
- and they looked good together.
- Did something happen?

413
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,489
Ko Bong Soo from the
Philosophy Department...

414
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,099
- caused trouble again.
- He's not her boyfriend.

415
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,329
Her rich boyfriend is amazing.

416
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,430
Isn't it insane?

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,539
(I envy her so much. She
should pay more taxes.)

418
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,009
(It seems they're still dating.)

419
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,410
(I want to have a boyfriend like him.)

420
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,250
What's wrong with them?

421
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,220
Why did they post it at a time like this?

422
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,260
I don't know what to say.

423
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,030
You've been put in an
awkward situation because of me.

424
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,860
I'm sure it'll blow over quickly.

425
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
Your boyfriend might not be happy about it.

426
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,129
- Sorry? - I mean...

427
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,600
Everyone thinks Ji Won is your boyfriend.

428
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,740
I wouldn't be happy about it if I were him.

429
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,720
Boyfriend, my foot.

430
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,760
Why do they call him a prince?

431
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,619
(I want a prince too.)

432
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,859
(I saw them passing
by the College of Art, )

433
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,889
(and they looked good together.)

434
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,959
(I want to have a boyfriend like him.)

435
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,400
(Bani)

436
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,870
Yes, Bani.

437
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,840
Well...

438
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,940
Have you seen the post?

439
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,020
Isn't it ridiculous?

440
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,579
It was nonsense.

441
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,389
I'm thinking of posting an explanation.

442
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,390
Bani.

443
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,590
Yes?

444
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,860
I'm fine.

445
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,060
It's not true anyway.

446
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,600
So don't worry about it too much.

447
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,240
You have many things
to worry about already.

448
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,470
Yes.

449
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,840
Thank you.

450
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,080
Oh, right. Yeol.

451
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,680
I think I should start
working all night from today.

452
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,190
Okay.

453
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,060
You should call me when something happens.

454
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,720
- Sure. - Okay.

455
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,010
Dong Ha.

456
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,510
- Yes? - Please help me.

457
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,809
You woke me up...

458
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,210
to do this?

459
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,250
Gosh. This will be enough, right?

460
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,589
Do you think this won't be enough?

461
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,590
Do you want her stomach to explode?

462
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,520
If you're going to do this,
just send a snack truck.

463
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,960
Oh, right.

464
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,830
I should've done exactly that.

465
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,630
- Why are you telling me only now? - What?

466
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,740
What?

467
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,540
Is it normal for Bani and Won
to work so closely together?

468
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,379
Fortunately, not much of it was broken off.

469
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,250
No wonder people think they're dating.

470
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,479
What I meant was...

471
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,249
that someone who's clearly dense...

472
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,959
might misunderstand the situation.

473
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,390
- Hey. You should leave. - What?

474
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,230
Thanks.

475
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,660
Wait. Hold on.

476
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,700
- Inside, there's... - Bani.

477
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,800
How about a late-night snack?

478
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,710
I was kind of getting hungry,
so this was great timing.

479
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,109
Eat up, okay? Dig in.

480
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,780
- That'll keep you energized. - Sure.

481
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,680
Did you really buy
all of this for us to eat?

482
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,720
Not "us." Just Bani.

483
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,920
You're freeloading.

484
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,290
Careful. You'll get it on your sleeve.

485
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,870
I didn't want her to ruin her clothes.

486
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
I didn't say anything.

487
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,580
I'm going to the rest
room to wash my hands.

488
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,980
Sure.

489
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,350
Ji Won.

490
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,260
Aren't you interested in studying abroad?

491
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,630
I wouldn't mind you staying there for good.

492
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,390
That's out of the blue.

493
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,400
Why are you studying in
Korea when you're loaded?

494
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,630
How about the US?

495
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,940
It's a long flight there which is perfect.

496
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,770
- That's why the US is good for me? - Yes.

497
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,480
A global talent. That suits you.

498
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,750
If you're not going to move to the US,

499
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,450
I suggest you keep a
moderate distance. Got it?

500
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,630
I appreciate you helping Bani out,

501
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,500
but keep a distance of 30cm at all times.

502
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,800
I'm not joking.

503
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,590
You're home.

504
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,820
You're home late. Have you eaten?

505
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,260
I have.

506
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
What is it?

507
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,390
Is something up?

508
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,710
Mom, Dad.

509
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,810
There's a good chance...

510
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,549
that I won’t receive the
scholarship for next semester.

511
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,550
What?

512
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,889
Why, though?

513
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,160
Don't you think you'll
get good enough grades?

514
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,429
I mean, if you don't get
it, then you don't get it.

515
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,930
- It's fine. - He's right.

516
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,629
We're grateful for the scholarships
you've already received.

517
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,269
And here I thought it
was something serious.

518
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,939
My daughter, did you think...

519
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,769
we wouldn't be able to pay your tuition?

520
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,339
Exactly. We've got it covered,

521
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,269
so there's no need for
you to worry about it.

522
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,980
Okay? Good.

523
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
- Honey. - Yes?

524
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,409
Scholarships were never
something I could receive.

525
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,949
I didn't even know how to spell the word.

526
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,450
- How do you spell it? - I have no idea.

527
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,890
- It starts with S. - Don't worry.

528
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,360
Or is it Z?

529
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,770
You know what?

530
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,100
Just do whatever you can, Hee Jin.

531
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,390
Here's to another good day. My
Bani's the best. You've got this!

532
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,709
Go, me! I can do this.

533
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,840
(Bani: Go, me! I can do this.)

534
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,849
Are you going to redo the arm?

535
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,050
Yes. I'll have to attach it afterward.

536
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,660
Ji Won, would it be okay
to use plaster on this?

537
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,289
It might need a layer of fabric...

538
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,330
Bani.

539
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,780
- Bani, I'll get more water. - Sure.

540
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,820
(Yeol: Are you done at the studio?
Call me when you're heading home.)

541
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,089
(Yeol: Are you done at the studio?
Call me when you're heading home.)

542
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,290
Are you done at the studio?

543
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,290
Call me when you're heading home.

544
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,340
What the...

545
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,480
When did I fall asleep?

546
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,100
(Are you done at the studio? Call
me when you're heading home.)

547
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,210
The phone is turned off. After the tone...

548
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,180
I don't think she came home last night.

549
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,120
Really? She made it home.

550
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,850
Ban Hee Jin!

551
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,560
Get up.

552
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,160
When did you get home?

553
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,390
After midnight.

554
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,969
Get up for now. You need to go to school.

555
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,030
Come on.

556
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,110
The phone is turned off. After the tone...

557
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
Who is it?

558
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,970
I'm Bani's boy...

559
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,300
I mean, I'm Bani's friend.

560
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,110
Bani's friend?

561
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,470
Yes.

562
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,479
I've heard on many occasions
that you were good-looking,

563
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,650
but I had no idea you
were this easy on the eyes.

564
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,450
I wouldn't say he's easy on the eyes.

565
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,190
Anyway, it's good to meet you.

566
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,690
I'm Bani's father.

567
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,620
Oh, right.

568
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,459
I'm Hwang Jae Yeol. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

569
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,700
We already greeted one another.

570
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,600
- Please make yourself at home.
- Are you squeezing my hand?

571
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
Of course not.

572
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,470
Right.

573
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,770
Why are you here this early in the morning?

574
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,909
- Well... - As if this counts as early.

575
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,680
You probably want to go to school with her.

576
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,150
Right.

577
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,780
You're awake. Come here
and join us for breakfast.

578
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,520
- Sit. - Jae Yeol, what are you doing here?

579
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,490
Please enjoy.

580
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,530
Right. I'll enjoy the meal.

581
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,439
It's been ages since I enjoyed...

582
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,469
a home-cooked meal as delicious as this.

583
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,409
Right? You rarely get to
enjoy one when you live alone.

584
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,609
Since you're here, why don't
I pack some food for you?

585
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,610
Hold on.

586
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,879
Don't I get a say since I did the cooking?

587
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,649
Is there anything in particular you like?

588
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,849
He likes rolled omelets.

589
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,789
With a lot of chopped
spring onions and carrots.

590
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,619
He also likes doenjang stew
with soft tofu and not regular tofu.

591
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,059
Oh, right. He also likes
shredded braised chicken.

592
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,430
- I see. - Shredded braised chicken?

593
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,630
Bani, it's amazing how you know
all his favourite dishes in detail.

594
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,500
What about you?

595
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,400
Do you know what Bani likes?

596
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,080
She likes everything that you make, sir.

597
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,210
That's why I wanted to try it myself.

598
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,750
It's delicious.

599
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,089
- Is it good? - Yes.

600
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,089
Then can you explain what
you like and why you like it...

601
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,559
in excruciating detail...

602
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,519
- to me? - Why would you dive into detail?

603
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,030
- We should let the kids eat.
- Please enjoy.

604
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,330
Here.

605
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,060
This is bulgogi.

606
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,840
Thank you.

607
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,780
Look at you eat everything
that's given to you.

608
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,210
Is it good?

609
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,550
I like bulgogi myself.

610
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,220
Don't get any on the
floor. It's my job to clean up.

611
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,789
- I enjoyed the meal.
- I'm glad to hear that.

612
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,289
Feel free to drop by
anytime if you'd like breakfast.

613
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,089
- Sure. - Shouldn't you ask me...

614
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,090
since I do the cooking?

615
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,400
Come by whenever you
want. You should get going too.

616
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,900
Then, take care.

617
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,070
- I'm off to school. - Sure.

618
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,140
Come on. Let's head inside.

619
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,710
- Make your way to school. - Sure.

620
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,259
It's been a while since
I last saw my mom...

621
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,130
smile so warmly like that.

622
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,659
My dad's usually the talkative one,

623
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,900
but he was holding back
his words to seem serious.

624
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,640
Jae Yeol.

625
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,010
Are you upset with me?

626
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,090
I couldn't reach you and that worried me.

627
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,290
Sorry.

628
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,289
I worked late into the night...

629
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,090
and fell asleep the second I got home.

630
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,260
Next time, no matter how late it is,

631
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,430
please reply to me first. Got it?

632
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,400
Got it. I promise to do that.

633
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,570
I'm sorry.

634
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,240
Sure.

635
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,400
No wonder it was quiet in here.

636
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,350
Actually,

637
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,290
there's someone I like.

638
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,620
Have you told her how you feel?

639
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,930
No.

640
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,200
Why not?

641
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,570
Because I can't.

642
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,010
Right now, I'm good
with just being by her side.

643
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,830
(November 28, Friday)

644
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,070
(Conclusion: The Durability
of Love and a New Direction)

645
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,910
Bani.

646
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,580
What?

647
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,279
When did you get here?

648
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,480
Are you done for today?

649
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Yes.

650
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,760
Let's go then.

651
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,990
It's getting late.

652
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,770
Okay.

653
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,239
(Art Hall)

654
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,310
I really thought there were
more people in the room.

655
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,040
I guess I was asleep for a long time.

656
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,510
Jae Yeol.

657
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,920
Yes?

658
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,290
I'm sorry. What did you say?

659
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,130
Nothing.

660
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,470
The final evaluation is tomorrow, right?

661
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,870
Yes.

662
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,420
Everything will work out well.

663
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,799
The police arrested A who
ran an investment scam...

664
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,900
by promising high returns
through a business venture.

665
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,469
Over the year, A encouraged
a total of 28 victims to invest...

666
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,239
in an environmental
project that didn't exist.

667
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,509
A is under suspicion...

668
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,750
of swindling three million
dollars as investment funds.

669
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,019
I can't believe there are still
investment scammers like that.

670
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,349
Good grief.

671
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,450
In the beginning, I was cautious.

672
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,089
- But we have known...
- Are you leaving already?

673
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,360
- each other... - Eat before you head out.

674
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,090
I'm good. I'm too sleepy to be even hungry.

675
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,230
- Where's Dad?
- He left early this morning.

676
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,330
- I see. Is that so?
- I heard there was a patent too.

677
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,070
- Okay. - Okay. Have a good day.

678
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,039
Thanks. See you later at home.

679
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,140
Okay.

680
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,240
I received the dividend.

681
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,240
I started to believe that the
business was making money.

682
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,579
My landlord suddenly asked
me to increase the deposit.

683
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,950
- My gosh. - So I didn't know what to do.

684
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,450
But then I thought this could
help me with the deposit.

685
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,649
So I trusted A and
invested all of my money.

686
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,749
(Park Jun Yeon, Victim)

687
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,550
How am I going to face my family?

688
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,359
The police have expanded
their investigation...

689
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,889
- with the possibility that... - What?

690
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,259
There may be more victims.

691
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,759
They also announced that...

692
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,760
they're looking for a
solution to retrieve the funds.

693
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,200
I'd like to thank you for
your hard work over the year.

694
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,070
Yoo Ri's piece will be the main piece.

695
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,710
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

696
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,109
Good luck with your exhibition.

697
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,479
And go home early today.

698
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,150
- Thank you. - Thank you.

699
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,280
- My gosh. - Yoo Ri.

700
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,219
- Seriously? - Congratulations.

701
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,920
- Good for you. - I told you she was good.

702
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,089
I know what happened to you wasn't fair.

703
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,590
But I had to be fair with my evaluations.

704
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,590
You understand that, right?

705
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:42,860
Yes.

706
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,460
Let's go.

707
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,430
- My gosh. Nice. - Let's go.

708
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,010
I'm sure yours would
have been the main piece.

709
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,480
No. Your piece deserves
to be the main piece.

710
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,579
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

711
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,580
Sure.

712
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,120
Let's go, Yoo Ri.

713
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,560
Are you all right?

714
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,170
Yes. There's nothing I can do.

715
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,500
I still managed to finish my piece.

716
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,440
To be honest, I'm worried
about my scholarship.

717
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,380
(Mommy)

718
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,650
Yes, Mom.

719
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,790
Bani. What do we do?

720
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,090
What? What's wrong?

721
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,830
I'm at the police station.

722
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,060
The police station?

723
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,870
(Seongcheon Police Station)

724
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,970
Seriously.

725
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,869
You must not have been thinking straight...

726
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,009
seeing how you invested that
much money in one venture.

727
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,880
How could you invest
all of our 50,000 dollars?

728
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,910
There's a limit to one's stupidity.

729
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,680
It's just that...

730
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,750
your body has been in so much pain lately.

731
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,320
Bani was upset for losing her scholarship.

732
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,190
Hey...

733
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:21,230
I wanted to be helpful in some way.

734
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,600
I really thought they
were a trustworthy friend.

735
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,900
Your so-called trustworthy
friend scammed you.

736
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,970
I'm sorry.

737
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,010
I'm sorry, Bani.

738
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:45,680
Yes.

739
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,620
Okay.

740
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,020
Come on. Try it.

741
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,159
What is it?

742
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,860
What was the call about?
Why did you sound so serious?

743
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,770
Remember the contest we entered?

744
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,340
We passed the preliminary round!

745
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,579
- What? - What?

746
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,580
The one we submitted...

747
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,580
- over the break? - Yes.

748
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,550
We didn't get a call about that,
so I assumed we didn't pass.

749
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,219
Passing the preliminary
means we'll get an award, right?

750
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,220
Right?

751
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,830
- Hey, Bani. - Hey.

752
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:31,830
Remember the contest we entered?
We passed the preliminary round.

753
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,130
- Really? - Yes.

754
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,439
So winning an award is guaranteed.

755
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,870
They'll announce the winner
of the Grand Award next month.

756
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,440
They just called me to
request additional assignments.

757
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,010
That's great news.

758
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,340
Congratulations.

759
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,520
What about you?

760
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,180
How did your final evaluation go?

761
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,590
Mine won't be the main piece.

762
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,360
But it's fine.

763
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,430
It didn't catch me by surprise.

764
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,269
Yeol.

765
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,199
Let's go and celebrate!

766
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,440
- We want beef. - Come on, it's your treat.

767
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,380
You guys ought to celebrate
with a big party tonight.

768
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,510
Well, it won't be a big party.

769
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,750
Do you want to come?

770
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,190
No. The winners should
celebrate it together.

771
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,890
I've gotten pretty tired from
several all-nighters lately.

772
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,830
I'm going to rest up at home.

773
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,190
Okay.

774
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,730
Congratulations once
again. I really mean it.

775
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,100
Okay. Thank you.

776
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,470
Sure.

777
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,390
Bani.

778
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,290
What? What are you guys doing here?

779
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,700
What do you think?

780
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,630
We knew you would be
moping around, so we're here.

781
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,170
Get up. Let's go out.

782
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,370
No. I want to rest up at home tonight.

783
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:20,039
Hey, don't be silly.

784
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,440
You need to get some
fresh air at times like this.

785
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,380
And a few drinks wouldn't hurt either.

786
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,080
Come on. Get up.

787
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,210
Let's go out. Please.

788
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,200
How's your dad holding up?

789
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,370
He's been apologizing nonstop...

790
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,440
when I should be the
one apologizing in fact.

791
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,740
Come on. Why would you say that?

792
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,480
It feels like I'm only making
things harder on my parents.

793
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,210
My father must've been
desperate to do what he did.

794
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,190
This time around,

795
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,920
you were just unlucky.

796
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,160
You can do well next semester
and get the scholarship.

797
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,330
But that's not a guarantee either.

798
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,270
Honestly,

799
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,940
I don't even know if I
can continue to pursue art.

800
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,880
My dream to become an artist...

801
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,320
feels like a selfish dream now.

802
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,720
I want to comfort you.

803
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:42,390
But I can't because I'm in the same boat.

804
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,220
Right.

805
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,390
Is this the reality of
art majors and athletes?

806
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,840
I'm already looking forward to this.

807
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,610
Guys.

808
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,610
I'm sorry.

809
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,850
I think I should be with Bani today.

810
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,519
Come on. You're our captain.
You can't flake out on us.

811
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,249
Or I'll join you later.

812
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,590
Why don't you guys go without me?

813
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,490
Then join us no matter how late it is.

814
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:18,890
Okay.

815
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:20,129
Do join us later.

816
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,460
- Let's go. - You have to come.

817
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:31,970
Bani.

818
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,710
Why don't we grab a
delicious meal together?

819
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:37,980
(Bani. Why don't we grab
a delicious meal together?)

820
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,879
- No? - I told you to stop.

821
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,379
- No, I don't want to. - Come on.

822
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,750
- Dong Ha. - Seriously.

823
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,360
Hey, isn't that Bani?

824
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,260
What? Yes.

825
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,500
I thought she was meeting up with Yeol.

826
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,730
Right.

827
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,840
(Bani. Why don't we grab
a delicious meal together?)

828
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,910
(Lee Dong Ha)

829
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,750
- Hey. - Yeol.

830
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,790
Well,

831
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,060
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

832
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,190
You said you were spending
time with Bani tonight.

833
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,260
But she's drinking here.

834
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,070
Where is she?

835
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,579
- Let's drink a little more. - Hey.

836
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,680
Get a grip.

837
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,550
My gosh.

838
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,649
We ordered the cab
to the street over there.

839
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,679
What about you, Bani?

840
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,520
I'm going to order one
too. You guys should go.

841
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,420
Text me when you get home.

842
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,860
Okay. We'll get going now.

843
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,290
- We'll get going. - Okay. Get home safely.

844
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,930
- Bye. - No. I'm not going to...

845
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,160
Hey.

846
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,110
(Ryeonok Restaurant)

847
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,050
Are you all right?

848
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,390
Yes.

849
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,490
Of course. I'm all right.

850
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:34,730
I'm just...

851
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,730
sleepy. That's all.

852
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,050
What are you doing right now?

853
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,369
I get that you're in the same department...

854
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,770
and each other's senior and junior partner.

855
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,780
But enough is enough.

856
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,180
Don't cross the line.

857
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,700
(Crushology 101)

858
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,900
Ji Won.

859
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:29,470
About yesterday...

860
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,200
But you must know how he feels about you.

861
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,340
That program in the US. I got in.

862
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,340
Congratulations, Bani.

863
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,180
There was a motorcycle accident here.

864
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,880
Don't worry about how
things might turn out.

865
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,690
Just follow your heart for now.

866
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,420
I'll go to the US with you.

867
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,790
If that's the case,

868
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,390
I can't let you go.
