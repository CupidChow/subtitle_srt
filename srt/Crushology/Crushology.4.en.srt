00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:29,397
Most talk about my main piece.

3
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,967
But personally, I like the
piece "Destiny" the most.

5
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:40,607
I wanted to portray the two aspects,

00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:43,277
and a fan...

8
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,347
Mr. J.

9
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,277
Hey, Ji Young. What did
you want to talk about?

10
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,387
There's something I want to ask you.

11
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,477
I keep getting confused.

12
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,146
That's why I want to make...

13
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,777
our relationship clear.

14
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:26,417
"Our relationship?"

(Timecode)

16
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,587
Hey, Yeol. Where are you going?

17
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,197
Bani.

18
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:12,357
Wait.

19
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:29,577
All done.

20
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:31,847
Thank you.

21
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:54,867
Ban Hee Jin.

22
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:57,277
Let's get you home.

23
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,697
- Jae Yeol. - Let's get you home.

24
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,147
Let go of me!

25
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,947
Let go of me, will you?

26
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:42,147
Do you like him?

27
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:44,387
What?

28
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,327
Don't like...

29
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,957
that jerk.

30
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:53,397
- Why not? - I told you he was a scum.

31
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,167
Are you blind when it comes to people?

32
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,367
But what does that have
anything to do with you?

33
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,137
What you're doing right now...

34
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,877
is crossing the line.

35
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,307
Only you will get hurt by
dating someone like him.

36
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:11,077
Think, will you? To put it bluntly,

37
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:12,847
why would he like you?

38
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,817
Do you want to be fooled again?

39
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,417
Have you not learned your lesson
from the last time you got tricked?

40
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,457
What did you say?

41
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,327
Who I date and whether I get fooled or not.

42
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:32,037
You have no right to
butt in or get in the way.

43
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,977
So please.

44
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:39,977
Mind your own business.

45
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,647
Is that coffee too?

46
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,286
I can't drink coffee, so
this is Solomon's seal tea.

47
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,347
What?

48
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,917
You're like an old man.

49
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:33,627
Actually,

50
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,337
Mr. J invited me separately
to his studio tomorrow.

51
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,637
I wonder how things are going.

52
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:00,387
Mr. J?

53
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,557
Bani.

54
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:16,877
I thought you would've left.

55
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:19,947
I waited for you.

56
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,047
What was up with that guy earlier?

57
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,687
Oh, him?

58
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,157
There was a misunderstanding.

59
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,887
It's no biggie. Don't worry about it.

60
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,527
I see.

61
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,527
You're okay, right?

62
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:39,797
Yes.

63
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,437
To put it bluntly, why would he like you?

64
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,137
Do you want to be fooled again?

65
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:03,957
Mr. J.

66
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,517
Yes?

67
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:09,927
What...

68
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,797
kind of relationship do we have?

69
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:17,297
Us?

70
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,667
What do you think we are?

71
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:29,047
I don't invite just anyone to my studio.

72
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,817
Nor do I come to the park with just anyone.

(Episode 4: Pursuit
Only I Don't Know About)

74
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:03,377
To put it bluntly, why would he like you?

75
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,317
Do you want to be fooled again?

76
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,046
Have you not learned your lesson...

77

from the last time you got tricked?

78
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:11,717
What did you say?

79
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:14,887
Did I go too far?

80
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,127
What are you doing here?

81
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:06,407
Did you...

82
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,647
get home safely last night?

83
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:13,487
Why do you care?

84
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,257
I don't have anything to say to you.

85
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,597
Let's talk.

86
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,837
Me?

87
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,917
I'll call you Ji Won.

88
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,147
After all, we've met before.

89
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,717
I don't know what we
could possibly talk about.

90
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:53,857
It's about Ban Hee Jin.

91
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,927
Ban Hee Jin and Jo Ah Lang.

92
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:03,337
We can't leave the two meet.

93
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,267
What do you mean by that?

94
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,347
There's something I want to ask you.

95
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,177
I keep getting confused.

96
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:23,387
That's why I want to
make our relationship clear.

97
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,417
"Our relationship?"

98
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,997
Since I was with you at your place...

99
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,857
all night long that day,

100
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:37,067
that makes us a couple, right?

101
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,107
How is that important?

102
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,137
I don't invite...

103
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,047
just anyone to my place, you know?

104
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:56,886
That jerk is crazy about girls.

105
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,557
Did you play that to Bani as well?

106
00:10:58,857 --> 00:10:59,927
No way.

107
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,697
I simply told her not to meet with him.

108
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,267
But she never listens to me.

109
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,497
Won't she listen to you if you stop her?

110
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,777
I'm guessing you're the nosy type.

111
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:21,977
You and Bani...

112
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,377
aren't that close, are you?

113
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:28,887
I'm being a decent human
being, not being nosy.

114
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,357
I can't just ignore injustice.

115
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:36,597
I'm leaving now that
I've fulfilled my duty.

116
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,567
Right. It's her problem to deal with.

117
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,497
Whatever. I've done more than enough.

119
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:56,917
Hello?

120
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,047
Okay. I'm on my way.

121
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,827
Ji Won. I need to make a
short trip to the Creative Room.

122
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,527
Go ahead.

123
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,207
Sir. I need you to look
into something urgently.

124
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,407
I wanted to portray the two aspects,

125
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,517
and a fan noticed it.

126
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,517
That was the most memorable moment.

127
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,256
As expected of Hwang Jae Yeol.

128
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,487
Did you finish editing
this in that short period?

129
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,787
Great work.

130
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:48,227
Pass on to Ban Hee Jin to tell me
if there are any changes to make.

131
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,467
You can tell her directly, can't you?

132
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:52,897
She doesn't want to talk to me.

133
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,377
Bani. Do you have any feedback?

134
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,176
Please tell him to adjust the brightness,

135
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,777
as Mr. J looks darker than in person.

136
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,517
She wants you to adjust the brightness.

137
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,616
Tell her it's impossible since his face...

138
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,017
is originally dull.

139
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:13,357
He says it's impossible.

140
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,926
Tell him to use the left angle more,

141
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,497
as Mr. J's left side of
the face is more attractive.

142
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:23,066
She wants you to use a variety of angles.

143
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,596
Tell her to keep...

144
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,607
her private and public life separate.

145
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,336
And to be better at
judging character while at it.

146
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:31,337
You heard him, right?

147
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,477
Please tell him to stay out of my business.

148
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:36,877
You two are loud enough.

149

And what am I? A parrot?

150
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:40,887
A voice mail?

151
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,957
You two can talk to each other directly.

152
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,557
Seriously.

153
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,287

Whatever.

Mr. J!

163
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,897
What brought you here?

164
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,867
I remembered you said
you lived around here.

165
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,767
Did you have some business nearby?

166
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,267
No. I came to see you.

167
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,507
My exhibition ends this week.

168
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:43,347
I'll be busy wrapping
it up starting tomorrow.

169
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:45,777
I dropped by when I had the time today.

170

Was it a bad idea to come out of the blue?

00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:51,917
No.

172
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,526
Since you're already here,

173
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,387
there's a must-visit
coffee shop around here.

174
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,127
Do you want to go together?

175
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,426
I'm in.

176
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,027
I was actually in need of some coffee.

177
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:04,297
- Let's go. - Okay.

178
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:23,457
Are you okay?

179
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,987
Yes. I'm fine.

180
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,307
Let's go.

181
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:58,657
Does that mean you two are dating?

182
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:01,127
He hasn't asked me out yet.

183
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,127
Nobody starts dating like that these days.

184
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:07,826
Interlocking your fingers says it all.

185
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,767
But you weren't in touch for three days?

186
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,197
- No. - That seems wrong, no?

187
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,566
Putting aside the fact
that he's a hotshot sculptor,

188
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,707
the exhibition must keep him really busy.

189
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,236
And he came to tell her...

190
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:21,146
that he might not be able to
get in touch much in advance.

191
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,446
How sweet is that?

192
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,817
Yes. You're right.

193
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,447
That's why I haven't
contacted him on purpose.

194
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,617
I'm going to contact him when
the exhibition ends tomorrow.

195
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,656
- Is tomorrow the last day? - Yes.

196
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,787
Then...

197
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:34,426
don't you have to buy
some flowers at least?

198
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,726
- Get some flowers.
- No. He'll be very busy.

199
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,156
If you go, he'll have to take care of you,

200
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,597
which is inconvenient.

201
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,497
Don't go unless he asks you.

202
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,066
No. He probably didn't tell her...

203
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,497
because he didn't want
her to feel pressured.

204
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,237
It's not any other day. It's
the last day of his exhibition.

205
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:51,507
Won't he be disappointed if you don't go?

206
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,467
He is crazy indeed.

207
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,167
He's seeing...

208
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:57,807
more than ten girls.

209
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:00,677
Using his status as a sculptor,
he's dating college students.

210
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:04,047
He's a lot worse than I thought.

211
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,857
I guess you're rich indeed.

212
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,686
How do you find out stuff like this?

213
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:14,957
Do you hack their phones...

214
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:16,657
and find out their private
social media accounts?

215
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:18,227
I don't know.

216
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,067
I don't do it myself.

217
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,707
Have you talked with Hee Jin?

218
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:31,277
If I tell her without firm
evidence, it'll only make her worry.

219
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:32,907
So I didn't tell her yet.

220
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:35,207
I found concrete evidence,

221
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:36,547
so I'm going to tell her now.

222
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,577
Are you going to say
everything, including this?

223
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,116
I think it's better to know and be angry...

224
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:45,857
than to be ignorant and look foolish.

225
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,227
(Senior Partner Bani)

226
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,467
(Ji Won)

227
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,666
- Bani. - Yes.

228
00:18:58,667 --> 00:18:59,667
Where are you?

229
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,566
I'm on my way to Mr. J's exhibition.

230
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,607
Now?

231
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:04,637
Okay. Bye.

232
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,207
She's on her way to his exhibition.

233
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:09,907
What?

234
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,187
- Are you not going to get on? - This?

235
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,157
I've never gotten on something like this.

236
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,357
I'll get going first then.

237
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,097
Gosh. Hold on.

238
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:26,697
Move over.

239
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:28,467
Wear the helmet.

240
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:33,607
Hold tight.

241
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:38,677
Hey, that's my Sparkle!

242
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,377
Be gentle with it!

243
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,517
Please look here.

244
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,157
Please look here.

245
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,497
Thank you for coming.

246
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:58,957
Shall we go inside now?

247
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:11,877
Thank you.

248
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,557
What's wrong with the ride quality of this?

249
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:31,457
Do you have a license?

250
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,627
Hey, do you have insurance?

251
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:35,927
Hold tight.

252
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:10,537
You're welcome.

253
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,567
I enjoyed your exhibition.

254
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,867
- Oh, my gosh. - It's him.

255
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:18,037
Hurry up.

256
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:54,447
Gosh.

257
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,247
I should give him flowers before I go.

258
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,907
You didn't have to come.

259
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:34,217
I came because I wanted to see you.

260
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:38,517
I couldn't keep in touch
with you during the exhibition.

261
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,757
We were supposed to meet tonight anyway.

262
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:48,167
I just wanted to give
you this before leaving.

263
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:41,016
When did you come?

264
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:42,087
You should've called me when you came.

265
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,017
Let's go.

266
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:48,656
What did I just see?

267
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:49,757
You don't have to look.

268
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,197
Yes, Bani. Let's go.

269
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:55,497
Give me a moment.

270
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:06,537
Can you explain...

271
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,007
this situation?

272
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,177
What situation?

273
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:15,847
The situation that is happening now.

274
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:22,787
Oh, yes.

275
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:25,257
I guess you saw it.

276
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:29,797
But why do I have to explain it?

277
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,567
I don't think there's any reason
for me to explain my private life.

278
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,667
Am I wrong?

279
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,177
It's not like we're dating.

280
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:42,877
Whoever I meet and whatever I do,

281
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,377
that's my business.

282
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:52,217
Does Ji Young know...

283
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:54,587
what kind of person you are?

284
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,067
I don't know.

285
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,697
What kind of person am I?

286
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:08,367
Bani.

287
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,837
I think what you're doing
is actually inappropriate.

288
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,976
You came to an exhibition
you weren't invited to.

289
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:16,407
And you're blaming me
as if I did something wrong.

290
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,277
Don't you think you're being rude?

291
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,487
If you want to say
anything, let's talk later.

292
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,257
Today is important to me.

293
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:39,397
That jerk.

294
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:44,737
Bani.

295
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,307
What is all this about?

296
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:10,066
Congratulations, Mr. J.

297
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,337
I love your work.

298
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:14,137
Hey!

299
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:18,237
I'm not done talking yet.

300
00:26:23,947 --> 00:26:26,217
But I don't think a person like you...

301
00:26:27,077 --> 00:26:28,817
would understand what I say.

302
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:34,787
So this would be better.

303
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,707
Hey!

304
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,377
- Are you crazy? - Did that wake you up?

305
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,177
You kept saying nonsense.

306
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:57,577
And you almost got me.

307
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,247
But no matter how much I think about it,

308
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,717
it's not normal to kiss another woman...

309
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:05,417
after doing what you did to me.

310
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,157
What are you doing?

311
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:14,796
You can't ruin my exhibition
while there are guests.

312
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:16,127
That's why I'm going to leave now.

313
00:27:18,197 --> 00:27:20,667
Unlike you, I have common sense.

314
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,537
But let me say one thing before I go.

315
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:31,277
You!

316
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,957
Become a decent human
being before an artist.

317
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,127
Hey!

318
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,236
What are you?

319
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,207
Stop before embarrassing
yourself even more.

320
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:55,837
Are you okay, Mr. J?

321
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,577
"Destiny," my foot.

322
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:01,477
What are you doing?

323
00:28:01,677 --> 00:28:02,847
Let's talk.

324
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:20,257
You always make me take off my clothes.

325
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,247
Are you done crying?

326
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:54,147
Yes.

327
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,517
Let's go then.

328
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:09,327
My tears might be on the jacket.

329
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,767
I'll wash it for you.

330
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:13,767
Never mind.

331
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,247
So you knew everything, right?

332
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,817
That's why you tried to stop me.

333
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:37,457
I guess I'm really a pushover
when it comes to a relationship.

334
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,997
Even after what I had gone
through, I got fooled again.

335
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,307
I'm so pathetic.

336
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:49,907
You're not pathetic.

337

Bani.

339
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,657
Let me take you home.

340
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,197
Bye.

341
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:21,837
Bye.

342
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,317
Bani.

343
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:42,057
Are you okay?

344
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,857
I was a mess earlier, right?

345
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,297
No.

346
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:49,067
You were so cool.

347
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:53,237
No. I ended up crying anyway.

348
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,907
But you didn't cry in front of him.

349
00:32:57,037 --> 00:33:00,607
You looked your best.

350
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:04,977
Hold on.

351
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:08,287
- If you laugh after crying... - Come on!

352

All right.

353
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:19,757
Wait. What...

354
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,497
I told you to be gentle.

355
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:25,037
How did Sparkle end up this way?

356
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,037
It's this place.

357
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,577
Come on. I'll pay for the repairs.

358
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,187
It needed some fixing anyway,

359
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:43,317
so it's not all too bad.

360
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:45,757
Forget it.

361
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,516
What makes Sparkle special...

362
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:49,127
is her no-accident, no-repair insignia.

363
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,127
Give me that.

364
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:56,197
So tell me. What was this about?

365
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,637
You left in a hurry. Was
everything sorted out?

366
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:05,377
Unbelievable.

00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:13,447

369

I shouldn't have told
you to go to his exhibition.

373
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:40,106
Don't say that. Thanks to you,

374
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:41,777
I got to see who he really
was sooner than later.

375
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:42,877
It's a good thing.

376
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:45,647
Anyway, it's satisfying to know
that you taught him a lesson.

377
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,887
As if. That piece of trash.

378
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,016
Rather than ice water,

379
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:52,957
you should've doused him with fish sauce.

380
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,627
Was his name J?

381
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,156
- Yes. - Don't worry.

382

is causing a huge ripple.

According to multiple victims,

391
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:24,956
he abused his fame and influence

What good did Bani
do in her previous life...

459

to have a relationship with them?

460

I believe there's no
business left between us.

That's not why I'm here.

471
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,967
Do you think I was being nosy?

472
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:04,667
What about you, then?

473
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,707
Was this only out of concern for her?

474
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:10,837
Or perhaps...

475
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,877
you like her.

476
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:16,677
Think about it.

477

You may be close to her,

478
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:21,277

It's like you're trying to sound me out.

482

Why would I do that?

483
00:40:38,137 --> 00:40:39,367
As if it was my concern.

484
00:40:43,537 --> 00:40:44,807
What are they talking about?

485
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:48,047

486

(Seoul 2107)

505
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:10,027
I should speed up, right?

506
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,427
Yes, of course.

507
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:15,027
Right? Right.

508
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,097
Hold on tighter, then.

509
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:18,436
Sure.

510
00:42:18,437 --> 00:42:20,297
Sparkle can be speedier than expected.

511
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:40,187
(Sparkle)

512
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:43,887
This.

513
00:42:49,497 --> 00:42:50,627
Thank you so much.

514
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,507
- Can I have your phone? - What?

515
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,237
Your phone.

516
00:42:58,937 --> 00:43:00,007
My phone?

517
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:01,847
My cell?

518
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:06,416
This is my number, so please call.

519
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,447
I'll return the favour.

520
00:43:11,017 --> 00:43:13,057
I'll be sure to call you.

521
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:14,987
I should be the one...

522
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,027
returning the favour

523
00:43:19,657 --> 00:43:21,567
I wonder what Bo Bae likes.

524

525
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:30,307
Thanks, Sparkle.

526
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:35,047
You did more than your share.

530
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,217
Me.

Min Joo.

Who wants human body?

533
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:53,997
Hee Jin and Won.

534
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:55,527
Okay.

535
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:57,967
Professor, me too.

536
00:43:58,437 --> 00:43:59,466
You too, Yoo Ri?

537
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,237
Sure thing. You'll be a team of three.

538
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:03,367
Who wants layer?

539
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:07,477
I hope I'm not ruining
your plan to work as a duo.

540
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:09,406
Don't be silly. It'll be
even better as a trio.

541
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:11,406
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

542
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:14,077
I've always been meaning to
do a group assignment with you.

543
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,017
- With me? - Yes.

544
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,257
With you too, Ji Won.

545
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:21,457
I hope we get along.

546
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,057
Right.

547
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,157
I hope we get along too.

548
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,326
I have a class to get to,

549
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:30,067
so I'll make a chat room for us.

550
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:32,597
- Sure. Invite us in. - Got it.

551
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,337
See you.

552
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:40,276
What was that?

553
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,777
Why were you acting like a stranger to her?

554
00:44:42,377 --> 00:44:44,877
It takes me at least a
month to open up to people.

555
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:47,377
What? Why wasn't that the case with me?

556
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:49,917
Beats me.

557
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,817
I wonder why I found you
comfortable right away.

558
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:56,127
Of course. I'm that sociable.

559
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:58,457
I get it from my dad.

560
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:00,296
He befriends at least two people...

561
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,197
whenever he takes out the trash.

562

What for?

Our work for the contest.

572
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:08,686
You have to hand it to him.

573
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:10,457
He never cuts any corners.

(Student Council Room)

575
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:39,056
All right. Good job, everyone.

576
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,716
- Good job. - Good job.

577
00:47:40,717 --> 00:47:41,886
- Good job. - Good work, guys.

578
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:44,126
- See you. - Good job.

579
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,197
- Bye. - See you.

580
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,296
The banner is all I have to get, right?

581
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:50,597
Yes, that's all we ask.

582
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,537
I have a class to get to.
See you later at the studio.

583
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,097
I'll see you.

584
00:47:56,037 --> 00:47:58,067
I thought you'd be weeping in sorrow,

585
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:01,337
but that's not the case.

586
00:48:01,877 --> 00:48:03,147
Why would I cry?

587
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:05,177
You said they were the nasty ones.

588
00:48:06,577 --> 00:48:07,647
Then it's all good.

589

592

593
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:29,607
See you!

putting on a brave face?

596
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:04,167
Bani, what do you say to the
cafeteria special tomorrow?

597
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,277
(Bani)

598
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:23,786
We borrowed all the equipment we need.

599
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:25,657
- What about the shot list?
- I have to stay up all night again.

600
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:28,156
Filming starts tomorrow anyway,
so don't try to make it perfect.

601
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:29,767
We should give it our
best while we're at it.

602
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,797
Make sure Choon Shik and Ho
Dong are aware of the timetable.

603
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,867
All right. I'll get going.

604
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:38,307
- What now? - It's to wish us luck.

605
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:40,177
Unbelievable.

606
00:49:42,907 --> 00:49:44,547
- I'm really leaving now. Bye. - Okay.

607
00:50:21,947 --> 00:50:23,087
Thank you...

608
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:25,857
for that day.

609
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:34,056
I have a class right away...

614
00:51:01,717 --> 00:51:03,257
Why am I suddenly so full of energy?

615
00:51:19,137 --> 00:51:21,037
All right. Let's do this.

616
00:51:34,087 --> 00:51:36,187
The special meal today was tasty as always.

617
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:38,356
I knew it.

618
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,697
Being introduced to flavour enhancers
late in life can get you hooked.

619
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,297
Hold on. Are they filming something?

620
00:51:45,697 --> 00:51:47,197
Maybe, they are. What's going on?

621
00:51:51,937 --> 00:51:53,106
(Wide high angle: Film with a drone)

622
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:54,807
Well, for the next take,

623
00:51:55,107 --> 00:51:57,706
we'll use the dolly to move
the camera side to side.

624
00:51:57,707 --> 00:51:59,516
Just keep up the good work.

625
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:01,676
I heard that Yeol was
preparing to enter a contest.

626
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:03,447
- I guess this is it. - I see.

627
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:05,657
- Shall we try it? - Okay.

628
00:52:06,517 --> 00:52:09,227
- Let's roll, Dong Ha.
- All right, let's do this.

629
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,257
All right. Rolling.

630
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:15,867
One. Ready.

631
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:18,027
- Action. - Action.

632
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:47,927
Cut. Okay.

633
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:49,866
- Okay. That was great. - Okay.

634
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,996
Hey, what's going on? Are
they idol stars? Awesome.

635
00:52:51,997 --> 00:52:54,367
- Give me the storyboard.
- Hey, stop pushing.

636
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,466
- Stop pushing.
- Are they filming something?

637
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:58,066
We'll change the lens and
do a tight shot for the next one.

638
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,636
- Keep performing like that. - Gosh.

639
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:01,406
- Bani, let's go. - Shall we?

640
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:02,477
- Yes. - Okay.

641
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,307
Excuse us. Let us pass through.

642
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,677
Gosh, stop pushing.

643
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,517
Excuse us.

644
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:14,187
- Stop pushing.
- Come on. What's wrong with them?

645
00:53:21,257 --> 00:53:22,967
Yeol, shouldn't we start?

646
00:53:24,097 --> 00:53:25,467
Right. Let's do it.

647
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,697
- Let's roll again. - Please quiet down.

648
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:31,767
By the way, Yeol...

649
00:53:32,207 --> 00:53:34,077
turned out to be more
impressive than I thought.

650
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:37,177
He seemed a bit professional at the shoot.

651
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:40,717
What a surprise. You're
actually complimenting him.

652
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:44,017
Well,

653
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,187
I've been thinking, and he's not so bad.

654
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:50,757
Things could be a lot better if
he wasn't so rude when he talked.

655
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:52,697
Right?

656
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:55,727
Yes.

657
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,197
What about you, then?

658
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:01,997
Was this only out of concern for her?

659
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,707
Or perhaps you like her.

660
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,507
Good work.

661
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:13,277
- Good work. - Good work.

662
00:54:14,547 --> 00:54:16,516
- Good work. - Good work.

663
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:17,887
- All right. Great job. - Good work.

664
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:22,686
Yeol, when I saw your storyboard,

665
00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:24,587
I got this feeling...

666
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:28,327
that you would win the Grand
Award at the contest again.

667
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,196
You bet.

668
00:54:30,197 --> 00:54:32,897
You always ask me to
pay for the drinks indirectly.

669
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,306
So you're not going to?

670
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:38,067
- You're not going to?
- You're not going to?

671
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,007
Fine, it's my treat.

672
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,076
I know everyone worked
hard today. Eat a lot.

673
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:47,546
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food then.

674
00:54:47,547 --> 00:54:49,587
- Call us when you need help again.
- Thank you.

675
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:51,487
Eat a lot.

676
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,276
Is it okay to order some sea eels?

677
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,807
Of course! Ma'am, give us
all the sea eels you've got!

678
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:17,807
Over here.

679
00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:21,447
Do you like sea eels?

680
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:24,347
Is that why you dance like a sea eel?

681
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,817
Can you show it to us?

682
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:40,496
- Hello, sir. - Hey.

683
00:55:40,497 --> 00:55:41,797
I'm here to pick up the
banner for the student council.

684
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:45,567
- I see. Here you go. Sure. - Thank you.

685

(I picked up...)

686
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:51,077
I picked up the banner.

687
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:52,776
- Are you all right? - Where are you going?

688
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:54,247
I'm fine.

689
00:55:59,217 --> 00:56:01,787

00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,027
What am I going to say?

694
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:50,637
No?

695
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,437
Do I need a reason to call her?

696
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,377
I can just call her to
ask what she's doing.

697
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:06,957
Gosh, but still. I shouldn't call her.

698
00:57:18,097 --> 00:57:19,137
Or should I?

Of course, I missed you.

cold when you call me?
