00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,750
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

2
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,960
Too bad.

3
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,890
Pardon? What do you mean?

4
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,460
I...

5
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,730
need to keep seeing you.

6
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,280
How come?

7
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
What?

8
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,690
My shirt.

9
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,720
Give me back my shirt.

10
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,900
Oh, your shirt?

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,770
All right. I'll return
it to you later today.

12
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,570
You must give it back today.

13

(Episode 3: Flirting and Fighting)

14

(Episode 3: Flirting and Fighting)

15
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,460
Here. Your shirt.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,800
We're done, right?

17
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,300
We won't need to see each other ever again.

18
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,570
You're right. Let's not
see each other again.

19
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,140
There's no reason to anyway.

20
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,110
Exactly.

21
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,140
Excuse me first.

22
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,670
You two haven't met before, have you?

23
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,239
He's Yeol, the department
rep of Visual Design.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
And she's Bani, the
department rep of Sculpture.

25
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,780
You're the department rep?

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,480
So you're the department rep.

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,809
What's this? Do you two know each other?

28
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,850
No.

29
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,720
Nice to meet you.

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,960
We'll start with the
group meeting right away.

31
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,999
(Arts University Alumni Interview)

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,530
Bani is in charge of casting.

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,430
Let's settle with these roles.

34
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,099
What's left is deciding
which alumni to interview.

35
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,940
Who do we interview?

36
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,310
Among the graduates...

37
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,450
How about Mr. J, who
gave a lecture last time?

38
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,780
But he doesn't accept any interviews.

39
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,250
I heard he recently turned down
all famous magazine interviews.

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,290
Is that so?

41
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,090
Then who should we interview?

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,120
The one casting should decide that.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,590
Sorry?

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
Cast the most famous graduate, okay?

45
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,630
We're all set here, right?
The meeting ends here.

46
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,470
For real? What's up with him this time?

47
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,880
Here's your meat.

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,450
By the way, how did you
end up at the Arts University?

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,390
Things just worked out that way.

50
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,289
Jae Yeol.

51
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,020
I heard you were the top student
in your department your first year.

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,430
Didn't you also win
several big competitions?

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,129
- Seriously? - Yes.

54
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,430
As I thought, your
looks weren't everything.

55
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,470
What a fool's gold.

56
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,710
What was that just now?

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,950
I said, "What a fool's gold."

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,180
I meant the meat.

59
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,890
Look. There's too much fat.

60
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,859
I love the fatty part.

61
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,859
Meat without fat isn't meat.

62
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,159
Pork belly is all about the fat.

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,060
- Guys. - It looks good.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,940
Bunny!

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,539
What does the bunny...

66
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,809
- from Paradise say? - From Paradise say?

Stop. I'll just drink double the amount.

It hurts! You...

95
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,079
Is your head made of a rock?

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,050
My head hurts more!

97
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,690
Whatever. Forget it.

nobody will follow the rules?

Jae Yeol. Can't we go for round two?

105
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,770
You can do that at each of your houses.

106
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,809
Go straight home. Don't make a detour.

107

- You too. - You okay?

- Bye. - Take care.

113

- I'm sobering up. - Oh, gosh.

- No. - Stop.

Guys.

- Oh, gosh. - You can take him, right?

117

- We can, right? - I can't see a thing.

118
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,469
- Don't worry. - I can't see a thing.

119

- Wake up. - Stand up, will you?

- Text me, Dong Ha. - Okay. Bye.

No.

Don't look down on Sparkle.

but she's still a lively teen.

This is all because
Sparkle brings good luck.

How about a ride to celebrate?

147

No thanks.

148

Why not? I'll give you a ride.

Yes.

I didn't.

I knew it.

167

Now that I look at it, you
have talent in modeling.

170
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,110
I don't have talent in modeling...

171
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,420
but talent in looks.

172
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Seriously.

173
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,460
I can't get used to your personality.

174
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,870
Bani. Are you free for a minute?

175
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,440
What brought you to school?

176
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,140
I had some business nearby...

177
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,080
and stopped by to see you.

178
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,850
Can I look at your sketches?

179
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,390
What?

180
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,690
But there's nothing much in here.

181
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,860
Come on. I just want to have a look.

182
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Here.

183
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,180
They look good.

184
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,810
The proportions are stable.

185
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
You're better than I was as a student.

186
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,190
That's impossible.

187
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,620
But still, thank you.

188
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,600
Is there something you want to say?

189
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
You see...

190
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
It's nothing.

191
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,650
What is it? Just tell me.

192
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,450
Do you mind being
interviewed as an alumnus?

193
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,920
- "Interviewed?" - Yes.

194
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,590
The student council is
conducting an interview.

195
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,860

196
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,790
I see.

197
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,370
I'm asking just in case.

198
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,200
Don't let it bother you.

199
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,800
I'll do it. The interview.

200
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,870

201
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,310

202

204
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,460
Can you feel her wild speed?

205
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
Speed, my foot.

206
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,030
Even a baby would be faster than this.

207
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,300

to work on our teamwork.

210
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
My gosh.

211
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,750
Didn't he just pat her on the head?

212
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,320
What's this? I thought you two had a thing.

213
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,690
But she already had a guy.

215

We're going to interview Mr. J.

216
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,110
Really?

217
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,019
My gosh. He's known
for not giving interviews.

218
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,050
How did you do that?

219
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,220
I'll do it. The interview.

220
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,690
Seriously?

221
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,290
You're the one asking, so I can't say no.

222
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,300
It seems the conversation with him
about the interview went smoothly.

223
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,170
Yes. He agreed to give an interview.

224
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,310
That's great.

225
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,240
Well...

226
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,780
It seems he really likes you.

227
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,350
He knows I'm a fan.

228
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
He treats his fan in a very special way.

229
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,450
He might not like you as a fan.

230
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,590
No way.

231
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,489
I already feel like I
became a successful fan.

232
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,930
So even this feels like a dream come true.

235
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,010
Where?

236
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,440
Do you have a model in mind?

237
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,550
Not yet.

238
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,350

would be the best, right?

239

Come on. What's that attitude?

241

It's for your sister.

242
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,860
You should get something
pretty, not just expensive.

243

244

Oh, how about this? This is pretty.

245
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,210
- Yes. It's pretty.
- So I can get a camera for free?

246
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,010
Gosh, I feel so lucky.

247
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,710
Oh, Bani.

248

Can you not recognize
faces or are you just forgetful?

252
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,530
Oh, my. I'm sorry, man.

253
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,440
No worries.

254

Oh, gosh. I've found a gem.

What are these people?

258
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,050
Oh, my. Handsome young man.

259
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,090
You dropped your wallet.

260

Oh, my.

261
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,830
Yes.

262
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,660
A man should have at
least that much confidence.

263

I'm sorry,

264
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,970
but I think this belongs to
this handsome young man.

265

268
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,680

269

something since we're here?

- No, I don't want to. - Why not?

278

By the way, he really has everything.

279
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,510
He's rich and handsome.

280
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,080
- "Rich?" - Yes.

281
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,250
He's the grandson of the
chairman of Chaon Group.

282

return to the Sculpture Department.

Do you think he agreed
to give an interview...

336
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,690
because something is going on between them?

337
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,530
Oh, this is mine.

338
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,150
(Son, it's 7pm today. Don't be late!)

339
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,060
Hey, here!

340
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
Here.

341
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,010
Welcome.

Here.

My son.

345
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,820
You look even more
handsome since it's been a while.

346
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,760
As if that was something new.

347
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,230
You're right. You were always perfect.

348
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,200
Thanks to someone who gave birth to you.

349
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,700
Oh, right. How's school?

350
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,440
Do you have a girlfriend?

351
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,310
How about food? Have you been eating well?

352
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,510
Ask one question at a time.

353
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,609
I have so many questions.

354
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,780
So please visit me often.

355
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,190
I hope you can just move in.

356
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,060
Why do you live alone
when you have a big house?

357
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm so upset.

358
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,030
Excuse me.

359
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,470
This is grilled scallop
seasoned with chive oil.

360
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,400
I prepared it because I thought
they would go well together.

361
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,070
Thanks, baby. I'll enjoy it.

362
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,110
How do you like the food?

363
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,750
You made it. Of course, it's good.

364
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,350
Feel free to call me
when you need anything.

365
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,020
I'll get going. Enjoy the food, baby.

366
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
I thought it was just you and me today.

367
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,700
I didn't know there was someone else.

368
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,040
It's just because...

369
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,480
it's nice to see you both.

370

Why does he date you?

371
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,520
It seems my age is closer
to his age than yours.

372
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,790
Come on.

373
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,820
Age isn't important these days.

374
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,730
People can date anyone as
long as they like each other.

375
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,100
Aren't you sick of it?

376
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,700
Sick?

377
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,930
Why would I be sick of it?

378
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,540
There's nothing to be sick of
when you're loved by someone.

379

Hurry up and eat. It's getting cold.

Yeol. Are you going to
have dinner before you go?

387
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,760
How about a pork cutlet?

388
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,530

- Yes, Mom. It's over now.
- Son. What do I do?

392
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,240
I don't think we can have dinner
because something came up.

393
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,580
Okay.

394
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,550
- I see. - I'm sorry, son.

395
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,050
I'm going to be very late tonight.

396
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,850
So don't wait for me and go to bed.

397
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Okay.

398

- Shall we have a pork cutlet? - Yes!

399
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,360
How about going to an
Internet cafe after that?

400
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,760
- Deal. - Oh, yes! Let's go.

401
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,870
- Let's go to a new place today. - Okay.

402
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,170
Over there.

403
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,900
Isn't she your mother?

404

But why are Yeol and Dong Ha not coming?

Why did you come out of that room?

It's our room.

Is your studio right next to Mr. J's?

419

Yes.

Is there anything that stands
out as memorable to you?

423
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,010
Most people talk about the main artwork,

424
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,650
but "Destiny" is actually my favorite.

425
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,120
A predetermined destiny...

426
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,050
can be good or bad.

427
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,320
I wanted to explore both sides,

428
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,120
and there was a fan who recognized that.

429
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,330
That was the most memorable.

430
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,360

Forget it. Don't. I don't want to hear it.

503
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,040
I thought you'd easily smack ghosts away.

504
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,280
I didn't expect you to be scared.

505
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,240
Gosh. Why is my stomach suddenly hurting?

506
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,070
By the way,

507
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,610
won't your family be worried?

508
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,350
It's fine. I can tell them I
stayed late to work on my project.

509
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,180
Why did this have to happen now?

510
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,020
This really isn't the time.

511
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,520
In situations like this,
it's hard to even sleep.

512
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,700
What are we supposed to do until tomorrow?

513
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,160
Hee Jin, keep it under control.

514
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,570
Stay calm and breathe...

515
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,250
Oh, no.

516
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,550
I can't hold it in any longer.

517
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,690
What is it?

518
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,620
My stomach...

519
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,290
What? Are you hungry?

520
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,010
Hold on.

521
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,240
Don't tell me...

522
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,410
The tteokbokki...

523
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
we had earlier was too spicy.

524
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,150
Are you kidding me?

525
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,280
This is nuts.

526
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,750
What do I do?

527
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,140
I can't believe you.

528
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,340
Because of you, I had to...

529
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,210
You can't tell anyone about this.

530
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,980
Never.

531
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,820
That depends on you.

532
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,420
Wait. You're hurt.

533
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,660
What? I didn't even realize it.

534
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,660
Hold on.

535
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,290
Thanks.

536
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,260
You saved me in there.

537
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,030
Consider yourself in my debt.

538
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,080
Are you perhaps dating that sculptor?

539
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,480
What? Gosh, no.

540
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,980
Okay, then.

541
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,720
Why did you ask me that?

542
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,790
He's no good.

543
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,660
I don't get a good vibe
from the way he looks.

544
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,200
You can tell he'll get around.

545
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Seriously?

546
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,170
Why are you badmouthing
him when he's not even around?

547
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,030
I know men like him.

548
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,540
They say it takes one to know one.

549
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,410
Maybe you're what you say he is.

550
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,710
What?

551
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,840
I'm not!

552
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Bani.

553
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,930
Hey, Ji Won.

554
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,100
Is this Solomon's seal tea?

555
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,130
- That's right. - Of course.

556
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,270
Do you have plans after classes today?

557
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,770
Shall we go and have today's special?

558
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,470
I'm having a pajama party with my friends.

559
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,840
- A pajama party? - Yes.

560
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,980
If you're not busy today,
would you like to join us?

561
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,350
Am I allowed?

562
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,590
Of course!

563
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,890
Sure thing, then.

564
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,660
Let's go.

565
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Just a second.

566
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,829
I'm not feeling well...

567
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,129
and can't be in class as the model today.

568
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,640
This is bad.

569
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
What's wrong?

570
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:15,440
The model for our art class...

571
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,310
called in sick today.

572
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,980
A model not showing up is
what the professor hates the most.

573
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,819
Like last time, I could...

574
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,750
It's your class too.

575
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,590
What will you do, then?

576
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,660
I should find...

577
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,830
a replacement.

578
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,700
What?

579
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,540
Is it me she's looking at?

580
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,340
Are you busy right now?

581
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,620
What am I even doing here?

582
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,390
It's nothing challenging.

583
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,960
Just sit still in that chair. Easy, right?

584
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,260
- You... - It's not easy.

585
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,430
I speak from experience...

586
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,930
when I say modeling
for a portrait isn't easy.

587
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,430
It's hard to keep a pose
and one needs patience.

588
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,700
But most of all,

589
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,040
one needs to look good.

590
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,650
I still think I should
model for the class instead.

591
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,830
Why are you still standing? Get drawing.

592
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,850
Of course.

593
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,390
I have a keen eye.

594
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,020
That was the perfect choice for a model.

595
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,730
But...

596
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,770
why does it feel like
he's only looking at me?

597
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,540
What's with that gaze?

598
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,669
Why is he staring at me...

599
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,910
rather than looking away?

600
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,350
This is the same...

601
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,519
as the leading man and woman in a movie...

602
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,250
falling for each other.

603
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,249
As if.

604
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,290
He's more like the villain.

605
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,290
Don't be fooled by that demonic gaze.

606
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,839
Thank you for helping out today.

607
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,440
(Energy drink)

608
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,180
You sure are shameless.

609
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,679
Is this how you repay me for
having your back yesterday?

610
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,690
I was that urgent.

611
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,650
So here I am thanking you from deep down.

612
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,190
(Mr. J)

613
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Hey, Mr. J.

614
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,300
Hi, Bani. Is this a good time?

615
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Sure.

616
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,810
If you're free tomorrow, come by my studio.

617
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,540
Tomorrow?

618
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,179
I'm busy with my exhibition...

619
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,780
and won't be free another day.

620
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,420
Sure. Sounds good.

621
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,520
- See you tomorrow, then. - Got it.

622
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,590
Are you meeting that sculptor tomorrow?

623
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,130
Why do you ask? To badmouth him again?

624
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:07,430
Anyway, thank you for today.

625
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,330
No way.

626
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,330
The rich are surely in
a league of their own.

627
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,970
I didn't know what you'd
like, so I got a bit of everything.

628
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,840
- Is this all right? - Absolutely.

629
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,310
Everything looks great.

630
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,140
Anyway, my dad left to see my mom today,

631
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,580
so make yourselves at home.

632
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,049
By the way, I didn't have time...

633
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,580
to prepare the proper attire.

634
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,049
Next time, I'll be in silk pajamas.

635
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,790
Of course. Silk for the young master.

636
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,130
That being said, did your
interview go well yesterday?

637
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,830
Yes.

638
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,600
What's that smile just now?

639
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,640
Actually,

640
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,470
Mr. J invited me separately
to his studio tomorrow.

641
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,170
- Just you? - Yes.

642
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,779
How's that for a success story?

643
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,510
He didn't invite you as
his fan. It's more of a date.

644
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,780
It'll be just you two...

645
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,650
in his private art studio.

646
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,220
A date?

647
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,549
Isn't it more common to go
to the theater or something?

648
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,690
That's why this is more exciting.

649
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,560
It's more intimate.

650
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,260
I'm not sure about this.
Are you sure it's a date?

651
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,300
What if you end up just
helping him in the studio?

652
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,170
As a guy, what's your opinion?

653
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,700
Well,

654
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,840
the company matters more than the location.

655
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,540
It could start off as a work thing,
but it could become intimate.

656
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,340
Yes, intimate.

657
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,480
You'll find out once you get there.

658
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,280
If it's truly a date or not.

659
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,120
What is this?

660
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,230
I thought it was a
message about an audition.

661
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,589
(Film Review of "Fogpiercer")

662
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,659
(I'm a fan of the director, but
it was better than expected.)

663
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,799
(I'm shocked that you liked a
movie by a pretentious wannabe.)

664
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,159
This again.

665
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,400
What? What happened?

666
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,129
So this member keeps
making insulting comments...

667
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,470
on my Drama and Movie Forum posts.

668
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Darn it.

669
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,919
Oh, my. You look gorgeous today.

670
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,590
Good luck, Ban Hee Jin!

671
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,610
- You're here. - Hey.

672
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,480
Did you get home safely last night?

673
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,509
Well, I meant to check
if you got home safely.

674
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,420
But I fell asleep while waiting.

675
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,480
Yes. I got home safely.

676
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,790
Okay. See you soon.

677
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,930
Ji Won.

678
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,800
Do I look better with my hair down...

679
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,840
or up?

680
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,810
Well,

681
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,579
since your outfit today
gives off a cheerful vibe,

682
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,080
a hairstyle with a lively
vibe would be a nice match.

683
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,320
You know like a high bun?

684
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,420
You can use that to tie your hair.

685
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,230
Yes. That's a great idea.

686
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,360
I knew I asked the right
guy. You have a good eye.

687
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,830
All good?

688
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Yes.

689
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,679
My gosh. Is this a drawing or a picture?

690
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,750
Jae Yeol, it looks just like you.

691
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,190
Darn it. Why did they put this out here?

692
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,890
Ban Hee Jin is great at drawing.

693
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,190
Great, my foot.

694
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,090
Why? It looks great.

695
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,930
Well, how should I put it?

696
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,630
I can feel affection for
her model in her drawing.

697
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,110
What affection? Don't be ridiculous.

698
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,610
Hey, that's really important in art.

699
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,820
Yes. Take a look at this one.

700
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
What is this?

701
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,520
You get something like this
when there's no affection.

702
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,260
This is Brooding Jae Yeol.

703
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,090
Hey, Bani.

704
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,200
We were looking at your drawing just now.

705
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,730
I see. Okay.

706
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,430
Do you have an important plan today?

707
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,170
You're looking more dressed up than usual.

708
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,839
I have somewhere to be.

709
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
I'll see you guys around.

710
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,280
Bye.

711
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,910
Okay, bye.

712
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,220
Hey, we should get going too.

713
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,800
Hey, watch my bike for a second.

714
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,000
I'll go and get some coffee.

715
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,500
Hey, hurry back.

716
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,170
Why is he so adamant on driving this thing?

717
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,780
This is so embarrassing.

718
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,320
Hello.

719
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,690
You can also order over there at the kiosk.

720
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,030
Well,

721
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,630
for some reason, using a kiosk to order...

722
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,030
feels so impersonal to me.

723
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,770
I plan to be a regular here.

724
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,570
I'll order here, so you get
used to seeing me here.

725
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,610
Sure.

726
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,010
What would you like?

727
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,420
Two cups of hot Americano.

728
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:38,890
Sure.

729
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,560
I guess he's a popular Visual Design major.

730
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,299
- That's funny. - Its name is Sparkle.

731
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,830
- Oh, my. - This isn't mine.

732
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,729
Seriously? What is that?

733
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,000
This isn't mine.

734
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,600
What's up with the heart?

735
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,370
- That's hilarious. - Darn it.

736
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,470
Have a good day.

737
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,080
Right back...

738
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,380
at you.

739
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,480
- What? - Right back at you.

740
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,150
You too have a good day.

741
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,050
(Yeol)

742
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,190
- Hello. - What's taking you so long?

743
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,389
People keep staring at me.

744
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,160
I see. The assignment about the UI design?

745
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,430
Yes, I actually checked it.

746
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,669
The touch gestures are too alike.

747
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,070
Well, we need to tweak them
with a variety of different options.

748
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,499
What are you talking about?
What nonsense is this?

749
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,170
Yes, sure. Let's discuss
them in person later.

750
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,510
Hello?

751
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,450
I must get going. I have an appointment.

752
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,250
See you tomorrow.

753
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,990
My gosh. My head is all over the place.

754
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,060
I forgot the coffee.

755
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:09,180
Did he step out for a moment?

756
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,580
Gosh, the directions...

757
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,680
Come on.

758
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,249
Good grief. Ho Dong and
Choon Shik are having a problem...

759
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,320
finding this place.

760
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,660
You go ahead first. I'll pick them up.

761
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,030
Okay.

762
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,980
- What are you doing here?
- You startled me.

763
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,580
You said you had somewhere to be.

764
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,450
Yes. And this is the place.

765
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,590
You were meeting him here?

766
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,990
Yes. Why?

767
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,400
Bani.

768
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,010
You should've called me
when you arrived. Let's go in.

769
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,740
Okay.

770
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,720
Here you go. I brought coffee.

771
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,820
- Thank you. - Sure.

772
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,040
What's this?

773
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,980
I just started on that. I'm
only shaping it for now.

774
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,910
How fascinating.

775
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,410
Would you like to try it?

776
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,120
- Can I? - Of course.

777
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,789
To submit it by the end of the month,

778
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,620
we must finish filming by this day.

779
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,919
Do you think our
schedule will be too tight?

780
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,289
- Come on. - Come on.

781
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,059
Dong Ha, you have us.

782
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,760
You don't need to worry about that.

783
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,100
- He's right. Just trust us on this. - Yes.

784
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,140
Did Choon Shik do that?

785
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,250
When did I do that?

786
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,410
They're two different things.

787
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,220
Bani.

788
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,090
Yes?

789
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,670
No.

790
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,780
No.

791
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,310
What's wrong, Yeol?

792
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,150
Did you not eat? Should I order something?

793
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,950
Hey, about that...

794
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,150
I'll order it.

795
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,560
Yeol wants to treat us.

796
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,670
Is it because the material is high-quality?

797
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,230
It's so soft.

798
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,240
That's because you're good.

799
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,390
Just focus on carving
it along the wood grain.

800
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,860
Here too. Carve it just like this.

801
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,400
Your jjajangmyeon is here.

802
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,300
Oh, jjajangmyeon. That's for us.

803
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,850
I must have...

804
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,150
put down the wrong address.

805
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,920
Then have a good day.

806
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,330
Have a good day.

807
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,900
Carry on then.

808
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,140
This is tasty.

809
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:29,710
- Gosh, this restaurant is great.
- The food is very good.

810
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,340
- Try the tangsuyuk. - Okay.

811
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,110
Seriously.

812
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,050
Are you not going to eat your jjajangmyeon?

813
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,849
- The food is amazing. - Yes.

814
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,320
Just go ahead and eat your fill.

815
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,960
There's a nice park around here.
Would you like to go for a walk?

816
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,690
Sure, sounds good.

817
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,360
Let's go.

818
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,340
The weather is amazing today.

819
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,770
And this gelato is great too.

820
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,110
Right.

821
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,580
It's my first time being
impressed by gelato.

822
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,610
- Really? - Yes.

823
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,210
Since meeting you, there
have been so many firsts.

824
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,450
The interview and the gelato.

825
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,560
Edit on the 19th. Post
production on the 20th.

826
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,660
It is pretty tight.

827
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,260
Let me take off your mic.

828
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,740
(Timecode)

829
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,230
(Timecode)

830
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,630
Hey, Yeol. Where are you going?

831
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:44,910
Bani.

832
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,110
Wait.

833
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,800
All done.

834
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,200
Thank you.

835
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,960
Ban Hee Jin.

836
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,420
Let's get you home.

837
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,380
- Jae Yeol. - Let's get you home.

838
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,980
(Crushology 101)

839
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,039
- What? - Hwang Jae Yeol, that jerk.

840
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,209
What's his problem?

841
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,910
I take it that you're the nosy type.

842
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,319
Then what about you?

843
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,519
Are you concerned about Ban Hee Jin?

844
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,520
Could it be that they're
fighting over Bani?

845
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,090
I'm here to see you.

846
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,390
What are we, exactly?

847
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,800
We can't let Ban Hee Jin and
Jo Ah Lang see each other.

848
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,500
You and Bani aren't this close.

849
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:24,870
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

850
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:28,070
You. Stop occupying my headspace.
