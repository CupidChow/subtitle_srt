1
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:20,473
Have you been well?

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,143
Yeol.

3
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,173
Are you free right now?

4
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:09,723
Okay. Please wait a bit.

5
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:15,333
I sent you a text.

6
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:17,833
Did you not get it?

7
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,373
I don't recall us...

8
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,243
being on texting terms.

9
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:27,713
At least you didn't block me.

10
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,313
What do you want?

11
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:39,993
You're still the same.

12
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:42,423
Well,

13
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:44,923
it's only been two years.

14
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:49,803
Although it felt like ages.

15
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,333
Did you not miss me?

16
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:01,943
It's funny.

17
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:04,943
You asking that question.

18
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,153
You heard I was the
upcoming festival's MC, right?

19
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,093
Coming to school after a while...

20
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,423
has made me realize
being a student was better.

21
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,933
How does it feel to return to school?

22
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,933
Did you get used to it quickly?

23
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:27,003
Did you become friends with the juniors?

24
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:43,753
I'm leaving if you've got nothing...

25
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:46,193
important to say.

26
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,093
I...

27
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,593
haven't even had a sip of my coffee.

28
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,003
It's been years since we last met.

29
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:04,003
Don't you have anything to ask me?

30
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:10,613
I did.

31
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:13,353
In the past.

32
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:17,553
But I don't anymore.

33
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:14,242
(Bani.)

34
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:18,213
(Earlier...)

35
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,673
Bani. Your class starts soon, right?

36
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,473
Yes. It's an elective.

37
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,212
I'll go to our department room after.

38
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:50,343
Okay.

39
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:53,253
Oh, my gosh.

40
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:55,353
Have you seen this?

41
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:57,223
These two were a campus couple.

42
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,522
(Back when Han Yeo Reum
and Hwang Jae Yeol dated)

43
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:00,953
I saw them earlier.

44
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,822
The two left after having coffee here.

45
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:07,293
What? That means this is true.

46
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,902
Who knew my role model's ex-boyfriend...

47
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,603
would be Jae Yeol,

48
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,603
not some celebrity or rich guy?

49
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:20,173
Oh, no.

50
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:23,183
Bani. Are you okay?

51
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,513
She's his ex-girlfriend,
not his current one.

52
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,083
Don't let it bother you.

53
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,723
What's this? What's up with you two?

54
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,252
Why would it bother me?

55
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,293
It's not like Jae Yeol and
I have a thing going on.

56
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,193
Weren't you two making progress?

57
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:43,663
It was romantic when we had meat.

58
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,202
No way.

59
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:48,773
How you guys get ahead of
yourselves is unbelievable.

60
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:50,473
I told you there was nothing between us.

61
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,472
Really, don't worry.

62
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:55,173
It doesn't bother me at all. Believe me.

63
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:05,423
What is it?

64
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:08,723
Seriously. This is actually true?

65
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:14,733
To think you and Beautiful
Han Yeo Reum dated.

66
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,062
Don't you have second period? Get going.

67
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:19,933
That can wait. Look, Boss.

68
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,343
I knew it.

69
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:28,242
To date a beauty, one must be...

70
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:29,783
the Emperor of Visual Design.

71
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,312
It's nothing new, but I deeply admire you.

72
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,513
What?

73
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,093
Where are you going?

74
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:24,203
Bani.

75
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,733
Right.

76
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:34,643
Are you going to class right now?

77
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:36,543
Yes.

78
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:43,523
Have you been well?

79
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,153
Yeol.

80
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:50,623
As expected.

81
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:54,293
A guy like him would definitely
have someone at heart.

82
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:00,533
I jumped the gun again like a fool.

83
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:05,143
You're really pathetic, Ban Hee Jin.

84
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:06,343
Listen.

85
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:09,483
- Earlier...
- I have things to take care of.

86
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,583
Excuse me first.

87
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:28,933
(Episode 6: What We Are)

88
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,243
Are you okay?

89
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:40,813
Yes.

90
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:49,653
Does it hurt? Do you need to see a doctor?

91
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,653
No. No way. That's going too far.

92
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,393
It's only a small cut.

93
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:01,893
And getting hurt is nothing new.

94
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,333
What were you thinking about to lose focus?

95
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:10,743
This is enough for today.

96
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,813
I couldn't concentrate,
so it's for the better.

97
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,772
I'm resting today because of my finger.

98
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:17,383
But I'll work hard starting tomorrow.

99
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,913
How about we get something sweet together?

100
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,223
Okay. I'm in.

101
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,823
Ji Won. I'm in front of
your campus right now.

102
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,133
You didn't have lunch yet, right?

103
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,462
What is it?

104
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,063
Hye Won wants to eat together.

105
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:37,403
She's at our campus right now.

106
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:40,373
Why don't we eat together
if she's okay with it?

107
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,643
Did she already leave?

108
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:27,153
Ji Won. Is this really a must-eat place?

109
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,113
It's not a hotel...

110
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:31,123
nor a restaurant.

111
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,293
You're so out of touch.

112
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:36,193
That right there is the
only bread menu here.

113
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:38,693
A place like this is
the real must-eat place.

114
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:41,633
You saying it's good is
making me pumped up.

115
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:42,963
Right?

116
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:44,432
- It's here. - Enjoy.

117
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,503
Thank you.

118
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:48,973
Let's have one each and order more later.

119
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,873
- Okay? - Sure.

120
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:54,813
By the way, don't be so
formal. I'm younger than you.

121
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:59,953
Okay then. Dig in.

122
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:01,813
Try it.

123
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,253
Okay.

124
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:08,153
Bite into the middle.

125
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,233
Ji Won.

126
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,163
Hold on.

127
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:26,473
All done.

128
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:30,013
How do you eat such big
bread without making a mess?

129
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:31,343
Should I...

130
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,353
teach you how to eat it neatly?

131
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,053
Here, look.

132
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:38,782
It's easier than you think.

133
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,453
For a cream bun like this one,

134
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,623
hold it vertically and take a big bite.

135
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:49,093
All clean, right?

136
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,833
- Try it. - Okay.

137
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,533
- Hold it vertically. - Yes.

138
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:54,973
Take a bite.

139
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,113
See? You won't make a mess.

140
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,673
It's my special skill.

141
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,813
But I'm letting you in on it.

142
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,112
I'll teach you how to eat...

143
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:08,353
a burger neatly next time.

144
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,453
Bani.

145
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:15,023
Just now, you looked really classy.

146
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:18,692
Right?

147
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,733
I'm quite sophisticated
when it comes to food.

148
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:23,703
- You should try too. - Okay.

149
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,003
- Have them at home. - No.

150
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,773
You didn't have to.

151
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:33,243
But I'll enjoy it with my parents.

152
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,413
Sorry. My finger slipped.

153
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:42,453
Aren't we leaving?

154
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,353
I'm leaving. Text me once you get home.

155
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:48,553
Okay.

156
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,163
Bye.

157
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:53,133
Hye Won. Bye. I'll see you again next time.

158
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,473
What's with that big smile?

159
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,373
Don't you also think Bani is interesting?

160
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:06,443
Interesting, or someone
you're interested in?

161
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:09,943
Bye.

162
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:21,153
I went to the department
room, but you weren't there.

163
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,663
I guess you're not working overnight?

164
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,163
Whatever.

165
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:37,943
Even the way she talks is beautiful.

166
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:42,243
- What's up with you? - Give me a second.

167
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,383
What are you doing?

168
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:47,053
- Show me. - It's nothing.

169
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:48,183
Show me.

170
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,382

00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:52,452
I see.

172
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:53,523
Okay.

173
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,363
Hey. Why are you so slow-witted?

174
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:03,903
Can't you tell she's not interested in you?

175
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,802
No way.

176
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,473
She even gave me that
priceless ticket to her play.

177
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:12,003
That was her trying to get
people to come to the play.

178
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,573
Look.

179
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:15,243
All her replies are...

180
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,013
short.

181
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:21,953
- That's not true! - As if.

182
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:35,793
No.

183
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:38,263
(From Bani: No.)

184
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:43,543
What's that?

185
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:48,543
I can feel the coldness from her reply.

186
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:56,653
Sorry.

187
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:03,062
I'm telling you,

188
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,722
this is what the men's
mugwort bath smells like.

189
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:06,493
Is that so? The women's
bath smells like rooibos tea.

190
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,032
- I'm back. - Hey.

191
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,063
Welcome back.

192
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,503
- Here. - What's this?

193
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:16,872
Look at all these cream buns.

194
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,443
Gosh, that's quite a lot.

195
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,273
I didn't buy it.

196
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:22,983
What? Then was it the junior partner guy?

197
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:25,813
- "Guy?" - That again?

198
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,382
I told you it wasn't like that.

199
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:29,383
What is it? What guy?

200
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:31,583
I'm being left out again, aren't I?

201
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,553
Honey, this is serious.

202
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,322
It looks like she takes after you,

203
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,463
attracting good-looking guys.

204
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,363
I saw her yesterday.

205
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:43,103
Some guy was dropping her off at home.

206
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:44,433
Really?

207
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,672
I saw that punk from afar,

208
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,202
but I could tell his face was shining,

209
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:50,703
which reminded me of my younger self.

210
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,912
- My gosh. - He was tall...

211
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,543
and looked elegant.

212
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:03,323
- How about the nose? - He had a big nose.

213
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:05,123
- I'll give him a pass then.
- He gets a pass.

214
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:21,503
You must be tired. Eat this.

215
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:25,403
I was actually sleepy, so
this is perfect. Thank you.

216
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,993
Oh, my. I feel much better.

217
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:46,293
Oh, right. Hye Won kept going on
and on about the bread yesterday.

218
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,063
Right? I've never seen anyone
who doesn't like their bread.

219
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:52,503
Let's go there again
with Hye Won next time.

220
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:53,633
Sure. Let's do that.

221
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,543
But Ji Won. I felt it again yesterday.

222
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,273
You're such a sweet brother to her.

223
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:02,373
Me?

224
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:04,413
Am I?

225
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,883
Aren't other brothers like that too?

226
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,283
I'm not sure because
I don't have a sibling,

227
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:11,853
but it doesn't seem so.

228
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,423
Even Kot Nim who is
always bright gets so mad...

229
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:17,363
when she's with her older brother.

230
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:22,333
Well... If you think about it,

231
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,403
Hye Won is in a different
situation from others.

232
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:27,233
So I worry about her.

233
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:32,803
But I'm a little overprotective, right?

234
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:35,373
What? No, not at all.

235
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:39,313
What I want to say is I envy her
for having a true brother like you.

236
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:46,423
By the way,

237
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:48,493
when will I be able to finish this?

238
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:50,323
I even have to do the plaster casting.

239
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:51,663
When will I ever finish it?

240
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:53,963
I know.

241
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:56,533
And we should do the assignments
for other subjects too. It's tough.

242
00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:59,033
I'm worried about the assignments too,

243
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,403
but I'm more worried
about the cost of materials.

244
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:06,043
You've never worried about
something like that, have you?

245
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:13,683
What are those eyes that can't lie?

246
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:21,023
If I work part-time, I
can't do assignments.

247
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,493
If I do assignments, I
can't afford the materials.

248
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:29,593
It's a dilemma.

249
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:32,663
Here are the drinks.

250
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,473
- Thank you. - Thank you.

251
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:44,782
Every time I see you
drink Solomon's seal tea,

252
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,383
I can't get used to it.

253
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,582
He's the only one who orders it...

254
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,713
at our cafe.

255
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:50,953
Really?

256
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:53,253
So this is a custom drink for me.

257
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:54,653
Please don't get rid of it.

258
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,123
Anyone interested in a group blind date?

259
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,423
I'll pass.

260
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:01,533
I don't have time because of
the theater festival rehearsals.

261
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,133
How about you?

262
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:06,472
I'm not going either.

263
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:08,133
I don't care about a group blind date.

264
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,843
I'm worried about my future.

265
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:13,213
I might have to work
part-time to buy materials.

266
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:14,742
I got introduced to a good part-time job.

267
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:15,773
Do you want to do it with me?

268
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:17,013
They pay on the same day.

269
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,853
Really? I'm on it.

270
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:21,983
- Okay. - Yes!

271
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:23,853
I wanted to go...

272
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,252
- on a group blind date.
- Just focus on studying.

273
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,293
Fine.

274
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:37,502
(I went to the department
room, but you weren't there.)

275
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:38,633
(I guess you're not working overnight?)

276
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:42,973
I'm not going to work every
day. It's only for a while.

277
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,473
And they pay me on the same day.

278
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,043
- They're together again. - Be careful!

279
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:25,383
Are you all right?

280
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,253
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:35,193
Be careful.

282
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:37,323
Okay. Sorry.

283
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,033
It's a relief.

284
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:44,733
That was close.

285
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:54,113
By the way, it seems you have zero reflex.

286
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:55,673
You were right next to her.

287
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:57,383
You should've caught it...

288
00:20:58,783 --> 00:20:59,843
like me.

289
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:04,923
It seems you're not humble then.

290
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:07,453
What a show-off.

291
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,333
- Are you going to class? - Yes.

292
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:19,863
I'm also heading this way.

293
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:22,033
Let's go together.

294
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:25,543
Sure.

295
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:31,843
Shoot!

296
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:34,913
- Nice. - Hey.

297
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:47,993
She hasn't changed.

298
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,073
Hey.

299
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:09,453
Where are you going?

300
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:13,253
- This way. - We're going...

301
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:15,353
this way. Okay then.

302
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:17,623
- Let's go. - Okay.

303
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,193
Bye.

304
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:32,873
This isn't going to work.

305
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,223
I wonder when... Oh, hold on.

306
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,792
Bani, come out quickly!

307
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:47,793
(Weekly Sports)

308
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:48,892
It's starting.

309
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:51,123
Come out quickly. Your
mom will be on TV today.

310
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,323
- Oh, the game last time? - Yes.

311
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:56,932
Over there. She's on TV. You're on TV.

312
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:58,832
- It's not even the first time.
- Extremely popular...

313
00:22:58,833 --> 00:22:59,962
- You're overreacting. - Watch.

314
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,773
They've kicked off the new
season with the opening game.

315
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:06,672
Here with us today as a special guest...

316
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:10,513
is Kim Hyun Kyung, the
coach of Daewun Airlines.

317
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,942
- Hello. Ms. Kim. - Hello.

318
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:14,912
I'm Kim Hyun Kyung, the coach...

319
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:17,153
of Daewun Airlines, the Challengers.

320
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:19,083
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Kim.

321
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,652
Congratulations on the
victory in the opening game.

322
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,492
Can you tell us how you feel?

323
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,833
The players trained very hard.

324
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:28,362
Despite it being the opening match,

325
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:30,833
which is a big game,
they didn't get nervous...

326
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:33,673
and performed just as they usually do.

327
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,633
I think that's why we were
able to achieve a good result.

328
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:40,473
How are you so eloquent?

329
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:42,213
You're born to be on TV.

330
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:45,243
Well, I'm not that good.

331
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:47,483
But Han Yeo Reum, the announcer,

332
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:50,012
really helped me ease my nerves...

333
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,253
before it started.

334
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:52,823
She's a nice person.

335
00:23:53,853 --> 00:23:55,993
She is? How nice is she?

336
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:57,963
I thought she was only pretty,

337
00:23:58,493 --> 00:24:01,132
but she was so friendly and smart.

338
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,133
If I had a son, I would've wanted
her to be my daughter-in-law.

339
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:04,403
Wait.

340
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,403
A son? Did you just say you wanted a son?

341
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,903
- Oh, my gosh. Here you go again.
- Do you want to have a son?

342
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:10,272
Okay. Shall we have a child?

343
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,972
- Shall we?
- Don't say that in front of her.

344
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:14,172
- I'm ready. - All right.

345
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:15,712
You're making me feel lonely again.

346
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:16,782
Thank you.

347
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:17,783
Thank you.

348
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:18,912
Not today.

349
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:21,382
Now, let's move on to the upcoming match...

350
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:24,653
between Daum Life and IBY
Bank, which will begin shortly.

351
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:27,992
- Yes. Let's get ready now.
- They're going. Hurry up.

352
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,793
- Please get ready. - Team.

353
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:32,322
We can finish it quickly
if you guys do well today.

354
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:33,832
- I'm counting on you. - Yes.

355
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,333
- Is everyone not here yet?
- They'll be coming soon.

356
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,903
- Hurry up and check. - Okay.

357
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,773
Why is she not coming?

358
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:49,343
The professor will watch the rehearsal?

359
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:53,613
Is that the only day available?

360
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:57,683
I'm supposed to work as
an extra with Bani that day.

361
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:00,723
The part-time job.

362
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:02,623
I'll do it.

363
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:05,823
Let me take over.

364
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,333
(Kim Min Jeong)

365
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,023
You're an extra, right?

366
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:39,323
Yes. I'm here to cover for Kwon Bo Bae.

367
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,993
- I'm Hwang Jae Yeol. - Okay.

368
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:43,333
- Director, everyone is here. - Is that so?

369
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,233
The two of you will be a couple.

370
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,273
- What? A couple? - Sure. I'm confident.

371
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:51,673
Okay. That's the spirit.

372
00:25:57,813 --> 00:25:58,883
Are you ready?

373
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:01,183
One, two. Action!

374
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:05,623
Finish up the drawings you're working on,

375
00:26:05,723 --> 00:26:07,393
and let's meet here again in two hours.

376
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:08,522
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

377
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:09,693
You're free to go.

378
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:18,663
This is my first time
doing this. It's interesting.

379
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:22,603
By the way,

380
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:25,243
how did you come here?

381
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:27,643
Because I heard you were here.

382
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:35,653
Did you see the post...

383
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:38,523
on our college community?

384
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:42,423
Yes.

385
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:44,663
You didn't say anything about it.

386
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,033
What should I say?

387
00:26:50,563 --> 00:26:53,503
And we're not close enough
to talk about things like that.

388
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,903
You think so?

389
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,643
I thought it'd be nice if you were curious.

390
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:10,683
Anyway,

391
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:14,093
I figured I should tell you.

392
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:18,623
There's nothing between us anymore.

393
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,963
I just hope you don't get...

394
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,373
the wrong idea.

395
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,283
I came here...

396
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:44,853
to say this.

397
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:49,193
Cut! This is not good!

398
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:52,593
You two! You can't stop
walking in the middle!

399
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,463
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, we were doing well.

400
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:58,603
Okay. Let's do it again.

401
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:00,063
Back to your positions!

402
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,933
Hurry up. We don't have time.

403
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:04,403
Come this way.

404
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,043
Hurry up. We don't have time.

405
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:17,323
Ready.

406
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:30,763
He said we're a couple.

407
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,403
One, two. Action!

408
00:28:49,913 --> 00:28:50,923
Cut! This is not good!

409
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:53,023
Why aren't you guys moving?

410
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:57,123
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

411
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:59,423
Gosh, please get it together, will you?

412
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,233
Let's do it again.

413
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:03,663
I'm sorry, but it's raining.

414
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:05,133
What?

415
00:30:12,003 --> 00:30:13,903
You did well today.

416
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:17,003
The theater festival is
just around the corner.

417
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:18,803
So everyone, hold out just a little longer.

418
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,403
- Okay. - Okay.

419
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:22,112
You know many industry professionals...

420
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,843
will be attending the festival, right?

421
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:28,713
Stay sharp and practice thoroughly.

422
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:29,853
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

423
00:30:29,854 --> 00:30:31,252
(Review of the movie "Lovers of Oblivion")

424
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:32,523
This jerk again.

425
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:34,553
Bo Bae?

426
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:36,193
Bo Bae.

427
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,163
Do you have something to say?

428
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:41,293
No. I'll practice hard.

429
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,003
Okay. That's the kind of spirit
a protagonist should have.

430
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:46,863
You're free to go now.

431
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,773
- Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Thank you.

432
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:54,212
Well,

433
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:57,042
to be impressed by such
a narratively weak film,

434
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,142
I guess you usually like movies...

435
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,353
that are all about style with no substance.

436
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,083
What? "All about style?"

437
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:06,153
This little...

438
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:08,593
It's a shame.

439
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:11,122
It seems you didn't understand...

440
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:14,263
the storytelling in the movie.

441
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:18,003
Maybe you should raise
your standards for movies.

442
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:22,073
What? "Raise your standards for movies?"

443
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,233
Gosh.

444
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:25,743
Look at Beautiful Bo Bae.

445
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,773
I have exceptionally high standards.

446
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:37,582
I can't help but doubt your taste,

447
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:40,022
especially since you enjoyed a movie...

448
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,423
that was only rated a 6 out of 10.

449
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:43,293
Gosh, you're questioning my taste?

450
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:48,133
Guys, come get your snacks.

451
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:53,063
Director.

452
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,433
What do we do?

453
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:56,603
What's that?

454
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:58,173
What happened to it?

455
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,972
It can't look different in the next scene.

456
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:02,112
The art director isn't picking up.

457
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:03,113
What?

458
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:04,782
Keep calling!

459
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,742
We've tried over ten times.

460
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:09,013
Are you kidding me? Keep calling!

461
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:11,823
What the...

462
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:14,993
Excuse me. If it's all right with you,

463
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,863
I could try to fix that.

464
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:25,063
This is incredible.

465
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:27,432
No way.

466
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:30,362
I was away checking
the set. You're a lifesaver.

467
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:31,463
Thank you so much.

468
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:34,233
No problem. I'm glad I could help.

469
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:38,003
- Sculpture Department, was it? - Yes.

470
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:42,013
Give me a call if you're
interested in this field as well.

471
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:45,983
Gosh, thank you.

472
00:33:47,113 --> 00:33:48,213
Her drawing is identical.

473
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:50,513
Unbelievable, right?

474
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:52,353
That's what I call talent.

475
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:55,893
Aren't you perhaps interested in acting?

476
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:01,393
Why did they have coffee when
they were not an item anymore?

477
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,633
Where's the harm in that?

478
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:06,063
I'm still in contact with my exes too.

479
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:08,472
That's because they still want to...

480
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:09,633
get in your pants.

481
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,773
If the guy I was interested in
used to date Han Yeo Reum,

482
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:15,013
I'd be out of my mind.

483
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:16,973
Who cares?

484
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:18,413
It's in the past.

485
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,812
On top of that, he told you
things were over between them.

486
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:23,153
Of course, but...

487
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:26,453
they were the power
couple of their high school.

488
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:28,522
If they stay in touch,

489
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:30,093
they might get back together again.

490
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,493
What do you think?

491
00:34:36,163 --> 00:34:37,233
What?

492
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,963
Do you want a relationship with him?

493
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,133
Trust him if you want,

494
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,573
but say something if
it's going to bother you.

495
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:56,113
Oh, Romeo.

496
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,753
Why is your name Romeo?

497
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:10,493
What do you think?

498
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:12,733
Do you want a relationship with him?

499
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:16,903
Trust him if you want,

500
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:19,503
but say something if
it's going to bother you.

501
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,213
Still,

502
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:25,113
I figured I should tell you.

503
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:29,953
There's nothing between us anymore.

504
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:34,993
I just hope you don't get...

505
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:38,463
the wrong idea.

506
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,333
He seemed to mean it.

507
00:35:55,373 --> 00:35:57,273
One hot Solomon's seal tea, right?

508
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,243
And one iced Americano.

509
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,913
Is the coffee for Bani?

510
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,223
Yes. She'll be staying
late working on her project.

511
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:08,653
I see. She has something else
during her late-night sessions.

512
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:10,823
- Should I get you that instead? - Really?

513
00:36:11,663 --> 00:36:12,893
Sure, I'll take that.

514
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:20,532
She says she needs at least
that much in her system...

515
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:22,073
to keep her going late into the night.

516
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:23,533
I see.

517
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:27,203
Right.

518
00:36:29,013 --> 00:36:30,073
Hold on.

519
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,313
- My wallet. - Seriously?

520
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,213
I even made you her special drink.

521
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:35,753
Did I leave it in my car?

522
00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:38,323
Wait. I know I brought it with me.

523
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:39,423
Just a second.

524
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:43,323
I'll put it on your tab just this once.

525
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:46,323
Thanks.

526
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:48,193
I'll pick up the tab later.

527
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:54,063
Bani.

528
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:06,013
Did you get home all right yesterday?

529
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:09,613
Sure. How about you?

530
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:11,623
Same here.

531
00:37:12,923 --> 00:37:15,423
I must've put too much energy
into my scenes yesterday...

532
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:17,353
because I went out cold.

533
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:25,733
Bani, do you like pasta?

534
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:28,333
Pasta?

535
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,203
A decent pasta place opened nearby.

536
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:37,913
Would you like to get pasta with me?

537
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:42,083
Just the two of us?

538
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:45,783
Yes. Just the two of us.

539
00:37:50,223 --> 00:37:51,323
What do you think?

540
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:53,723
Do you want a relationship with him?

541
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,533
Trust him if you want,

542
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:59,333
but say something if
it's going to bother you.

543
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:02,133
Right now,

544
00:38:02,873 --> 00:38:05,103
I want to trust him.

545
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:10,672
Think about it and get back to me.

546
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:11,683
Let's go.

547
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:15,183
We'll have pasta.

548
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:25,323
Right, sure.

549
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:28,433
When?

550
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:30,093
Are you free tomorrow?

551
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:32,903
Yes. Tomorrow will be fine.

552
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:38,003
Good.

553
00:38:38,603 --> 00:38:39,773
I'll see you tomorrow.

554
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,013
See you tomorrow.

555
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,413
I'll call you tomorrow.

556
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,483
Sure.

557
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:51,853
Good.

558
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:10,673
Bani.

559
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:12,973
Wait. Isn't that...

560
00:39:13,573 --> 00:39:15,773
I was told you drank this
when working at night.

561
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,213
Although I can't tell if this
is more coffee or cream.

562
00:39:20,013 --> 00:39:22,653
I was going to work late today
and thought about getting it.

563
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,753
Thanks for this.

564
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:43,433
Thanks to the coffee you got me,

565
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:45,843
I still have enough energy to spare.

566
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:50,643
What is it that you want to say?

567
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,113
What?

568
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:55,513
You've been waiting for the right moment.

569
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:57,413
Am I wrong?

570
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:01,393
Well...

571
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:03,493
Ji Won.

572
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:06,523
A guy would only ask a girl out to pasta...

573
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:08,633
if it were a date, right?

574
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:12,333
Why do you ask?

575
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,203
Did someone ask you out to pasta?

576
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:18,943
Jae Yeol.

577
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:22,642
He explained how there
was nothing going on...

578
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:24,413
between him and Han Yeo Reum.

579
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,813
Also, he invited me out to pasta.

580
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:30,053
I've been wondering what it meant.

581
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:35,023
It seems odd for the two of
us to have pasta alone, right?

582
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:39,663
Why do you say that?

583
00:40:40,663 --> 00:40:41,893
Do you want it to be a date?

584
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:43,493
What?

585
00:40:43,494 --> 00:40:46,203
Gosh, no. Of course not.

586
00:40:47,603 --> 00:40:50,372
The proportions seem off. Don't you think?

587
00:40:50,373 --> 00:40:52,673
Is it leaning to one side?

588
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:08,823
- Are you done with your work? - Yes.

589
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:12,163
- What's that?
- The university's Lost and Found.

590
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:13,563
I wanted to get them back to the owners.

591
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:16,293
Get on it, then. I'm heading out.

592
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:18,933
Yeol, wait.

593
00:41:20,263 --> 00:41:21,603
Can you get this to him?

594
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:24,273
- What is it? - Won's wallet.

595
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:27,872
I have too much to do,
so please do this for me.

596
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:29,043
(Cha Ji Won)

597
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:30,973
Sure thing.

598
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:32,543
- Get to work. - Thanks.

599
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,623
Won, look.

600
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:46,193
Doesn't it seem better?

601
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:52,533
What's wrong?

602
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:55,173
It's definitely not good.

603
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:57,433
Really? Is it bad?

604
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:01,312
But the proportions seem evenly balanced.

605
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,313
It's not that.

606
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:03,873
That.

607
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:06,713
I see. Is there something on it?

608
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:15,323
Hold still.

609
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:37,473
Bani.

610
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:53,163
You must be working on your project.

611
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:55,333
Will...

612
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,363
- you be long? - Yes.

613
00:42:57,793 --> 00:42:59,563
I'll have to stay behind and work on this.

614
00:43:01,673 --> 00:43:02,733
The both of you?

615
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:10,843
Don't push yourself too hard.

616
00:43:11,843 --> 00:43:13,313
I'll call when I get home.

617
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:16,713
Sure. Get home safely.

618
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:25,093
Won, can we talk?

619
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:37,373
I wanted to make things clear with you.

620
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:39,543
About what?

621
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:42,473
I told you my feelings were serious.

622
00:43:44,683 --> 00:43:45,813
But what about you?

623
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:49,453
How many times do I have to say this?

624
00:43:49,813 --> 00:43:51,252
She's only a friend to me.

625
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,153
And I'd like to believe that.

626
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:55,093
But...

627
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:58,493
maybe you don't know how you feel.

628
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:01,023
Or maybe you do, and you're hiding it.

629
00:44:12,043 --> 00:44:13,903
(Cha Ji Won)

630
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:15,313
Either way,

631
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:19,613
I made my feelings for Bani clear.

632
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:22,013
So...

633
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,283
be good to her.

634
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:30,823
I'd rather...

635
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:34,323
you not...

636
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:36,863
confuse her.

637
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,193
Wait. Are we at my place?

638
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:45,033
How long was I out?

639
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:47,433
Why didn't you wake me up?

640
00:45:48,403 --> 00:45:50,503
You weren't out for long. It's fine.

641
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:55,173
You didn't snore nor did you drool.

642
00:45:56,843 --> 00:45:57,973
Unbelievable.

643
00:46:00,683 --> 00:46:03,583
Anyway, thanks for driving me home again.

644
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:06,253
Get in safely. I'll leave
once I see you're inside.

645
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,253
Sure.

646
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:15,163
Get home safely.

647
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,863
Sorry. My finger slipped.

648
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:34,743
My gosh.

649
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:53,693
(Hwang Jae Yeol)

650
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:57,593
Hello.

651
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,003
Did you get home safely?

652
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:02,773
Yes. I got home just now.

653
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,243
Good job today.

654
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:08,103
Wait, that won't do.

655
00:48:09,213 --> 00:48:12,613
Since you worked hard today,
let's get tastier pasta tomorrow.

656
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:18,013
Right. So what time
should we meet tomorrow?

657
00:48:19,783 --> 00:48:23,992
My class will be done around
6pm. What about yours?

658
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:25,593
Oh, mine too.

659
00:48:26,763 --> 00:48:27,823
That's great then.

660
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:29,633
The pasta place is around the City Hall.

661
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:31,563
Then...

662
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:34,663
- why don't we meet at 7pm?
- Sure. Sounds good.

663
00:48:36,603 --> 00:48:37,633
Okay.

664
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:39,603
I'll text you tomorrow.

665
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:42,273
Sleep tight, Bani.

666
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:46,943
Okay. You too, Jae Yeol.

667
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:02,093
"Jae Yeol?"

668
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,133
She called me Jae Yeol.

669
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:13,273
"Jae Yeol."

670
00:49:13,943 --> 00:49:14,973
Gosh, you...

671
00:49:24,453 --> 00:49:25,853
Are we really turning...

672
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:28,123
into a thing?

673
00:49:40,663 --> 00:49:42,073
See you later at 7pm.

674
00:49:55,683 --> 00:49:56,883
- Really? - I know.

675
00:49:57,213 --> 00:49:58,483
- She's gorgeous. - No way.

676
00:49:58,653 --> 00:49:59,883
- I can't believe this.
- She's so stunning.

677
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:02,193
- What's going on? - Oh, my.

678
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:06,223
- I'm so jealous. - Oh, my.

679
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:08,223
She's so beautiful.

680
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:24,773
(Yeol hearts Yeo Reum)

681
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:27,082
Seriously. Everyone
can buy only one of these.

682
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,783
- No, I'm good.
- You really don't want a bite?

683
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:30,453
What?

684
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:36,493
It's been a while, Dong Ha.

685
00:50:37,653 --> 00:50:39,193
Hey, it's been a while.

686
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,363
I've been following you on TV.

687
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:44,793
Thanks.

688
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:47,663
You've gotten more handsome now.

689
00:50:48,773 --> 00:50:49,803
You think so?

690
00:50:57,543 --> 00:50:59,113
I'm here for a festival meeting...

691
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,953
and to say hello to the professors.

692
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:07,153
Do you want to have dinner...

693
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:09,023
when my meeting is over?

694
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,463
When does your last class end today?

695
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:28,373
- Bye. - Bye.

696
00:51:29,143 --> 00:51:30,413
Come on, just go.

697
00:51:46,723 --> 00:51:50,193
All right. That's enough of
this boring history lesson.

698
00:51:51,263 --> 00:51:55,503
I received everyone's
proposals over the weekend.

699
00:51:56,003 --> 00:52:01,002
I'll be sending you some feedback,
so take that into consideration.

700
00:52:01,003 --> 00:52:02,013
Yeol.

701
00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:04,743
I want us to take a break.

702
00:52:06,483 --> 00:52:09,353
What do you mean?

703
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,153
I want a break.

704
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:18,963
So what do you mean by that?

705
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:22,263
It's self-explanatory.

706
00:52:24,463 --> 00:52:25,603
Right now,

707
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,733
I don't want to be with you.

708
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:37,843
What you're saying doesn't make any sense.

709
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:42,112
We were fine up until yesterday.
Why do you suddenly want a break?

710
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:43,183
You're just...

711
00:52:46,723 --> 00:52:47,923
too much...

712
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:51,353
for me.

713
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:56,993
What?

714
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,233
I feel so lame...

715
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:07,073
when I'm with you.

716
00:53:26,523 --> 00:53:27,822
I've been thinking about it for a few days.

717
00:53:27,823 --> 00:53:29,062
But this isn't right.

718
00:53:29,063 --> 00:53:30,562
(Yeo Reum)

719
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:32,163
I don't know what's going on with you now.

720
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:34,133
Let's talk in person.

721
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,173
Yeol.

722
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:37,533
I heard Yeo Reum went
abroad as an exchange student.

723
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:40,043
Gosh, how could she leave
without saying goodbye to me?

724
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:44,943
An exchange student?

725
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:48,813
What? You didn't know?

726
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:52,783
Hey!

727
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:03,763
The number you have
dialled is not in service.

728
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,163
Please check and call again.

729
00:54:10,933 --> 00:54:14,943
(Yeo Reum)

730
00:54:15,573 --> 00:54:18,443
("Weekly Sports")

731
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:21,513
- Hey. - Hey, you're out too early.

732
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:23,883
Is there anything you'd like
to do? What should we do?

733
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,253
Do you want to watch the
movie, "Handsome Man?"

734
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:26,623
I watched it yesterday.

735
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,152
- How are you slower than a soldier?
- Hello, viewers...

736
00:54:30,153 --> 00:54:32,063
- of "Weekly Sports 24."
- Are you coming from the terminal?

737
00:54:32,423 --> 00:54:34,063
- I'm Announcer Han Yeo Reum, - Then...

738
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:36,562
- your new host starting today.
- Remember our regular spot?

739
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:37,592
- What was the name?
- The word, "first," stirs...

740
00:54:37,593 --> 00:54:38,832
- excitement and fond memories...
- Yes! "Animal Farm."

741
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,263
- to all of us. - Should we meet there?

742
00:54:40,563 --> 00:54:43,073
This is my first news
program after joining MBS.

743
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:46,072
I've been a fan of "Weekly Sports 24."

744
00:54:46,073 --> 00:54:47,873
So it's a huge honour to host the show now.

745
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:52,413
I will try my best wholeheartedly
to live up to my title,

746
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:55,553
the youngest announcer of MBS Sports.

747
00:54:55,813 --> 00:54:57,383
I look forward to your support.

748
00:54:57,513 --> 00:54:58,513
Hello?

749
00:54:59,723 --> 00:55:01,383
Are you there?

750
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:03,353
Hey, are you even listening?

751
00:55:05,223 --> 00:55:07,923
You can ask the TA, and
she will explain it to you.

752
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:10,563
And...

753
00:55:11,463 --> 00:55:14,103
if you need any help regarding...

754
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:33,883
(See you later at 7pm.)

755
00:55:56,213 --> 00:55:59,143
What time are you meeting him later?

756
00:56:00,883 --> 00:56:02,083
At 7pm.

757
00:56:04,713 --> 00:56:07,123
I'm heading toward the City Hall too.

758
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:09,353
Should I drop you off on my way?

759
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:36,353
Where are you going?

760
00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:38,053
Have dinner with me.

761
00:56:40,983 --> 00:56:42,123
I have plans.

762
00:56:42,723 --> 00:56:44,153
With whom? With your friend?

763
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:47,963
It's not with a girlfriend, right?

764
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:51,933
You did this earlier today
and at the cafe that day.

765
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:54,203
You keep leaving me first.

766
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:07,183
What are you doing right now?

767
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:10,283
You broke up with me as you pleased.

768
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:11,783
Remember how you ghosted me?

769
00:57:12,423 --> 00:57:14,053
How could you be this brazen now?

770
00:57:15,353 --> 00:57:16,723
I never said I wanted to break up with you.

771
00:57:17,023 --> 00:57:18,323
I said I just wanted a break.

772
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:22,833
- Are you kidding me?
- I wasn't ending it with you.

773
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:24,433
I meant that I would come back for you.

774
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:33,203
You're unbelievable,

775
00:57:34,073 --> 00:57:35,143
Han Yeo Reum.

776
00:57:37,573 --> 00:57:38,983
You're still self-centered as always.

777
00:57:46,983 --> 00:57:48,223
Please do me a favour.

778
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:52,023
Don't ever come to see me again.

779
00:57:53,693 --> 00:57:54,823
Don't even say hello.

780
00:57:57,893 --> 00:57:59,033
I don't have...

781
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:02,233
any more patience left for you.

782
00:58:11,543 --> 00:58:15,713
(City Hall Station)

783
00:58:21,683 --> 00:58:22,723
Bani.

784
00:58:25,993 --> 00:58:27,123
Hey, Hwang Jae Yeol!

785
00:58:42,973 --> 00:58:44,743
You've made your point.

786
00:58:45,513 --> 00:58:47,112
This is the last tantrum
of yours I'll put up with.

787
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:48,113
So...

788
00:58:49,013 --> 00:58:50,053
enough is enough.

789
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:51,983
Were you even listening to me earlier?

790
00:58:52,483 --> 00:58:54,723
- Why are you being selfish...
- I missed you.

791
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,093
You...

792
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:07,233
You missed me too.

793
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:09,973
That's why you're so angry with me.

794
00:59:11,403 --> 00:59:13,303
If you didn't have any
feelings left for me,

795
00:59:14,203 --> 00:59:16,713
you wouldn't be this angry. Am I wrong?

796
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:36,433
You couldn't have...

797
00:59:38,263 --> 00:59:39,903
moved on from me.

798
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:38,443
(Crushology 101)

799
01:02:39,113 --> 01:02:41,513
How am I supposed to understand that?

800
01:02:41,683 --> 01:02:43,352
You made a fool out of
her when she trusted you.

801
01:02:43,353 --> 01:02:44,612
Is that your way of showing your sincerity?

802
01:02:44,613 --> 01:02:46,323
- What? - Don't mislead her.

803
01:02:47,953 --> 01:02:49,953
You can't be this handsome and sweet.

804
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:51,352
That's just cheating.

805
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:52,353
You're pretty.

806
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:54,963
- Please let's talk it out. - Let go of me.

807
01:02:55,363 --> 01:02:57,163
I heard Hwang Jae Yeol was sick.

808
01:03:00,503 --> 01:03:01,602
It's called the Confession Tree.

809
01:03:01,603 --> 01:03:03,903
Simply put, it's like
making a public confession.

810
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:06,343
Then what is it? Are you
in love for the first time?

811
01:03:06,373 --> 01:03:09,343
Then could you come up to the stage?
