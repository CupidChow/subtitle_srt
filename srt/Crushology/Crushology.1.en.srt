00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,440
Let's go hang out somewhere else.

7
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:21,764
Okay.

8
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:26,934
Wait for me.

9
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:32,244
When I was a kid,

10
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:34,714
I chose a fairy tale book based on...

11
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:37,383
its cover, whether it had a handsome man.

12
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,655
("The Crybaby Prince")

13
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,543
Getting the light and darkness right is important...

14
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:07,844
when drawing with a pencil.

15
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:10,044
Think of the lightest part as the origin.

16
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:13,244
Follow its path, and it gets darker. Easy, right?

17
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:15,614
That's when it hit me.

18
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:19,283
My heart pounds at handsome men,

19
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:22,294
making me a softie for good looks.

20
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:34,033
I sublimated this overwhelming sensation...

21
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,774
into art.

22
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,614
With that, I got into the Sculpture Department.

23
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:04,963
You're unbelievable, Bani.

24
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,180
Exactly.

25
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,673
You have such discerning taste in art.

26
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,710
Your boyfriend must be a looker.

27
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:11,104
Bani!

28
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:20,754
The first boyfriend I have chosen is...

29

(Ko Bong Soo, Yein University, Bani's first-ever boyfriend)

30

31
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:52,114
Say hi to him. He's my boyfriend.

My name is Ko Bong Soo.

33
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:01,093
Bani must not care about looks when dating guys.

34
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,994
Right? I guess she only looks at the inner beauty.

(Kwon Bo Bae, Nam Kot Nim)

36
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:19,320
Don't you go for looks?

37
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:20,814
Why are you dating him?

38
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,854
Bani!

39
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:30,754
I like you.

40
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:36,594
I'm serious.

41
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:42,564
I like you.

42
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,582
(I like you.)

43
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,574
I like you!

44

(I like you.)

45
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:05,724
Isn't it obvious?

46
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,693
He adores me tons.

47
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,794
(Officially started dating)

48
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,364
That's all I need.

49
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:18,610
Nothing is more important than feelings.

50
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,604
Even so, this doesn't feel all that right.

51
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:24,773
What can we do about it?

52
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:27,874
As long as Bani is happy, we should be too.

53
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,414
Hello.

A bright sunny day.

57
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,424
And the refreshing breeze.

58
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,394
Everything is perfect.

59
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,603
But of course, the most perfect thing is...

60
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,004
Bani!

61
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:02,904
Bong Soo!

62
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,144
Bani!

63
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:13,484
My undoubtedly happy love life.

64
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:15,853
Listen, Bani.

65
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:18,330
How about a trip this weekend? The weather will be great.

66
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,830
"A trip?" I love going on trips.

67
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:23,524
When should we go? Saturday or Sunday?

68
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:27,194
If you want, we can go on Saturday and return on Sunday.

69
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:29,633
You mean an overnight trip?

70
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,104
Yes. Is it a problem?

71
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,474
Oh, and this.

72
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:40,204
Ta-da.

73
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,543
What's this? Is it for me?

74
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:43,544
Yes.

75
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:44,583
I bought it, thinking it'd look good on you.

76
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:45,660
Pretty, right?

77
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,313
It's gorgeous!

78
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,014
Hold on. Let me put it on you.

79
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:52,184
I'm getting nervous.

80
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:55,854
I'll put it on you.

81
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:22,554
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:23,830
Is that it?

83
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:25,584
Do you think "I'm sorry" is enough?

84
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,654
- You bumped... - Sorry.

85
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:30,070
- How dare you... - Bong Soo.

86
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:31,993
- It still looks new. - But he...

87
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,134
I can tell the pearls are real.

88
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,634
Watch where you're going, okay?

89
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,934
Bong Soo. How do I look?

90
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:44,444
Pretty, isn't it? I love it.

91
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:46,604
Right?

92
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,384
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

93
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,084

Kot Nim.

95

Here's your mocha latte.

96

- Enjoy. - Wait.

97
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,263
You're my ideal type.

98
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:15,504
For real. You're so pretty.

99
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,074
I see.

100
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,614
But I've got the nastiest personality.

101
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:21,820
What?

102
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:23,514
Enjoy your coffee.

103
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,984
Right. Keep up the great work.

104
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:31,730
Bo Bae. Isn't this really pretty?

105
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:33,630
Bong Soo has great taste.

106
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,354
It's all right, but not great.

107
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:37,794
"All right?"

108
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,794
How is this just "all right?"

109
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:42,633
Why are you so mean when it comes to my boyfriend?

110
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:43,933
Stop it, will you?

111
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,910
If we're asking questions, let me ask you one.

112
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,673
You have high standards for men.

113
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,980
But why did you ignore your boyfriend's looks?

114
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,403
Is there a need to ask?

115
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,404
- It's because... - Kwon Bo Bae.

116
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:58,384
What? Why are you here? Weren't you going straight home?

117
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,444
Didn't you say you needed this?

- Was your name Ban... - It's Ban Hee Jin.

121

I remember telling you last time.

122
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:15,134
Did you?

123
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm leaving first. Keep up the good work.

124
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:19,164
Bye.

125
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,080
Look at him.

126
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,304
Good-looking guys like him have no interest in me.

127
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:29,043
Are you saying...

128
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:31,390
that's why looks don't matter to you for your boyfriend?

129
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:32,820
Stop kidding me.

130
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:35,254
I know that a face like his isn't good enough for you.

131
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:37,784
That's ridiculous.

132
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:41,070
I wonder if you can say that even when you meet someone...

133
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:43,054
incredibly handsome.

134
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:55,634
My gosh.

135
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,664
Oh, no.

I have my application to return to school.

142
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,830
When will it get processed?

143
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:50,224
Sorry?

144

Oh, right. Let's see.

145
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:56,163
Your application will be processed within the day.

Hey. Did you see this year's freshmen?

152
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,213
The girls were all so pretty.

153
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:17,483
Of course. And I agree with you.

154
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,223
I especially found the bob hair pretty.

Oh, yes! She's a beauty.

I'll keep it a secret.

I know, right? He's my role model.

172
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:15,814
"If you can't say it to their face, don't say it..."

173
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,944
I can't do it. Let's go.

174
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:20,614
Gosh.

175
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:23,153
Yeol. That's no reason to kill their spirits on the day...

176
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,500
you've returned to school.

177
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,924
We need to nip it in the bud.

178
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:29,323
Keep being nice,

179
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:31,023
and they'll cause trouble later.

180
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:33,294
I see. As expected of the department rep.

181
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:36,534
Really. Why did I have to become the department rep?

182
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,364
It's such a hassle.

183
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:43,280
Hey, department rep. Wait for me.

184
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,174
You walk fast, department rep.

185
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,994
(Bani)

186
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,664
Gosh.

187
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,313
(Bong)

188
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,474
Is he busy?

189
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,940
(Jung Geun Cheol)

190
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,514
Oh, wait.

191
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,014
Hello?

192
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:32,424
Of course. What did I say? It won't be before long.

193
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:33,753
Who's that?

194
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:35,653
Go on the trip, and it's a done deal.

195
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:38,724
I already dropped a hint about being an overnight one.

196
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:46,634
You know, right?

197
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:49,474
How much effort I've put into sleeping with Bani.

198
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,804
- Is he crazy? - What in the world?

199
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,714
Yes. Bani, no matter what.

200
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,243
I've been looking for the chance to sleep with her...

201
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,144
since the day we started dating.

202
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,153
Gosh, but she was playing so hard to get.

203
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:05,184
I'm telling you, I couldn't even make any attempts.

204
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,853
I'm not sure if she's quick-witted...

205
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:09,293
- or really slow. - What?

206
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:10,594
Hey, Yeol.

207
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,323
- What's this broadcast? - I pulled cheap tricks,

208
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:13,793
- suggesting we rest somewhere, - What is he talking about?

209
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,394
but it didn't work.

210
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:17,603
That's why I'll make her drink...

211
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,564
the second we get to the destination.

212
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:23,604
He's talking about Bani, right?

213
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:25,604
I'm going to kill that punk today.

214
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:28,390
Since we'll be drunk,

215
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,843
she'll get the message if I humour her...

216
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,184
and get the mood going.

217
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:39,160
Hey. Did you seriously sweet-talk her into it?

218
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:41,670
My wish is her command.

219
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,153
For real?

220
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:45,894
Honestly, aren't I way out of her league?

221
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,440
I hit on her because she looked easy, okay?

222
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:49,834
Seriously?

223
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:52,304
I'll just keep hitting on her.

224
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:53,834
Why are you dating her?

225
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,174
Simply put, to sleep with her.

226
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,714
- Gosh. - I told you, didn't I?

227
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:04,614
That she was easy.

228
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:15,793
I'll make it happen for sure for all the time...

229
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,424
and effort I put into her.

230
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,264
What? That necklace?

231
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,370
I used it to soften her up to go on the trip.

232
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:24,704
It's fake anyway.

233
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:28,574
Looking for one that looked identical was tough.

234
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,574
Hey! What a wacko.

235
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:36,344
What?

236
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:37,844
The mic.

237
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,054
Oh, my.

238
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:46,824
Bani.

239
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:51,764
Bani! Oh, no!

240
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:56,894
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,220
We'd like to make an announcement.

242
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:14,713
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience...

243
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:17,253
caused to the students of Yein University...

244
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:19,384
due to incorrect broadcast content.

245
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:22,254
- My gosh. - We'd like to apologize once again.

246
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:23,923
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience...

247
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:26,740
caused to the students of Yein University...

248
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,194

(Bong)

250
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:46,814
Oh, Hee Jin.

251
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:49,884
So it's...

252
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:52,484
It's...

253
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,070
It's all my fault.

254
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,253
But you're misunderstanding what I said.

255
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:57,254
I didn't mean it.

256
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,323
You're saying I'm misunderstanding after saying those things yourself?

257
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,270
I was just trying to show off to my friend...

258
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:02,733
and went overboard.

259
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,510
Do you think it makes sense?

260
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,603
It's true.

261
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:08,803
You know how much I like you.

262
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,204
Please believe me.

263
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,674
You jerk.

264
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:16,313
He's Ko Bong Soo who studies Philosophy.

265
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:17,460
Hey.

266
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:19,684
You're not even human.

267
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:22,814
It's humiliating.

268
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:28,354
It's Ban Hee Jin.

269
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:33,464
I can't do this anymore.

270
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,110
Hey.

271
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:38,164
You should also stop pretending.

272
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,234
Did you really not know my intention?

273
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:43,474
You wanted it too. Don't act like a victim only now.

274
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:47,704
What? Why?

275
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,520
You were all smiles when things were good.

276
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,544
But now you're embarrassed...

277
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,044
because your true colours might be exposed in front of everyone?

278
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:55,160
You're nothing special, but I've been putting up with you.

279
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:58,624
You're nothing special, but I've been putting up with you.

280
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,120
Hey.

281
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:29,884
I'm going to say this just once, so listen carefully.

282
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:31,883
I only dated you...

283
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:34,354
because you begged desperately.

284
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:37,124
Hey, I could meet a good-looking guy too!

285
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:40,740
Don't you dare show me that face from now on.

286
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,640
It's your lucky day.

287
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,064
You jerk!

288
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,674
Oh, my gosh. That was unbelievable.

289
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:04,413
The call cannot be connected.

290
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:06,214
She's not picking up.

291
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:09,313

(Gosh, Fiery Fist at Yein University is here.)

294
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,183
(- That guy is trash. - He should drop out of school.)

295
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:14,184
(But honestly, the girl has an issue too.)

296
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:16,154
Are they crazy?

297
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,264
"She brought it upon herself?"

298
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,763
Are they joking?

302

Bani.

303
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,784
It's all my fault.

304
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:18,983
What are you talking about? It's not your fault.

305
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:20,993
He's trash.

306
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,294
No.

307
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,994
Just because he said he liked me,

308
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:29,334
I let him have his way.

309
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,564
I like you.

310
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:33,104
I like you!

311
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:37,604
I'm just...

312

I'm just regretting everything.

313
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,874
What do you regret the most?

314
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:47,614
The fact that I thought it was all good...

315
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,684
as long as he liked me.

316
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,654
Actually, what was the most important...

317
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,564
was my feelings.

318
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,764
It's okay because you know now.

319
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,464
What's important is the future.

320
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:06,263

321
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,564
Yes.

323
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,324
I've made up my mind.

324

Listen carefully.

325
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:36,894
I'm going to start dating good-looking people too!

326

There you go!

She's sleeping so quietly.

335
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:13,134

00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:19,973
- Oh, my goodness. - Gosh.

339
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:22,673
If you're up, wash up quickly and eat.

340
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:24,483
I've made a refreshing hangover soup for you.

341
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:26,113
How about the other girls?

342
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,490
They had breakfast and left a long time ago.

343
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:31,884
Gosh, stop dawdling and get up quickly. You should go to school.

344
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:35,523
I should. I should go to school.

345
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,624
I should go and take a leave of absence.

346
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:39,824
- "A leave of absence?" - "A leave of absence?"

347
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:48,774
Honey.

348
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,744
Can you ask Bani...

349
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:54,650
if she really wants to take a leave of absence?

350
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,214
I will.

351
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,520
Oh, gosh.

352
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:01,013
What's the reason this time?

353
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:02,053
Why do you want to take time off...

354
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,354
as soon as the new semester starts again?

355
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:05,653
- "Again?" - "Again?"

356
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,954
Yes.

357
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:08,423
Don't you remember?

358
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:09,793
You said you wanted to move to another school...

359
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:11,193
as soon as the new semester began and made a fuss.

360
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,864
Oh, right.

361
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,864
I remember.

362
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,803
Let me go to another school!

363
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:21,873
Let me move!

364
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:25,244
Bani, no matter how much you want to do it,

365
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:29,550
you can't follow the student teacher to go to school in Gangwon Province!

366
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:30,890
What about it?

367
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:32,813
The water is clean, the air is nice, and it makes me happy.

368
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:36,414
What's wrong with that? Just let me go!

369
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:44,024
Coming.

370
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:45,524
Oh, gosh.

371
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,434
Hello.

372
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:52,033
We moved in next door today.

373
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,364
And my mother asked me to give you some rice cakes.

374
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:56,933
Oh, yes.

375
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,944
I heard someone was moving in. Was it today?

376
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:02,914
- You didn't have to do this. - Thank you.

377
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:12,084
He was her first love.

378
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:16,223
If it weren't for him,

379
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,923
she would've moved to Gangwon Province.

380
00:25:17,924 --> 00:25:18,963
Oh, gosh.

381
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:21,464
No. He's not the reason I didn't go.

382
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:23,694
Anyway,

383
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:26,834
I've made up my mind for sure this time. So don't stop me.

384
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,704
- I'll get going. - All right.

385
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:41,083
If a strikingly handsome guy appears,

386
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:43,954
she'll never say she'll take a leave of absence again.

387
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:47,324
- A handsome guy like you. - What?

388
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,994
What is this? A signal?

389
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:51,993
Shall we go to the room?

390
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:53,394
I'm ready.

391
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:00,193
(Application for Leave of Absence)

392
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:15,784
- Excuse me. - Yes?

393
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:18,130
I'm kind of lost.

394
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:19,954
Do you know how to get to the library?

395
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,706
- Excuse me. - Yes?

396
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,167
I'm kind of lost.

397
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,991
Do you know how to get to the library?

398
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:08,062
What is this perfectly measured beauty?

399
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,202
Is this the Renaissance...

400
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,832
I've only heard about?

401
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,012
Or...

402
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:26,282
is it a golden ratio of a Greek sculpture?

403
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:38,422
He has charm.

404
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,862
He has great charm.

405
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:47,401
I feel like he would be choosing flowers...

406
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:49,372
with sad eyes somehow.

407
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:53,272
At that moment, the owner of the flower shop comes out and asks.

408
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,172
Is it for your girlfriend?

409
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,382
Then he smiles without a word.

410
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,082
I don't know why. He just has to.

411
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,481
Then...

412
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:09,792
he puts the flowers in a vase beautifully.

413
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:14,192
Let me tell you where he is.

414
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,592
It's his sick girlfriend's hospital room.

415
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:19,738
How are you feeling today?

416
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:22,401
Then his delicate and dainty girlfriend...

417
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:23,902
would answer.

418
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:30,342
"Same as always."

419
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:33,858
Oh, my gosh. Why does she have my face?

420
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:35,912
Get it together, Ban Hee Jin.

421
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:45,662
I'm sorry. I was thinking about something else for a moment.

422
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:47,508
Where do you want to go again?

423
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:50,362
Where is the library?

424
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,862
What?

425
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,831
Is this...

426
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,748
(Sculpting Technique)

427
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,472
Are you a freshman in the Sculpture Department?

428
00:28:57,772 --> 00:28:59,742
No, I'm not.

429
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:05,158
Mom, Dad, I've made up my mind.

430
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:08,512
I'll never leave Yein University.

431
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,222
Let's go. I'll take you there.

432
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,468
Why were you by yourself?

433
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:24,762
Did you not make friends yet?

434
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:27,308
I'm a bit shy around new people.

435
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,702
I see.

436
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,948
It's okay. I understand it can be awkward.

437
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:33,872
You bumped into me thanks to that.

438
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:36,771
Actually, I'm the Sculpture Department's representative...

439
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:38,312
this semester.

440
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:40,411
If you don't know anything, feel free to ask me.

441
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,882
I'll tell you everything.

442
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:43,712
Sure.

443
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:45,958
How about your course registration? Did it go well?

444
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:47,528
It must've been hard as a freshman.

445
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,891
I was a bit late,

446
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:50,938
so I just registered for the remaining classes.

447
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:52,968
You did? You probably don't have a long break between classes then.

448
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,268
It's a bummer.

449
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,431
I would've scheduled all the classes for you...

450
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:56,862
if we had met just a week earlier.

451
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:58,838
Oh, have you tried the special meal at school?

452
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:00,932
You must try it.

453
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:03,171
Actually, it's a little expensive.

454
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,542
Let's eat together...

455
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,302
next time.

456
00:30:08,112 --> 00:30:09,572
Yes. Let's do that.

457
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,918
(Main Library)

458
00:30:12,943 --> 00:30:14,882
Thank you for taking me.

459
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:17,822
No need to thank me. I just did what I should do.

460
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:19,821
If there's something you don't know,

461
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:22,322
feel free to contact me at the number I gave you earlier.

462
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:24,398
I have a lot of past exam papers.

463
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,698
Okay.

464
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,291
I'll get going then.

465
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,132
Let's definitely meet up next time.

466
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,632
Okay.

467
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,532
Bye.

468
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,082
No way.

469
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,282
Who is that man possessing sublime beauty?

470
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:30,922
A sharp jawline, a cold gaze,

471
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,462
and chilly lips.

472
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,532
There's something to him.

473
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,532
There's definitely something to him.

474
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:43,632
Even the hottest summer weather would be blasted away.

475
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,702
He has that refreshing vibe to him.

476
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,888
Let's see. On the back of his bike...

477
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:52,982
would be his high school sweetheart.

478
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:55,558
That girlfriend of his...

479
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,422
must have dark hair with dark eyes...

480
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,252
Me?

481
00:32:24,382 --> 00:32:25,981
Why did I add my face again?

482
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:28,752
Stop picturing you with them, Ban Hee Jin.

483
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:32,698
I'm glad I didn't take time off from school.

484
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:35,652
This is the Almighty telling me to stay.

("The Ultimate Male Divinity" by Ban Hee Jin aka Bani)

486
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,182
I see you have good taste.

487
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:07,882
It's by the top second-year student in our department.

488
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:10,592
With this piece, she received the highest score in history.

489
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,861
When it comes to artistic talent,

490
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:14,392
she'll be the most famous.

491
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:20,362
Hold on.

492
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,732
You kind of look like him.

493
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,542
Even more with that smile.

494
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,612
Enjoy.

495
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:10,982
What's his problem?

496
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,432
That was unbelievably annoying.

497
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,802
Excuse me.

498
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,442
I was just about to put my things in it.

499
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:37,512
So?

500
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,052
Shouldn't it go...

501
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:43,982
to whoever occupies it first?

502
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:00,478
I can finally function again.

503
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:02,378
Nothing cures a hangover like cream buns.

504

505
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:05,471
is that you ran into not 1 but 2 handsome guys.

506
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:06,648
Back to back.

507
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,648
I had no idea our campus was this beautiful.

508
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,242
The campus...

509
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:12,918
is full of light.

510
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:14,312
Is it bright?

511
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,458
Lucky you.

512
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,798
I'd also like to encounter good looking guys like that.

513
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:19,851
Tell me about it.

514
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,792
We had better things to do then work on our art.

515
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:25,491
The new semester event is keeping us from having our eyes blessed.

516
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:28,308
Still, they look pretty when gathered like this.

517
00:35:28,332 --> 00:35:30,192
They remind me of cherry blossoms.

518
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:32,361
I'd love to have...

519
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:34,972
cherry blossom petals flutter around me and my boo.

520
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:39,902
I doubt that's in my cards though.

521
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,148
It wouldn't be impossible if you put your mind to it.

522
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:45,142
You vowed to only date good-looking guys.

523
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:46,941
Enjoy cherry blossoms, lock eyes with love,

524
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,651
smack those lips together, and do it all.

525
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:50,852
You're taking it too far with the kissing.

526
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:04,964
(Student Council Room)

527
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,058
Creative Work of Art by Youth.

528
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:24,812
We need to get in.

529
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,682
Can we submit it by tomorrow?

530
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:29,398
- I'm almost done. - Okay.

531
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:32,392
Let's do this, Yeol. Let's get us a room.

532
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:33,892
I'm done on my end.

533
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,268
I hope they get us a room.

534
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,438
We'll have a studio free of charge.

535
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,432
I hear they have other benefits too.

536
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:41,531
We'll get in.

537
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,572
I stayed up countless nights trying to finish this.

538
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:45,642
Jae Yeol.

539
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:47,572
This is for you.

540
00:36:50,872 --> 00:36:52,612
Sure. Thanks.

541
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,652
Jae Yeol, you're the best.

542
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:02,128
This is why you're my role model.

543
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,251
The one who stole women's hearts as soon as the semester began.

544
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:05,338
Who could he be?

545
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:08,768
He's my pride and joy as well as yours.

546
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:12,562
- Moreover, the whole department... - Hey. Shut it.

547
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:15,632
If you're going to be loud, take this and get lost.

548
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,302
Could us humble beings have something this precious?

549
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:22,412
- Are you sure? - Are you sure?

550
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,252
- We'll enjoy it. - Thank you.

551
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,302
That should do it.

552
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:54,931
(Yeinies)

553
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:56,412
Unbelievable.

554
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:01,751
Have you ever gotten anything like this before?

555
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:03,352
Of course I have.

556
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:06,952
Talk about a human air purifier.

557
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,291
How refreshing.

558
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:10,698
Yeol, have one.

559
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,321
- It's yours, so have one. - I'm good.

560
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:13,691
- He's right. - Thanks to you...

561
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,261
We got it thanks to you, so have one.

562
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:16,861
- At least have one. - Have this instead, then.

563
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,431
- Go on. - I'm good.

564
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:20,702
- Open wide. - I said I was good.

565
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:22,832
Watch out!

566
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:56,132
Are you all right?

567
00:38:56,572 --> 00:38:58,132
I hope you weren't hurt.

568
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:01,302
What a relief.

569
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,472
That...

570
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:07,182
Oh, no.

571
00:39:07,582 --> 00:39:08,912
My gosh.

572
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,722
Did it crack?

573
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:14,282
Check, will you? See if it's still working.

574
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:17,552
What about our work?

575
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,670
Did it crack?

576
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,230
Check, will you? See if it's still working.

577
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,500
What about our work?

578
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:59,775
(Yeinies)

579
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:11,444
What now?

580
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:13,974
Our blood, sweat, and tears were in that.

581
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:15,614
Well,

582
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:20,114
I only reacted thinking you were in danger.

583
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,924
This was never my intention.

584
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:32,224
I should've known better and I'm sorry.

585
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:34,394
Please forgive me.

586
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,564
Whatever.

587
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,034
What will you do about my tablet?

588
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:45,744
Of course I should pay for a new one.

589
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:47,720
Do you even know how much it costs?

590
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:50,318
Well, I'll do what I can to...

591
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:51,975
(Tablet Pro 13 Gen 7 WiFi 256GB Gray, 2,000 dollars)

592
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,154
Is it 2,000 dollars?

593
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,460
Is that 2,000 dollars?

594
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:00,200
That costs 2,000 dollars?

595
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,594
That's expensive.

596
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:08,064
Would it be possible...

597
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,664
to pay you back monthly?

598
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:12,940
Does she think he's a department store?

599
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:14,633
Who pays back on an instalment basis?

600
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:15,980
We could at least give her three months.

601
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:18,744
I'll get you the money as soon as possible.

602
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,304
I'm...

603
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:22,914
I'm terribly sorry.

604
00:41:32,184 --> 00:41:33,554
- Wait. - Hold on.

605
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:37,394
Your number.

606
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:40,624
Give me your number before you go.

607
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:50,403
Hi.

608
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:52,574
- Hey. - What took you so long?

609
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:54,814
Bani.

610
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:56,813
Hey, you're here. Have a seat.

(Grilled pork belly, Udon)

612
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,754
- Are you doing better? - What?

613
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,652
What? Why?

614
00:42:04,676 --> 00:42:06,352
You were all smiles when things were good.

615
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:07,505
But now you're embarrassed...

616
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:08,852
because your true colours might be exposed in front of everyone?

617
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:11,005
You're nothing special, but I've been putting up with you.

618
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,075
Right, I forgot.

619
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:14,445
I'm the pushover girlfriend of Yein University.

620
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:16,946
Of course I'm all right.

621
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:19,416
I had been all right.

622
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:27,072
That's a relief.

623
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:29,295
I was seriously worried...

624
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,996
that you might take time off from school.

625
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:34,436
I know.

626
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:38,206
Maybe I should consider that.

627
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,815
Why should I...

628
00:42:52,816 --> 00:42:54,856
when life is this beautiful?

629
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:57,932
You came.

630
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,155
- Have a seat here. - Sure.

631
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:00,956
He's so handsome!

632
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:02,396
No way.

633
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:07,766
Attention, please.

634
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,482
We'll start with Group A.

635
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:11,835
One by one,

636
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:14,106
you'll introduce yourselves.

637
00:43:14,336 --> 00:43:16,545
Finally, a hottie joined our department.

638
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:18,292
Right? Isn't it a joy?

639
00:43:18,316 --> 00:43:19,875
- By the way, how did you... - Hello.

640
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,592
get to know the grandson of Chaon Group's chairman?

641
00:43:21,616 --> 00:43:23,445
- Freshman of 2025... - I was startled to say the least.

642
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:26,716
- I hope we get along. - You see, on my way to school...

643
00:43:29,756 --> 00:43:31,302
- I'm next. - Hold on.

644
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:33,232
- Hello. - What was that?

645
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:34,626
Chaon Group.

646
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:36,996
He's the grandson of the group's chairman.

647
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,036
Didn't you know?

648
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:41,612
Hello.

649
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:42,835

(Sculpture Department Freshmen Welcome Party)

654
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:05,832
Everyone.

655
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:07,755
The one in front of you...

656
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:11,242
will be your partner for the year.

657
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,535
Greet one another.

658
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:14,035
- Hello. - Hello.

659
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:15,536
- Hi. - Hello.

660
00:44:16,866 --> 00:44:18,835
Should I pour you a drink since you're my senior?

661
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:19,836
What?

662
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:22,246
Gosh, why would you call me that?

663
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:23,805
Allow me to pour you a glass.

664
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:26,392
Don't be absurd. I should pour you one first...

665
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,846
since you're my senior partner.

666
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:29,816
Gosh, please.

667
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:32,262
I'm messing with you.

668
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:33,986
Besides, I can't handle any alcohol.

669
00:44:34,116 --> 00:44:35,832
It was to get you to ease up.

670
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:38,026

You're the grandson of Chaon Group's chairman.

Am I even allowed...

675
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,366
to sit at the same table as you?

676
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,276
You're a funny one.

677
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,685
From here on out, just call me Bani.

678
00:45:01,686 --> 00:45:02,686
Bani.

Junior partners,

682
00:45:13,526 --> 00:45:16,696
were you able to get to know your seniors better?

683
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:17,995
- Yes! - Yes!

we'll now...

Sure, so far so good.

713
00:46:38,316 --> 00:46:40,646
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

714

I'm glad I was able to make up for my error.

That's part of the deal on my end.

Gosh, that isn't necessary.

718
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,756
I only helped you out to be rid of my own guilt.

How about sirloin then?

What do you think? He seems to be in a better mood, right?

Hey. Stop right there.

- What are you doing? - Yes.

798
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:34,176
Your eyes.

799

The way you talk.

800
00:51:38,476 --> 00:51:40,616
Gosh, I'm getting the chills.

801
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:45,116
Did you have to be so scary? Are you satisfied?

802
00:51:46,986 --> 00:51:48,832
My goodness, you're so rude.

803
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,662
What? Rude?

804
00:51:50,686 --> 00:51:55,056

You. Come on.

812
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:27,256
This isn't fair.

813
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:31,526

814

to protect...

816

What?

817
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:44,005
Darn it. Nothing is more precious...

818
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:46,075
- than this handsome face... - That hurts.

Your face could easily be worth a million dollars.

00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:05,896
You look...

822
00:53:08,366 --> 00:53:10,706
even more handsome up close.

823
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:26,316
Hey.

824
00:53:27,256 --> 00:53:29,126
That's really not cool.

825
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:32,596
Hey, don't open your mouth. Keep it shut.

826

If you open your mouth, I'm going to kill you. I swear.

Gosh, my head is pounding.

828

How much did I drink last night?

829
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:07,996
How did I get home?

830
00:54:10,026 --> 00:54:12,536
And why do my hands feel so sore?

831
00:54:12,636 --> 00:54:14,666
Did someone hit my hands?

832
00:54:17,706 --> 00:54:20,036
What? The tablet.
