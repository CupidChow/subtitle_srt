(See you later at 7pm.)

2
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,230
Has he still not read your message?

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,600
No, not yet.

4
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,670
What if my pasta plans get cancelled?

5
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,340
How about we get that pasta together?

6
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,450
No, it's okay. He's probably on his way.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,779
Thank you for giving me a ride, Ji Won.

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,090
- See you tomorrow. - Bye.

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,520
Bye.

10
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,060
What kind of situation is this?

11
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,800
You kissed me on purpose
in front of her, didn't you?

12
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,050
Bani. It's not like that.

13
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,890
I don't want to talk right now.

14
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,740
- Hey. - Welcome back.

15
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,379
Didn't you have dinner plans?

16
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,009
Oh, right. Since you were having pasta,

17
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,620
we were about to have some too.

18
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,579
Join us if you haven't had dinner.

19
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,650
Come.

20
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Hee Jin?

21
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
What?

22
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,799
Did you have to go that far?

23
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,929
(Han Yeo Reum)

24
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,100
I won't waver.

(Episode 7: Misunderstanding
and Understanding)

27
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
- Bani. - Let's talk for a minute.

28
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,050
How should I interpret
what happened yesterday?

29
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,350
What?

30
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,250
You kissed me out of
the blue without a word.

31
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,290
How am I supposed to understand that?

32
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,329
Bani. Yesterday, I...

33
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,360
Does that mean we're dating now?

34
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
I was right.

35
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,380
You used me.

36
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,650
- What do you...
- I thought you were different.

37
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,020
But you're not.

38
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,670
(City Hall Station)

39
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,120
You're here early.

40
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,650
Yes.

41
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,850
Don't you have a student
council meeting today?

42
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,660
I do. I just stopped by to drop my bag off.

43
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,730
What is it?

44
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,370
What? Well...

45
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,870
You left this in my car yesterday.

46
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,170
I thought I lost it.

47
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,980
Thank you.

48
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,280
I couldn't have pasta last night.

49
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,550
Yeol had an urgent
matter and couldn't make it.

50
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,560
You should've called or texted me.

51
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
I would’ve driven back.

52
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,500
Maybe I should have.

53
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,000
We can have pasta together later.

54
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,570
I'd better get going. See you.

55
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,810
Bye.

56
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,530
If there are no objections,

57
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,600
we'll finalize these roles. Okay?

58
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,600
We got the flyers for the festival.

59
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,970
I think it's best to hand them out today.

60
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,909
Anyone want to be the mascot?

62
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,010
Gosh, I'm so tired.

63
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,750
- What? - Do you want to do it?

64
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,320
- Do what? - Okay.

65
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,950
Hwang Jae Yeol wants to do it.

66
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,290
- Nice, Hwang Jae Yeol.
- As expected of the emperor.

67
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,099
Guys, please come to the art festival.

68
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,970
You're invited to The Artists' Night.

69
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,340
Look at our mascot.

70
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,580
The Prince of Visual
Design sure is different.

71
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,380
To think you'd be able to
pull off such a cute costume.

72
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,580
Let go while I'm being nice to you.

73
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,960
I've got no time for this right now.

74
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,190
Bani.

75
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,160
Hey, Ji Won. What brings you here?

76
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,730
You seemed busy, so I came to cheer you on.

77
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,940
Have some coffee as you work.

78
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,870
Thank you. I was actually feeling thirsty.

79
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,110
Thank you for the coffee.

80
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,650
Is there still a lot left?

81
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,650
Yes, quite a lot.

82
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,020
We just started the distribution.

83
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,690
Why don't I help you out a little?

84
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,559
- Please come to the art festival.
- I surely will.

85
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,400
Isn't he so handsome?

86
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm a junior.

87
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,770
- Please come to the art festival.
- Okay, I will.

88
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,440
- See you again. - See you.

89
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
- Please come to the art festival. - Okay.

90
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,280
Ji Won. I'll go get some more flyers.

91
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,450
Sure.

92
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,960
Hwang Jae Yeol.

93
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,630
Let's talk after we're done.

94
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,900
Remember what you said?

95
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,040
That you were sincere.

96
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,510
What?

97
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,240
Your feelings for Bani.

98
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
You made a fool out of
her when she trusted you.

99
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,890
Is that your way of showing your sincerity?

100
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,530
Don't mislead her.

101
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,629
Bani. Yesterday, I...

102
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,390
Does that mean we're dating now?

103
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,030
I was right.

104
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,340
You used me.

105
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,520
Bani.

106
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,890
Should we wrap up for the day?

107
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,660
- Okay. - Let's get some coffee.

108
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,100
Ta-da. Enjoy.

109
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,430
Thanks.

110
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,000
You're practically a part-time worker here.

111
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,510
Of course. I've filled in
numerous times already.

112
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,210
Bo Bae's last show is tomorrow, right?

113
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,440
Yes.

114
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,450
The after-party of Bo Bae's show.

115
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,910
Why not hold it at my place?

116
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,520
- Can we do that? - What about your sister?

117
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,249
It's okay. Hye Won went
to our parents' place today.

118
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,619
She'll stay there for a few days.

119
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,289
If so, we have no reason to refuse.

120
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,360
You'll go, right?

121
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,590
Well, if that's the case,

122
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,960
- I'm in. - Nice.

123
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,370
I'll make the preparations.
You simply have to come over.

124
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,570
Is this the class of a wealthy man?

125
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,170
Should we wear a dress or something?

126
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,010
- Make it a silk dress. - Okay.

127
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,220
("Romeo and Juliet")

128
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Romeo.

129
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,590
Why?

130
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,160
Why didn't you leave any poison for me?

131
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,970
Here's a knife.

132
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,750
We will...

133
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,280
meet again.

134
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,409
I really like how you interpreted Juliet...

135
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,980
as a more proactive woman
compared to the original.

136
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,820
Especially, Juliet's expression...

137
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,150
when she drew her knife in Act Five was...

138
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,390
Okay. Good.

139
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,490
You did a great job.

140
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,729
It's indeed great to have a boyfriend.

141
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,000
You ease my mind.

142
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,470
You did so well.

143
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,700
Let's go.

144
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,349
Come to the art festival.

145
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,319
(The Artists' Night)

146
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,850
Come to the art festival.

147
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,360
Oh, hello.

148
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,560
You're promoting the festival.

149
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,600
Why are you doing it by yourself?

150
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,839
Well...

151
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,410
Do you need help?

152
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,380
It won't take long if we do it together.

153
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,310
Bo Bae's play will end soon.

154
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,810
Shouldn't we go?

155
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,580
I heard they would take pictures
later, so if it's for a moment...

156
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,319
Or how about you and I go first?

157
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,559
Hey, what are you talking about?

158
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,229
Why? You're a member
of the student council.

159
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,230
It'd be better for you to help him than us.

160
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,299
It's fine.

161
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,229
Come on. You can't do this by yourself.

162
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,000
That's a lot of leaflets.

163
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,000
You can have a nice
time, just the two of you.

164
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,940
- No. - What?

165
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,150
I'm sorry.

166
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,899
What? What's the matter?

167
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,910
Yeol.

168
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,170
What do I do?

169
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,050
Hey.

170
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,350
- Cheers. - Cheers.

171
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,930
Thank you.

172
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
I get to have such a luxurious
after-party thanks to you.

173
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,730
Thank you for coming.

174
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,200
Actually, I've never invited
someone to my place.

175
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,239
Please invite us anytime.

176
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,310
I'll come right away.

177
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,010
Come on.

178
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,279
Let's eat. Let me know if you need more.

179
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,379
No way.

180
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,710
Even just taking a bite of each of
these dishes would make me full.

181
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,080
Thank you.

182
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,349
Thank you.

183
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,380
Thank you.

184
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,920
- It's so good. - Is it good?

185
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,730
Try this too.

186
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,540
Hey. The after-party is an excuse...

187
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,870
to feed Bani, isn't it?

188
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,740
Of course, it is. Why do you ask?

189
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,010
He's her boyfriend.

190
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,380
A boyfriend, not even a crush.

191
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,880
Hey. I didn't know...

192
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,650
and even bought flowers.

193
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,490
Hey.

194
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,860
Have you been rejected even
before confessing your feelings?

195
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,700
I have.

196
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,670
I can't even confess to her,

197
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,810
but I'd at least like to talk to her.

198
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,250
- What? - Do you know...

199
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,820
what kind of face people make...

200
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,680
when they hate someone?

201
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,490
I do.

202
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,560
Because I've been feeling it...

203
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,130
for the past few days.

204
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,830
I can't even talk to her...

205
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,230
or look at her because of that.

206
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,170
So how can I apologize?

207
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,940
No. Am I in the position to apologize?

208
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,780
There's nothing I can say.

209
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,250
I can't say anything because I did wrong.

210
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,180
It's all my fault.

211
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,060
I'd hate someone like me too.

212
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,630
I'm selfish and do as I want.

213
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,629
And I always ruin everything.

214
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,630
Hey, you're not that bad.

215
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,299
My gosh.

216
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,510
What's wrong with you, Hwang Jae Yeol?

217
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,910
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

218
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,090
I'm so full.

219
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,550
Me too.

220
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Oh, right.

221
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,090
Did something happen between you and Yeol?

222
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,060
What? Why?

223
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,900
When they met earlier,

224
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,430
something felt off.

225
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,570
Oh, it's just...

226
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,170
It's all over now.

227
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,040
It seemed he still had
feelings for Yeo Reum.

228
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,520
He's a lost cause.

229
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,590
Hwang Jae Yeol.

230
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,990
Bani, I thought you deserved
much better from the beginning.

231
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,130
I agree.

232
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,399
We don't want you to date someone...

233
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,630
who still has feelings for his ex.

234
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,329
There are other men in the world.

235
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,540
Forget about him. It's over now.

236
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,710
Gosh, I'm mad.

237
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,620
What?

238
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,189
Did I finish it already?

239
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,820
Hey. You're drunk. Stop drinking.

240
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,290
I'm not drunk.

241
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,330
- Go to bed. - Don't!

242
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,040
Hey.

243
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,710
You know...

244
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,610
Do you know what torments me the most?

245
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,220
The fact...

246
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,720
The fact that I hurt her.

247
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,720
The fact that Bani was hurt...

248
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,360
because of me.

249
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,940
That's...

250
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,510
what hurts me...

251
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,740
and torments me the most.

252
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,620
I'm sorry, Bani.

253
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,390
Bani.

254
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,489
(Han Yeo Reum)

255
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,160
- What are you doing? Are you home?
- I'm so sorry.

256
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,099
(Yeol)

257
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
(How are you doing?)

258
00:23:58,101 --> 00:23:59,770
(Did you really have to
do that? I won't waver.)

259
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,430
(Mom)

260
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,140
(Mom)

261
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,850
(Mom)

262
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,730
I knew it.

263
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,499
They acted like they
would have a party all night.

264
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,060
But they fell asleep like that.

265
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,800
Aren't you tired?

266
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,070
No. I look totally fine, right?

267
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,940
My body is so used to this because
I worked all night for a long time.

268
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,250
Hold on.

269
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,750
Thank you.

270
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,250
Here.

271
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,960
It's good now.

272
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Ji Won.

273
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,299
You can't be this kind...

274
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,760
with that handsome face.

275
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,470
What?

276
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,370
I mean, I'm not going to think that way,

277
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,040
but other women might misunderstand.

278
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,980
Why won't you think that way?

279
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,580
Sorry?

280
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,520
And...

281
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,820
I don't do this to any woman.

282
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,500
The night view is amazing.

283
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,270
- The night view? - Yes.

284
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,339
Is it because nothing is blocking the view?

285
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,610
I can see the stars so clearly.

286
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,550
It's beautiful.

287
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,550
I know.

288
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,660
It's beautiful.

289
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,220
Gosh, my head hurts.

290
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,710
I'm always on your side. Cheer up.

From Cute Dong Ha.

292
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,490
I was right.

293
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,730
You used me.

294
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,960
- What do you...
- I thought you were different.

295
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,970
But you're not.

296
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,560
Aren't we preparing too much?

297
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,460
Come on. This is the highlight
of the festival. It isn't too much.

298
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,400
When I think about it,
people are really amazing.

299
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,429
I'd hate it if someone confessed
their feelings to me publicly.

300
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,500
Why? Isn't it quite touching?

301
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,610
It means they like you so much
that they want to let everyone know.

302
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,069
That's what I'm saying. Why
would they let everyone know?

303
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,780
They can just say that to me privately.

304
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,710
Here.

305
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:37,050
(I thought of you when I
was walking yesterday.)

306
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,390

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,920
- Yes. - When are you coming?

312
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,020
- I'm coming soon. - Don't be late.

313
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,720
Okay. See you later.

314
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,960
See you.

315
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,830
Hey!

316
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,269
Gosh!

317
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,270
Why are you doing this? Let go of me!

318
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,439
It's you, right?

319
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,370
You're the crazy woman who's
been cheating with my husband.

320
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,069
You old fox,

321
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,970
couldn't you find anyone else?
How dare you seduce my husband?

322
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,440
You should know your place!

323
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,110
Let go of me before you talk!

324
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,319
Don't get physical. Talk it out.

325
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,950
Are you crazy?

326
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,020
I didn't seduce him!

327
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,359
It's your husband who went after me.

328
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,660
Why are you accusing me?

329
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Right.

330
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,360
You should be shameless like that.

331
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,830
You'd have to be that
shameless to commit adultery.

332

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,749
and still claims that
she did nothing wrong!

338
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,750
Gosh.

339
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,050
That's not true! What's wrong with you?

340
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,450
- What's going on? - My gosh.

341
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,620
Who are you?

342
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,530
I'm sorry.

343
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,740
What are you doing?

344
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,010
Why do you apologize?

345
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,380
Stop and just follow me.

346
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,080
Do you think this is enough?

347
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,290
- Is that it? - I mean...

348
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,190
You should listen!

349
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,630
Let go of me.

350
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,730
What's wrong with you?

351
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,030
Are you crazy?

352
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,200
What are you doing?

353
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,870
And what are you doing?

354
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,069
Why did you apologize to her?

355
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,340
Get it together!

356
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,170
Don't you know what's wrong?

357
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,080
What did I do wrong?

358
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,110
I'm the biggest victim here.

359
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,179
I was fooled by a married man...

360
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,750
and got my hair pulled by a woman
who is much younger than me!

361
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,420
So why did you apologize to her?

362
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,530
As if I really had an affair!

363
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,500
Mom.

364
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,310
Aren't you ashamed?

365
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,680
Don't you feel guilty?

366
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,010
You're embarrassing me...

367
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,050
and driving me crazy.

368
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,520
I'm embarrassing you?

369
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,890
What do you even take me for?

370
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,800
I haven't done anything
to deserve this from you.

371
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,670
They're the ones who
made me look like a fool.

372
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,370
Why should I be blamed for trusting him?

373
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,210
Isn't he the one to blame for
taking advantage of my feelings?

374
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,250
(Orthopaedics)

375
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Thank you.

376
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,349
I hope I didn't interrupt
anything important.

377
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,819
You didn't. Besides, that
shouldn't be an excuse.

378
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
It's for you of all people.

379
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,630
I've had dinner and
will be getting to work.

380
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,940
Who are you this excited to text back?

381
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,680
No one. I was just wondering
if her project was going well.

382
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,480
As if. It's more like
you just want to see her.

383
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,650
Why don't we get...

384
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,050
something good to eat
once you're done here?

385
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,089
Look at you changing the subject.

386
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,660
You're not even denying it anymore.

387
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,020
What is it, Ji Won?

388
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,460
Did you fall for someone
for the very first time?

389
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,360
Don't be ridiculous.

390
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,640
My first love is you.
Did you already forget?

391
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,190
Why should I be blamed for trusting him?

392
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,920
Isn't he the one to blame for
taking advantage of my feelings?

393
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,540
(Bani)

394
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,010
That's not true! What's wrong with you?

395
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm sorry.

396
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Come on.

397
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,610
Are you kidding me?

398
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,000
Thanks.

399
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,230
Right.

400
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Here.

401
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,090
Thanks.

402
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,500
Would you like to go to
the 63 Building with me?

403
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,870
Right now?

404
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,320
Why do you call this...

405
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,750
the 63 Building?

406
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,890
Because you must walk up...

407
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,520
exactly 63 steps to get here.

408
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,890
I see.

409
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,000
I come here to dry my coveralls or fabric.

410
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,700
Coming up here puts me in a good mood.

411
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,770
It washes some of my troubles away.

412
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,210
You're right.

413
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,220
You were probably...

414
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,750
a bit shaken earlier.

415
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,460
I'm sure what happened shook you up more.

416
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,830
This isn't the first time my
mom's been in this mess.

417
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,270
Still, I never seem to get used to it.

418
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,440
I try to believe she has changed her ways,

419
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,080
only to be disappointed again.

420
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
But I guess...

421
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,660
I don't have the right to judge her.

422
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,590
Endless disappointments.

423
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,370
Now I know that's how you felt.

424
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,350
I'm sorry...

425
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,590
for disappointing you.

426
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,260
I got carried away...

427
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,900
and acted selfishly.

428
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
But...

429
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,900
it's really not what you think.

430
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,840
I wasn't trying...

431
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,080
to take advantage of you.

432
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,320
I know what I did was wrong.

433
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,720
But at the time,

434
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,190
I was trying to hold onto
you in any way I could.

435
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,800
You had every right...

436
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,640
to feel the way you did.

437
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,210
I'm really sorry.

438
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,000
Goodness. I didn't know someone was there.

439
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,109
I'm afraid this place must be locked up...

440
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,840
at night.

441
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,140
Head back down already.

442
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,180
Right. We're so sorry.
We'll head down right away.

443
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,280
- Good. Hurry on down. - Yes, sir.

444
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,890
We should get going.

445
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,630
Sure.

446
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,309
(Rewriting a legend on the court)

447
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,920
(Coach Kim Hyun Kyung's
philosophy of the game)

448
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,920
- This is incredible. - Really?

449
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,590
- Who came up with this idea?
- Me, of course.

450
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,889
- I'm home. - I expected no less.

451
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,590
- Hey. - You're home?

452
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Yes.

453
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,359
I see Mom did an interview.

454
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
- Yes. - Yes.

455
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,860
Here. Check out this photo.

456
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,729
Stunning, right?

457
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,800
(What do you value the most as a coach?)

458
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,969
If only the interview had been longer.

459
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,970
Darn it.

460
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,510
What?

461
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,140
Why did they have to
stick his photo in there?

462
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,180
Why? Who is it?

463
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,419
Your mom's ex-boyfriend.

464
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,520
I see.

465
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,289
- What? - They were the talk of the town.

466
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,560
The sports star couple of the century.

467
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,660
That's ancient history.

468
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,330
Your mom was a star in her field,

469
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,059
but this punk had it going for him as well.

470
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,630
He was like a celebrity.

471
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,530
Everyone around me said...

472
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,140
I stood no chance against him.

473
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,170
However,

474
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,140
I never gave up.

475
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Why?

476
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:21,910
Because love is reserved
only for the brave.

477
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,550
"Did you think that would make me yours?"

478
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,180
"You're mine."

479
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,720
Gross!

480
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,220
See? I ended up winning the lady.

481
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,190
This is why you must always be brave.

482
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,860
Like your dad. Come here.

483
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,299
No, tighter.

484
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,339
Watch that side.

485
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,770
- Hold on. - Check here.

486
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,140
- One, two, three. - Gently.

487
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,880
- Careful. - Sure.

488
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
- There. - Yes.

489
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,050
By the way, when will Yeol get here?

490
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,960
You know what Yeol had
to go through yesterday.

491
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,190
I doubt he'll be up for any of this.

492
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,190
Even I'd be feeling down.

493
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,430
Don't you agree?

494
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,100
Whatever.

495
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,040
Jae Yeol came down with something today.

496
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,070
What do you mean? Is it bad?

497
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,940
It's just a cold and the shivers,

498
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:31,080
but he hasn't been able to eat or sleep.

499
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,580
Apparently, he's been
dealing with it all on his own.

500
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,790
That being said,

501
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,190
are you busy today?

502
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
Thanks, again. You
only have to get him this.

503
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,700
I think it's around here somewhere.

504
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,470
Right. That must be it.

505
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,280
What brings you here?

506
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Well,

507
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,120
I'm here to see Yeol.

508
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,790
Yeol's asleep.

509
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,790
Should I wake him up?

510
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,130
No.

511
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,870
All right, then.

512
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,129
Can you make sure he gets this?

513
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,340
(Heartwarming Porridge)

514
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,510
Also,

515
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,110
please tell him that Bani was here.

516
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,320
What? How did you get in?

517
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,560
Your passcode is still the same.

518
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,300
Don't get any ideas.

519
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,359
I called your phone,

520
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,170
but you weren't picking up even
though I could hear it ringing.

521
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,640
I only came out of concern.

522
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,410
(Heartwarming Porridge)

523
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,750
A friend dropped it off.

524
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,860
- You should go.
- Shouldn't you see a doctor?

525
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,700
You have a terrible fever.

526
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,600
Didn't I tell you...

527
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,340
that I no longer have the patience for you?

528
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,640
So please,

529
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,340
just leave.

530
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,880
It hurts to even see you.

531
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,920
How long is this going to continue?

532
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,790
It wasn't just you. It
was just as hard for me.

533
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,830
I had my reasons back then.

534
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,700
So?

535
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
What?

536
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,540
Don't say it like you had no choice.

537
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,570
In the end,

538
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,710
the choice you made was yours.

539
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,660
I got you some medicine.

540
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,430
Eat your meal...

541
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,830
and make sure to take it.

542
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,700
All right?

543
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,130
(Hwang Jae Yeol)

544
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,880
Bani.

545
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,120
Hey.

546
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,050
Fruit delivery.

547
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,520
Enjoy some sweet and tasty fruit.

548
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,560
Enjoy.

549
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,760
- Dad. - Yes?

550
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,160
Did it really not bother you?

551
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,400
Mom's ex-boyfriend.

552
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,570
You said he had everything going for him.

553
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,770
Of course,

554
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,440
it bothered me.

555
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,240
How could it not?

556
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,020
Even I could see she
was better off with him.

557
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,090
How did you keep pursuing her...

558
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,260
despite thinking that?

559
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,330
How should I put it?

560
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,760
I knew...

561
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,630
that I couldn't be with
anyone but your mom.

562
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,930
I was already so in love with
her. What choice did I have?

563
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,670
Since my love began budding,

564
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,870
I had to see it through.

565
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,790
You were pretty cool, Dad.

566
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,820
- Thank you for the fruit. - Sure.

567
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,999
I'm leaving now. Call
me if there's a problem.

568
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,170
Wait, Ji Won.

569
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,930
Will you be coming home late tonight?

570
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,339
- Why do you ask? - There was an exhibit...

571
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,469
I wanted to go to.

572
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,609
And it ends today.

573
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,110
If you're not busy, can you come with me?

574
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,940
I see.

575
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,880
I feel awful.

576
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,410
But I don't think I can today.

577
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,820
Is this the first time
you're saying no to me?

578
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,220
I'm sorry.

579
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,590
I'm going to the school
festival with Bani today.

580
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,629
But I'll take you to another
exhibit next time. I promise.

581
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,660
I'm sorry.

582
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,130
The school festival?

583
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,240
Yeol. You got the stuff from Bani, right?

584
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,410
What did you just say?

585
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,949
Did you get the tablet PC yesterday?

586
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,050
No, not that part.

587
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,180
You asked whom?

588
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,250
Bani.

589
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,920
What? Did you not see each other?

590
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,790
A friend dropped it off.

591
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,359
Hey, Yeol.

592
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,460
Hey, where are you going?

593
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,030
The rehearsal will begin any minute now.

594
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,500
Come on. You need to man the camera.

595
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,270
(Yein Hall)

596
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,049
It's just a departmental
festival, but this is a great turnout.

597
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,079
You bet.

598
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,180
Art school festivals are
the most popular ones.

599
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,150
What's that?

600
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,690
You don't know what this is?
We've done this every year.

601
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,189
It's called the Confession Tree.

602
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,199
You can write out your
confession and hang it on the tree.

603
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,960
The MC will read it one at a time.

604
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,370
Simply put, it's like
making a public confession.

605
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,070
What do you say? Would
you like to write one?

606
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,540
I worked really hard on making that.

607
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,609
Wait. I think the girls are here.

608
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,310
- We should slowly head over. - Sure.

609
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,809
(I want to be with you on Christmas.)

610
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,849
(The Artists' Night)

611
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,850
Bani. Over here!

612
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,230
Hello.

613
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,820
- She's over there. - Gosh.

614
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,320
- She looks gorgeous. - Oh, my. Hey.

615
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,690
- Look over there. - It's Han Yeo Reum.

616
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,330
- She's so pretty in person. - No way.

617
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,930
This is awesome.

618
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,470
Hello, everyone.

619
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,340
I'm your host for The Artists' Night.

620
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,880
I'm Announcer Han Yeo
Reum. Nice to meet you all.

621
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,220
Returning to my alma
mater is certainly stirring up...

622
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,860
a wave of sentimentality.

623
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,299
I'm especially honoured to be
the MC of my alma mater's festival.

624
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,700
I'm slightly nervous.

625
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,829
Even if I make a mistake,

626
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,669
you'll be kind enough
to let it slide, right?

627
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,470
- Yes! - Yes!

628
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,110
Then...

629
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,710
let us begin The Artists' Night now.

630
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,080
Yeol.

631
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,020
A moment, please?

632
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,370
What?

633
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,640
My microphone isn't working.

634
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,500
Could you fix it one more time?

635
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,210
Are you all right?

636
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,679
Gosh. Of course, I am.

637
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,380
Why wouldn't I be okay?

638
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,750
Thank you.

639
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,239
Give it up, go all out

640
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,750
It's time to scream out

641
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,719
Not to feel lonely

642
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,590
I do my own dance

643
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,100
- Two, three. - Two, three.

644
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:22,650
All right. There can't be a
festival without this program.

645
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,480
It's time for the Confession Tree.

646
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,549
The event with the Confession Tree
matched countless men and women...

647
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,649
- even when I was attending here. - Right.

648
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,320
- It's a popular event. - Gosh.

649
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,160
As expected, many students
participated in this event today.

650
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,430
I wonder if we'll get to see
new couples forming tonight.

651
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,869
Let me draw one now.

652
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,069
(The Artists' Night)

653
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,340
(Thanks for the other day.)

654
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,380
(The Artists' Night)

655
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,020
"Seung Min."

656
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,889
"How about..."

657
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,690
"some late-night snack
with me after the festival?"

658
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,260
Me?

659
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,260
- Go, Seung Min. - My gosh.

660
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,560
What an ingenious idea to
flirt with late-night snacks!

661
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,630
Seung Min, the guy who's about
to get some late-night snacks.

662
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,670
Please come on up.

663
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,769
- Let's go! - Yes!

664
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,769
- Let's go! - Hey, cutie!

665
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,040
Let's go, Seung Min!

666
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,810
Hello.

667
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:28,810
Hello.

668
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,980
I'm Hyun Seung Min, a
sophomore and a sculpture major.

669
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,950
- You look handsome! - Nice to meet you.

670
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,890
Seung Min.

671
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:43,030
Do you have any idea who
wrote this confession card to you?

672
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,330
Yes.

673
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,400
- Really? - Oh, my!

674
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,640
Let's find out if she's indeed
the one he's thinking of.

675
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,140
I'm looking for the lovely girl
who hung the confession card.

676
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,540
Where are you?

677
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,779
- Who is it? - Where is she?

678
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,940
It's me.

679
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,150
Please come up to the stage.

680
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,580
- Go for it. - You're so cool!

681
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,220
- Yes! - Nice!

682
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
All right.

683
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:17,789
How about holding each
other's gaze for ten seconds?

684
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,759
(The Artists' Night)

685
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,830
- All right. - Oh, my.

686
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,430
Let's all count to ten together.

687
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,370
Start.

688
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,670
- Ten, nine, - Ten, nine,

689
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,810
- eight, seven, six, - eight, seven, six,

690
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,780
- five, four, - five, four,

691
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,780
- three, two, one. - three, two, one.

692
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,620
Let's go!

693
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,390
- Congratulations! - How lovely!

694
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,340
(Bani, I want to be with you on Christmas.)

695
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,810
- Why did she stop? - What's going on?

696
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,620
What is it?

697
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,950
- What is it? - I have no idea.

698
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,430
- What? - What's wrong?

699
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:25,930
What is this?

700
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,430
"Bani."

701
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,730
What?

702
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,070
"I want to be with you..."

703
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,140
- Oh, my. - Christmas?

704
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,700
"on Christmas."

705
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,240
- Oh, my. - Bani.

706
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,840
He's thinking about Christmas already?

707
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,950
Just the mention of that
is making my heart flutter.

708
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,780
All right then. Bani.

709
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,450
Could you come up to the stage?

710
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,030
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

711
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,799
Don't just stand here. Go on.

712
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,930
- Go on. - Go on.

713
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,970
- Go on. - Go on.

714
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,110
- Go on. - Go on.

715
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:18,349
(The Artists' Night)

716
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,450
Oh, my!

717
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,650
Hello.

718
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,590
I'm Ban Hee Jin, a sophomore
and a sculpture major.

719
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,189
- Good luck! - Yes!

720
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,730
- Good for you! - Nice!

721
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,430
Someone has written a
confession card to you.

722
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,130
Did you expect to get a card?

723
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,700
- No. - I see.

724
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,010
Then you must be
flustered and quite surprised.

725
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,810
Perhaps, the writer could be
feeling more nervous than you now.

726
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,350
But we ought to meet him
onstage. Don't you agree?

727
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,980
- Yes! - Yes!

728
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,420
I can't wait...

729
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,820
to find out who it is.

730
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,930
I'm looking for the man who
wrote this confession card.

731
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,000
Please come up to the stage.

732
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:16,470
(The Artists' Night)

733
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:19,440
- Come on. - Where is he?

734
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,579
- What? No one is going up.
- I don't see anyone.

735
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,349
- What's going on? - Seriously?

736
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,580
- How come no one is going up?
- I don't see anyone going up.

737
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,949
- What is this? - Come on.

738
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,849
- Was this a prank? - Oh, no.

739
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,089
- This is so embarrassing.
- Maybe, no one wrote this.

740
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,520
- Who is it? Why isn't he coming up?
- No one is going up

741
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,690
- Oh, no. - What's going on?

742
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,700
- What's this? - Come on.

743
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,159
- What is this? - What?

744
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,130
Maybe, this was a prank.

745
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,740
- Look behind you. - There he comes.

746
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,240
- No way. - It was him!

747
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,720
(The Artists' Night)

748
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Rolling.

749
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,829
- Okay. Action. - Okay.

750
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,799
(Crushology 101)

751
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,199
You're crossing the line a lot...

752
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,900
for a guy she's just friends with.

753
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,299
I saw you struggling to make up your mind.

754
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,240
I just can't let Bani
date someone like you.

755
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,770
Hee Jin.

756
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,980
The two of us didn't break up for good.

757
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,750
This is between us, so we'll
talk about it by ourselves.

758
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,480
Don't date anyone who makes you wonder...

759
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,480
about his intention.

760
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,719
This is way too painful.

761
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,760
That's why I'll go to her.

762
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,520
Seriously. You...

763
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,060
drive me crazy.
