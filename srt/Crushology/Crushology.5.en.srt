1
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:20,683
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

2
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:24,553
You...

3
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,563
Stop being an eyesore already.

4
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,663
What is it this time?

5
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,203
I...

6
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,673
I'm broken.

7
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,023
I...

8
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,223
must have a crush on you.

9
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,813
Will you marry me?

10
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:00,903
Ms. Ban Hee Jin?

11
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,013
Ms. Ban Hee Jin.

12
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:06,013
You're under arrest for megalomania.

13
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,183
Come with us to the police station at once.

14
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:09,883
Hold on.

15
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:11,813
What do you mean by megalomania?

16
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,423
Honey.

17
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,423
Do something.

18
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:18,223
- Arrest her. - Don't move, Ms. Ban.

19
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,333
Did you really think...

20
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,403
we could get married?

21
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:02,733
(Alarm)

22
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:05,773
Seriously.

23
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:12,783
It was just a one-time booze talking.

24
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,553
Stop imagining too far.

25
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:23,223
But...

26
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,523
it really was just a booze talk, right?

27
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:43,112
(Episode 5: Heart Fluttering Alert)

28
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:47,113
(Episode 5: Heart Fluttering Alert)

29
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:00,063
How did I get home?

30
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,093
Did I drink too much last night?

31
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,173
I...

32
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:21,583
must have a crush on you.

33
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:28,583
You're crazy.

34
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,023
You really are.

35
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:36,163
You've lost your mind.

36
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,433
It can't be true.

37
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,223
You're here early.

38
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:12,763
Well, yes.

39
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:14,863
Because of this.

40
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,443
You went home just fine last night, right?

41
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,613
I see.

42
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:31,583
I guess you don't remember.

43
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,883
What?

44
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:38,053
Did I do something again?

45
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,023
You've done...

46
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:44,533
plenty of things.

47
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,603
You even cried.

48
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,033
"Cried?"

49
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,373
I beg you.

50
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,543
Can't you walk properly?

51
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:56,073
Sorry.

52
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,243
I want to,

53
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,283
but my legs...

54
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,383
They won't listen to me.

55
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:05,113
You even picked a fight.

56
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,083
You little...

57
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,693
What are you looking at?

58
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:13,993
Look away right now. Do it.

59
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:15,863
Darn you.

60
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,903
You put on a great slapstick comedy.

61
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,903
Come on. Let's go in a bit.

62
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,003
- Okay. Let's go. - What?

63
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:30,513
Hey, Choon Shik. Where's your energy?

64
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,083
How soft.

65
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,253
Darn it.

66
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:39,353
No wonder.

67
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:41,353
And...

68
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:44,853
There's more?

69
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,793
You even confessed your feelings to me.

70
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:01,703
That wasn't a mistake.

71
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:07,843
What?

72
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:09,813
It wasn't...

73
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,313
a mistake.

74
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,973
(Yein University)

75
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:37,873
Goodness.

76
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:39,983
My heart was about to explode.

77
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:43,553
Did I just...

78
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,623
confess to her again while I'm sober?

79
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:51,893
My gosh.

80
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,562
Now then.

81
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:57,092
Thanks for coming to the meeting...

82
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:59,063
despite being swamped with exams.

83
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,102
- I doubt... - It'll be a first...

84
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:03,233
- in the upcoming festival.
- It was a confession.

85
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,833
What did that mean?

86
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:10,873
Don't tell me...

87
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:12,673
it's a new way of bullying.

88
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:17,353
Right. Now I remember.

89
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,683
Those black pupils.

90
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,583
That nasty corner of the lips.

91
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:23,923
Stay strong today as always.

92
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:26,163
I'm sure.

93
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,923
He's clearly bullying me.

94
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,902
Only those who apply can
work overnight at school,

95
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:33,933
so please check.

96
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,233
Good luck with your exams.
I'll see you after the exam week.

97
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:39,573
- Great work. - Good luck.

98
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,903
Good luck.

99
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,573
I have something important going on,

100
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,073
- so I'm leaving first. - Okay.

101
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,013
Why?

102
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:52,483
What's this?

103
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:54,052
- Remember? - Right.

104
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,353
Did she already leave?

105
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:56,993
Is it impossible?

106
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:00,993
(I'm a snow crab. I like you snow much.)

107
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,893
Hey.

108
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,133
Should I be more mannerly?

109
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,433
Welcome.

110
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,433
Hey, welcome.

111
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,703
I need to look cool.

112
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,043
Oh...

113
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,713
Over here.

114
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:28,653
Here. Sit.

115
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,963
You sure dig in, but beautifully at that.

116
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,693
I couldn't eat lunch.

117
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,863
I see.

118
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,893
By the way,

119
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,963
what's your ideal type?

120
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:42,103
Sorry?

121
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,313
A guy who's good at grilling meat.

122
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:51,843
- Meat? - Yes.

123
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,212
It proves how much of a good sense he has.

124
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,483
- Is that so? - And...

125
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,313
the forearm muscles peeking
out while grilling meat...

126
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,222
makes the heart pound.

127
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,253
I see.

128
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,793
Then, how about I...

129
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:07,063
pick the crab meat out for you?

130
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,092
- No, I'm good. - It's okay.

131
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:10,993
What's more, eating snow crabs...

132
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,403
with your hands is the way to go.

133
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,463
How big.

134
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,543
But I'm really okay.

135
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,323
My forearm muscles.

136
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:35,853
I can do it.

137
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,032
Mommy.

138
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:53,773
That girl has a crab claw on her hair.

139
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:05,953
(Local Bar)

140
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,093
I'll be leaving first.

141
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,163
Thank you once again for that day.

142
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,703
Wait.

143
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,073
- Yes? - Where...

144
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:32,713
are you studying for the upcoming midterms?

145
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,313
- What? - I want to make up...

146
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:37,113
for today's bad manners.

147
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:45,353
The midterm will be replaced
with your project interim evaluation.

148
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:49,263
Even if it's an interim evaluation,
it'll be part of your final grade.

149
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,833
Don't think of slacking off.

150
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,433
- Okay. - Okay.

151
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,763
You know projects are important
starting sophomore year, right?

152
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,133
Only one team's work can
be displayed in the main hall.

153
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:03,043
And only one piece will be
selected as the best work.

154
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,483
Don't think of helping each other.

155
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,813
Think of surviving alone.

156
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:09,543
- Okay. - Okay.

157
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:11,053
Good luck.

158
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,453
Study hard for your exams, okay?

159
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:15,153
I'm always rooting for you.

160
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:16,622
- Thank you. - Thank you.

161
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,653
Of course.

162
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,293
I'm going to study at the library.

163
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:23,932
Who wants to come?

164
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,163
Me. I planned to study
before going home anyway.

165
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,363
All right.

166
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,972
By the way, Bani. Are
you done with the sketch?

167
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:32,673
I did. Won helped me
out by being the model.

168
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,903
Is that so?

169
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:36,203
I'm not done yet.

170
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:42,513
Can't you give me a hand, please?

171
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:43,983
Me?

172
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:47,353
Take your time. I'll
be at the library first.

173
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:48,823
Okay.

174
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:54,023

175
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,213
Nice.

176
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,853
Him again? Of all people!

177
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,823
Hello.

178
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,523
What are you doing?

179
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:01,393
Take a seat.

180
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:05,533
Earlier, I thought you
reserved the seat for someone.

181
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,833
Yes.

182
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,133
For you.

183
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,473
Me?

184
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,513
Can't you just be honest with me?

185
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,913
What did I do wrong this time?

186
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,083
You did nothing wrong.

187
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:05,222
Why on earth are you being like this then?

188
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,792
You reserved the seat for me.

189
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,893
And you keep looking at me.

190
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,333
Excuse me.

191
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,963
Can you keep it down, please?

192
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,533
Sorry.

193
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,453
Do you not really get it?

194
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,853
Then think about...

195
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:46,803
why I'm acting like this.

196
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,213
- What? - What's going on?

197
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,883
What is it?

198
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,612
Due to an emergency
safety inspection today,

199
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:06,653
the power supply has been interrupted.

200
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:09,582
Please proceed safely to the first floor...

201
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,592
- using the emergency exits.
- I have an exam.

202
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,223
- My goodness. - I repeat.

203
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,292
Due to an emergency
safety inspection today,

204
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,433
the power supply has been interrupted.

205
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,362
Please proceed safely to the first floor...

206
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:23,803
using the emergency exits.

207
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,233
- Gosh, this is crazy. - It's so dark.

208
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,172
- This is unfair. - This is unbelievable.

209
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,343
Hold onto me.

210
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,943
Why did this happen?

211
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:40,023
Thank you.

212
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,083
Hold me.

213
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:44,093
Or you might trip.

214
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:14,123
(Main Library)

215
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:24,033
Are you going to study more?

216
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,063
Why?

217
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:28,463
Well...

218
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,573
I know a nice place to study.

219
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,773
Do you want to go with me?

220
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:35,873
No.

221
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:38,973
I...

222
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,942
I'll just study at home today.

223
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:43,653
Bye then.

224
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:44,883
Hey.

225
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,503
(Kot Nim)

226
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:07,273
- Hello? - Bani, where are you?

227
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,143
I'm at school. Why?

228
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:11,013
Bo Bae found an amazing place.

229
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,413
Let's all study there.

230
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,043
Sure. Where is it?

231
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,853
Thank you so much for today.

232
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:23,723
No worries. We're on the same
team. Of course, I should help.

233
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,893
Ji Won, we found a place to study.

234
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:29,163
Bani is coming too.

235
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:34,333
Oh, right. Do you want
to have dinner with me?

236
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:37,373
Since you helped me, I
want to treat you to dinner.

237
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:39,503
Well... I'm sorry.

238
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,703
Let's have dinner next time.

239
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,813
I'll get going first. You did well today.

240
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,043
Thank you.

241
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:54,283
So this is the place to study?

242
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:58,523
I thought you went home.

243
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:02,463
I know.

244
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,663
Why am I here?

245
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:08,063
Dong Ha said we could study here.

246
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:11,303
But I definitely heard that
there would be three people.

247
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:16,473
I was invited too.

248
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:18,943
I invited him.

249
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,243
He's our friend.

250
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,443
Can I go in?

251
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,183
It's neat.

252
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,153
Where is Dong Ha, by the way?

253
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,023
Dong Ha...

254
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:35,993
is here.

255
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,833
Since everyone is here, shall
we begin the pork belly party?

256
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,363
- Pork belly? - Yes.

257
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,203
We should take enough protein
before studying for the exam.

258
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:45,403
Shall we go?

259
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,143
We can't eat meat here.

260
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,823
(Table Repair in Progress)

261
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:04,893
Just give up.

262
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:07,323
I can't.

263
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:09,993
I must grill the meat today.

264
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:12,933
I'm hungry.

265
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:17,033
There's a way.

266
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:26,173
Is it really okay to grill the meat here?

267
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:28,982
Of course. It's my room. Who cares?

268
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,283
Do you really have to do this to eat meat?

269
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:32,653
But it'll be delicious.

270
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,053
I haven't had pork belly for a long time.

271
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,023
Right. I didn't know we
would eat it in a place like this.

272
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,323
Let me grill it then.

273
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:48,233
- Cook my meat well done, please.
- Well done? Okay.

274
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:49,303
How about you?

275
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:50,903
Just make it delicious.

276
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:52,433
Delicious? Okay.

277
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:58,873
Excuse me.

278
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,403
It's hot.

279
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:39,282
I mean, your hand must be so hot.

280
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,583
What? Oh, yes.

281
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,653
Eat a lot.

282
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:32,133
Ji Won, eat quickly.

283
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,173
I'm eating.

284
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,473
Good.

285
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:39,713
By the way,

286
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,743
why do you use honorifics
only when you talk to me?

287
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:43,683
Sorry?

288
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,053
You call him casually.

289
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:49,523
Why do you use honorifics when you call me?

290
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:57,363
You were kind of scary.

291
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,463
And we weren't exactly
comfortable in the beginning.

292
00:25:04,173 --> 00:25:05,273
I don't like it.

293
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,273
I don't like it when you use honorifics.

294
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:27,263
Oh, my gosh. Why would you not like it?

295
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,263
Come to think of it, we
don't have any beverages.

296
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:33,393
- I'll get it. - I'll join you.

297
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,233
Let's go together.

298
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:49,983
Are you stuck on Bani?

299
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:54,653
Why are you always with
her whenever I see you?

300
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,893
We're close.

301
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,293
Oh, you're close?

302
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,533
Are you sure you're just close friends?

303
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,333
Why are you acting like that then?

304
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,203
Excuse me?

305
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:19,873
If you're going to play
with her, you better stop.

306
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:25,553
I'm not playing.

307
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:30,423
I'm serious.

308
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,852
Don't just grill the meat.
You should eat some too.

309
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,353
- Let me grill it. - No, it's fine.

310
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:02,923
Sorry?

311
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,953
I love grilling meat.

312
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:07,963
Okay.

313
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:17,503
What?

314
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,433
What's going on? What's this?

315
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:21,803
Is there a fire outside?

316
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:24,813
- That's horrible. - Dong Ha!

317
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:27,243
The smoke! It's because of this!

318
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,643
I think it's because of the smoke.

319
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:31,853
Water.

320
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,823
- Dong Ha! - No!

321
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,643
I'm doomed.

322
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:39,653
Gosh.

323
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,593
Hee Jin.

324
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,393
What are you doing?

325
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:56,233
I... This...

326
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:58,403
Come out.

327
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:00,473
Darn it.

328
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:04,673
Let me see. Did you not get hurt?

329
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:09,443
No. Well, the equipment is wet.

330
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,813
Who cares about the equipment?

331
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:13,013
What if you had been hurt?

332
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:15,053
But those are expensive.

333
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,353
So you're really not hurt, right?

334
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:23,093
No.

335
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,233
I'm fine.

336
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,823
Are you sure you don't need help?

337
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,153
It's okay.

338
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,053
We should clean up the mess.

339
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,763
You guys must've been surprised.

340
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,363
Go home and take a rest.

341
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:06,033
We'll get going first then.

342
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:08,143
Let me know if you need anything.

343
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:09,403
Okay.

344
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,963
Bye, my love.

345
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:41,803
Get in my car, everyone.

346
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:43,573
I'll drive you home.

347
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:46,313
No, it's fine. You must be tired too.

348
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,543
How can you go home like that?

349
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:55,723
I guess you're right.

350
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:58,053
Wait here. I'll get my car.

351
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:05,093
This means I can cross "water
park" off my list for summer this year.

352
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:06,993
Tell me about it.

353
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,103
You said there was no way.

354
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:15,543
- What? - Him.

355
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:17,643
You said he didn't like you.

356
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:20,343
As if.

357
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,413
Wasn't it obvious?

358
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,183
Didn't you see love dripping from his eyes?

359
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:25,953
I thought he was Timothee Thalamet.

360
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:27,983
It's Chalamet.

361
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:30,383
Right, Thalamet. Timothee Thalamet.

362
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,092
Timothee Chalamet.

363
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,963
Thalamet. Timothee Thalamet.

364
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:36,793
Did I say it wrong?

365
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,583
(Ban Hee-nuisance I Can't Stand)

366
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:00,923
Could she be asleep?

367
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:05,723
You said he didn't like you.

368
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,562
As if.

369
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:09,062
Wasn't it obvious?

370
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,463
Didn't you see love dripping from his eyes?

371
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:20,573
(Hwang Jae Yeol I Loathe)

372
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:30,813
Hello?

373
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:32,813
You weren't asleep.

374
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:36,383
Right. Not yet.

375
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,693
Why are you calling this late?

376
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,463
No reason. I was just wondering
if you got home all right.

377
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,793
It was also to hear your voice.

378
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:51,003
By the way, how are things at the studio?

379
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,933
I explained the situation
to the building manager...

380
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:55,173
and tidied up the best I could for now.

381
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,913
Hold on.

382
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:00,073
Don't you think you'll catch a cold?

383
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:04,183
Right. I do have the chills,

384
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:05,583
but it's nothing serious.

385
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:06,883
You have the chills?

386
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,083
You know what? Just go to bed already.

387
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:11,793
Don't forget to tuck yourself in.

388
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,523
Right, sure.

389
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,263
Then,

390
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:18,333
good night.

391
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,663
Sure.

392
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,473
What on earth was that?

393
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,443
You even confessed your feelings to me.

394
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:34,213
That wasn't a mistake.

395
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:36,413
Then think about...

396
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:41,483
why I'm acting like this.

397
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,683
Who cares about the equipment?

398
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:45,023
What if you had been hurt?

399
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:47,863
Does he...

400
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,293
really like me?

401
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:03,173
(Ban Hee-nuisance I Can't Stand)

402
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:14,583
(Bani)

403
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:20,853
You're going soft, Jae Yeol.

404
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,202
Are you going to work on
your project this afternoon?

405
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:36,703
Yes, for a bit.

406
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,313
What about you, Ji Won?

407
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:42,412
I'm tired today, so I'll
be heading home early.

408
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,983
Why? Are you not feeling well?

409
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:47,882
I wasn't able to get a
good night's sleep last night.

410
00:34:47,883 --> 00:34:48,883
I see.

411
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,623
They say we sleep less as we grow older.

412
00:34:54,763 --> 00:34:55,863
It's not like that.

413
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,562
We'll have lunch ourselves then.

414
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,933
- Sure. - Good.

415
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:05,902
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

416
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,433
Could that be it?

417
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,573
I was drenched from head-to-toe last night.

418
00:35:09,703 --> 00:35:10,973
I don't have a fever though.

419
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,383
She couldn't sleep and has the shivers.

420
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:19,953
She hasn't been able to keep her eyes open.

421
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,053
She's really sick, okay?

422
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:23,683
What?

423
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,223
I need cold medicine.

424
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,622
General, nasal, and throat.

425
00:35:27,623 --> 00:35:29,223
Pills, syrup, or powder.

426
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,633
I'll take everything that does the trick.

427
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,633
Everything?

428
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:38,403
Gosh, I'm stuffed now.

429
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,573
I'd give anything to take a nap right now.

430
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,513
But we should work
hard since we ate, right?

431
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:46,413
- Good luck to us. - Let's do it.

432
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:52,613
(Cold Medicine)

433
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,253
You have the chills?

434
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:59,523
You know what? Just go to bed already.

435
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:01,263
Don't forget to tuck yourself in.

436
00:36:01,523 --> 00:36:02,923
Are you kidding me?

437
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:04,693
No way.

438
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:06,793
One oat latte, coming up.

439
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,073
- Hi. - Hey.

440
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:18,413
Well...

441
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:20,713
Well...

442
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,443
I'm sorry about yesterday.

443
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:27,682
Don't be. We enjoyed the meal.

444
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,283
Still, I'm the reason you...

445
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,993
I hope you have another good day, then.

446
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,993
I'll be getting to my class.

447
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:41,363
Just a second.

448
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:54,943
This is the play I'm in.

449
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:56,843
You should come see it.

450
00:36:59,253 --> 00:37:00,253
What?

451
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,823
It's for all the meat you grilled.

452
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,223
I'll see you that day.

453
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:12,033
("Romeo and Juliet")

454
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:14,963
No way.

455
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,173
My forearm muscles finally paid off!

456
00:37:21,603 --> 00:37:23,803
Do you see them? My gosh.

457
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:25,443
Good job, boys.

458
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,453
Hey, friend.

459
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,053
What's going on? You
looked dead up until yesterday,

460
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:41,692
but now you're beaming.

461
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:42,893
I was reminded once again...

462
00:37:43,423 --> 00:37:44,493
that hard work...

463
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,993
doesn't betray you.

464
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,403
Whatever.

465
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:56,703
Gosh. Hi, Ms. Lim.

466
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:01,413
Professor...

467
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:09,383
Hey.

468
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:17,833
Are you kidding me?

469
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,863
I was going to tell you,

470
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,402
but there was never the right time.

471
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,672
You've been too busy.

472
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:27,133
Is it a professor this time around?

473
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:30,103
Does he know...

474
00:38:30,843 --> 00:38:32,042
that I'm your son?

475
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,143
I haven't told him yet.

476
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:36,883
Why not?

477
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:40,153
Even you must know...

478
00:38:40,913 --> 00:38:42,153
that this whole situation is messed up.

479
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:47,053
What can I do when I only found
out about his job after we got together?

480
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:48,623
Are you saying we should've broken up?

481
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:53,662
Besides, I'm not cheating on my husband...

482
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:55,203
nor dating a student.

483
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:58,902
Aren't I free to date a man...

484
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,433
that seems decent?

485
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:05,873
Rather than wishing for my happiness,

486
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,143
you make it sound like
I did something wrong.

487
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,183
To you,

488
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:15,883
I never matter.

489
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,453
What did I expect?

490
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:21,723
You only took custody of me...

491
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,693
so that you'd get child support.

492
00:39:27,163 --> 00:39:28,932
- What? - You only said you'd raise me...

493
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,063
in return for getting a building of his.

494
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:32,303
Did you think I didn't know?

495
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,703
Now that you have what you wanted,

496
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:38,043
I no longer...

497
00:39:38,873 --> 00:39:40,713
matter to you.

498
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,943
You...

499
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:46,553
- How could you... - Whatever.

500
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:48,853
Just forget it.

501
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:54,093
Don't care about me like
you've been doing so far...

502
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:56,993
and do whatever you want.

503
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,193
Date anyone and do as you please.

504
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:04,803
I'm done...

505
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,473
caring about it.

506
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,113
So what if I got a building from him?

507
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:16,182
What about it?

508
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:18,153
Wasn't I entitled to that much?

509
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,782
I raised you well giving
you everything you needed.

510
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:23,683
What more do you want from me?

511
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:29,693
I finally want to enjoy my life.

512
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:33,093
Is that too much to ask? Is it?

513
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:52,013
Jae Yeol?

514
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:07,423
I didn't get a good look
the last time I was here.

515
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:10,693
It's a mess, right?

516
00:42:13,093 --> 00:42:14,093
I guess.

517
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,233
Anyway, what were you up to?

518
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:23,773
I was working on the basics
for the interim evaluation.

519
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:25,813
I see.

520
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,083
It's more fascinating up close.

521
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:33,813
It might seem that way at first,

522
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:36,383
but it's just like a sketch.

523
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,153
This isn't my first time.

524
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:43,963
Sorry?

525
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,813
Your hair is down today.

526
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:05,813
You normally have it up.

527
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,353
My hair? I forgot.

528
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:12,523
How did you know though?

529
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,673
I told you.

530
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,503
This isn't my first time.

531
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,783
Gosh.

532
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:43,283
I should do it later.

533
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:45,523
Here.

534
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:51,383
There you go.

535
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:00,233
I have something for you.

536
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,073
I bought some just in case.

537
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:10,673
Take them when you're not feeling well.

538
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:13,873
Hold on.

539
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:16,313
Weren't these from you?

540
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:19,013
What are those?

541
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,723
They were left on my desk earlier.

542
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:23,853
I thought they were from you.

543
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,193
Take these instead.

544
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:32,663
I asked for everything that did the trick.

545
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:36,633
Take what I got for you.

546
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:38,603
Okay?

547
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:43,273
Sure. Thanks for these.

548
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:51,013
Then,

549
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:53,053
I'll get going.

550
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:55,453
And...

551
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,723
Call me whenever you feel bored.

552
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:07,563
Or...

553
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,003
just call me whenever you want.

554
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,273
Sure.

555
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:35,593
(Cold Medicine)

556
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:43,003
Did your sculpting go well today?

557
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:46,872
(Chaon Hospital)

558
00:46:46,873 --> 00:46:48,803
(Chaon Hospital)

559
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:55,013
Yes. I'm going to wrap
things up and head out soon.

560
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:57,313
You must have been bored to work alone.

561
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:09,193
(Senior Partner Bani)

562
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,823
I wasn't alone the whole time.

563
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:12,933
Yeol stopped by for a moment.

564
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,613
Okay. Be on standby, everyone.

565
00:47:29,243 --> 00:47:32,012
Sir, you can come this way.

566
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:33,053
You can stand here.

567
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,293
Yeo Reum.

568
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:41,323
We'll start shooting in five minutes.

569
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:43,593
Okay. I got it.

570
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:59,743
(How are you?)

571
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:11,323
This is how one makes a glorious return.

572
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:13,252
She's the most successful
alumna of the Media...

573
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:14,793
and Public Relations Department
and the youngest sports announcer.

574
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:16,923
I will get a job...

575
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:18,993
at a TV station just
like her no matter what.

576
00:48:20,093 --> 00:48:22,433
Someone like her wouldn't
date just anybody, right?

577
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,763
Does she date idol stars, actors,

578
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,403
or guys with rich parents?

579
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:31,403
No. My grandparents are rich.

580
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:33,713
- I see. - It's his grandparents.

581
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,313
Port cutlets?

582
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:39,213
- No way. - My gosh.

583
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:43,453
Han Yeo Reum will be the
MC at this year's festival.

584
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:44,722
It's Han Yeo Reum.

585
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:46,553
She's been blowing up these days.

586
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:49,563
My gosh, it's been so long
since I saw her in person.

587
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,623
You know that she's super
popular these days, right?

588
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:54,293
- She's so beautiful.
- Gosh, she's coming to our school.

589
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:56,063
- She's gorgeous. - Right.

590
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,503
Hey.

591
00:48:57,863 --> 00:48:59,203
Why are you already
thinking about the festival?

592
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,873
I thought you guys had one more exam left.

593
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:03,402
- Gosh. - Come on.

594
00:49:03,403 --> 00:49:05,443
My goodness, I didn't mind
that I had forgotten about it.

595
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:07,943
Why do you keep bringing up our exams?

596
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:09,813
- Read the room.
- Don't ruin our good mood.

597
00:49:13,883 --> 00:49:16,022
The theme of our
sculptures is body language.

598
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:18,592
Each sculpture portrays happiness,

599
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,953
sadness, and anger
through gestures and poses.

600
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:24,692
The proportions are balanced,
and the details are thorough.

601
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:25,763
This is good.

602
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:29,203
Yoo Ri, you can start
working with plaster now.

603
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,163
Well done.

604
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:32,703
- Thank you. - Okay.

605
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:39,713
Did you not have enough time?

606
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:41,913
Pardon?

607
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:43,613
Why is yours lacking refinement?

608
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:45,213
What were you thinking?

609
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:50,453
I'll try to improve it.

610
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:53,392
Forget about the details.

611
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:55,123
You'll need to redo the frame.

612
00:49:55,723 --> 00:49:57,493
Do you think this can keep
you at the top of the class?

613
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:07,203
Won, you're next.

614
00:50:17,883 --> 00:50:18,883
Bani.

615
00:50:19,913 --> 00:50:21,713
How about the special
meal today? It's been a while.

616
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,453
I wanted to go home
early and rest up today.

617
00:50:26,593 --> 00:50:27,853
Let's take a rain check.

618
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:29,793
Okay.

619
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,103
- Right there. My gosh, yes. - Up here?

620
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:41,503
My gosh.

621
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:44,773
Why don't you take the season off?

622
00:50:44,873 --> 00:50:46,043
How could I?

623
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:48,112
To provide for our daughter...

624
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:49,113
who needs a lot of financial support,

625
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:50,783
I must keep earning money when I still can.

626
00:50:51,513 --> 00:50:55,213
We can't afford to send her abroad,
but we must help her graduate.

627
00:50:58,123 --> 00:50:59,553
You know what?

628
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:03,263
I'm so relieved that she
always gets the scholarship.

629
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:04,823
Right.

630
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,333
- She's doing us a favour. - Yes.

631
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:09,903
My gosh.

632
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:12,003
Goodness, your whole body is aching.

633
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,552
Our interim evaluations are
posted on the academic affairs page.

634
00:51:25,553 --> 00:51:28,653
(Our interim evaluations are
posted on the academic affairs page.)

635
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:32,292
(Check Grades)

636
00:51:32,293 --> 00:51:34,323
(Sculpture 1: B plus, Plaster 1: B plus)

637
00:51:38,063 --> 00:51:40,293
My grades are mediocre
in other subjects too.

638
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:48,533
Call me whenever you feel bored.

639
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:56,113
(Ji Won)

640
00:51:58,713 --> 00:51:59,783
Hello?

641
00:52:00,613 --> 00:52:03,253
Bani, can you come out for a moment?

642
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:05,993
What?

643
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:15,763
What's this about?

644
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:18,333
Let's go for a drive.

645
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:20,403
Now?

646
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:21,673
Yes.

647
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:26,973
I'm not in the mood to go for a drive.

648
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:29,683
Let's go.

649
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:45,863
Bani.

650
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:48,493
Doesn't it feel good to be out?

651
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,433
Yes. You're right.

652
00:52:54,273 --> 00:52:56,173
It does feel good now that I'm out.

653
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:19,793
My gosh, the breeze is nice,
and the view is amazing too.

654
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,703
I always wanted to go for a
drive and come to the Han River.

655
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,573
I'm glad to hear that.

656
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:34,813
Thank you, Ji Won.

657
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:39,253
You brought me here
so you could cheer me up.

658
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:43,553
To be honest,

659
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:48,193
I was anxious after getting
the professor's feedback.

660
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,563
I was worried that I might lose...

661
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:56,163
my scholarship next semester.

662
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,203
My parents are working hard
to put me through art school.

663
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:07,913
You have a lot of time.

664
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:10,243
Don't worry too much.

665
00:54:11,713 --> 00:54:14,113
Well, if you don't think it's going well,

666
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:16,323
I'll take over and carry the team.

667
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,123
You trust me, right?

668
00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:22,963
So I can be a freeloader?

669
00:54:23,223 --> 00:54:24,223
If that's what you want.

670
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:29,803
You know what?

671
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:32,303
It feels liberating to tell
you what's on my mind.

672
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:46,653
I had so much fun today. Drive safely.

673
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,682
Okay. See you tomorrow at school.

674
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:49,683
Okay.

675
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:55,423
You startled me.

676
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:57,163
Dad.

677
00:54:57,763 --> 00:54:59,193
How long have you been standing there?

678
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:02,233
Who is that handsome guy?

679
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,463
- Is he your boyfriend? - No, he's not.

680
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,473
He's my junior partner.
Don't get your hopes up.

681
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,703
Okay. But a junior partner
can turn into a boyfriend too.

682
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:14,573
Seeing his face reminds
me of my younger days.

683
00:55:15,473 --> 00:55:17,143
I like him. He gets a green light from me.

684
00:55:17,483 --> 00:55:19,682
No, Dad. Hear me out.

685
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,352
He's really not my boyfriend. Not him.

686
00:55:21,353 --> 00:55:23,253
Okay. I got you.

687
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,223
"Not him?"

688
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:28,553
You must have a crush on someone.

689
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:31,362
My gosh, whatever. I'm going in.

690
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:33,563
You can tell me. Come on. Talk to me.

691
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:36,432
- Whatever. I'm going back in. - Come on.

692
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,603
Tell me. Come on, Bani. Wait.

693
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:47,713
Seriously.

695
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,723
I asked for everything that did the trick.

696
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,693
Take what I got for you.

697
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:04,023
Okay?

698
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:11,933
You must have a crush on someone.

699
00:56:43,603 --> 00:56:44,603
Bani.

700
00:56:54,813 --> 00:56:57,413
My crush.

(Student Council Room)

702
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,763
The weather is amazing today.

703
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,463
You know, it's making
me want to play hooky.

704
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,733
I know, right?

705
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:54,133
A picnic would be perfect today.

706
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,703
Do you need to work on
your sculpture again tonight?

707
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:00,973
Yes. Probably.

708
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:03,743
I see.

709
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:05,343
Bani.

710

Ji Won.

711
00:58:10,223 --> 00:58:11,453
You guys came to school together.

712
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,053
We ran into each other over there.

713
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:16,223
Gosh, is coming to
school together a problem?

714
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:21,133
Aren't you tired? You
went home late last night.

715
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:24,003
I'm fine. I had a good night's sleep.

716
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:25,603
How are you feeling?

717
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,573
The breeze from the Han
River last night was a bit chilly.

718
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:31,003
I'm fine.

719
00:58:32,143 --> 00:58:34,413
I think you're running a fever.

720
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:43,183
She's not.

721
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:49,823
If you're sick, make sure to
take the medicine I gave you.

722
00:58:52,023 --> 00:58:53,033
Okay.

723
00:59:08,743 --> 00:59:09,883
It's Han Yeo Reum.

724
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,293
Hey, look.

725
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:29,663
- My gosh. - She's so pretty.

726
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,232
- It's Han Yeo Reum. - You look so pretty.

727
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:32,773
- My gosh, no way. - I can't believe this.

728
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:34,033
- Is that really her? - Yes.

729
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,003
- You look so pretty. - I'm a fan.

730

Unfortunately,

731
01:00:02,363 --> 01:00:05,003
I realized this just as
I figured out how I felt.

732
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:07,833
Have you been well?

733
01:00:09,703 --> 01:00:10,703
Yeol.

734
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:23,583
That the heroine...

735
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:24,983
of a heart-fluttering
love story like this...

736
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:27,953
would be someone else.

(Crushology 101)

738
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:33,893
Did you guys see this?

739
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:35,492
Did you not miss me?

740
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:36,792
Why must I be bothered by this?

741
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,563
It's not like he and I are dating.

742
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:42,133
- Are you all right?
- You're such a sweet guy.

743
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,463
Well, I'm kind of worried about her.

744
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,033
Are you sure this isn't a crush?

745
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:47,773
Be careful, will you?

746
01:01:48,473 --> 01:01:49,473
You haven't changed.

747
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:51,743
I thought I should tell you.

748
01:01:52,103 --> 01:01:54,112
I told you I was serious that time.

749
01:01:54,113 --> 01:01:55,173
What about you?

750
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:57,243
My feelings for Bani...

751
01:01:58,643 --> 01:01:59,653
are genuine.
