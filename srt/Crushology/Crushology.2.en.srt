00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:26,321
After my first wild breakup
with a loser boyfriend,

2
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,551
I promised myself.

3
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:30,751
Listen carefully.

4
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:34,521
I'm going to start dating
good-looking people too!

5
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,731
Do words truly have power?

(Corner Cafe)

7
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,281
For the first time,

8
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:02,221
I started getting tangled
up with handsome guys.

9
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,421
And very intensely...

10
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:07,621
at that.

11
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,761
You.

12
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:17,501
What are you?

13
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,181
Well...

14
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,311
You see...

15
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,491
Sorry.

16
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:39,860
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,891
Seriously.

18
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:42,421
I'm terribly sorry.

19
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,461
Stop right there!

20
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,161
I told you to stop!

21
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:54,140
(A Cruel Fate)

22
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:58,171
(Episode 2)

23
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,651
Are you okay?

24
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,121
How do you know that punk?

25
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,451
You see...

26
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,091
You can say we're in a debt relationship.

27
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:17,031
I broke that guy's tablet.

28
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:20,101
Anyway, we're not on good terms.

29
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,071
"That punk?"

30
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,141
Do you know him?

31
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:32,411
Excuse me.

32
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:34,741
I was just about to put my things in it.

33
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,611
Shouldn't it go...

34
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,581
to whoever occupies it first?

35
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:41,521
I'm in a similar situation.

36
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,021
We're not on good terms.

37
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:48,691
Running out of the blue made me hungry.

38
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,731
Should we go and get that
special menu we talked about?

39
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,501
How is this the special menu?

40
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,971
Is it any good?

41
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:16,791
What's this?

42
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,761
This rice bowl is on a whole other level.

43
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:21,490
Of course.

44
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,291
As for this rice bowl,

45
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,590
it's the perfect combination...

46
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:27,431
of the cooks' heartfelt
cooking skills and Korean MSG.

47
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:30,771
I didn't know the school
had such a cafeteria.

48
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,970
To think I never had
this delicious dish before.

49
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:39,010
How unfair.

50
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,940
This is actually the faculty's cafeteria.

51
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,311
You can only come
and dine with a professor.

52
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,051
But I laid the groundwork so well that...

53
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,251
the cooks let me have this menu in secret.

54
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,831
Let's...

55
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:00,631
get along really well.

56
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,131
Sure thing.

57
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,541
That was a scrumptious meal.

58
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,071
Coffee will be on me.

59
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,741
No way. A meal and coffee come as a set.

60
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,741
Today will be my treat.

61
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,611
Then it'll be on me next time.

62
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:16,851
All right.

63
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,151
- You made this, right? - Yes.

64
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:30,691
Bani. What do you think?

65
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,161
About what?

66
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:44,971
Let me guess. Are you posing like a model?

67
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,581
I got it. An ad for a coat?

68
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:55,221
No. Think outside the box.

69
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,121
This statue.

70
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,761
Doesn't it sort of resemble me?

71
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:08,331
Are you trying to make me
believe that you look like the statue?

72
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,871
How can someone say it outright?

73
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:12,531
You're hilarious.

74
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,341
Let's get going.

75
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:18,040
How are you aware that
you have a sculpted face?

76
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,211
Don't people usually play
dumb even if they know it?

77
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,210
It doesn't suit you at all.

78
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,681
Why not act like a chic city guy?

79

(First Love)

80
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,451
Yes?

81
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:33,621
I just had lunch.

82
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:36,891
Is that so?

83
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,631
Okay. I'm on my way.

84
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,271
Bani. This is a bummer.

85
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,271
I have to get going.

86
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,541
I'll treat you to coffee
next time. I'm sorry.

87
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,540
Don't worry.

88
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,310
Get going. You must be in a hurry.

89
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,311
Okay.

90
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,451
"First love."

91
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,151
Could it be his girlfriend?

95
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,201
Ignoring my calls, are you?

96
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:28,211
I looked for you for ages.

97
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,111
I...

98
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,951
didn't ignore your calls.

99
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,021
I touched the wrong button.

100
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:38,421
What?

101
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,460
Are you planning to
apologize and then bolt again?

102
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,491
No.

103
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:45,231
Come with me.

104
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,601
If everything becomes
mechanized and mass-produced,

105
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,870
we will lose the beauty of our daily lives.

106
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,041
And that is the concern.

107
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:58,871
Without my tablet,

108
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,011
I can't write anything down.

109
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:05,181
Yes.

110
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,751
You're right.

111
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:10,921
But won't your friends' notes...

112
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,621
be better than mine?

113
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,261
After all, I'm not in your department.

114
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,661
I hate borrowing things from others.

115
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,131
Be thorough.

116
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,231
Got it?

117
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,441
Right. "Thorough."

118
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,091
My wrist hurts.

119
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:50,830

He wants me in all of these classes?

125
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,941
Over my dead body.

126
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,040
I'd rather pay back that
2,000 dollars quickly...

127
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,611
than be humiliated.

128
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,011
What? Hold on.

129
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,520
Doesn't the off-season
training end tomorrow?

130
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,750
Remember? I told you it
ends the day after tomorrow.

131
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,651
What? You did?

132
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,391
What about your meals?

133
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:22,320
You're eating properly, right?

134
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,090
Of course. This place has the best food.

135
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,590
- Hi. - Hi.

136
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:27,730
- Hi. - We've heard a lot about you.

137
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,470
- I should get going. - Okay. Go ahead.

138
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,971
And here's my heart, honey.

139
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,601
She hung up.

140
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,911
- Was it Mom? - She seemed busy.

141
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,541
Isn't she a lot busier than
when she was a player?

142
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:43,810
Coaching isn't for just anyone.

143
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,151
You're right.

144
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,120
This won't do.

145
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,781
I will go grocery shopping tomorrow...

146
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,251
and buy ingredients to boost her energy.

147
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,421
And you, Bani? Are you craving anything?

148
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,821
- Me? - Yes.

150
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:02,900
- Dad. - Yes?

151
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,670
Can you lend me...

152
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:05,731
Give me a minute.

Hello? Yes, good evening.

155
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,371
- Listen. - Yes?

156
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,510
I'm afraid I need to increase the deposit.

157
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,610
By how much?

158
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:18,381
Since you've been a long-term resident,

159
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,151
I'm thinking 30,000 dollars.

160
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,790
It's such a sudden notice.

161
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,660
We need time to gather that much money.

162
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:29,621
Let me call you back within this week...

163
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:31,790
after discussing it with my wife.

164
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,330
Sure, Yeong Min. I'll
be waiting for your call.

165
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:36,461
Okay. Bye.

166
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:39,331
Was it the landlady?

167
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,101
Is she increasing our rent deposit?

168
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,271
Yes.

169
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,311
Nobody has 30,000 dollars on hand.

170
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,841
Such short notice puts people on the spot.

171
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:51,781
What was it earlier? You need some what?

when are you going to pay
me back the 2,000 dollars?

341
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,310
How much did I suffer from him...

342
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:53,671
to have a dream like this?

343
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,111
I must do something.

344
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:07,190
(200 dollars)

345
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:08,420
(Sending 200 dollars to Ruthless
Debt Collector, Hwang Jae Yeol)

346
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:10,631
(200 dollars transferred successfully)

347
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,140
(200 dollars deposited)

348
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:24,171
(Debt of 2,000 dollars, Ban
Hee Jin has sent 200 dollars.)

349
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,041
She's going to pay back in instalments?

350
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:32,710
(Decline, Accept)

351
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,121
(200 dollars accepted)

352
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:37,420
(Contacts)

353
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,590
(Debt)

354
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,521
(Debt of 2,000 dollars)

355
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:50,701
(Debt of 1,800 dollars)

356
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:26,431
Is she his first love?

357
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,191
The campus is pretty as you said.

358
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,361
What about class? Is it okay not to go?

359
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,491
You're more important than the class.

360
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:51,991
Gosh.

361
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:54,531
I'm thirsty.

362
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:56,061
Are you thirsty?

363
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:58,471
Just a moment.

364
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:06,241
Stay here for a
moment. I'll get it quickly.

365
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:07,711
- Don't take too long. - Okay.

366
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:31,471
I like the campus.

367
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,651
What's wrong with this?

368
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,191
Come on.

369
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,721
Please come out. Come on!

370
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,961
So you want to see who is going to win?

371
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:02,021
Are you okay?

372
00:25:04,531 --> 00:25:05,531
Yes.

373
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:14,671
It became muddy after it rained last week.

374
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:15,941
Thank you.

375
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:20,471
The mud is all over your pants.

376
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,040
It's fine.

377
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,451
I'm used to getting dirt on my clothes.

378
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:26,081
Hye Won.

379
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:37,691
These are new clothes.

380
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:42,101
That's why you shouldn't
go around as you like.

381
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,631
I'm glad you didn't get hurt, though.

382
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:49,001
Are you guys close?

383
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,041
Why are you asking something like that?

384
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,141
Why?

385
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,181
Can't I ask your friend about that?

386
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,211
Oh, right.

387
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:06,021
When did you change your name on my phone?

388
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,491
Why? I'm your first love.

389
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:11,031
You said I was the first
woman you loved in your life.

390
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:12,931
Gosh.

391
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:15,801
Cha Hye Won. Nobody can stop you.

392
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,811
Why are you looking at us like that?

393
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:28,281
Sorry?

394
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:29,911
No.

395
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:32,781
You guys really look like close siblings.

396
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:34,381
We're quite close.

397
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:37,521
As you can see, my brother adores me a lot.

398
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:39,891
Yes.

399
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:42,091
Let me see your hands.

400
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:45,560
Did you receive the timetable?

401
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:46,590
(Did you receive the
timetable? The class is at 3pm.)

402
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:47,831
The class is at 3pm.

403
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:50,531
Jae Yeol.

404
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:54,271
Can you please come with us just once?

405
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,201
I definitely said I wouldn't
go on a group blind date.

406
00:26:58,211 --> 00:26:59,871
I knew it.

407
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:02,841
Jae Yeol. They're dance majors.

408
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,380
If you don't come,

409
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:05,751
they won't meet us.

410
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:07,150
Just this once, please.

411
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,850
- Please.
- Jae Yeol, I won't ask you again.

412
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,721
Can you please come with us just this once?

413
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:13,320
Please.

414
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,790
What did they do...

415
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,060
for him to make them kneel?

416
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,361
Just once.

417
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,730
No matter how good-looking he is,

418
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:21,000
I shouldn't get involved with someone...

419
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,100
who has a personality like that.

420
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,161
- Jae Yeol. - Please.

421
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,371
- Just once. Please. - Just once.

422
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,001
Can you?

423
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:30,040
We're talking. What are you looking at?

424
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,441
- Jae Yeol.
- Jae Yeol, can you really not...

425
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,340
- Jae Yeol. - Where are you going?

426
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:34,341
Jae Yeol.

427
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:36,281
- We're doomed. - You...

428
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:39,381
Hey.

429
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:42,881
Why are you so startled as if
I'm a ruthless debt collector?

430
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:49,421
Did I catch you when you were
running away without taking notes?

431
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:50,791
What?

432
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,891
No. I was on my way.

433
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,331
I sent 200 dollars in the morning.

434
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,731
Did you see it?

435
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:01,371
That's 1-10th of the money you owe.

436
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:04,101
I'll pay you back the
rest of the money soon.

437
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:11,981
- Why do you look like that? - What?

438
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:14,581
This?

439
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:24,861
Put this on.

440
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,131
No. I'm fine.

441
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:36,641
Just put this on.

442
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,541
No.

443
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,381
I'm really fine.

444
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,911
If your clothes get dirty, I'll
have you pay you even more.

445
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,081
- So you'll walk around like that? - Yes.

446
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:50,081
I'd rather walk around looking
like this than having more debt.

447
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,421
Hey.

448
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:54,591
I won't charge you for my
clothes. Will you put it on now?

449
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,601
It's because I don't like
how you look right now.

450
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:02,861
- Stay strong today as always.
- Yes. I'll stay strong.

451
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:09,701
Hey. It's misspelled.

452
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:12,531
I got it.

453
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:21,681
(Assignment Report)

454
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,321

(The Significance of Alphonse
Mucha in the History of Design)

456
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:36,921
(Professor Jang Jae In's mailbox
by 5am on the next class day)

457
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:41,961
Your drawing is nice.

458
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:46,301
A sculpture major is indeed different.

459
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:18,831
Why does the sunlight have
to shatter on those eyelashes?

460
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:27,311
Why does the wind have to tickle that hair?

461
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:34,051
Get it together, Ban Hee Jin.

462
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,451
Don't let that face fool you.

463
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:40,351
Let's go.

464
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:44,391
(Assignment Report)

465
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,231
Here you go.

466
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:56,540
I'll get going then.

467
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,471
Sure. I'll see you in tomorrow's class.

468
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:09,281
Are you sure...

469
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,591
you're having her
around just to take notes?

470
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:13,851
What are you getting at?

471
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:17,761
Nothing. It's amusing, that's all.

472
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:36,841
What? He'll see me in tomorrow's class?

473
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:39,280
Am I supposed to take
his notes tomorrow too?

474
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:41,111
Will today repeat itself?

475
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:44,721
Hey, Bo Bae.

476
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:45,991
Bani!

477
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,420
What on earth? Did you hurt your arm?

478
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:49,661
Oh, this?

479
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:51,891
It's what I needed for drama class.

480
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,591
You had me worried.

481
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:55,131
I thought you got hurt.

482
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:58,731
- Are you off to work part-time?
- Yes, I have the graveyard shift.

483
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:02,071
Wait. Can you hold on to this for me...

484
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:03,370
while I go to the restroom?

485
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,710
Sure thing. I'll be out here.

486
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:06,041
- Thanks. - No problem.

487
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:10,911
No way. This looks so real.

488
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:14,051
It fits.

489
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:15,251
Seriously?

490
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:17,881
Did you hurt your arm?

491
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,721
What?

492
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:21,561
Oh, this.

493
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:27,891
You were fine earlier today.

494
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:29,501
When did this happen?

495
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:32,301
You see...

496
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,301
It seems bad.

497
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,141
Then you won't be able
to take notes in class.

498
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:43,141
I know.

499
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:45,251
I should've been aware of that.

500
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,681
How can I make up for this?

501
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:52,391
Forget it.

502
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:54,621
Recovering should be the priority,

503
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:56,161
so focus on that.

504
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:57,521
Sure.

505
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:03,831
Nice!

506
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:08,071
(Surim Elementary School)

507
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:10,270
The mural last year...

508
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,770
by Yein University's art students...

509
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:13,871
was a huge hit with our children.

510
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,110
I ask that you do
another good job this year.

511
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:18,151
- Sure. - Sure.

512
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:20,810
You can work on the mural...

513
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,451
in groups of two.

514
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:24,690
Shall we begin, then?

515
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:25,850
- Got it. - Sure.

516
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:26,990
We should partner up.

517
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,891
Hey, you'll work with me.

518
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:30,521
What?

519
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,661
You hurt your arm and
won't be able to work much.

520
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:34,331
I'll do it for you.

521
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,661
It's okay. I can do this much.

522
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:10,061
As if I'd be comfortable...

523
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:12,301
with an injured person working beside me.

524
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:16,741
What's going on? Why is he
suddenly being nice to me?

525
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,211
He's only making me feel guilty.

526
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:38,131
Just take a seat.

527
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,260
I can work just fine with my other hand.

528
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:43,131
What if you end up hurting that one too?

529
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:44,631
Stay seated.

530
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:49,141
But you'll be doing all the work alone.

531
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,441
Well,

532
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:55,011
you put in the work taking my notes.

533
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:56,911
I can do...

534
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:58,981
about this much for you.

535
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:14,491
He'll throw a fit once he
finds out I lied about my arm.

536
00:36:15,531 --> 00:36:17,761
Maybe I should come clean.

537
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:28,641
What do I do?

538
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:31,411
I can't say it.

539
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,061
- Pass me the paint. - Sure.

540
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:49,431
- What... - What?

541
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:09,781
Hold on. How is your hand?

542
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:12,291
Are you okay?

543
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:13,821
Yes, I'm fine.

544
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,761
- What about you? - Gosh.

545
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,231
I'm more than fine.

546
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,531
You're fine as well?

547
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,371
Yes, I'm perfectly fine...

548
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:57,501
Let me get this straight.

549
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,101
You lied?

550
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,871
You faked an injury...

551
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:06,340
so that you wouldn't have to take my notes?

552
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:07,671
It's not like that.

553
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:11,481
I never initially intended to lie to you

554
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:17,950
It's tough, isn't it?

555
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:20,021
- Maybe we'll do that. - Sure thing.

556
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:22,521
- This could be better, though. - But...

557
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:32,801
That's right. Your arms are
fine, so you should work hard.

558
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:36,901
- Up there. You missed a spot. - Okay.

559
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:40,271
Over here as well. The
brush strokes aren't even.

560
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:42,541
Move faster.

561
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,361
Bani.

562
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:01,291
Hey, Ji Won.

563
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:05,231
- Here. - Thanks.

564
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,101
I'm truly grateful for the other day.

565
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:09,900
If it hadn't been for you, Hye
Won could've been badly hurt.

566
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,571
Don't mention it. All is good
since nothing happened.

567
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:15,011
This is just what I was craving.

568
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:18,550
Is that coffee too?

569
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:20,881
I can't drink coffee, so
this is Solomon's seal tea.

570
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,420
You're like an old man.

571
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:28,291
Why? Solomon's seal
tea is nutty and refreshing.

572
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,531
By the way, how are you
doing with that debt of yours?

573
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:36,730
Don't even get me started.

574
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,500
My whole body is aching...

575
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,771
from all the note-taking
I have to do in return.

576
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:44,041
I still have 1,800 dollars more to go.

577
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,171
When do I pay it all back?

578
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:51,011
- If it's bad, I could... - What?

This seems like a long shot.

(Who's the Strongest at Yein University?)

596

Come on. You're saying that
because you don't know her.

597
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:41,661
Let me tell you about Bani.

598
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,300
The Sculpture Department is known...

599
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:45,331
as the athletic department
of the College of Art.

600
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,961
Her physical strength is
acknowledged by all its students.

601
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:11,261
I expected no less.

602
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:12,591
What on earth?

603
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:14,061
- No way. - My gosh.

604
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:24,401
Do you need a hand?

605
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:27,941
Bani...

606
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,881
might even be able...

607
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:31,850
to lift the earth.

608
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:34,051
- You'll know once you see her.
- See for yourself.

609
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,520
What's going on?

610
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:37,521
Wait, isn't that the note-taker?

611
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,221
Bani, right?

612
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:40,820
- Where? - Over there.

613
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:41,890
What's she up to, though?

614
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:44,121
Next up is Ban Hee Jin of
the Sculpture Department.

615
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:46,130
- Strength Showdown? - Go, Bani!

616
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,090
- I get it. - It's the punch machine.

617
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,660
That's actually my expertise.

618
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,300
- As if. - Seriously.

619
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,931
- It's all about the twist. - Oh, please.

620
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:55,071
Go, Sculpture Department!

621
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,001
No way.

622
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,630
- Go, Bani! - My gosh.

623
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,740
You're the best!

624
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:29,741
I got it.

625
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:31,641
Isn't she the pushover girlfriend?

626
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:34,340
The one who punched
that guy from the media club.

627
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:35,410
- Oh, right. - Exactly.

628
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:37,581
They weren't kidding about her iron fist.

629
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:40,480
A punch like that
would've crushed his ribs.

630
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,120
- She's in first place. - No way!

631
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:43,520
Bani, you're the best!

632
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,150
- Go, Bani! - Can you believe it?

633
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:46,720
That's amazing!

634
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:47,751
Yes!

635
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:49,491
That puts her in first place.

636
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:51,461
That was perfect!

637
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:57,661
Go, Bani!

638
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:02,540
Congratulations.

639
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,601
My gosh. Thank you so much.

640
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:07,211
I can't believe I actually won this.

641
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:09,411
Does this mean you'll
finally settle your debt?

642
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,541
Yes.

643
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:14,551
Then, how about basketball?

644

as soon as possible, right?

650
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,201
What is she up to now?

651
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,441
What is it?

652
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:45,751
Here you go.

(Women's Division, Latest tablet)

654
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,091
What's this?

655
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,390
It's a tablet.

656
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:57,221
I settled my debt, so I no
longer owe you 2,000 dollars,

657
00:43:57,391 --> 00:43:58,931
nor do I need to take notes for you.

658
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:01,031
Well,

659
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:03,131
I apologize for everything.

660
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,041
- You did well. - Thanks.

661
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:10,701
- Shall we get going? - Sure.

662
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,541
The way you threw that punch was inspiring.

663
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,181
That was nothing.

664
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:18,540
Did you see that?

665
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,681
Does one punch like so?

666
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:29,891
What was that?

667
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:35,931
No way.

668
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:39,200
I expected nothing less
from a chairman's grandson.

669

dinner with me and my friends?

What is it? Who's that?

686
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:34,951
Someone handsome.

687
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:39,031
You're here.

Don't even try.

692
00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:54,911
You were so handsome
that I couldn't help myself.

693
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,041
Sorry.

694

Please be understanding.

695

My friends can be a bit extra.

It's all right. I get that a lot.

697
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:09,190
Of course. It'd be annoying...

698
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:10,861
for someone with that face
not to know he's handsome.

699

- You get my stamp of approval! - Mine too.

700
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:14,330

704
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:29,611
Was paying him back that urgent for her?

705
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:32,351
You must've made her want to escape you.

706
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:34,710
Yeol treated her poorly.

Did you want this?

715

Forget it. Have as much as you want.

716

Why would you eat that?

717

You should have ordered more
when we said we were getting some.

718

Darn it. I lost my appetite.

year did you start college?

because of him.

734

Hey.

735
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,051
I accidentally broke his tablet.

736
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,861
Then...

737
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,990
- who is this guy? - This guy...

He asked for my number...

when I was working at the exhibition.

741
00:48:34,671 --> 00:48:36,071
We had a cup of coffee together too.

742
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,641
What? Then he totally hit on you.

743
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:41,170
So there are two possible guys
who could be your boyfriend?

744
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,240
What? Boyfriend?

745
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:44,040
My gosh. You're getting
ahead of yourself again.

746
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,080
What's the harm in that?

747
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,680
You said you wanted to
date a handsome guy now.

748
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:47,981
Both of them are handsome.

749
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:51,121
Their good looks put them on
the shortlist for your boyfriend.

750
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:53,151
They are good-looking, indeed.

751
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:55,621
As for this guy,

752
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,121
his presence is a breath of fresh air.

753
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:00,460
Should I say his face...

754
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,531
satisfied my decade-long
craving for artistic beauty?

755
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,061
Then you can satisfy your
craving for dating with him too.

756
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:07,471
But I got him a new tablet.

757
00:49:07,731 --> 00:49:08,941
So I won't be seeing him anymore.

758
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:10,741
More importantly, he's quite rude.

759
00:49:11,341 --> 00:49:12,371
Yes.

760
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,171
Then what about him?

761
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:15,471
Watching him is...

762
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:17,541
like getting a jolt of caffeine.

763
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:21,511
One look at his face is enough to
wake you up from a sleepy state.

764
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:24,421
You can keep him by your
side like a cup of coffee.

765
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:27,850
But if you met him for
the first time that day,

766
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,761
shouldn't you take time
and be more careful?

767
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:34,130
You're right.

768
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:36,901
I only know his name and age.

769
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,071
Well,

770
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:42,100
hate turns into love.

771
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:43,540
Strangers...

772
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,301
become lovers. Am I wrong?

00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:47,110
Yes.

No one knows from where and
in what form destiny will come.

775

So even if you don't think
he could be your boyfriend,

776
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:54,211
you should check again.

Gosh. Do you even have to ask?

788
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:30,020
You were more than just harsh on her.

789
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:31,951
I felt so awful watching you torment her.

790

been for her to fake an arm injury.

would have taken some time off.

00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:35,901
Good for you. Have fun.

836
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:38,741
- I'm off now. - Okay.

837
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:42,411
Hey.

838
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,711
I guess they're friends.

839
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,451
Had I known, I would have
gotten to know her better.

840
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:01,631
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

841
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:06,271
Why are you ignoring my message?

842
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:09,031
I didn't ignore your message.
I just didn't answer it back.

843
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:10,971
That's the same thing.

844
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,811
I didn't have anything to say to you.

845
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:18,010
Hey, did you seriously participate
in the showdown yesterday...

846
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:19,381
to give me a new tablet?

847
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:23,081
Yes. Why?

848
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:28,421
So the only solution you came
up with was using brute force?

849
00:54:31,421 --> 00:54:33,460
Wouldn't it have been easier...

850
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:35,091
to take notes instead
of doing the showdown?

851
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:37,831
Why do I have to do that?

852
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:41,131
What?

853
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:43,801
I'll get going.

854
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:45,801
I settled my debt.

855
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:48,341
There is no reason for
us to see each other now.

856
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:55,411
What? I never said I
wanted to keep seeing you.

857
00:54:57,951 --> 00:55:00,121
It's liberating now that I
don't have to see you now.

858
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:05,191
Darn it.

859
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:09,530
(Yein Hall)

860
00:55:09,531 --> 00:55:12,230
(Lecture by Sculptor Jay,
Alumnus of Yein University)

861
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:14,071
Hey, I knew you would be here.

862
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:15,630
I saved you a seat.

863
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:16,801
- Hey. - Okay.

864
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:18,941
- Bani. - Yes.

865
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:22,011
Hey, grab a chair over there.

866
00:55:22,071 --> 00:55:23,841
- I can't wait. - Seriously.

867
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,851
I knew it would be packed.

868
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:31,621
I wouldn't have gotten a seat
if I hadn't booked it in advance.

869
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:34,051
I really wanted to meet this sculptor.

870
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:36,690
I've become a bigger fan of the sculptor...

871
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:38,221
after working at the exhibition.

872
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:46,771
All right. Thank you all for waiting.

873
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:49,130
He's the pride of our university...

874
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:50,870
and also the most sought-after artist now.

875
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:52,611
Let me introduce Sculptor Jay.

876
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:48,731
Do you remember the
title of the piece we saw?

877
00:56:50,331 --> 00:56:51,431
The title...

878
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,371
It was "Destiny."

879
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,371
No one knows from where and
in what form destiny will come.

880
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,940
What do you think...

881
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:06,151
is the probability of all
these coincidences...

882
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:08,281
falling into place?

883
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:13,051
Hello.

884
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,791
I'm an alumnus of Yein University.

885
00:57:15,051 --> 00:57:16,561
And I'm the guest lecturer of today.

886
00:57:17,221 --> 00:57:19,091
I'm Sculptor Jay.

887
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:22,391
(Lecture by Sculptor Jay)

888
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:40,050
First of all, the focal length...

889
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:42,151
is measured in millimetres.

890
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:45,581
With a short focal length,
the field of view will be wide.

891
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:47,951
With a long focal length...

892
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:06,171
How irritating.

893
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:08,171
I'll get going.

894
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,911
I settled my debt.

895
00:58:11,941 --> 00:58:13,551
There is no reason for
us to see each other now.

896
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:33,501
Hey, what's wrong with you?

897
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:56,791
Yeol.

898
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:19,411
Where is he going?

899
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:39,571
Are you surprised?

900
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:42,401
I didn't tell you on purpose,
so I could surprise you.

901
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,401
So you were Sculptor Jay.

902
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:46,611
Are you disappointed?

903
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:48,211
Because I'm him?

904
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,241
No. This is impressive.

905
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:54,381
I feel like there's an
invisible wall between us now.

906
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:56,151
Is that so?

907
00:59:58,351 --> 00:59:59,921
I feel like we're closer now.

908
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:07,261
Hold on.

909
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,091
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

910
01:01:09,591 --> 01:01:10,591
Too bad.

911
01:01:12,121 --> 01:01:14,761
Pardon? What do you mean?

912
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,161
I...

913
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:20,401
need to keep seeing you.

914
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:35,870
(Crushology 101)

915
01:02:35,871 --> 01:02:38,641
What if those guys say they like you?

916
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:40,211
Does he...

917
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,120
really like me?

918
01:02:44,121 --> 01:02:45,251
Isn't that Bani?

919
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:48,250
Then does it mean you guys are dating now?

920
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:50,391
Well, he didn't ask me out officially.

921
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:54,161
Do I look better with my hair down or up?

922
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:56,431
A predetermined destiny...

923
01:02:57,161 --> 01:02:58,161
can be good...

924
01:02:58,761 --> 01:03:00,131
or bad.

925
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:02,171
This is about Ban Hee Jin.

926
01:03:02,771 --> 01:03:04,101
We can't let Ban Hee Jin and Jo Ah Lang...

927
01:03:04,901 --> 01:03:06,071
see each other.
