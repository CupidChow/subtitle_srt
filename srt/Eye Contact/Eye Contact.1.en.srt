1
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,227
My name is Nu

2
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm basically a nobody

3
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,025
You wouldn't see me in a crowd

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,193
And why is that?

5
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,953
This big thick glasses

6
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,081
make it hard to be approached by anyone.

7
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,584
Statistically speaking, we nerd-looking people

8
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,878
are usually not the most noticeable.

9
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,089
Which is actually good

10
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,383
I don't really like to mingle with people anyway

11
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,218
I want to lay low, being a nobody like this

12
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,554
all the way through college.

13
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,849
But, that fortune-teller said.......

14
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,685
You are going to be a smoking hot guy.

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,855
Me?, with this big-old glasses?

16
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,356
Yeah

17
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,191
You have a pair of seductive eyes.

18
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,819
People are going to fall for them,

19
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,404
just wait and see.

20
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,905
Wait for what?

21
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,869
Once you have encountered 3 misfortunes

22
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,247
then your life will turn completely different.

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,791
And why must it be after the unfortunate events?

24
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,585
Can't it just turn good right now?

25
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,798
These fortune-teller are just making things up,

26
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,175
because this life of mine had been written.

27
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,595
Nobody can just change it.

28
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:09,814
HEY!!

29
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,859
Shit!

30
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,155
Where did you learn how to drive?

31
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,323
This is the campus's road,

32
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
not a fucking race circuit.

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,160
You're responsible for this!

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,828
You made my life unfortunate before I even started my class!

35
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,705
Misfortune 1!

36
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,248
You're not even going to come down?

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,375
Ok!

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,544
People who don't admit their wrongdoing

39
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,755
are those that failed to listen to their parents' teaching!

40
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,715
I gotta teach you something myself!

41
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,009
You're really not going to come down,ha?

42
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,678
Alright!

43
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't care

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,581
who the hell do you think you are.

45
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,832
You are going to.......

46
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,668
Hey!...what the hell are you doing?

47
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,002
Let me go!

48
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,671
Hey!

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,214
Where are you taking me?

50
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:17,924
I'm not going!

51
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,133
Where are you taking me?

52
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,134
What are you doing?

53
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,511
Heyyy!

54
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,680
Shut up !!!

55
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,119
How long are you going to stare at me?

56
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,371
Fine, whatever.

57
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,415
I know I'm handsome.

58
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,583
Feel free to stare

59
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,626
I won't charge

60
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,756
Did you forget to take your drugs?

61
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,883
Is it why you are hallucinating that you are handsome?

62
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,553
Well, if you are not looking at me for my handsomeness

63
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,638
then why are you looking at me for?

64
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,101
And why are you bringing me here?

65
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,646
What are you doing?

66
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,148
Dressing your wound.

67
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,816
That's hurt!

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,484
Let me go!

69
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,319
Ouch, that's hurt!

70
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,282
it hurts!

71
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,408
zip it!

72
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,076
It hurts, you know?

73
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,799
Alright, that's it.

74
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,385
Now get you ass out of my car.

75
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:45,636
Hah?

76
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,558
Is this how doctors treat patient?

77
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm studying medicine

78
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,561
I'm not a doctor

79
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,692
You really going to have me walk back to my faculty?

80
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,736
That's your problem

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,738
not mine

82
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,782
now go!

83
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,830
If you're not getting out

84
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,334
I'm going to kick your ass out!

85
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,211
I don't know how to open this!

86
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,216
Go!

87
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,856
Damn bad-mannered doctor!

88
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,359
I'm going to be late

89
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,693
You!

90
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,237
Hey you!

91
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,446
What the hell is it now?

92
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,489
You!

93
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,334
Are you from faculty of art?

94
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,461
Are you talking to me?

95
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah, I'm talking to you

96
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,637
well...

97
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,556
Yes, I am

98
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,682
How did you know?

99
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:13,808
Hah...

100
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,937
A good looking guy like me

101
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,856
is easily recognizable by the entire freshman year.

102
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,024
Ahhh

103
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,902
Sorry, I realy don't know who you are.

104
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,572
And which are you major in?

105
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,531
English

106
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,448
English?

107
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:30,741
English, really?

108
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,618
Didn't you know

109
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,079
that the first lesson of the freshman year

110
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,622
is always Prof. Ratsami's class.

111
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,790
And I'm telling you what

112
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,625
She is really tough!

113
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,085
Just one minute late

114
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,295
she's going to deduct your points like crazy.

115
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,379
Really?

116
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,380
True

117
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,175
I've been deducted myself.

118
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,427
Let's go, I'll get you there in time,

119
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,309
Well

120
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,060
thank you

121
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,605
Anyway, what's your name?

122
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,106
Chain

123
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,804
Hey!

124
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,723
stop right there.

125
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,980
You can't sit.

126
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,440
Until you give a reason,

127
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,275
why you are late.

128
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,654
And if the reason is not good enough.

129
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,698
I will deduct your points.

130
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,952
Which may eventually affect your grades.

131
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,412
Well I was...

132
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,039
As an English major.

133
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,208
Please speak English.

134
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,504
I got hit by a car in the university.

135
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:12,051
I had to go get my wound taken care of at the
University Clinic.

136
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,012
That why I got here late.

137
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,890
Here is the evidence.

138
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,893
Hmm..

139
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,938
You have backed your words with proof

140
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,774
Therefore, I will not deduct your points today

141
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,359
But if there is ever another time!

142
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,778
Whether it'd be you or anyone else in this class

143
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,947
who are late for class.

144
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,657
Punishment will be 20 points deduction!

145
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,078
Whoaaa...20 points?

146
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,289
Hah...

147
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,250
Hmm...

148
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,336
Your English is pretty good

149
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,338
Have you studied abroad?

150
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,966
No, ma'am

151
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,800
Umm...

152
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,012
If not, and you speak that well

153
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,432
I might have to give out some As this year.

154
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,018
After quite a long time not giving one out.

155
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,144
Be seated

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,481
Alright, let's continue

157
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,089
In one month time

158
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,008
there will be an election for class's president.

159
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,594
We must submit one representative

160
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,346
from our 6/2 class

161
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,722
to run for that position.

162
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,724
As you all may aware

163
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,352
The class president title for 3 years in a row,

164
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,562
has always been from 6/2.

165
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,731
Therefore this year

166
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,399
the class President title

167
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,026
must be won again by.....

168
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,195
6/2

169
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,324
Everyone, more energy please

170
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,702
this doesn't sound like 6/2 at all.

171
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,037
One more time then

172
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,246
must be won by.....

173
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,499
6/2

174
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,126
everyone!

175
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,586
be more energetic

176
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,213
must be won by.....

177
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,507
6/2

178
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,140
I would like to volunteer to run for our class.

179
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,521
Err...

180
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
What did you just say?

181
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,942
I would like to volunteer to be the representative.

182
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,195
I wanted to be the class president.

183
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,280
Can't I?

184
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,284
There is no rule against that

185
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,744
However...

186
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,995
are you really sure about it?

187
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,914
I have never been more sure.

188
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,920
Shouldn't there be any kind approval first?

189
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,549
Then, anyone in favor of

190
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,967
Gundam

191
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,594
being our class representative to run for the title?

192
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,772
Who would support this kind of guy?

193
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,609
I can guarantee there will be nobody in favor, 200%

194
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,862
right?

195
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,697
True hah?

196
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,202
Here it is

197
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,913
My approver

198
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,833
So no problem now?

199
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,391
Students, you will write after me

200
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,067
We cannot let Gundam runs on our class's behalf

201
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,202
He's not only an asshole, but also a dumbass.

202
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,706
It's a waste of 6/2's good name to have him run.

203
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,962
But we can't just throw him out as long as he has a supporter, he can run.

204
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,052
Well then, If we can't stop him from running

205
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,222
Then we find someone to run against him!

206
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,017
Yep, that's it

207
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,688
Problem is, who's gonna run against him?

208
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,566
Yeahhh

209
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,949
Hey both of you

210
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,951
do you want to be in our workgroup?

211
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,494
Come to my group instead

212
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,039
I can guarantee you won't have to work

213
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,875
If you come to my group, you don't need to work.

214
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,168
Just give me your number and that's enough.

215
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,548
If you invite us just because you think my friend is a beauty

216
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,840
go and get someone else.

217
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,177
We can work on our own.

218
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,595
Let's go Lin

219
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,903
You, you there

220
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,824
Do you want to work with my group

221
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,243
Sure, come sit over here.

222
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,483
Ohh

223
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,861
Don't you have a seat?

224
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,864
Well, no

225
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,990
then

226
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,075
why don't you come join me?

227
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
P'Chain

228
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,082
yes

229
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,252
It seems like you are quite famous

230
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,046
A little

231
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,009
There, right over there.

232
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,469
Er

233
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,597
Isn't that room reserved for faculty's prom kings and queens?

234
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,644
Kings,queens or any other regular students.

235
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,480
everyone has the same right.

236
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,565
come

237
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,195
here

238
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,281
I got you someone to join your groupwork.

239
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,868
And how did you know he hasn't got a group yet?

240
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,870
Umm

241
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,914
Top-of-class like him

242
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,624
must have lines of people asking him to join.

243
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,960
In every first class of Prof.Ratsami

244
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,296
she would split you all in groups like every year.

245
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,799
My guess is

246
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,842
you don't have any one asking yet right?

247
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,930
No, not yet.

248
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,975
Good, then please work with my sister.

249
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,937
I don't trust any other men around here.

250
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,401
Heyy

251
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,361
introduce yourselves

252
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,405
so you guys can get acquainted.

253
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh

254
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,824
Er...my name is Ploy

255
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,033
She's Lin

256
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,327
We both went to the same school.

257
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,038
Speaking of that, me and Lin

258
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,707
have been in the same class since primary school.

259
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,335
Now, see

260
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,840
this is why everyone thinks I'm muted and unfriendly.

261
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,468
In reality, you beat me to every conversations.

262
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,097
Alright, I'll let princess Lin say now.

263
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,307
I'll zip my mouth shut.

264
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,561
My name is Lin

265
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,271
I'm Chain's sister.

266
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566
I'm...Nu.

267
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,237
Well...when you answered the professor earlier in the class.

268
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,781
that was really impressive.

269
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,284
Yeah...teach us please.

270
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,162
I want to have a chance to get A from Prof.Ratsami.

271
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,040
Then both of you should stick to Nu.

272
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,418
You will definitely get a good grade.

273
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,799
So.....I'll leave you guys together then.

274
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,807
Wowwww!!

275
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,559
Look, our handsome seniors.

276
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,644
Awww...so handsome.

277
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,520
Omg!

278
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,742
Why did all the prom kings came here today?

279
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,327
So handsome.

280
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:03,999
Where the fuck is he?

281
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,667
Where is he?

282
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,628
Calm down, Jon

283
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,755
This is the canteen.

284
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,757
Get a hold of yourself

285
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,386
No.......it ends today for me and that asshole.

286
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,138
I think...

287
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:23,143
I found you someone that deserves your rage more that that snake of a friend.

288
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,398
Is it good?

289
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,068
This curry rice is also pretty good.

290
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,328
Hey..P'Sun,P'Jon, P'Zak, P'Man

291
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,498
Hi there, Lin

292
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,794
Hello

293
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,003
What's going on with you guys?

294
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:55,384
We're just here to find our old friend.

295
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,056
P'Chain didn't came to have lunch with us.

296
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,724
That's weird

297
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,269
A person who is very protective of his sister

298
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,564
wouldn't let you dine out here all alone

299
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,983
on the first day of the semester.

300
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,154
I have my friends with me here.

301
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,867
No need to always be stuck on to my brother.

302
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,535
then...

303
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,163
can we sit here with you too.

304
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,751
You guys can take this table, I'll go to another table.

305
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,547
It's fine

306
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:39,136
Just tell Chain that we all miss him.

307
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,264
The campus is not that big

308
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,474
definitely not too big that we won't run into him.

309
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,144
So just tell him for us then.

310
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:48,687
Let's go

311
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
So, you are in faculty of art?

312
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,661
Must be a long way this morning

313
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,013
Hmm...

314
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,556
fake

315
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,310
This one is also fake

316
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,898
You look like a nice person, but you are really bad-mannered.

317
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,695
Oh wow

318
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,240
You seems to target every single types of girls ha?

319
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,909
even learn how to cook, hmm

320
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,537
Let me see how fake you can be.

321
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,249
The food that I like to make?

322
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,709
Salad, I guess

323
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,920
It may look simple to make

324
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,714
but it's can raise some "Wow" factor.

325
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,637
Umm

326
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,099
Is it enough for this.

327
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,602
Just a bit more

328
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,526
to make a good presentation

329
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,570
you must pay attention to small details.

330
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,990
put your heart into it

331
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,743
like this

332
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,542
you seems to be hungry

333
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,378
you didn't say a word

334
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,883
I'm not doing this

335
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,593
I'm not hungry

336
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,680
But Nu

337
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,100
you made me hungry.

338
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,237
Hey!

339
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,780
What the hell are you doing?

340
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,491
I was about to

341
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,787
eat you.

342
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:48,909
Hey!

343
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,251
Was I dreaming?

344
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,173
I was just watching the video.

345
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,551
and you can cause me to daydream like this?

346
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,639
You are so scary!

347
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,598
Damn you doctor Sun.

348
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,901
Hey

349
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,569
enough

350
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,447
You have Lab work tomorrow morning

351
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,407
you shouldn't be drunk.

352
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,246
How can you not let me get drunk

353
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,623
my heart was broken.

354
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,583
Yeah...we all know

355
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,920
Tonight you can drink all you want for your Ex

356
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,296
Tomorrow you will be finding a new one.

357
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,549
A handsome guy such as you,

358
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,175
won't be hard to find a new girl

359
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,344
why would be sad for ha?

360
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,722
You listen to me

361
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,351
I'm not sad about my Ex

362
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,562
But I'm in enraged

363
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,273
that Chain stole my girlfriend.

364
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,484
I trusted him

365
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,737
and this is what he do to me

366
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,199
This is fuck up!

367
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,746
Hey Sun

368
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,083
You think like me, right?

369
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,545
You have been there before

370
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,927
Both of you, look after him

371
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,095
I'm going to the toilet

372
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,890
Don't let him start a fight with anyone

373
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,601
tomorrow he have an early class.

374
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,483
Jon

375
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,569
let's toast

376
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,196
damn man

377
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,431
Hey Chain

378
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,683
Oh hey, Sun

379
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,520
Aoy, this is my buddy Chain.

380
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,731
He is my most trusted friend here.

381
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,526
Congratulation, Aoy

382
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,696
If Sun called someone a girlfriend

383
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,615
that means he really loves that person.

384
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,992
you can believe me

385
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,788
No ones know him like I do

386
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,872
isn't that right?

387
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,423
Nice to meet you Aoy.

388
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,012
Nice to meet you too.

389
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,480
Ahh...P'Chain

390
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,489
P'Chain...

391
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,742
P'Chain

392
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,665
being nice to me like this, what do you want from me?

393
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,876
Nope

394
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,003
I just want to ask

395
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,590
about you and P'Sun.

396
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,841
What's going on?

397
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,096
Why you all became enemy all of a sudden.

398
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,560
There's nothing going on.

399
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,647
It's not a big deal.

400
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,357
Don't think about it.

401
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,319
I just don't want you to have problem with them.

402
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,447
There is only two of us now.

403
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,910
If something happened to you, how will I be?

404
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:36,881
Hey

405
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,008
what do you think of my poster?

406
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,637
lame....

407
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,266
Hey!

408
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,479
Your poster is not interesting.

409
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,150
I think you should remove all these stupid stickers

410
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,110
and it should be better.

411
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,155
If you put it like that, why don't you just throw it into garbage.

412
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,532
well then...

413
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,160
you should really throw it away

414
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,286
Alright

415
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,495
Hell, nahhhhhhh

416
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,540
Don't you see how much effort I put into this?

417
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,255
Then......make it more interesting.

418
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,799
OK

419
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
Do it

420
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,303
Here, add some dinosaur.

421
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,358
Oh...some boats

422
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,110
Whoa.....some dinosaur.

423
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,161
Wow......

424
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,706
You are really good with this.

425
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,666
very good

426
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:57,795
I got an idea

427
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,091
You are now my campaign runner for the election!

428
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,219
Wait a sec......

429
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,430
since when did I ask for that job?

430
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,060
Since you designed my poster here

431
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,645
therefore

432
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,440
it means you want to help me!

433
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,650
I didn't wanted to

434
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,277
You asked me to do it!

435
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,323
Whether it's because I asked or you volunteered willingly,

436
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,661
in the end you designed my new poster here.

437
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,039
Therefore, you are now in my team.

438
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,627
Err.........can I turn this down?

439
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,503
No,you can't

440
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,632
From now on, you are my number 2 guy.

441
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,508
Well done

442
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,636
I'm proud to have sit right next to you for so long.

443
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,264
I finally now see your full potential.

444
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,821
Damn you!

445
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,325
Frong!

446
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,452
I'm gonna kick your ass.

447
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,685
Frong!

448
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,938
Why would you run for the class president against me?

449
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,857
We are in the same homeroom.

450
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,401
I didn't want to apply for it.

451
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,194
Don't act like you don't mean it.

452
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,779
you are trying to undermine me right?

453
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,116
Why would I do that?

454
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,119
why...you are trying to stop me from successfully become the president.

455
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,830
If you are really up for it

456
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,665
why would you be scare of a little competition?

457
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,709
I'm not afraid of anyone,

458
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,003
I'm afraid of you!

459
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,797
What part of me that you are afraid of?

460
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,424
Well...

461
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,926
you are better than me in classes.

462
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,637
way more friendly and well-mannered.

463
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,929
way more people like you.

464
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,973
If you run for the president.....

465
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,308
I will stand no chance to win.

466
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,810
Well, if you know that

467
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,270
then you should withdraw.

468
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,691
Now that our real competitor

469
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,151
is willing to run.

470
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,781
If you realized you can't win

471
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,367
then don't run for it, it's a waste of time.

472
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:39,415
So....this is all your plan?

473
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,002
We just want to protect the good name of our room

474
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,380
of room 6/2, that's it.

475
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,923
Because the title of class president

476
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,216
is not something to take lightly.

477
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,842
Not just anybody can be one.

478
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,847
And what makes the 3 of you think I'm not worthy?

479
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,101
You might love to be one,

480
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,436
but you lack the capabilities to even compete.

481
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,940
It's a waste of effort, Gundam.

482
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,862
Just withdraw and let Frong run as our representative

483
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,864
save us and you from all the trouble.

484
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,283
No way!

485
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,952
I'm not withdrawing.

486
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,039
Read my lips, no way!

487
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,709
I'll prove to you guys

488
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,919
that I can be the class president!

489
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,213
Without needing your help!

490
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,424
As for you

491
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:30,925
Frong

492
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,219
this is not over!

493
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,030
Every man is this world is the same

494
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,868
they all revolve around beautiful girls.

495
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,706
You maybe just the one exception.

496
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,252
You are the first man that didn't cause me trouble.

497
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,337
What kind of trouble?

498
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,716
See that?

499
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,218
That's our cue.

500
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,140
I think I'm going to be the most hated by all the mens in this college.

501
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,811
All the mens may hate you, but your friend loves you that should be enough.

502
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,814
If all the men hate me, how can i get a boyfriend?

503
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:29,859
Friend...

504
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,278
cannot fulfill that role, you know.

505
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,578
You should hurry and go research on Prof.Ratsami's assignment.

506
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,039
I'll take care of this and go find you.

507
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,217
I'm sorry......that's my seat.

508
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,762
You are clearly worry about her.

509
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,270
Where is it.....

510
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,778
Chain was

511
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,447
nowhere to be found at the faculty of art.

512
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,617
he went and stay at the social development's club.

513
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,869
That's doesn't seem like him at all.

514
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,288
Is he really afraid of us that much?

515
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,874
Well, he really did made a mess.

516
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,626
I wouldn't be surprise if he's scared.

517
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,004
That's why he deserves what's coming!

518
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,591
so he can feel the pain that he had caused

519
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,135
Do you have a plan?

520
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:38,886
I do

521
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,472
He can kept hiding forever.

522
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,642
And once I found him

523
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,687
I will make sure he gets it!

524
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,359
Hello, Lin, Ploy?

525
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,028
Nu, you got something?

526
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,279
Where are you guys now?

527
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:39,655
Hey!

528
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,660
Ohh, he hung up.

529
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,414
Don't you know

530
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,124
that eavesdropping

531
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,293
is rude!

532
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,838
Misfortune 2!

533
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,804
Why is my college life must be this tough?

534
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,059
What's wrong with you 4-eyes?

535
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,522
Leave me alone!

536
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,232
Oops

537
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,828
Did you just kissed me?

538
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,830
That was an accident

539
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,123
who would have wanted to kiss you?

540
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,042
But you fucking kissed me!

541
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,627
That was my first kiss!

542
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,422
Why must my first kiss be with an asshole like you!

543
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,173
Damn!!!

544
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,385
Why every time I ran into you, misfortunes came with it!

545
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,054
Can you just stop messing with me

546
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,639
you damn bad-luck-bringing doctor.

547
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:32,727
That way...

548
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,146
hell...

549
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,257
Err...

550
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,761
I'm sorry, I must be in a wrong class.

551
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,387
Wait wait wait

552
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,766
You...

553
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,017
Are you an English major?

554
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,560
Ahh...yes

555
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,686
wow.....

556
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,356
I got it now professor, I got it.

557
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,486
What's your name?

558
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,821
Did you take Basic English class with me?

559
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,948
Why haven't I seen you before?

560
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,909
Ah...I'm Nu

561
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,786
one with the big glasses

562
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,037
Nu...

563
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,997
the one that speaks really good english?

564
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,665
And where are your glasses?

565
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,545
Ahh..I broke them earlier.

566
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,922
Is this really Nu?

567
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,257
You are quite handsome!

568
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,510
Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror?

569
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,053
and see that without the glasses

570
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,679
you are really good-looking.

571
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:52,723
So

572
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,767
this freshman

573
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,186
Nu who used to wear glasses

574
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,105
from now on, no more glasses,

575
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,272
I will sponsor

576
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,024
all your contact lenses to wear.

577
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,154
What is all this about?

578
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,448
Ohh......this is Chang

579
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,534
He is in junior yeah of our faculty.

580
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,370
He came here today to find the competitor for freshman's prom king.

581
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,664
hey...no need to be confused

582
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,875
We already got Lin as the prom queen competitor.

583
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,546
As for the king, I think it's you.

584
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,632
Prom kind and queen?

585
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,341
Aha

586
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,051
Me?

587
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,302
Yep

588
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,554
It's you

589
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,139
Err...

590
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,058
I didn't really want to compete.

591
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,101
Ahhhh

592
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,394
no need to be afraid.

593
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:43,524
I will be right by your side for the whole period.

594
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,484
with Prof.Ratsami

595
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,028
as head of our faculty's activities

596
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,530
to help give guidance.

597
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,823
No need to be afraid Nu.

598
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,907
Umm...

599
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,537
Believe me, there is nothing to be afraid if we compete together.

600
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,583
Yes...that's right

601
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,668
True

602
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,919
Please,Nu. Please

603
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,756
Alright, I'm in.

604
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,975
Why is of all the sudden

605
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,561
both of my friends become the prom king and queen?

606
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,398
I'm not surprise with you.

607
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,567
But you!

608
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,570
since you broke your glasses.

609
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,113
What the hell kind of magic this is?

610
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,449
Yeah

611
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,117
Don't tell me that

612
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,328
you were wearing those glasses as a cover of this.

613
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,079
To protect your real looks?

614
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,040
So you don't shine out?

615
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,751
Who would have done that P'Chain?

616
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,002
That sounds like me

617
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,799
Err.....I wear glasses because of my bad vision.

618
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,887
With your glasses broken,

619
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,013
it must be really hard.

620
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,223
It's fine.

621
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,141
I got my contact lenses at home.

622
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,560
That's good

623
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,145
Let's celebrate tonight!

624
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,855
Hmm...

625
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,523
You're just finding excuses to get drunk.

626
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,945
Err...well..

627
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,279
Don't say no.

628
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,451
Let people see your good looks

629
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,911
understand?

630
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,039
let's go preapre.

631
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,207
Ok.....let's go

632
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,251
I'll see you tonight.

633
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,717
P'Chain

634
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,053
I was at the library earlier today,

635
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:39,223
and I overheard Sun and his crew talking.

636
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,267
They were...

637
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,228
planing a revenge on you.

638
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,312
I don't really know

639
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,023
what's the beef between you and them.

640
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,111
Bu I really want you to be careful.

641
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,489
Don't you worry

642
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,410
Those rich kids got nothing on me.

643
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,953
They were just running their mouths.

644
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,874
But I really appreciate that you worry about my safety.

645
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,804
Here are your spare glases, master.

646
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,807
You can wear it out tonight.

647
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,933
Err......

648
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,852
I think I will wear my contact lenses now.

649
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,271
changing things out a bit.

650
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,231
Are you debuting, master?

651
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,984
I just want to try not to wear glasses.

652
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,029
Everything else is still the same, as we agreed.

653
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,947
So......

654
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,408
I will drop you off at the campus.

655
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,534
No

656
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,160
And...

657
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,164
if your father calls, should I report him where you go?

658
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,833
Just tell dad I'm at the club.

659
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,459
And...

660
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,128
how about if your mother calls from abroad?

661
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,892
Tell mom I go for a study at my friend's place.

662
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,894
Give her just name, no last name.

663
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,730
And no location pin.

664
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,899
So she can't look into them.

665
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:13,650
Yes, master.

666
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:22,743
Master

667
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,453
here

668
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,270
What the......

669
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,489
Don't tell me that.....

670
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,032
last night......
