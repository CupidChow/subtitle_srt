1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,880
This player over here said that...

2
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,000
he wouldn't get into
a long-term relationship.

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,160
I just wanna get even with Chain.

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,080
He took my partner from me.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I just wanna take
someone precious from him in return.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,560
Just who are you, really?

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,040
The person you just called

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,800
is Mr. Narut Hemwipat,

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
son of Padej Hemwipat.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,480
He's the owner of this condo.

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,120
As your campaign assistant,

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,240
I've figured out a way to help you.

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,240
Master.

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Master...

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,720
Uh...

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,160
How did you get here?

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm here to check up on you

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,080
to see how you are doing.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,680
Seeing you like this...

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
I guess there's nothing to worry about,
is there?

21
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,160
Uh...

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Where's Sun, by the way?

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,440
He said he had a lab class in the morning,

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,840
so he told me to wake you up
for your class.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm not in a hurry today.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,720
My class starts in the afternoon.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,960
After class,

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,960
you have to go and see your father, too.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
See my father?

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Today?

31
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,360
Did he tell you
what he wants to talk to me about?

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,760
He only said that

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,200
it was a matter

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,360
of the utmost importance.

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
Hey, hey.

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,520
Did anybody here see
that last-minute campaign poll?

37
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,120
Of course, I did.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,360
The three of us
did the survey ourselves, no?

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,560
What were the results?

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
Did it go beyond our expectations?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
Of course,
it was way beyond my expectations.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Girls from Grades 7 to 12 preferred Frong.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,480
80% of Class 12/2 preferred him, as well.

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,200
This means that we've already won, right?

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Hey.

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,040
Have you seen that "last-second" poll?

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,790
Of course, I have.

48
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,640
I've heard that 80%
of boys across Grades 7 to 12

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,000
preferred you, right?

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,520
That means that I'm in the lead, right?

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
Aren't I, Frong?

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,120
How would I know?

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
Huh? Why did you say that?

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Between the boys and girls here,

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,880
which group has the higher population?

56
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,800
Don't think about that, Frong.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,720
An inferior poll like that is unreliable.

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,600
Is the one that you conducted reliable?

59
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,640
Of course, it's better than yours.

60
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,210
Based on the one we've conducted,

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,720
nobody preferred you.

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,520
Honestly, nobody even remembers

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,470
that you, too, are running
for student president.

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
That means...

65
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,880
you've already lost
before the game even started,

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
isn't that right?

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,320
Why did you have to say that
to him, though?

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,840
We don't want him
to waste his precious time.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,120
If he knows that he's losing,

70
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,200
he should've just given up

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,520
so that he can move on to something else.

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Gundam is not gonna lose

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,840
because I'm gonna help him
become student president.

74
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
What's wrong?

75
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,880
Nothing.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,280
I'm just...

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,800
slacking off.

78
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,360
Working on the stage is exhausting.

79
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,680
Don't tell me that you're also slacking.

80
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,560
No.

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I just wanna check up on you.

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,000
For what?

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
I...

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm worried that you'd get torn apart
by what those girls said.

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm good.

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,000
Have you ever heard of
the Thai saying that goes,

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,920
"The santol fruit becomes
sweeter the more it's beaten"?

88
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,960
It's just like me.

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,480
The more I'm looked down upon,
the stronger I'll become!

90
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,260
Sheesh.

91
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,480
Where did you get that old saying from?

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,360
My mouth's watering hearing of that fruit.

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,040
- That means you wanna have one.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
I've been studying a lot lately

95
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,320
so that one day,
I'll get to be better than you.

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
You're already better than me.

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,520
You and your compliments...

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,080
At any rate, thank you

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,200
for worrying about my feelings.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,930
With pleasure.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,400
Now that you're out here,

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,880
why not stick around
and slack off with me?

103
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Mm.

104
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,590
That sounds good.

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm done listening to those girls anyway.

106
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,480
Wanna listen to music?

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,400
I came across a song, you see.

108
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,920
Maybe it helps you clear your mind.

109
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Here.

110
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,680
Is it an old song like that saying?

111
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,080
Give it a listen.

112
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,760
Gosh.

113
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,710
Dad usually doesn't book
a restaurant for anyone.

114
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Is something wrong?

115
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,960
Your clue is as good as mine.

116
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,200
He directly called me,
saying that it's an urgent matter.

117
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,520
Dad's gonna kill me for this.

118
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
Good evening, Mr. Nu.

119
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, it's been so long, hasn't it?

120
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,200
You've grown!

121
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
You're quite adorable yourself.

122
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,640
Your eyes are as gorgeous
as your mother's.

123
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
Master.

124
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,840
This is Mr. Danai and Dr. Orn,

125
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
your father's close acquaintances.

126
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Good evening.

127
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,720
And this is Sun, our son.

128
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,280
Do you remember him?

129
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,760
You often played with him
when you were little.

130
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,960
Now, he's studying
at the same college as you.

131
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,440
Hey, Nu.

132
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,120
Please stay still, Mr. Patient.

133
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,720
Let me tend to your wound.

134
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,800
You're bleeding, too.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,640
Let me tend to your wound.

136
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,150
Uh...

137
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,560
- Oh?
- Master?

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
Are you sick?

139
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,160
You can tell me if you need help.
I'm a doctor.

140
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,190
It's okay.

141
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
Let me use the toilet real quick.

142
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,760
Sure.

143
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,730
Let me help you get there.

144
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,550
Master, your father is here.

145
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,800
How's it going?

146
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,760
Give me a hug.

147
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,320
- How are you?
- Oh, my goodness.

148
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Hey.

149
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,120
If I didn't tell you this is urgent,

150
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,760
you wouldn't have come to see me, right?

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,960
Come on.

152
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,570
The work that you've given me
is that simple, huh?

153
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
It's a shame

154
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,960
that I can't trust others.

155
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,160
I've had my people
look into you for a while now.

156
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm sorry for doing this,

157
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,600
but it is necessary.

158
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
I need someone

159
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,240
who I can trust.

160
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,480
Actually,

161
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,280
it's my fault

162
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,160
for messing with that actor.

163
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,560
That minor incident

164
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
shouldn't get you into hot water, right?

165
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,040
It didn't get me into trouble, no.

166
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,080
My wife, however,

167
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,320
wanted a divorce.

168
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
She said

169
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,230
she couldn't tolerate my womanizing.

170
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,870
More importantly,

171
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,880
she said she wanted to cut ties
with my sons.

172
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,200
That's when you decided
to become a better man?

173
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,400
Of course.

174
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,640
That's why I want to change her mind.

175
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,480
You're seeing Mom?

176
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Yes.

177
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,520
I want to make it up to her

178
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,880
so that she can forgive me.

179
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,840
I don't know how long it'd take, though.

180
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,400
Please take care of him on my behalf.

181
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,960
What about Ruj, Dad?

182
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,840
He's coming with me.

183
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
He's Mom's only trusting bodyguard.

184
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
He might be able to help me.

185
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,760
And you, kid,

186
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,680
please take care of my son,

187
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,720
for you are his senior.

188
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,320
I know that you've got good grades,

189
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,400
are well-behaved,

190
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,350
and are one of the top students
at the college.

191
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,960
I believe that

192
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,600
you can help him have an easier time
getting along with other people,

193
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,280
as all he wants
is to be alone all the time.

194
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,920
I'm worried that
he won't have any friends.

195
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,840
I promise I'll take care of Nu

196
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,760
the best I can.

197
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,640
For us, Mr. Nu has always felt like
a part of our family.

198
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,240
No need to worry.

199
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
We will take care of him.

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Thanks.

201
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,680
Danai's family is great.

202
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
They will take care of you
better than I can.

203
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,760
Please come back as soon as possible, Dad.

204
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,880
Pray that Mom is less angry at me now.

205
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,320
You know that
she won't give in that easily.

206
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,920
No matter how hard I pray to God
to make her become softer,

207
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
I still don't know
if that can change her mind.

208
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,480
Then wish me luck.

209
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,640
Yes.

210
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,920
I don't want you and Mom to fall apart.

211
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,320
That kind of stuff

212
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
will not happen.

213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
I promise.

214
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,120
You have to come back home
with Mom and Not, okay?

215
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,000
Have there been any instances

216
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,760
in which I failed my promises?

217
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,720
Nu!

218
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,360
You look as lovely

219
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,360
as what I've heard!

220
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,240
Did you know that at my school,
rumor has it that

221
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,280
the king from the Faculty of Arts
is extremely good-looking?

222
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,920
I've tried snooping around your college
to see you so many times.

223
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Yet, I've never seen you with my own eyes.

224
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,480
It's such a blessing

225
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,920
to see you here at my house.

226
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,200
This is Benja, my younger sister.

227
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,120
She's studying at
the college's demonstration school.

228
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,800
Please take good care of me, Benja.

229
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,680
No need to say that.

230
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,480
I've always wanted to take care of you
as best as I can!

231
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,720
Don't get overly excited there.

232
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,560
He's such a lovely man, though.

233
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,880
Why are you messing with us?

234
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,280
You wanna have him all by yourself?

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,400
He's a junior at my college.

236
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm his senior,
so it's my job to take care of him.

237
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
Now, now.

238
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,520
Apologies for the commotion, Mr. Nu.

239
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,040
These two are always fighting.

240
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,960
It's okay. This is heartwarming.

241
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,280
You must be missing Not and your mother
living overseas, correct?

242
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes.

243
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,760
By the way,

244
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,200
you don't have to call me "Mr.,"

245
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,960
since I'm now part of the family.

246
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Of course. You're our future son-in-law.

247
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,800
You're so sweet, dear.

248
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,480
Let me give you a hug.

249
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,040
I've already prepared a room for you.

250
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,040
- Shall we check it out together?
- Sure.

251
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go...

252
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
- Let's get going.
- This way!

253
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Let's go!

254
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
Here it is.

255
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,120
This used to be Benja's bedroom.

256
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,520
She gave her bedroom up for you.

257
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,760
It might be a bit small,

258
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
but it sure is comfortable.

259
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,760
You said he'd be sharing the room
with me, though.

260
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Men can simply share the room.

261
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,680
Right?

262
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,840
Mr. Nu is our important guest.

263
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,040
We cannot have him
sharing the same room with you.

264
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,920
Everybody needs a private space.

265
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
You're a private person, though.

266
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,240
You're acting kinda weird, you know?

267
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,200
I really like this room.

268
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,120
Isn't that right?

269
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,760
You can treat this bedroom as yours, Nu.

270
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Sun.

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,840
Whoa!

272
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,320
How long have you been standing there?

273
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
Well, quite a while, actually.

274
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,760
Why were you that scared?

275
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,640
Sneaking around the house like this

276
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,480
scares just anybody.

277
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,480
I think the one who's sneaking around

278
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,160
is probably you.

279
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm grabbing some water.

280
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
Can you get some for me, then?

281
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,800
What?

282
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,280
You're asking me to do you a favor?

283
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,520
Well, I'm busy with work.

284
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,120
What work?

285
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
It's this:

286
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,400
student president's policy posters.

287
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,120
Aren't they gorgeous-looking?

288
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
You're gonna work here?

289
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,760
I always get them done here.

290
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,630
Is there a problem?

291
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,280
It's kinda dark here.

292
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,360
I'm worried that

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,480
your eyesight will go bad.

294
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,600
Since when have you been this caring?

295
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,760
I'm off getting us drinks, then.

296
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,920
Sun.

297
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,080
What now?

298
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,000
The staircase's this way.

299
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,880
Oh, I forgot.

300
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,240
What's up with him?

301
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,000
I hate to say this,

302
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,960
but Sun is absolutely stunning today.

303
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Where is he?

304
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,720
He was just right there.

305
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Where did he go?

306
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,920
Did I perform well?

307
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,440
Mm.

308
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,200
That was your response?

309
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,320
Were you even watching?

310
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,000
All you're looking at is your phone.

311
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,320
Something's going on?

312
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,400
Oh...

313
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,480
A celebrity couple just broke up.

314
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,760
Huh?

315
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,200
You're interested in this kind of stuff?

316
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,080
Well, I am sometimes.

317
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,000
Wait...

318
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,240
Where's Nu, by the way?

319
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,760
Weren't you guys practicing together?

320
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,920
He was behind me a while ago.

321
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,600
I don't know where he's off to, though.

322
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,360
Maybe he's in the toilet.

323
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Mm...

324
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,360
Are you hungry?

325
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
Let me get you something.

326
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm getting myself a drink anyway.

327
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm good.

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Make sure you're back ASAP

329
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
before the next practice session starts.

330
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,640
Mm.

331
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Hello, Chain.

332
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,280
You've seen the URL I sent you, right?

333
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,400
I have.

334
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm having someone look for the culprit.

335
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,080
I've already looked into it myself.

336
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,560
The page was created by a burner account.

337
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
Someone like us can't catch them.

338
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,600
What do we do now?

339
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,240
I'll deal with other stuff myself.

340
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,030
You just have to make sure that

341
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,880
Lin doesn't come across that page.

342
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,680
If she were to find out,

343
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,000
she'd be heartbroken.

344
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,400
I don't wanna see her cry again.

345
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,680
As long as I'm here,

346
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
she will never shed a tear.

347
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,400
Are Lin and Nu done with the practice?

348
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
The professor is giving them a break.

349
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
Lin is getting a drink.

350
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,600
As for Nu...

351
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
I don't know where he's off to.

352
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,520
He's not in the toilet either.

353
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,560
It's fine. I'll look for him myself.

354
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,960
Mm.

355
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,320
It's so peaceful
when nobody is at your house, isn't it?

356
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,920
I love it.

357
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
If you do,

358
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,560
you can just stay here forever
if you like.

359
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,520
Tell me how.

360
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,800
I'm already causing them so much trouble.

361
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,160
Just move in as...

362
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
a son-in-law.

363
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,600
Even though we're into each other,

364
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,360
others may not accept it.

365
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
I have faith in my family.

366
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
They'll accept you either way.

367
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm worried
that wouldn't be the case for my family.

368
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,800
Your dad probably understands
this kind of stuff.

369
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,040
His words carry no weight.

370
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,080
In my family, the one with the final say

371
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,400
is my mom.

372
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,040
Both of you have to study overseas

373
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,880
and live there with me.

374
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,280
Honey.

375
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,360
They're still kids, though.

376
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,480
We should wait for them
to get a bit older first.

377
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,400
It'll be hard for them to get adjusted.

378
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,960
Moreover, their accents
will be different from native speakers.

379
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,800
You have to study overseas nonetheless.

380
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,280
I don't wanna go, though.

381
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Me too.

382
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,040
I'm not asking for your opinion.

383
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,720
This is an order.

384
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,200
Did you know that

385
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,280
I was restlessly crying for 3 days

386
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,840
to the point that my dad begged her
to send me back to Thailand.

387
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,600
He then made a promise
to take care of me very well

388
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,960
so that I could come back here.

389
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,600
What about your brother?

390
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,240
He has to follow my mom's orders,

391
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,440
as he's the only one

392
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,080
my parents will pass
the whole business on to.

393
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,280
Despite that, I'm happy

394
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,800
that I get to be with you like this.

395
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,240
If that's the case,
can I ask you a favor?

396
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,200
What is it?

397
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,400
Can you fulfill my dreams?

398
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,440
I want to enjoy
a gorgeous sea view on a ship

399
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,880
with you.

400
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,520
Please make it happen.

401
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Please, please!

402
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,800
Please...

403
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Sure.

404
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,560
I'll make it come true.

405
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,480
Yay!

406
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,720
Doing it in the middle of the ocean...

407
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,440
sounds pretty good.

408
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,960
Sun!

409
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,400
I was just kidding.

410
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,160
But I'll do it for real.

411
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
Gosh!

412
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,080
What are you selling?

413
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm selling freshly squeezed orange juice.

414
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,160
Are you interested?

415
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,200
Is it actually fresh?

416
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,880
Or has it been left overnight

417
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
and sold today,

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,400
falsely claimed as freshly squeezed?

419
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
With that said, we'd like to have a sample

420
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,840
and see if it's actually fresh.

421
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,320
Yes, we'd like to have a sample first

422
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,560
if you don't mind.

423
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,840
Why did you do that?

424
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,240
Your orange juice isn't fresh.

425
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,200
We don't dare take a sip.

426
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,760
Each batch is made daily.

427
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,520
Quit lying to us.

428
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
Let's empty the whole batch!

429
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,360
What are you doing?

430
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't be so nosy.

431
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,080
Ah, the transaction's successful.

432
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,400
Mm.

433
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,840
If you manage to find any info
about who created that page,

434
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,480
I'll pay you double.

435
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
I wanna know who's behind it

436
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,840
so I can deal with them.

437
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,120
Easy.

438
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Hacking is my expertise.

439
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
I'll leave you to it, then.

440
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,680
No problem.

441
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Who was that?

442
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,360
Why did you pay him?

443
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,680
Uh...

444
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
I...

445
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
I asked him to fetch something for me.

446
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,560
Do you know that when you lie,

447
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,920
it's blatantly obvious, Ploy?

448
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
Tell me the truth.

449
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,720
It's got to do with me, right?

450
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,200
You and Chain have been acting
really weird.

451
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,360
Stay out of this.

452
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
I'll deal with it myself.

453
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,720
You can't just deal with my issues

454
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,240
while leaving me in the dark.

455
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,160
How much did you pay that guy?

456
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,120
Let me see.

457
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,120
Hey!

458
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,880
- I'll pay it back.
- No.

459
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,840
- Give it to me!
- Lin!

460
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,960
I told you I'll do it myself.

461
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,760
Have you forgotten the promise

462
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,240
that I'll take care of you?

463
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
I haven't.

464
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,440
But I'm not a kid anymore, Ploy.

465
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
That means...

466
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
you no longer want me to take care of you?

467
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,360
If you're carrying
all the burdens yourself

468
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,920
without telling me anything,

469
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,720
I can't afford to have you look after me,

470
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,800
let alone

471
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,280
have you as my friend.

472
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,840
Lin...

473
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't wanna take advantage of you, Ploy.

474
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
You...

475
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
You should have steered clear.

476
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,160
You always wanna make yourself cry.

477
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,920
I told you not to look at them.

478
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,520
I'm crying

479
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,800
not because of the hate I've received,

480
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,800
but because of the edited photos of me

481
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640
that make me look so awful.

482
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,280
Look at them.

483
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,520
Some photos are kinda creative, though.

484
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,240
Should I do one with both of us together?

485
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,400
I've got no problems with that,

486
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,160
but...

487
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,200
don't turn me into a ghost.

488
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,240
I'm scared.

489
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,600
Why are you crying?

490
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,960
Just let me be the only one crying.

491
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,480
I feel sorry for you.

492
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
This always happens to you.

493
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,280
Looking pretty doesn't always bring
happiness, right?

494
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
Do you think

495
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,920
the reason people hate me

496
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,320
is simply that I'm pretty?

497
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,840
Those people do it out of jealousy.

498
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,640
As for boys,
they might just be teasing you,

499
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,840
trying to get your attention.

500
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,600
What do you want me to do?

501
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
I can't just...

502
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,760
get plastic surgery
to make myself look worse.

503
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,560
You simply have to do nothing.

504
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,040
Just live a happy life.

505
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,280
I am happy

506
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,240
because I've got a friend like you.

507
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,640
Uh...

508
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,840
I'm delighted
to see you regain your confidence.

509
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,760
Now then, let's go and get some stuff

510
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,680
for the contest day.

511
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,840
Why is it that when you talk,

512
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,760
you tend to avoid looking at me?

513
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,400
Don't tell me that

514
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,360
you're flustered.

515
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,680
If you're being stared at like this,

516
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,040
doesn't your heart start racing?

517
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,040
How's that?

518
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,720
Serves you right.

519
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,400
You're also flustered.

520
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,160
Mm...

521
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,000
That's funny.

522
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,560
Why are we glowing
by looking at each other

523
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,280
despite being friends?

524
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,360
[Someone blocked my sunset shot]

525
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,920
You owe me big time.

526
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,280
I made you the No. 1
student president candidate.

527
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,560
Stunning, isn't it?

528
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,520
How do I look?

529
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
I look dazzling, don't I?

530
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,320
Well...

531
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,680
You're naturally beautiful.

532
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,240
It's nothing exciting.

533
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,360
Really?

534
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,960
- Let me do some more touch-ups then.
- No need!

535
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,900
This...

536
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,480
You already look perfect.

537
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
You think?

538
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,480
Honestly,

539
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,000
if you didn't say that I look beautiful,

540
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,920
I wouldn't feel that confident.

541
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,040
People here...

542
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,710
No one's being honest with me.

543
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,440
It's only you

544
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,080
who I trust.

545
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
When I said you're beautiful,

546
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,000
I actually meant it.

547
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,360
Okay.

548
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
I've got my confidence.

549
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,680
Oh, about that page.

550
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,960
You've actually done it.

551
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,200
Of course.

552
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,400
Though I can't find the culprit,

553
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,280
there's someone out there who loves you

554
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
and reports the page
so that it gets removed.

555
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,360
At any rate, thank you...

556
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Stop it.

557
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,680
No need to thank me any further.

558
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,480
Just winning the queen title

559
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,080
will be a big slap in their faces.

560
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,360
What if

561
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,960
I didn't win?

562
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,440
You're still my queen.

563
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,160
Hey!

564
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,120
Where did you get this tiara?

565
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,080
Let's just say I found one for you.

566
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,200
Tell me whatever you want.

567
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,320
I'll be sure to get all of them for you.

568
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,000
Simply having you as a friend

569
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,880
is more than enough.

570
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,920
Be your most gorgeous self

571
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,120
and be the queen,

572
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,120
my princess.

573
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
Thanks.

574
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,560
Mm.

575
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,510
What about your prince?

576
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,320
Mm...

577
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,560
Nowadays,

578
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,600
a princess doesn't have to partner
with a prince, you know?

579
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,560
Look.

580
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,680
Thank you very much, Chain.

581
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
For what?

582
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,800
For taking care of me really well

583
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,200
since the first day we met
and up until now.

584
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,400
I have a motive, though.

585
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,880
Hey.

586
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,680
I'm kidding.

587
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,120
It's my duty to take care of the juniors.

588
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,280
But you...

589
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,210
You've received special care from me,

590
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,080
and I'm not lying
when I say I want something from you.

591
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,520
Nu.

592
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,800
Can I ask you something?

593
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,040
What is it?

594
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,720
If you win the king,

595
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,720
can you consider me as your boyfriend?

596
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,480
Chain, what the hell are you doing here?

597
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,040
It's the same reason as you.

598
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Stealing another's partner,

599
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
you'd better be careful.

600
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
No one here

601
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,080
belongs to anyone.

602
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,200
Before saying that out loud,

603
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,440
have you asked him

604
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,560
whether or not he's taken?

605
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,240
If you two are gonna fight,

606
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,240
I'll have to excuse myself.

607
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,560
Don't be so cocky, Sun.

608
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,040
Nu is different from your exes.

609
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,520
No need to say that to me, Chain.

610
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,120
I know him way more than you do

611
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,240
- because he's...
- Boys.

612
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,040
Oh?

613
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,800
I was wondering where you guys are.

614
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,900
Let's get yourselves ready.

615
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,800
Hurry up!

616
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,240
What's with all happy hums?

617
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,200
I'm happy

618
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,840
because Nu told me that

619
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,320
if he gets to be the king,

620
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
he's gonna date me.

621
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,320
No way.

622
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,160
He would never say that to you.

623
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,400
You're delusional, Chain.

624
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,480
Say whatever you want.

625
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,230
Just wait until the end

626
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,240
and see if it's true or not.

627
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,880
Stop messing with my boyfriend.

628
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
Your boyfriend?

629
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,840
Before calling him that,

630
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,240
have you asked if he wants to be yours?

631
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,080
Damn you, Chain!

632
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Stop!

633
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,520
What's the hurry, Chain?

634
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,680
Your outfit still needs a few touch-ups.

635
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,080
The professor
might get upset at you, you know?

636
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,680
Make haste, Chain.

637
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,040
Don't keep others waiting.

638
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,200
[2025 King &amp; Queen Contest]

639
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,150
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

640
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,960
Calm down, guys.

641
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,880
Calm down.

642
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,560
Those were the 2024 king and queen.

643
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,840
Now, it's time for you to meet
the 2025 king and queen candidates

644
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,600
from each faculty.

645
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,920
Let's meet the first pair,
candidates from the Faculty of Arts!

646
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,440
A round of applause, please.

647
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,800
Nu.

648
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,520
What's up with Sun?

649
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,680
He looks like he's mad at someone.

650
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Did you upset him?

651
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,320
Would you go and make it up to him?

652
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,160
Let him be.

653
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,800
It's got nothing to do with me anyway.

654
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,200
Alrighty.

655
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,880
Even though you say that,

656
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,360
your eyes...

657
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,080
Do you know that tears
are about to come rolling down?

658
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,960
Alright.

659
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,800
If you care that much about him,

660
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,520
go and make it up to him.

661
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,800
You're so charming!

662
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,720
You and Lin did really well.

663
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,600
I'm sure that you'll win.

664
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,960
Uh...

665
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,600
I'm off to see Ploy now, okay?

666
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,440
I wanna see
how many photos of us she has taken.

667
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,360
I hope that

668
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,240
you haven't forgotten about the promise.

669
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,680
Don't get mad, Sun.

670
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,760
About Chain...

671
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,280
I'll deal with him myself.

672
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,320
What's the hurry again, Chain?

673
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,280
Can we talk for a minute?

674
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,680
I have nothing to discuss with you.

675
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,600
You're quite the talker yourself.

676
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,520
Don't act like a baby right now.

677
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,000
You always gang up on others like dogs.

678
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,800
Better than being an opportunist.

679
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
What's it gonna be, huh?

680
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,600
I just wanna give you a warning

681
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,920
as a fellow dog.

682
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,600
I'll deal with him myself.

683
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,000
Head back to the contest without me.

684
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,760
This is just the beginning.

685
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
I can do worse than you can imagine.

686
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,480
The results of
the 2025 King &amp; Queen Contest,

687
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,720
based on both on-site and online

688
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,800
student votes,

689
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
as well as esteemed professors,

690
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,000
are now in my hands.

691
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,240
The 2025 King and Queen are...

692
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,440
It's because you're childish.

693
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,320
Why did you have to give me
the cold shoulder like that?

694
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,560
The promise you made with Chain,

695
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,480
saying that you'd date him if you win...

696
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
What do you think

697
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,080
- about my plan?
- What have you done?

698
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,000
You have to take
accountability for everything!

699
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,960
Or else I'll take action.

700
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Chain hasn't come home since yesterday.

701
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,800
If something were to happen to him, too,

702
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,640
I probably couldn't go on.

703
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
If you wanna kill me, just do it.

704
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,000
We're all intellectuals here, you know?

705
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,880
Why would I kill you?
