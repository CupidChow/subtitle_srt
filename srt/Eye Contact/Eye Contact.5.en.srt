1
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,680
That means...

2
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,960
you've already lost
before the game even started,

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,880
If he knows that he's losing,

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
he should've just given up

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,240
Gundam is not gonna lose

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,720
because I'm gonna help him
become student president.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,760
What's with all the happy hums?

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm happy

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,000
because Nu told me that

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,640
if he gets to be the king,

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,920
he's gonna date me.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
This is just the beginning.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,920
I can do worse than you can imagine.

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
[2025 King &amp; Queen Contest]

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,520
Here's the announcement
for the 2025 King and Queen.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
The king is from
the Faculty of Communication Arts,

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,400
and the queen from the Faculty of Arts!

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,920
Yay!

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,080
Yay!

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
Are you heartbroken
because you didn't win the title,

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,560
or because you didn't get to date Chain?

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm heartbroken

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
because I have a childish partner like you.

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,280
Let go of me.

25
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
Why are you crying?

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
It's because you're childish.

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Why did you have to give me
the cold shoulder like that?

28
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,520
At that time, didn’t you know

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,960
how much I needed your support?

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was jealous.

31
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
I was mad

32
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,600
about the promise you made with Chain,

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
saying you'd date him if you won.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
I made no promises.

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
I even turned him down.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Chain.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I...

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm currently dating Sun.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm afraid I can't do as you asked.

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
I must apologize.

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,800
What did you tell him?

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,880
I told Chain that I'm dating you.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,080
But you said

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,760
you wanna keep our relationship a secret.

45
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes,

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,720
I don't want anyone to find out,

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,800
but I had no choice but to tell him.

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,880
I didn't want to get his hopes up.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
More than that,

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,800
it's because I love you, Sun.

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
But you're so childish.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,640
You have no idea
how much I love you, do you?

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,280
You're so silly.

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
You're so foolish!

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
You're so childish.

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,200
I get it.

57
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
Now, I understand it.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,720
So quit acting like such a child

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,480
and doubting how I feel.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
If that's the case,

61
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,160
you have to prove yourself.

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,240
Are you thinking naughty stuff?

63
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,520
You really have a dirty mind!

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Do you

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,600
like it, though?

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I love it.

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Let's get in the car already.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,920
What's all this?

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,720
Why do these two
seem like more than just friends?

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,360
Well...

71
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,120
I have Sun take care of Nu.

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,240
That's why they're close with one another.

73
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,920
It's normal for them
to be seen that way, isn't it?

74
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Do you really think this is normal?

75
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Ruj.

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,880
I've assigned you
to keep a close eye on Nu,

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,280
so tell me

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,880
what this is about.

79
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
So...

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,080
Sun and Nu are studying
at the same college.

81
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
They're also living in the same condo.

82
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Moreover, both of their fathers
are close friends.

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,040
So, it makes sense
that they have a close bond.

84
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
I think you know that

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,520
if I want to know the truth
about something,

86
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,240
I'll try to find it on my own.

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,800
If anybody lies to my face,

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,040
they'll be severely punished.

89
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
So I'm asking you again.

90
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,720
What relationship are these two in?

91
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,360
Hey.

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,480
Honey.

93
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Ruj has been working with us
for a long time,

94
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,160
so he wouldn't lie.

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,160
Mm.

96
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Fine.

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,440
I trust you and Ruj.

98
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,960
Maybe I'm just too worried about my son.

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,560
Go and get yourself ready, then.

100
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,040
I still have some business to tend to.

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Okay.

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I need to know

103
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,680
who my youngest son is dating.

104
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,680
Do you think

105
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,960
my plan is a clever move?

106
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,480
What the hell are you talking about?

107
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,680
Huh?

108
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,360
I got rid of your rival

109
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,560
so you'd have a better chance to win
and become the student president.

110
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,880
What have you done?

111
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Give me a moment.

112
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
[Someone blocked my sunset shot]

113
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
Shit.

114
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,440
This is a fucking disaster.

115
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,440
Frong!

116
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,200
Frong...

117
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm so...

118
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,430
Huh? What the hell are you doing?

119
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,520
Oh?

120
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,320
It's nice that you're here.

121
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Can you tell me

122
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,480
if you like it or not?

123
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,760
Did you hear what I just asked you?

124
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,760
What are you doing?

125
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm helping you with your speech.

126
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
Why are you helping me?!

127
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,680
You're supposed to be mad at me.

128
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,720
Why should I?

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,680
It's because of that damn rumor.

130
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
That's why you withdrew from the campaign.

131
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
It's perfect.

132
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,440
Now, I have a reason for my campaign.

133
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Are you out of your mind?

134
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
You're supposed to be upset with me.

135
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,000
You have to take
accountability for everything!

136
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Or else, I'll take action.

137
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,520
Right.

138
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,800
I'll take care of everything.

140
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,320
Tell me how.

141
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,480
Quiet!

142
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,760
I'll tell everyone that

143
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
the other person in the photo

144
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
is me.

145
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,720
You're done, right?

146
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,920
I can get back to working on your speech.

147
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,040
Huh?

148
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Hey!

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
What's gotten into you?

150
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,720
You were mad at me just a second ago.

151
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,160
I pretended that
I was angry to make you happy.

152
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
You're fine now, right?

153
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,000
Help me write your speech, then.

154
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,440
Come on!

155
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
God, Frong.

156
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,400
Man!

157
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,440
I don't know what to do with you.

158
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,400
But...

159
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,320
Thank you.

160
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
For what exactly?

161
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,860
At least,

162
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,400
you care about my feelings.

163
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Here.

164
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,600
Give it a read.

165
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
What have you been writing?

166
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,090
Whoa.

167
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,560
You have to say those 14 things out loud.

168
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,520
Oh...

169
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,600
- All of them?
- Mm.

170
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,400
Should we get rid of at least one?

171
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,920
What the hell are these?

172
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,480
Chain hasn't come home since yesterday.

173
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,920
At first, I thought
he was partying with his friends.

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,040
I went to his bedroom
to wake him up this morning.

175
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
That's when I found out
he hadn't come home.

176
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
His phone is off as well.

177
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,520
Mm...

178
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,760
He was probably drinking too hard.

179
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,680
With who exactly?

180
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,160
With how handsome Chain is,

181
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,520
everybody wants to hang out with him.

182
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,480
But why does he have to drink?

183
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,720
Is something bothering him?

184
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Chain.

185
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm currently dating Sun.

186
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
I'm afraid I can't do as you asked.

187
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,000
Please.

188
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,480
I hope he's just partying
at his friend’s house.

189
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,760
Please don’t let it be anything worse.

190
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,560
If something happened to him,

191
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,160
I don’t think I could go on.

192
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,640
Why are you doing this?

193
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,120
What do you want from me?

194
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,640
I just wanna keep my enemy close.

195
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,840
I wanna know how it feels.

196
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,800
If you wanna kill me,

197
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
just do it.

198
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm not afraid of you.

199
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
Chain.

200
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,640
We're all intellectuals here, you know?

201
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,480
Why would I kill you?

202
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,480
You dare call yourselves intellectuals

203
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,160
after ganging up on me?

204
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,080
Come on now...

205
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,680
The moment you regain consciousness,

206
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
you immediately start barking.

207
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,720
I guess

208
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,400
you don't need the food.

209
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm starving.

210
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,400
Go and have it, then.

211
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
How am I supposed to have it?

212
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,600
About that...

213
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,560
It's totally up to you.

214
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,600
Chain.

215
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,840
You're filthier than dogs, you know?

216
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,760
Fucking eat up.

217
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,480
Why are you just standing there?

218
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Come and have a seat.

219
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,520
You look pretty handsome

220
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
in glasses.

221
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
You never give me compliments like that.

222
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
A ton of people have already done it.

223
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,600
Why do you care so much
about my compliments?

224
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,960
Their words

225
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,840
mean nothing to me.

226
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
When we're on a bed together,

227
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
should I wear the glasses, too?

228
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,720
Stop thinking dirty.

229
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,960
Others might catch us.

230
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,560
Don't you love me wearing the glasses?

231
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,440
Now, I don't.

232
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,840
Why are you here all by yourself?

233
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,440
Is Jon absent today?

234
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,040
He said he was sick

235
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,720
and told me to take notes for him.

236
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Is there anything wrong?

237
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,080
Well...

238
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,620
Chain didn't come home last night.

239
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
Nobody could reach him either.

240
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
Maybe he's with girls.

241
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,640
When we were close friends,

242
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,960
he didn't come home for days.

243
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,880
What's up with you

244
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,520
suddenly asking me about Chain?

245
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,880
You're the only one at the college
who has beef with him.

246
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,360
Also, on the day of the contest,

247
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
you two almost had a fight.

248
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't get mad, Sun.

249
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,000
About Chain...

250
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
I'll deal with him myself.

251
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,840
You've figured something out?

252
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,240
It's nothing.

253
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,720
Go and get yourself cleaned.

254
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,080
I don't want my house smelling like rot.

255
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
How am I supposed to take a shower?

256
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,960
You have to untie me.

257
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,200
Chain.

258
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,800
You think I'm stupid or what?

259
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
If I untied your hands,

260
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
you'd just run away.

261
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,040
Huh?

262
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
If you're not gonna do it,

263
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,840
then I guess you've gotta help me shower.

264
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,920
You think I wouldn't dare
do such a thing, don't you?

265
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,760
Giving you a shower

266
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
is just like giving a dog a bath.

267
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,080
Take off my pants for me, then.

268
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,760
Doctor.

269
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,240
Why are your hands all shaky?

270
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
Showering together

271
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
sounds pretty fun.

272
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,200
What the hell were you trying to do?

273
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Fine.

274
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,240
If you don't wanna shower the normal way,

275
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,680
then shower like a dog.

276
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,520
Hey!

277
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,560
You guys!

278
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,760
You're always causing trouble.

279
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,960
Don't you know that
Chain hasn't come home?

280
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,240
Nobody is able to contact him either.

281
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,080
If his sister goes to the police,

282
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,480
what are you gonna do?

283
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,280
Shit!

284
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,720
Don't tell me that
Jon is gonna get us into trouble!

285
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
Chain is still alive, isn't he?

286
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
I don't fucking know!

287
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,640
He really despises Chain.

288
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,800
You two, stop thinking about it.

289
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,040
I'll ask the man behind everything myself.

290
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,720
Hey, Jon.

291
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,160
Where have you taken Chain to?

292
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,480
He's now in a hospital.

293
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,960
Send me photos of him.

294
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,640
You want photos of him

295
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,800
because you don't trust what I say?

296
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,160
I'm warning you not to do anything stupid.

297
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
Don't worry, friend.

298
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,840
He's still kicking.

299
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
I assure you.

300
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
When will you get him back?

301
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm a bit under the weather.

302
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Why are you asking me
so many questions today?

303
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,680
If you don't trust me,

304
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
then cut ties with me.

305
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,840
I'm done talking to you.

306
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,240
Jon, don't hang up.

307
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Are you alright?

308
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Of course, I am.

309
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,160
Chain taught me

310
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,920
to stay strong.

311
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm confident, though,

312
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,560
that he'll come back.

313
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,960
He's gonna be fine, isn't he?

314
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I'm afraid

315
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,000
something might happen to him
like with my parents.

316
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,040
I don't wanna live all by myself.

317
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,880
My life won't be able
to go on like this, Ploy.

318
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
That's why I'm here.

319
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,680
Don't be afraid, Lin.

320
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,320
I will not leave you.

321
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,320
Don't hold it in if you can't.

322
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,800
Cry if you want to.

323
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,480
Chain told me

324
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,480
to stay strong

325
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,320
and never shed a tear in front of anyone.

326
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Sometimes, we just need to cry

327
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,840
to let our emotions wash away

328
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,880
so we can keep going.

329
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,560
And...

330
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,960
We don't have to be strong all the time.

331
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,320
After you've let it all out,

332
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
we'll go to the police station.

333
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,600
Mm.

334
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,240
Pick up the phone.

335
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,120
Oh...

336
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
It's Chain!

337
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Then accept the call!

338
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,200
Chain. Where have you been?

339
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,520
Why haven't you answered the phone?

340
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,080
Why aren't you coming home?

341
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,640
Do you know how worried I am about you?

342
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Uh...

343
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,600
I...

344
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm hanging out with a friend.

345
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
A friend?

346
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,680
Who?

347
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Why are you staying with that person?

348
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,520
I blacked out on that night at the contest,

349
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,480
so I hopped in the car
to my friend's place in the country.

350
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,080
I'll be home in a couple of days.

351
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Who is this friend?

352
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
What province are you in?

353
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,680
You haven't met this person.

354
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,200
I know all of your friends.

355
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,440
Tell me who it is.

356
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Chain.

357
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,320
Are you really fine?

358
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,440
I'm hanging out with my friend.

359
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,400
He's a doctor.

360
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
He's taking care of me...

361
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,880
Wait, what?

362
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Chain!

363
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,800
Do you really think I don't know

364
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,080
what you were trying to do?

365
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,110
If you keep trying to do that,

366
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
I'll never let you call your sister again.

367
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Also, every once in a while,

368
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,840
I might even take care of her

369
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,720
when you're no longer around.

370
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,520
Keep my sister out of this.

371
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,240
Do it to me, not her.

372
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,440
Don't touch my sister.

373
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,600
So, behave yourself.

374
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,680
Don't get me into trouble.

375
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,560
Also...

376
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,800
Take the pills.

377
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,640
They'll make you feel better

378
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,280
so that you can go home.

379
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,480
Quit crying.

380
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,490
If you don't,

381
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,570
I'll make you stop crying myself.

382
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,160
What's Sun doing in there?

383
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,990
Huh? Where's the ladder?

384
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,040
Stop laughing.

385
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,880
Others might hear us.

386
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
It's just too funny.

387
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,120
That's what you get for being nosy.

388
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,320
Oh!

389
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,960
I'm in pain.

390
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,040
I can't take it anymore.

391
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,040
Did you take the pills I gave you?

392
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,000
Had you taken them,

393
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
your condition wouldn't have been this bad.

394
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,040
How was I supposed to know?

395
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,700
You're such a...

396
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,400
Come here.

397
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,080
Where are you taking me to?

398
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,800
Don't try to run away.

399
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,720
This is my dad's hospital.

400
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,840
If you chose to run away,

401
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,930
you wouldn't get away.

402
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,320
What the fuck are you staring at?

403
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,120
Did you hear what I just said?

404
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
I'm not deaf.

405
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,840
Shouting into my ears

406
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,360
is so damn annoying.

407
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,880
You...

408
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,120
The moment you've gotten better,

409
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,330
you start barking again.

410
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,160
You never shut up.

411
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,160
Are you really that hurt?

412
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,850
Ow!

413
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
Fuck you, Jon.

414
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,040
What the hell were you trying to do?

415
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,640
I should've told the doctor

416
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,360
that you're the one who did this to me.

417
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,680
Even if you said it,

418
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,640
no one would have believed you.

419
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,540
Because...

420
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,080
I have a good reputation here.

421
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,360
Mr. Chainthana Sinchaikaron,
your medication is ready at counter No. 2.

422
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,150
Jon.

423
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,720
Pick up the medicines for me.

424
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm in pain,

425
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
and I can't get up.

426
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,400
Do I look like a servant or what?

427
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,760
You're not a servant.

428
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,280
You are

429
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,200
a fucking bastard who hurt me.

430
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,760
Mr. Chainthana Sinchaikaron,
your medication is ready at counter No. 2.

431
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
Fine.

432
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,280
I'll get your medication.

433
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,560
Don't you dare run away.

434
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,800
If you're not here when I get back,

435
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,040
you'll be in deep shit.

436
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,560
What?

437
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,200
Damn you, Chain!

438
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,600
Why can't I still reach him?

439
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Chain!

440
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
Chain!

441
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,680
Chain!

442
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Where have you been?

443
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,140
Do you know how worried I am about you?

444
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:44,920
Wait...

445
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,440
Hold on.

446
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,360
What?

447
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,880
What happened to you?

448
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,280
I just wanna give you a warning

449
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,760
as a fellow dog.

450
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,370
Who hurt you?

451
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,680
Yeah, Chain.

452
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,880
We can't let this go.

453
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,240
You have to go to the police.

454
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,600
Do you remember who did this to you?

455
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,400
I didn't see who did it.

456
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,440
I have no idea who they were.

457
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,760
How come you can't remember them?

458
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,480
You just got away from them.

459
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,880
I really don't remember.

460
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,640
I don't know if you really don't remember

461
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,640
or if you're trying to protect somebody,

462
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,640
but if you're gonna let this slide

463
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,640
just so those guys
will take pity and leave,

464
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,480
that's not gonna happen.

465
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,680
If those guys can do this to you,

466
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,440
it means that

467
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,400
they don't see you as a human.

468
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,080
Go to the police.

469
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,120
Don't leave them be.

470
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,920
Issues at this school require immediate action,
[Student President Campaign Speech]

471
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,760
including the insufficient number
of student toilets,

472
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,400
limited access to clean water
for most students,

473
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,680
a lack of parking spaces,

474
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,920
the prices of food offered at the canteen,

475
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,160
and trash and waste sorting.

476
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,720
These issues can be resolved

477
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,200
without requiring confirmation
or approval from anyone.

478
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,320
We simply have to take the initiative.

479
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,600
I'd like my fellow brothers and sisters
to volunteer

480
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,000
and start taking action
on these issues for everyone.

481
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,200
Guys, what are we waiting for?

482
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,480
Give it up for him!

483
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,280
Excellent!

484
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,320
Hey! Your face looks hilarious.

485
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,880
Can I put it all over the school?

486
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,840
You can't!

487
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,760
Are you trying to embarrass me?

488
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,920
Delete the video.

489
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,660
- No!
- I've saved the video!

490
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,640
Delete it!

491
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,600
Come on!

492
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,960
- I won't delete it.
- Frong!

493
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,800
Give me the phone!

494
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,640
- No!
- Hand it over!

495
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,800
Are you gonna hand it over or what?

496
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,920
- Come on!
- No!

497
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Hand it over.

498
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,790
Frong.

499
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,640
So this is the truth.

500
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,200
You withdrew yourself from the campaign
so that your lover can win?

501
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,360
How poetic.

502
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,240
You're pretty good yourself.

503
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,987
You manage to use the little charm

504
00:48:56,012 --> 00:48:57,840
that you have to have others
do your bidding.

505
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,880
What the hell are you guys talking about?

506
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,560
You keep stirring up dramas from thin air.

507
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,330
You should blame yourself.

508
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,760
You're the one that causes everything.

509
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
What did I do?

510
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,840
You tricked Frong to be your partner

511
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,160
and forced him to help you
to become the student president.

512
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,720
You're so cold.

513
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,240
You've never seen him as your friend?

514
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,960
Don't worry, Frong.

515
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,760
We'll protect you.

516
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,000
Protect me from what?

517
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,000
We're gonna expose the one who tricks you

518
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,200
and make everyone in the school
know that Gundam is into boys,

519
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,480
full of lies, pretentious,

520
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,000
and doesn't deserve
to win the title at all.

521
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,040
Be honest.

522
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,590
Just what were you thinking

523
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,280
to hold him captive like that?

524
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,600
I don't know.

525
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,640
If you think you've got the wealth

526
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,480
and that money can solve everything,

527
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,800
I dare say that

528
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,300
you're wrong.

529
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,400
What are you gonna do?

530
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,680
I'm gonna settle things with him.

531
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,660
What if he's not backing down?

532
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,640
I know a way,

533
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,080
but you guys must not do anything.

534
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Again.

535
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,840
Do not do anything.

536
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,400
Where are you off to again?

537
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,120
I need to study notes with my friends.

538
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,400
The exam is just around the corner.

539
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,280
I thought I'd get to stay home
with you alone.

540
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,720
Aww...

541
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,680
I'll be back ASAP.

542
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,680
Mm.

543
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,680
My friends are rushing me.

544
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
I've gotta go.

545
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,040
I have something to talk to you.

546
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,480
If you want to talk to me
about your friend,

547
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,280
it's fucking useless.

548
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,560
What if I wanna use this opportunity

549
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,080
to call it truce?

550
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,280
Well...

551
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,640
What if I want you to stop messing with Nu?

552
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,920
We can't be friends

553
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,600
because you're embarrassed
by those nonsensical gossips?

554
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,700
You care those people that much, don't you?

555
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,200
Does Sun treat you well, Nu?

556
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,960
Yes.

557
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,160
So you've placed a lot of trust in him?

558
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,400
How pitiful.

559
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,360
Chain, what are you trying to insinuate?

560
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,920
You're an asshole,

561
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,560
and you want others to be the same?

562
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,880
You have nothing to do with this.

563
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,720
You're wrong.

564
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,080
I'm gonna date Chain.
