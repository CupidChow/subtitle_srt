1
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,560
It's because you're childish.

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,440
Why did you have to give me
the cold shoulder like that?

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,520
The promise you made with Chain,

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,600
saying you'd date him if you won.

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
What do you think

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,160
about my plan?

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
What have you done?

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,120
You have to take
accountability for everything!

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,080
Or else I'll take action.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,160
Chain hasn't come home since yesterday.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,920
If something happened to him,

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,760
I don’t think I could go on.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,960
We can't let this go.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,120
You have to go to the police.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,120
Do you remember who did this to you?

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,520
That matter's got nothing to do with this.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,320
Make of it what you will,

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,120
but don't you think it's all related?

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
I won't break up with him.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,160
Then, what's between us isn't over.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,440
I've already come all the way here
to beg you.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,480
Just what more do you need?

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
If you really wanna beg,

24
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,903
how about bowing down at my feet
for your friend?

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,320
Now, then,

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,880
do you dare do it?

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,000
I've given you a chance, Chain.

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,920
See what happens if you don't take it.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Hold on.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,440
You just got here,

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,880
so why are you leaving so soon?

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
This place is boring.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
A bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch,
does it?

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
You know that

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,640
I'm not the boring kind, Sun.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Let's do something fun,

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,320
like in the good old days.

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,720
Are you that afraid of losing votes

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
just for being my friend?

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
Yeah.

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm afraid we can't be friends.

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
We can't be friends

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,600
because you're embarrassed
by some ridiculous rumors?

44
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,040
You care about those people that much,
don’t you?

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Of course, I do.

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Those people are my votes.

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,440
I guess my single vote

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,840
doesn't mean much to you anymore, right?

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,160
Best of luck to you, then.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
No matter how you're gonna treat me,

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
this one vote

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,640
will always be yours.

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,240
Who were you texting?

54
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,800
The notifications were blowing up.

55
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,560
Is someone trying to hit on you?

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
What do you mean?

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,840
Uh...

58
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,487
Petch just wanna ask me

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
what it's like sharing a bed with you.

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,640
Why?

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
Your sibling’s worried
I’ll do something to you?

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,280
Meow!

63
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Hey!

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,080
What are you doing?!

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Aww...

66
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,010
Isn't your heart racing?

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm trying my best here.

68
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
Meow!

69
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,400
More like flatlining.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
Go to sleep!

71
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Chain isn't home yet.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
You said you're gonna stay up
and wait with me.

73
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,480
You'd better sleep now.

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,200
I've written a congratulatory letter
for you and your future lover.

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,120
Can I read it now?

76
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,680
If you wanna read it,

77
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,560
hurry up and get married.

78
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,280
[Orange juice: 30 baht each, 3 for 100 baht]

79
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Help! Help!

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
Police! Help me!

81
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Ploy!

82
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,720
Ploy.

83
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,160
Are you alright?

84
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm okay.

85
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
This is nothing.

86
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,800
Ouch! That hurt!

87
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
You said you're okay, though.

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,280
Well...

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,680
I felt nothing at first.

90
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,760
Now, I can feel the pain.

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
And...

92
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,120
Why did you come and help me, though?

93
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,560
We're friends, aren't we?

94
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
Mm.

95
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes.

96
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,950
Don't cry, Lin.

97
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,680
I'll forever be a good friend of yours.

98
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,480
Is this much concentration
really necessary for exam prep?

99
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,080
She's isolating herself from us.

100
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
You're right.

101
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,120
We always study notes together.

102
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,080
Are you two mad at each other?

103
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
No, we're not.

104
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,840
We still talk to each other as usual.

105
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,680
Hm...

106
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
Maybe we don't.

107
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:04,160
Perhaps.

108
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,552
I guess you can't ever

109
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:09,712
make her mad.

110
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Why is that?

111
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
What do you mean?

112
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,500
Well...

113
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,160
Why is it that
I can't ever make her mad at me?

114
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,624
Who would wanna upset our own crush?

115
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:24,369
Oh...

116
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,640
Hey!

117
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,840
You knew?

118
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm your friend, you know.

119
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Call me blind if I can't tell.

120
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
And...

121
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,720
Do you think she knows?

122
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,840
Do you think she does?

123
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
What should I do, though?

124
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
You don't have to do anything.

125
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,480
You haven't done anything wrong.

126
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,440
Love is a beautiful thing, you know?

127
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,540
Yes.

128
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,240
Having a crush on Lin is

129
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
the most beautiful thing in my life.

130
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,950
And...

131
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,920
You don't wanna confess
your feelings to her?

132
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
I'd rather not.

133
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,040
Simply having a crush on her

134
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,910
is more than enough.

135
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,729
Damn it!

136
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,090
God!

137
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:51,977
How does it feel?

138
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,440
From being a handsome
student president candidate

139
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,080
to becoming...

140
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
A piece of garbage.

141
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,480
That's karma.

142
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,360
That's what you get

143
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,225
for slandering people.

144
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:14,081
If you girls find it entertaining,

145
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,720
then sure.

146
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
This is great, actually.

147
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,520
The tale of the student president
from Grade 12/2

148
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:23,944
ends here.

149
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,560
It's only yours that has ended.

150
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,760
We're gonna ask Frong to come back.

151
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,720
You never listen to anyone, do you?

152
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:43,777
He always says he never wants
to be the student president.

153
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,824
Yet, you're here bugging him

154
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:47,569
and forcing him to rejoin the campaign?

155
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,000
Seriously...

156
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,080
If you want the student president
to be from our class that much,

157
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
why don't the three of you

158
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
run for it yourselves?

159
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,240
Or perhaps

160
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:09,248
you girls aren't qualified

161
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,776
to be good people.

162
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
Where are you running off to again?

163
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Do you think I'm coming here to kiss you?

164
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,320
Your nasty kiss?

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
I didn't feel a goddamn thing.

166
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,160
It's pale in comparison to a kiss I had

167
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,960
with your ex.

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
Damn you, Chain!

169
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
You dare mock me?

170
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm gonna kiss you so hard

171
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,440
that you're gonna beg for mercy.

172
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Chain?

173
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,820
If Sun tells you to end this,

174
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,730
and you don't,

175
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,320
I'll be the one putting you in the dirt.

176
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:00,776
Chain.

177
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,490
Huh?

178
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
Chain?

179
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,110
"I'm gonna kiss you so hard

180
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,800
that you're gonna beg for mercy."

181
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,880
Damn you, Jon!

182
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,680
Chain,

183
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,440
are you okay?

184
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,936
I'm fine.

185
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,680
Nu.

186
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,808
How are things with Sun?

187
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Uh...

188
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,070
Pretty good, actually.

189
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,160
Does he treat you well, Nu?

190
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Yes.

191
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:29,224
So you've placed a lot of trust in him?

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
How pitiful.

193
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:36,672
Chain, what are you trying to say?

194
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
When it comes to you,

195
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,960
you probably won't believe anything I say,

196
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
so just watch this video yourself.

197
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,760
Nareubadee!

198
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,480
It's not possible.

199
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,400
Nareubadee.

200
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,440
Nareubadee!

201
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,880
Nareubadee!

202
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,120
For real?

203
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,760
Nareubadee.

204
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,480
Damn!

205
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,824
How is this possible?

206
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,920
Everyone was giving me
weird looks yesterday, though.

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,160
Come on.

208
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
You don't know anything, do you?

209
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,400
Dramas come and go so quickly nowadays.

210
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
People may have criticized you yesterday,

211
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,480
but today,
karma has caught up to the girls.

212
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,630
Look.

213
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:30,888
They're all anxiously huddling together.

214
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,600
This is giving me so much joy.

215
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
If you laugh at them too much,

216
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,840
karma might come and haunt you.

217
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
Please don't say that,

218
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Student President.

219
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,440
No!

220
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
I still haven't won!

221
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,320
Nareubadee.

222
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,880
The number of votes for Arthit,
the candidate from Grade 12/8,

223
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,240
is now the same as Nareubadee's.

224
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,160
What's in my hand right now

225
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,945
is the final vote.

226
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,240
The final vote belongs to...

227
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,720
To...

228
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,680
To...

229
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,440
Nareubadee!

230
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
What?!

231
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,880
- Damn!
- Yes!

232
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,060
Oh!

233
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
You won!

234
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,000
Did I?

235
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,760
I actually won?

236
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,960
I fucking won!

237
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,080
- You're now the student president.
- Yeah.

238
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,520
Damn...

239
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,400
I can't believe that

240
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,720
one final vote

241
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:09,656
won you the position.

242
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,440
Everyone!

243
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,040
Gundam!

244
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:14,065
Gundam!

245
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,200
Gundam!

246
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,105
Gundam! Gundam!

247
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Gundam! Gundam!

248
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,985
Gundam! Gundam!

249
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,120
Gundam! Gundam!

250
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,360
I guess my single vote

251
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:28,656
doesn't mean much to you anymore, right?

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Best of luck to you, then.

253
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,712
No matter how you're gonna treat me,

254
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
this one vote

255
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,440
will always be yours.

256
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Gundam! Gundam!

257
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,320
Gundam! Gundam!

258
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,240
Gundam! Gundam!

259
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,160
Gundam! Gundam!

260
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,440
Honey!

261
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,400
I'm here to grade your exams!

262
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:41,344
Where's Nu?

263
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't tell me that

264
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,385
you gave him the master's bedroom?

265
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,310
You still haven't realized
you caused trouble?

266
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,276
How could you do this?

267
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,720
I fully trusted you to take care of Mr. Nu.

268
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,480
What are you talking about?

269
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,080
I don't get it.

270
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Sun.

271
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,912
You've made love with Mr. Nu, haven't you?

272
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:12,616
How would I look at Mr. Padej now?

273
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,800
He entrusted us to take care of Mr. Nu.

274
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
How did you know?

275
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,680
I was the one who told them.

276
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,920
And you believed her?

277
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,440
Then, tell us

278
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,880
if it's you in this picture.

279
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,320
Sun.

280
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,680
You don't even know what you're in for?

281
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,320
Sun,

282
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,680
do you actually love Mr. Nu?

283
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,680
Yes.

284
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,240
I really love him,

285
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,758
and I'm sure

286
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,712
he does as well.

287
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,680
Even if you say that he loves you,

288
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,680
the Hemwipats

289
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,680
will not be okay with this.

290
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:28,224
I do not care.

291
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
Even if I die,

292
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm fine with it

293
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,880
because I love him.

294
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,080
Why did you choose to call Nu?

295
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,280
I'm sure you know where he is, Ploy.

296
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,680
I do,

297
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,000
but I've promised him
I'd keep this a secret.

298
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Honestly,

299
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,720
he told me if you called,

300
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,520
he asked me to tell you that
he wanna break up with you.

301
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:08,929
How?

302
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:11,492
I still didn't know
what I did to upset him.

303
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,560
I've already made my promise, though.

304
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,230
Oops.

305
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,440
I've gotta go.

306
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,825
They're getting suspicious.

307
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,160
Ploy.

308
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
Ploy!

309
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,440
Damn it.

310
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,032
The nighttime view is

311
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
gorgeous, isn't it?

312
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,340
But...

313
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,560
Why do you look so sad?

314
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
You look sad too, Chain.

315
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,120
Is something wrong?

316
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,680
Hey.

317
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm here to comfort you,

318
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,480
not for you to worry about me.

319
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
I know that

320
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,120
I was the one who caused this.

321
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
It's not your fault.

322
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,720
You simply showed me

323
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:34,785
things I have never seen.

324
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,000
I did it

325
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,465
simply for myself.

326
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,880
Nu,

327
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,640
my feelings for you are still the same.

328
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm still waiting for you.

329
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm gonna kiss you so hard

330
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,940
that you're gonna beg for mercy.

331
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,640
Uh...

332
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,160
Let me go and
unpack things with others first.

333
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,520
[Nu told Ploy not to tell you, but not me]

334
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,160
[It's his fault, you know?]

335
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,360
Nu is gonna be mad about this.

336
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:00,480
Do you want our friend to
break up with his partner

337
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,905
without talking things through?

338
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,320
He chose to do this.

339
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,360
If he made the wrong choice,

340
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:12,113
it's our job to help him
make the right one.

341
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
But...

342
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,120
Saying this to someone like you,
who doesn't show their feelings,

343
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,960
I guess you won't get it.

344
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
Do you have something against me?

345
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,456
You've been acting weird for days now.

346
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,600
What about you?

347
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,720
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

348
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,049
Tell you what?

349
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:35,224
It's what you wanna confess.

350
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
I've got nothing to confess.

351
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,720
Likewise, then.

352
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,560
Good morning, kids.

353
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,360
Good morning!

354
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:57,225
Alright.

355
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,730
Education is essential for communities.

356
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:04,808
However, in some communities,
children may not get to attend school

357
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:06,711
or may not meet educational standards.

358
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:12,136
So, the Creating Knowledge & Education
for Development Program,

359
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,560
undertaken by volunteer students

360
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,265
is going to be very valuable.

361
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,960
With the support from the Hemwipat Group,

362
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,600
this project can continue
for years to come,

363
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,200
thanks to their ongoing commitment.

364
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,920
A round of applause for the Hemwipat Group,
the supporter of this project, please.

365
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,120
Alright, guys.

366
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,520
Our handsome volunteer students
are going to give you snacks.

367
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,320
You got me, so don't worry, Nu.

368
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,360
You and I, we need to talk.

369
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
Sun.

370
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,960
Have some respect.

371
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,600
This is a community project,

372
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,160
not the time for private matters.

373
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,880
Why are you mad at me?

374
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
Why did you run away from me?

375
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:27,464
Okay, guys.

376
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,000
Get in line and get your treats.

377
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
Let's get going, Chain.

378
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,560
Okay, please give the snacks to them.

379
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,640
Easy, Sun.

380
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,440
Don't cause more trouble just yet.

381
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:57,016
What have I done to upset you?

382
00:28:57,824 --> 00:28:59,464
Give me a chance to explain myself first.

383
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,400
I didn't expect you
to be this unreasonable.

384
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,240
If you wanna break up
and get together with Chain,

385
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,800
there's no need to make excuses
to be mad at me.

386
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,080
Just be honest with me.

387
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,640
I understand.

388
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,800
Don't listen to his rotten words.

389
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,680
You're an asshole,

390
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,416
and you want everyone else to be one too?

391
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,120
This is not your problem!

392
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,040
You're wrong.

393
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm gonna date Chain.

394
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Is that true, Nu?

395
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,800
Don't lie to me.

396
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,680
You won't be happy with him

397
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,840
because you love me.

398
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,080
I'm not into liars.

399
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,240
I've never lied to you.

400
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,120
Then tell me...

401
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,120
Since the first day we started dating,

402
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,680
have you slept with someone else?

403
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,330
That's what you get

404
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,430
for being a player and banging everyone.

405
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,440
That's why you can't remember it.

406
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,520
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,480
Thanks

408
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,600
for not lying to me.

409
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,351
You've...

410
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:32,248
You've never changed at all.

411
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Let's end it here.

412
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
This is my first mistake.

413
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,780
I promise that

414
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,840
there won't be a second time.

415
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:47,176
Sun.

416
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,440
Please let Nu go
so he can be with someone better.

417
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,200
That person isn't you either.

418
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,160
Nu,

419
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:55,856
don't believe someone like him.

420
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm not a kid anymore.

421
00:30:58,752 --> 00:30:59,992
I can make my own choices.

422
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,960
Let's go, Chain.

423
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:44,512
I'm really sorry

424
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:45,937
for saying that.

425
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,440
I thought that was actually true.

426
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,640
It's not easy to forget someone.

427
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,529
I've already told you

428
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,915
I'm patient.

429
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,960
Are you really sure

430
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,760
that you like me?

431
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,120
I don't know.

432
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,280
My gut tells me

433
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,080
you've found someone
you're more into than me.

434
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
We'll see

435
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,320
whether you can wait for me
to forget someone

436
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,040
or if you figure out who you like more,

437
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,200
which one will happen first.

438
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,480
Seriously, Chain,

439
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,720
don't you miss me?

440
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,560
Why would I miss a bastard like you?

441
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,040
I really miss you,

442
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,680
especially when we kissed.

443
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,880
It makes kissing others

444
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,225
not as delightful.

445
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,720
What the fuck are you talking about?

446
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,120
I'm expressing my feelings, you know?

447
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
I also know that

448
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
you're feeling the same as I do.

449
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,320
Isn't that right?

450
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,160
You're a psycho.

451
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,240
Ask your father, who's a doctor,

452
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,600
to check your brain,

453
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,800
so you'll stop messing with me.

454
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,720
I'm afraid that's impossible

455
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
because I'm already hooked on you.

456
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,040
The only cure to this

457
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,520
is you.

458
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
What the fuck are you trying to do?

459
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
I just wanna try something new.

460
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,440
Maybe I will feel better.

461
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,880
Jon, fuck off.

462
00:34:40,823 --> 00:34:42,423
You told me to back off,

463
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,600
but you didn't move an inch.

464
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,280
That's because you

465
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,960
don't wanna resist the things
I'll do to you, right?

466
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:54,144
I don't wanna do it.

467
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,280
It's just that I'm not afraid of you.

468
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,193
Be afraid, Chain.

469
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,680
If you were to fall for me,

470
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,680
I'll make you pay for this

471
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,740
again and again.

472
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:14,088
You're nothing, Jon.

473
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,560
From what I've seen,

474
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:19,881
it's more like you're the one
who's addicted to me.

475
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,680
You should be afraid, too.

476
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,760
If you become more addicted,

477
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:29,961
I'll be the one
who'll make you pay a lot more.

478
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,040
Then try it and see

479
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,560
which one of us actually has feelings.

480
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,200
If something's troubling you,

481
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:33,585
I can give you a hand.

482
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,040
You've been stressed for several days now.

483
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:46,361
I won't let you leave

484
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:50,016
until you tell me what's going on.

485
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:58,824
There's someone who really loves me.

486
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,336
Why do you look so worried, though?

487
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
You love that person?

488
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,720
Who is it?

489
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,224
Do I know that person?

490
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,440
How did they go under my radar?

491
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,760
If there's someone who's into you,

492
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,225
there's no way I wouldn't know.

493
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:20,536
You've asked me so many questions,

494
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:26,944
now it’s my turn to ask you.

495
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,080
Ask me?

496
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
What do you wanna ask?

497
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
Who are you into?

498
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,713
Why did you suddenly ask me that?

499
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
I just wanna know it, too.

500
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm your best friend,

501
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,520
but you've never told me anything about it.

502
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,920
Well...

503
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't have anybody in mind.

504
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,680
What else do you want me to say?

505
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Okay, okay.

506
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,720
I guess I can't really count on you.

507
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,120
Why not?

508
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,000
Tell me what you want me to do.

509
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,840
No need.

510
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
I'll do it myself.

511
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:17,184
What are you talking about?

512
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,240
Why do you look so stressed?

513
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,080
Is it that big of a deal?

514
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,105
Tell me.

515
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,568
Stop it!

516
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,600
I like you.

517
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,160
Can you repeat that?

518
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
I can't hear it.

519
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,760
You're so silly.

520
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,359
I.

521
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Like.

522
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
You.

523
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Is that true, Lin?

524
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:00,256
Now,

525
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,080
can you confess what's on your mind?

526
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,800
Confess what?

527
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:06,816
Come on!

528
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,240
Say what you wrote in the notebook.

529
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't wanna read it after I get married.

530
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,760
This notebook was put together

531
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:26,805
because I know I can probably
only be your best friend.

532
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,360
Everything we've done

533
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,960
and the time we've spent together

534
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,920
has always been delightful to me.

535
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,800
If there's someone

536
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,440
you wanna wake up to see,

537
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,280
I hope you know,
to me, that person has always been you,

538
00:41:44,784 --> 00:41:46,664
and it always will be.

539
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,640
I always like you,

540
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,214
not just as a friend,

541
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,200
but this is more than enough.

542
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,040
I hope you're happy with your love life.

543
00:41:58,065 --> 00:42:01,185
I'll forever be your beloved friend.

544
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,520
From Ploy.

545
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,600
You actually like me?

546
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,280
It's not just that I like you...

547
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,240
I love you.

548
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,640
I love you...

549
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,720
I'm not dreaming, am I?

550
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,600
Well...

551
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:51,088
We have to kiss again

552
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,360
so that you know that this isn't a dream.

553
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,080
Come on, Nu!

554
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:54,769
Why do you keep turning the fan on?!

555
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,880
It's already chilly!

556
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
I'm sorry.

557
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Are you good, Nu?

558
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,240
Thank you.

559
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:09,105
Mm.

560
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:15,103
- Professor!
- Professor!!

561
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,521
- Professor!
- Something awful happened!

562
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,200
What's going on?

563
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,360
Sun has gone missing.

564
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,200
Huh? Is that true?

565
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,640
Yes, he didn't pick up the phone.

566
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,560
His phone has been turned off, too.

567
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,320
You guys never stop causing me trouble.

568
00:44:56,992 --> 00:44:58,592
Why the hell are you standing here?

569
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,840
Others have been nervously looking for you.

570
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
I'm gonna stand and wait here

571
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:08,696
until you forgive me.

572
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,000
Pay no attention to me.

573
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,640
Let's go.

574
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,920
It's time to head back.

575
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,080
Have you forgiven me?

576
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,320
You've lost your mind.

577
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:42,728
Let's head back.

578
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,320
Have you forgiven me, though?

579
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,600
I will forgive you

580
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:53,448
when I'm no longer mad at you,

581
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,320
not out of pity.

582
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,960
Then that day won't come, right?

583
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:16,768
Why are you burning up?

584
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,240
Sun...

585
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,440
Sun?

586
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:21,857
Sun!

587
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
Sun!!

588
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,320
Sun!

589
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,960
Sun!

590
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:41,745
Alright, students.

591
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,120
It's time to head to the bus.

592
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:44,976
We'll hit the road in 10 minutes.

593
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,960
I won't wait for those getting there late.

594
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,440
Let's go.

595
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:50,625
- Quickly.
- Yes, Professor.

596
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,480
Okay.

597
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,320
- Professor.
- Yes?

598
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:05,664
- Please take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

599
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:23,969
I'm sorry, Chain.

600
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
The person you hope will come with you

601
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:29,064
isn't here.

602
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,216
What are you trying to do?

603
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,320
If they love each other,

604
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,680
I don't have to do much.

605
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,040
This game...

606
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:50,064
You lost!

607
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,800
But the game between you and me

608
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,760
is just getting started.

609
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:25,736
Where are the others?

610
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,440
They've all left.

611
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
You're the only one left,

612
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,640
waiting for an ambulance.

613
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,600
You're not heading back with the rest?

614
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,040
I'm the one causing this,

615
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,080
so I have to take responsibility.

616
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:43,448
Just being responsible?

617
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:47,096
You don't love me even a little, do you?

618
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,920
We're even now.

619
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,240
You broke my heart,

620
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,560
and I made you sick.

621
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,680
We've settled the score, okay?

622
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,920
No.

623
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,080
Don't be like that.

624
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,800
You can be mad

625
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,960
or hate me all you want,

626
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,160
but don't act like I meant nothing to you.

627
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,720
If you don't wanna forgive me,

628
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:20,824
I'll keep begging for forgiveness
until your anger fades.

629
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,960
If you wanna get together
with someone else,

630
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,240
I'll wait.

631
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:31,504
I'll do everything I can
to prove that I love you.

632
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
I know that, don't I?

633
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:38,416
That means...

634
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,720
You're no longer mad at me?

635
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
I wish I could hate and be angry at you...

636
00:49:59,023 --> 00:50:01,263
Why did you have to
make me love you this much?

637
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,060
You're such

638
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,560
an asshole.

639
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,480
I'm sorry.

640
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,680
I promise

641
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,080
I will never break your heart again.

642
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:20,104
Please, get back together.

643
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,720
Don't let there be a second time.

644
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,600
If there is,

645
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,280
you're in deep trouble.

646
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,560
Why did you suddenly

647
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:32,048
become so strict?

648
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,720
I got a handsome boyfriend.

649
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:37,928
That's why I have to be strict.

650
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,840
I've made my promise.

651
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,000
I just wanna enjoy the beach
like how normal people do,

652
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,400
but you're making it too fancy.

653
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
I didn't wanna simply go to the beach.

654
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,040
I wanna be on a honeymoon trip.

655
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,360
A honeymoon is for a newly married couple.

656
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,800
To me...

657
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,720
It's for the one I love.

658
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,440
Nonsense.

659
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,001
You're mine now.

660
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,480
From now on,

661
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,224
no matter what happens,

662
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,540
we'll make it through.

663
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,720
I love you, Nu.

664
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,320
I love you too, Sun.

665
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,160
I haven't had anything.

666
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,840
I'm starving to death.

667
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,880
Thank you for reserving a table for me.

668
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,880
Yes.

669
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,040
Alright. I'm at my place now.

670
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,760
Talk to you later, Mom.

671
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,160
Please.

672
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,480
Who's at the door?

673
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,120
Maybe it's Ruj.

674
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,960
Let me answer the door.

675
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Hello?

676
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,200
Who are you here to see?

677
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,880
I'm here to see Nu.

678
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,280
Is he here?

679
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Yes, he is.

680
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,520
And you are...

681
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,960
I'm Nicha.

682
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,760
Who is it, Sun?

683
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:33,120
I'm his fiancee.

684
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,400
Nu!

685
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,856
I miss you very much!
