1
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,288
You're gonna be smoking hot.

2
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,540
Me? With these nerdy glasses?

3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,376
Once you've encountered
three misfortunes,

4
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,087
your life will then totally change.

5
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,338
Why the fuck did you do that?

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,175
We're on campus.
You can't just race around.

7
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,472
What's wrong with you, Four-eyes?

8
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,931
Leave me alone!

9
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,311
The Faculty King and Queen Contest?

10
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,063
As for the queen from our faculty,
we got Lin.

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,357
As for the king,

12
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,567
we're choosing you.

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,004
I don't know that song.

14
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,380
- You haven't heard that?
- Hey, Nu!

15
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,508
Hey.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,967
You're here?

17
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,677
Yes, Chain.

18
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,138
Your outfit is so cute.

19
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,767
A compliment from a friend
doesn't count.

20
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,727
Well, I mean it, though.

21
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,272
He's so much more adorable
without glasses.

22
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,107
Well...

23
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,153
He really is.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,533
Chain!

25
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,620
Hurry up. We're performing soon.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,996
Don't be late, okay?

27
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,459
I'll get ready for my performance, then.

28
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,253
I'll see you when I'm done.

29
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,722
Hey,

30
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,349
let's go inside.

31
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,642
I'm feeling it.

32
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,394
Let's go.

33
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,232
I wanna know

34
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,651
if Chain's performing today.

35
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,569
Yeah.

36
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,279
But if you want a fight,

37
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,239
please don't.

38
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,950
I just wanna talk to him.

39
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,660
There won't be a fight.

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,204
I'll take that as a promise from you.

41
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,499
Do not fight here in my club.

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:47,959
Okay.

43
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,015
Ton,

44
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,100
thank you so much.

45
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,977
Everything's alright.

46
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,478
Don't worry.

47
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,689
Hey, trust me.

48
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,107
He's fearsome to lots of people.

49
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,108
You're safe now.

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,318
Don't worry.

51
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,277
Right?

52
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,820
You're exaggerating.

53
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,113
Just do what you need to do.

54
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,042
Hey, lover boy,

55
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,877
what are you staring at?

56
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,669
Right,

57
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,796
looking satisfied, huh?

58
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,840
Is something making you happy?

59
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
Thought it was someone else.

60
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,433
You're looking at Chain's sister,
aren't you?

61
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,602
She's getting prettier every day.

62
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,438
Can I get her if I hate her brother?

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,941
Hey, Sun's probably going for her.

64
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,152
Just do whatever you want.

65
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,197
Hey, where are you going?

66
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:00,990
To the toilet.

67
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,951
Wanna come see my pee?

68
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,244
I won't steal that chance
from your ladies.

69
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:13,920
Hey,

70
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,422
I know where Chain is now.

71
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,428
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,596
Yay.

73
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,770
Hey.

74
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,533
You...

75
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,120
I forgot that
you're allergic to alcohol.

76
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,581
Oh, I forgot that, too.

77
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,627
Did you bring your pills?

78
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:59,757
Gosh, who would bring them to a club?

79
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,510
What should I do now?

80
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,055
- It's itching everywhere.
- Don't scratch it.

81
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,620
Thanks a lot.

82
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,042
Nu.

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,251
Yeah?

84
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,754
I'll go get Lin her pills.

85
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,756
She's allergic to alcohol.

86
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,299
Oh...

87
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,968
You're going to the mall?

88
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,179
No, not the mall!

89
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,514
Lin's allergic to alcohol.

90
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,516
Oh,

91
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,603
so you're going to sleep and snore?

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
Come on, we were just here.

93
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,773
Gosh.

94
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,150
You're out of it.

95
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,944
You guys are giving me headaches.

96
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,489
Hey, I'll be back.

97
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,075
Don't go anywhere
or drink any more alcohol!

98
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,409
Got it?

99
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,078
Oh,

100
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,329
cheers!

101
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,248
Come on.

102
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,125
Oh...

103
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:16,959
Stop it.

104
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,253
What?

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,880
You're going to the mall?

106
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,804
Cheers!

107
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,483
You seem unwell, Lin.

108
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,485
I'm throwing up.

109
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,361
Hey...

110
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,655
Hold it back.

111
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,450
I can't.

112
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,619
It's coming out.

113
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,328
But...

114
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,664
You can just do it here.

115
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,707
I can't go anywhere else.

116
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,459
I really can't hold it back anymore.

117
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,631
Why are you giving me your hands?

118
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,050
To hold your vomit.

119
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,304
Come on, you don't need to do that.

120
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,391
You want me to see you
throw up on the floor?

121
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:17,228
What if someone records you
and uploads it?

122
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,063
It'll forever be on the Internet.

123
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,398
Can you handle that?

124
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,649
Come on,

125
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,110
I'll take it with my hands.

126
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,821
It's okay, I can wash my hands.

127
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:32,326
Why do you have to care
about me this much?

128
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,209
'Cause...

129
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,838
you're my dear friend.

130
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,769
I'm sorry, Ploy.

131
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,642
You should've told me you'd come

132
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,185
so that I'd be with you.

133
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,480
I missed you, Sun.

134
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,857
Why didn't you call me at all?

135
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,859
I've been waiting.

136
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,195
Can't avoid a creep
when you're drunk, huh?

137
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,531
I really missed that night.

138
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,533
Should we try to rekindle

139
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,410
our feelings

140
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,620
on that night?

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,539
You tell me, Sun.

142
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,459
My room or yours?

143
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,920
- You should come with me.
- But if you can't wait,

144
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,214
we can just do it in the car.

145
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,805
Come on, Sun.

146
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,432
Maybe later. I'm busy.

147
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,149
You're completely drunk, you know?

148
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,373
Where are you going?

149
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,626
Just leave already.

150
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,420
- I'm not leaving.
- Sun,

151
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,464
let go of my friend.

152
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,384
Isn't it too late to be a hero now?

153
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,927
You're...

154
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,887
always late.

155
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,723
I told you to let him go.

156
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,850
Don't make me repeat that again.

157
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,519
I don't care
if you repeat it a thousand times.

158
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,813
But let me tell you one thing.

159
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Don't tryna get on our nerves

160
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,317
'cause you have haters everywhere.

161
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,537
It's time to get...

162
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,080
my revenge.

163
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,917
Don't worry, Chain.

164
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,295
I'll make sure
to take good care of your friend.

165
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,007
Hey!

166
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,469
Come on.

167
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,013
- Come with me.
- To where?

168
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,805
Just come.

169
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,019
Let go of me!

170
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,771
Just sit here.

171
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,356
I'll get you some water to sober up.

172
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,398
No need.

173
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,359
Just leave me alone.

174
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,486
- Let me go!
- Can you stop moving

175
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,154
and just stay still?

176
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,115
I won't stop.

177
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,410
Who do you think you are
to tell me what to do?

178
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm older than you.

179
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,163
What?

180
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,208
You're older than me?

181
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,668
Whoa.

182
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,754
Let me take a closer look.

183
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,107
Hey!

184
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,318
If you won't stop doing that,

185
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,488
I can't tell you what's gonna happen.

186
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,826
You think I'm scared?

187
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,205
You should be.

188
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,501
But I am not.

189
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,176

Right, I don't have his number.

Actually,

199
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,459
I don't even know your name.

200
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,758
Hey!

201
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,969
If you won't stop doing that,

202
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,181
I can't tell you what's gonna happen.

You think I'm scared?

00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,437
You should be.

205
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,858
But I am not.

206
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,120

you could just ditch me like that,

You'll be late for your class, sir.

Can you please submit
my college withdrawal form?

211
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,188
I don't wanna go there anymore.

00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,149
Did you forget, Master?

213
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,819
If you don't go to this college,

214
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,280

No!

I don't!

218
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,581
I don't wanna be with Mom.

219
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,624
- Ouch...
- Are you okay, sir?

Do you want me
to book a doctor appointment now?

Ruj,

222
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,677
don't ever say the word 'doctor' again,

223
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,304

224
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,223
Yes, sir.

Please don't ask me anything for now.

228

So,

229
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,324
I don't need to submit
your withdrawal form anymore, right?

230
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,867
Not today.

231
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,621
I'll sleep on it first.

We ordered a ton of copies
of your posters.

We're also ordering
some standees and banners.

239
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:42,366
If the school billboard
weren't so expensive,

240
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,952
we would've already chipped in
with our classmates

241
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,954
to put up a campaign sign for you.

242
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,082
You're taking this so seriously.

243
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,500
Of course we are.

00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,171
We won't let Gundam win
and be the president.

245
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,508
But didn't you tell me to participate

246
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,927
so it would increase
our class' chances of winning?

247
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,137
Why does it have to do with Gundam?

248
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,266

249

Gundam wants to do it,

268
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,030
so I think he deserves this
more than I do.

269
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,575
You should help him, too.

270
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,619
Of course, we will.

271

I'm sorry.

342
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,030
You should've realized this was wrong
before you even did it.

343
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,699
You think I can't hurt you?

344
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,700
Take it easy.

345
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,369
I'm not only sorry,

346
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,037
but I'll make it up to you, too.

347
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,955
Make it up to me?

348
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,249
You think you can just give me money,
and that's it?

349
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,792
- You motherfucker!
- Hey!

350
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,585

I just...

353
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,053
don't want you to cheat

354
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,973
It'll be too late when you're older.

Yeah.

357

358
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,356
But everyone else doesn't.

359
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,983
I...

360
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,693
don't expect to be recognized.

361
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,821
But if you want to be
the student president,

362
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,991
everybody should know

What are you talking about?

364
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,577
I came to talk about the posters,

365
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,745
not to get compliments from you.

366
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,414

00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,082

What are your policies?

372
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,008
Show me.

00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,801
Maybe I can help.

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,094
What?

375
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,762
What do you mean?

376
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,389
You're my rival!

377
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,765
But I don't wanna be that!

378
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,726
I will never be.

379
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,604
What? What did you say?

380
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,565
Let's just do this.

381
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,734
All you need to do

382
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,444
is remember that

383
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,237
if I help you, you'll also help me.

384
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,659
What are you talking about?

385
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,910
I'm so confused.

386
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,872
Listen to me

387
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,249
carefully, okay?

388
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,753
I don't want to be student president,

389
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,757
and I don't want
those three school protectors

390
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,467
to use me to make you lose.

391
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,177
Therefore,

392
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,930
I'll help you,
the unrecognizable good guy,

393
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,390
win the election and be the president,

394
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,352
so I can focus on

395
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,065
studying for the entrance exams.

396
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,319
Got it?

397
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:40,617
So you, who are my rival,

398
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,118
are helping me?

399
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,411
Yes, secretly.

400
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,957
You can be sure that a wise guy like me

401
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,960
can absolutely make you the president.

402
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,384
Do you have a deal?

403
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,679
How could I say no?

404
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,987
I'm really sorry, Nu,

405
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,323
for leaving you last night.

406
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,575
It was my fault.

407
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,160
I couldn't stay.

408
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,287
Chain also got into a fight.

409
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,081
Luckily, we found him in time.

410
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,208
Otherwise, he would've been more hurt.

411
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,002
Who did he fight with?

412
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,171
Sun and his friends.

413
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,465
Why do they hate him so much, though?

414
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,803
You look pretty drained, too.

415
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,680
Are you okay?

416
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,140
Well,

417
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,558
I've got a fever.

418
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,019
I was probably too drunk last night.

419
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,313
Ouch...

420
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,109
You were dancing your heart out.

421
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,819
It hurts, doesn't it?

422
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,154
Right.

423
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,906
It's good that you let your worries go,

424
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,242
but you should've known your limits.

425
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,710
- I need to go now.
- Hey! That's Sun!

426
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,669
Where are you going?

427
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,713
Aw, he's so hot.

428
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,725
You're burning hot,

429
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,894
but you're still here?

430
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,732
- Hey...
- Wait.

431
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,484
Oh...

432
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,028
What's going on?

433
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,115
Why did he take Nu with him?

434
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,825
Right, why?

435
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,287
I told you to let me go!

436
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,248
Wherever you're taking me to,

437
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,917
I'm not coming with you.

438
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,377
If you don't stop acting up now,

439
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,631
I'll carry you in front of everyone here.

440
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,300
Don't you think I won't do it?

441
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,177
Last night,

442
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,095
I already did that once.

443
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,266
What do you want from me?

444
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,728
I...

445
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,400
Can't you just talk to me?

446
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,241
At least tell me your name.

447
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,577
What are you gonna do with it?

448
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,580
We should at least know each other.

449
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,959
My name's Sun.

450
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,712
I already know that.

451
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,383
I also know that you're an English major
from the Faculty of Arts,

452
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,677
a close friend of Chain's sister,

453
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,930
and a faculty king
for the Faculty King and Queen Contest.

454
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,101
Were you spying on me?

455
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,022
I just wanted to know you.

456
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,693
You must already know my name.

457
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,779
I do,

458
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,324
but I want to hear it from you.

459
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,666
I'm Nu.

460
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,543
Nu?

461
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,215
Wait up!

462
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,690
Take off your shirt.

463
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,577
I said, take it off.

464
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,497
Why do I need to?

465
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,374
What are you gonna do?

466
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,500
Open your mouth.

467
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,753
Do it.

468
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,423
Open your mouth now.

469
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,560
Look.

470
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,562
You've got a high fever.

471
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,689
I'll lower your body temperature

472
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,150
so that you can rest after taking a pill.

473
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,985
I've got a fever,

474
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,695
but do you know who did it?

475
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,614
I told you

476
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,075
to stop, remember?

477
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,369
You didn't listen.

478
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,418
I was drunk

479
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,545
and wasn't in my right mind.

480
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,215
I wouldn't have known
what I was doing.

481
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,884
You were fully aware,

482
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,844
yet you didn't hold back.

483
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,306
Didn't you feel any shame at all?

484
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,020
I did,

485
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,106
but I couldn't help it.

486
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,858
You were so damn hot.

487
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,735
That's enough.

488
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,195
Stop talking.

489
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,822
I'm going back to my class.

490
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,157
I've checked your courses.

491
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,701
You don't have classes now.

492
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,579
I'm going home, then.

493
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,248
Hold on.

494
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,583
You can't leave yet.

495
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,961
You gotta get better

496
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,338
and feel stronger first.

497
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,634
Take your shirt off.

498
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,933
If you don't do it now,

499
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,521
I'll do it how I did last night.

500
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,897
Fine, I'll do it.

501
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,608
I'll go get a towel.

502
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,286
Just hurry and do what you want.

503
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,997
But...

504
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,416
don't do what we did last night again.

505
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,838
You're sick. I won't do it.

506
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,549
Once you're better,

507
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,718
I'll definitely go for it.

508
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,306
Stay still.

509
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,428
[Why did Sun take Nu,
our faculty king, with him?]

510
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,388
[They even held hands]

511
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,224
[Sun's never done that with anyone]

512
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,726
[Exactly! Something's going on]

513
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,603
[Are they dating?]

514
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,814
[Since when? I'm positive Sun's single]

515
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,569
Chain!

516
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,291
What's going on between Sun and Nu?

517
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,546
I have no idea.

518
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,175
No one knows.

519
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,469
I guess we have to ask Nu, then.

520
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,639
But he hasn't picked up any of my calls.

521
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,725
If this happened before now,

522
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,895
I would've been more helpful to Nu.

523
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,898
Look at me now.

524
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,694
I can barely take care of myself.

525
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,950
I don't know
what's between you and them,

526
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,871
but I've warned you, Chain,

527
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,290
about Jon's ex.

528
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,376
And today,

529
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,170
it's finally getting back at you.

530
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,839
About Sun's ex,

531
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,717
I admit that I was in the wrong.

532
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,635
But Jon's ex...

533
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,387
I didn't have anything to do with her.

534
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,644
Jon and I...

535
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,399
can no longer be together, Chain.

536
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,075
If you want to cry,

537
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,703
just let it all out,

538
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,914
but don't assume things just yet.

539
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,126
There might be a solution
to your problem.

540
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,088
Chain, you...

541
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,716
You've always said that

542
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
since we were in middle school.

543
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,598
"Every problem can be solved."

544
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,684
But we can really solve any problem

545
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,479
as long as we stay calm.

546
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,939
Yeah.

547
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,379
What?

548
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,131
That was it? Seriously?

549
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,301
Is that really enough
to end a friendship

550
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,470
and go after each other?

551
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,392
Not to offend you,

552
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,144
but this is all crap.

553
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,981
You'd never get it

554
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,191
unless it happened to you.

555
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,654
See? You're still defending them.

556
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,200
Did that wound do nothing to you?

557
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,662
Fine.

558
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,038
Whatever.

559
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,457
But I know...

560
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,544
that you guys had been good friends.

561
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,798
Sun, Jon, Zak, and Man...

562
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,719
They helped us a lot

563
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:28,639
when we lost our parents.

564
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,350
That's the reason

565
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,644
I can't hate them.

566
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,521
When things are good,

567
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,440
they're incredibly amazing.

568
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,483
But when anger strikes,

569
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,193
they won't freaking listen.

570
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,613
And...

571
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,160
What's between you and Nu?

572
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,537
What do you mean?

573
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,166
I mean...

574
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,626
When you're with him,

575
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,004
something's off.

576
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,841
You like him, don't you?

577
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,801
Yeah.

578
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,136
Knew it!

579
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,597
I never get it wrong.

580
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,767
However,

581
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,770
this time, your enemy is Sun.

582
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,855
Can you really handle that?

583
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,523
Well,

584
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,025
with your help,

585
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,943
I think I can.

586
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,196
Hold on.

587
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,825
You want me to help you get Nu?

588
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,498
You've been hit on by millions of men.

589
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,833
I'm sure you must've picked up
a trick or two.

590
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,711
Come on.

591
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,923
Fine, then.

592
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,884
Since my brother's begging me,

593
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,095
I can't say no, can I?

594
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,249
Sun, what are you doing?

595
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,835
I just want to know...

596
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,129
if your fever is gone.

597
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,384
Where are you going?

598
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,136
I'm going home.

599
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,346
You can't do that.

600
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,931
You're still ill.

601
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,933
I'm better now,

602
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,102
and I don't want
any treatment from you.

603
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,105
Ouch...

604
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:43,941
See?

605
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,610
You wouldn't listen to me.

606
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,321
To heal fast,

607
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,699
you've got to treat the right place.

608
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,034
Got a wound?

609
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,245
That's where the cream goes.

610
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,706
Does that mean...

611
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,917
I have to apply the cream to...

612
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,715
Gosh.

613
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,554
Don't be scared.

614
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,264
This is part of the treatment.

615
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,850
Can't I really do it myself?

616
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,935
I'm a doctor.

617
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,981
You're just a sophomore medical student.

618
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,068
There's no need to be embarrassed.

619
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,362
I've seen everything

620
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,364
and every inch of you.

621
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,199
That's enough.

622
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,201
Stop talking.

623
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:36,869
Whatever you're doing,
just do it quickly.

624
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:40,498
Spread your legs.

625
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:49,965
Ouch...

626
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,138
Can't you be more gentle?

627
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,891
I'm doing it in the most gentle way.

628
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,980
Me?

629
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,484
Yeah, you!

630
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,111
Help me make Nu
fall in love with Chain, please.

631
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,906
I made a promise with him,

632
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,200
but I've got no idea what to do.

633
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,244
Do you happen to know anything?

634
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,412
Well...

635
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,041
I'm not sure if it's gonna work,

636
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,835
but...

637
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,004
should we give it a try?

638
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,007
Bring it on!

639
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,343
- First!
- Yep.

640
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,264
You need to arrange a dinner for them.

641
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,224
- Oh, okay!
- Make sure the food's good.

642
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,141
Got it.

643
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,810
Second,

644
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,354
they need to see a movie together.

645
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,897
- A movie?
- You know, like...

646
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,525
In a cold room,

647
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,735
Chain could be a gentleman...

648
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,611
Yeah?

649
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,530
And give Nu a blanket!

650
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:55,990
Like this.

651
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,660
Yeah, something like that.

652
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,161
You know, being a gentleman.

653
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,290
Now, the 28th thing...

654
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,086
This should be enough.

655
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,589
You've got too many of them, Ploy.

656
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,593
What? These are just the basics.

657
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,013
I've only told you
one-third of everything.

658
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,973
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

659
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,599
- For real?
- Of course.

660
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,810
You've got all these plans.

661
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,146
Who are you planning
to do all of these with?

662
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,276
[Orange juice: 35 baht per bottle]

663
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,403
Hi, Lin from Class 7.

664
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,822
I'm Ploy from Class 8.

665
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,325
You know me?

666
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,659
Of course I do.

667
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,369
I've seen you
at every morning assembly.

668
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,707
Why are you selling orange juice here?

669
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,209
I just...

670
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,503
wanna help my mom earn more money.

671
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,048
This location won't work.

672
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,008
What about selling it at my place?

673
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,218
Oh, I'm good.

674
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,219
I don't wanna bother you.

675
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,262
So...

676
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,306
I'll help you here, then.

677
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,141

What are you trying to do?

680
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,240
Increasing the sales!

681
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,118
You need competition
to make your product more interesting.

682
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,084
Orange juice! It's cheap here!

683

of three bottles for 100 baht!

Wait...

685
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,881
You sure you got that right?

686
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,007
I guess.

687
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,470

It's 100 for three bottles.

695
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,943
Okay, then. I'll get three.

696
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,824
No one.

697
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,326

Come on.

Hey, Lin.

702
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,718
Aside from conjoined twins,

703

we're the only people
that can't be separated.

704

00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,403
As I won the Faculty King
and Queen Contest last year,

743
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:31,158
I'd like to give you some advice
on your uniform.

744
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,202
Can you please listen to me first?

745
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,080
I'm sick of your lies!

746
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,248
Remember,

747
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,916
you and Chain

748
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,002
are incomparable!
