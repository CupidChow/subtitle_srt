1
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:41,040
So you, who are my competitor,

2
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,000
are gonna help me?

3
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,084
Yes, secretly.

4
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,586
Do we have a deal?

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,756
If you won't stop doing that,

6
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,841
I can't tell you what's gonna happen.

7
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,635
You think I'm scared?

8
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,514
You think
you could just ditch me like that,

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,390
Four-eyes?

10
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,517
This time, your rival is Sun.

11
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
Can you really handle that?

12
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,437
With your help,

13
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,897
I think I can.

14
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,148
[I like you]

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,154
Oh, it's Sun!

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,031
Sun?

17
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:34,302
♫Those eyes of yours make my heart shake♫

18
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:41,601
♫Just one glance, and love begins to wake♫

19
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:49,150
♫As we draw near,
there's one thought I can't forsake♫

20
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,487
♫If I spoke the truth I could not fake,♫

21
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,490
♫Would your anger break?♫

22
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:00,411
♫Even if the world falls apart,♫

23
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,249
♫I will stand by you through every part,♫

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,669
♫Holding you close within my heart♫

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:14,133
♫And loving you strong as long as I last♫

26
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,802
♫My world froze
when I looked into your eyes♫

27
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,011
Sun is hitting on that kid?

28
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,181
We've been trying so hard to win him over,

29
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,767
but in the end, a rat snatched him away.

30
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,562
There’s no way I’m letting this go.

31
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,814
And you think I will?

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,000
What?! What is the school thinking?

33
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,668
The rule has changed.

34
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,212
All student president candidates
must give a speech on stage.

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,590
There's nothing wrong with that.

36
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,550
That's how it's been done every year.

37
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,052
But this isn't like
the good old days anymore!

38
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,555
Nowadays, everyone
campaigns on social media.

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,181
God!

40
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,935
And...

41
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,479
What's the problem with that?

42
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,648
Well...

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,734
I can't do public speaking!

44
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,613
How about this?

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,699
As my No. 1 campaign assistant,

46
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,451
you have to do whatever it takes

47
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,537
to help me speak in public.

48
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,456
Help me, please!

49
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,417
If you're that weak, just give up already.

50
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,960
Right?

51
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,925
Whoa...

52
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,762
These three girls are going all out,
campaigning for Frong

53
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,139
without a care in the world.

54
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,767
So that's why you decided to be
one of the candidates.

55
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,310
Yeah,

56
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,895
I already saw them.

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,566
So much for not wanting
to run for the president.

58
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,236
Have you prepared
your policies and speech?

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,030
Feel free to tell me if you need help.

60
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,865
No need, Frong.

61
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,493
Let them do their thing.

62
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,787
It's eliminating competitors

63
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,455
via natural selection.

64
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,915
Yes.

65
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,250
They were never going to win, anyway.

66
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,627
Whoa...

67
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,837
By talking to us like that,

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,464
they're underestimating us.

69
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
So what?

70
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,676
It's fine.

71
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,013
Cool guys don't just bark.

72
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,723
They actually do things.

73
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,183
Really?

74
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,227
But if it's too much for you,

75
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,729
now isn't too late to quit

76
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,940
so that you won't be
ashamed of yourselves.

77
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's go, Frong.

78
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,445
Let's not waste any more time here.

79
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,322
It's fruitless.

80
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,452
The real deal is always the real deal.

81
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,371
Please understand this.

82
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,289
Girls, let's go.

83
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
Hey! You...

84
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,212
Whoa! Take it easy, man!

85
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,716
Don't stop me.

86
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,803
I told you to calm down.

87
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,266
God...

88
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,564
"I, Gundam, promise that..."

89
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,941
Before speaking it to others,

90
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,611
you must first understand
what you wanna say.

91
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,699
If you're here to showoff,

92
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,242
just leave. Shoo!

93
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,165
I already told you I wanna help.

94
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,791
Why don't you just trust me for once?

95
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,210
God...

96
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,756
Hey!

97
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,300
What's this?

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,473
Don't tell me that these are
your policies and speech.

99
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,891
Exactly.

100
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,684
I came up with them myself, too!

101
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,102
How cool is that?!

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,605
It's simply incomprehensible.

103
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,107
How on earth will you
make others understand?

104
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,817
Huh?

105
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,320
Hey!

106
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,240
You're ruining the note, damn it.

107
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,909
- Shut up already.
- Hey!

108
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,619
- There.
- No!

109
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,165
When are you free?

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,416
Why?

111
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,337
We need to plan the campaign seriously.

112
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,926
You must gain the upper hand
over those girls first.

113
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,222
Or else I might actually get to be
the president.

114
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,850
Oh, by the way,

115
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,270
we also have to

116
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,731
draft new policies of yours from scratch.

117
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,027
I've already sent you what you'll need.

118
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,404
If you wanna win

119
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,490
and become the student council president,

120
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,785
follow every instruction of mine.

121
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,500
Hm?

122
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:58,960
Huh?

123
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,378
What's this?

124
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,922
"Monday: Draft new policies."

125
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,507
"Tuesday: Public speaking practice 1."

126
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,342
"Wednesday: Public speaking practice 2."

127
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,803
"Thursday: Public speaking practice 1 &amp; 2."

128
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,556
When will I get to rest?

129
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,099
Huh?

130
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,059
Gosh...

131
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:16,894
You...

132
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,063
You're serious about this?

133
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,693
I'm dead serious.

134
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,529
Just don't mess around.

135
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,202
Sun!

136
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,079
Have you seen what you did?

137
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,299
Is this a video of him singing
at the cafeteria a few days ago?

138
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,758
You're right.

139
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,552
It's got hundreds of thousands of views.

140
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,263
I think girls all over the college

141
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,682
are trying to figure out
who you're singing this song for.

142
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,351
It’s got nothing to do with anyone.

143
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,062
Don't you remember?

144
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,480
When you were single

145
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,358
girls all over the college
were charmed by you.

146
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,528
If someone got to claim you,

147
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,572
I bet they won't give in easily.

148
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,326
You're causing that kid huge trouble.

149
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,166
Huh?

150
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,091
I think the two of you should get
the same shade of hair color

151
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,718
so that you look like you match.

152
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,094
Nope.

153
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,638
I'd rather not.

154
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,557
People might think
he and I are fraternal twins.

155
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,184
It's gonna be rough,

156
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,686
don't you think?

157
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,232
What do you say, Nu?

158
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,276
Oh...

159
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
I'm cool with anything.

160
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,037
Have you found any clues

161
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,664
about what’s causing him to be like this?

162
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,083
He's been looking stressed for days now.

163
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,418
I have no idea.

164
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,839
All I know is that
after the day Sun sang to him,

165
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,841
he's had a stressed look on his face.

166
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,176
Yeah.

167
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,970
How strange.

168
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,098
Something is probably going on.

169
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,019
Nu.

170
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,646
Nu!

171
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,275
Lin and I are gonna get you a drink, okay?

172
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,737
I'll wait here, okay?

173
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:32,738
Okay.

174
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,965
Who are you?

175
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,219
So you are Nu,

176
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,305
this year's Faculty of Arts King?

177
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,890
You do look kinda cute, actually.

178
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,144
As last year’s Queen of the university,

179
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,604
I'd like to give you a word of advice

180
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,983
on your outfit.

181
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,197
What are you doing?

182
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,371
Hey!

183
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,296
Now, that looks better.

184
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,799
Here's a fair warning.

185
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,928
What you're doing is against the law.

186
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,139
Paying a tiny fine

187
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,393
to ensure you leave Sun alone

188
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,812
is more than worth it.

189
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,663
Pretty face, huh?

190
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:14,882
- Sun?!
- Sun?

191
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,426
You know what's gonna happen

192
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,388
for making me mad, don't you?

193
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,139
Sun...

194
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,766
I was just playing around.

195
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,936
Yeah, it was just for fun.

196
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,815
Don't let me catch you two
messing with Nu again.

197
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,608
The one who’ll be in pain

198
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,693
isn't gonna be me.

199
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,119
Whoa!

200
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,912
What happened?

201
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,590
You're a medical student,

202
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,843
you should be able to take care
of your own wounds, right?

203
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,180
Nu!

204
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,224
Nu!

205
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,480
Nu.

206
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,774
Nu!

207
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,819
Hey!

208
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,947
Which part of the galaxy did you come from,

209
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,408
that you don’t know what to do

210
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,120
when someone who cares about you
comes to help?

211
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,707
What about you
singing that song days ago?

212
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,751
It's because I like you.

213
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,462
Like?

214
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,884
Lucky you for choosing to be
a medical student

215
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,386
because your acting

216
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,805
is super fake.

217
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,113
What do you think you were doing,

218
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,448
going on stage and singing?

219
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,161
Don't tell me
you're trying to get attention.

220
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,915
Are you really gonna hit on that kid?

221
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't think so.

222
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,004
This player over here said that...

223
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,340
he wouldn't get into
a long-term relationship.

224
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,799
He wouldn't date anyone either.

225
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,552
I think the reason he did it is because

226
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,429
he has a plan.

227
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,640
I just wanna get even with Chain.

228
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,934
He took my partner from me.

229
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,520
I just wanna take
someone precious from him in return.

230
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,951
Any excuses?

231
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,496
You didn’t listen to
what I said after that?

232
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,667
And I still have to listen to
more of your lies?

233
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,544
Get this.

234
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,046
I'm through with your lies!

235
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,756
Wait, Nu!

236
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,340
Hey!

237
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,175
Let go, damn it.

238
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,260
I hate you.

239
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,971
Can you just listen to me first?

240
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,224
I'm not gonna listen to
another one of your lies.

241
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,934
And remember this,

242
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,813
someone like you
doesn't even come close to Chain.

243
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,232
Fucking let go.

244
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,953
Are you alright, son?

245
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:16,915
Dad.

246
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,211
How close are you and Padej?

247
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,798
He and his family...

248
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,301
We owed them a lot.

249
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,554
We got to have this much wealth,

250
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,141
and you got to have a luxurious condo
next to your college,

251
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,894
all because of him.

252
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,606
What makes you ask me this
all of a sudden?

253
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,567
Nu!

254
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,319
Please listen to me!

255
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,445
- Hey!
- Stop!

256
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,488
Stop right there!

257
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,073
What the hell is this?!

258
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
Just who are you, really?

259
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,037
The person you just called

260
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,539
is Mr. Narut Hemwipat,

261
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,167
son of Padej Hemwipat.

262
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,586
He's the owner of this condo.

263
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,675
I remember that

264
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,678
his son is studying overseas, isn’t he?

265
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,138
I think that's the oldest son.

266
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,393
The younger one is studying
at the same college as you.

267
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,936
What faculty is he in?

268
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,898
I think it's the Faculty of Arts.

269
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,317
Go there and look after him
if you have the chance.

270
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,320
I remember that
when you guys were little,

271
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,239
he was really attached to you.

272
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,369
Now, let's go have a meal.

273
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,383
Hey, Nu.

274
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,014
Please stay still, Mr. Patient.

275
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,516
Let me tend to your wound.

276
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,525
Is that how wounds are treated?

277
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,111
Yeah, doctors in Chinese films did it.

278
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,487
This is how it's done.

279
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,780
Better now?

280
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,370
I'm feeling better now.

281
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,331
You're also bleeding.

282
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,333
Let me tend to your wound, too.

283
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,143
It's you who stole my first kiss.

284
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,906
Nu.

285
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,204
We need to talk.

286
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,459
I want you to hear the truth
directly from me.

287
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
I beg you.

288
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,973
Make sure he can't get to me.

289
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,434
Yes, Master.

290
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,294
As your bodyguards,

291
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,588
we assure you that
Sun won’t get near you.

292
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,218
Thank you very much.

293
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,344
Study hard, Master.

294
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,723
Oh, Lin and Ploy.

295
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,978
What's going on, Nu?

296
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,897
Did yesterday’s incident

297
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,066
make you call those bodyguards?

298
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,528
I usually have them by my side,

299
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,154
but with more of them.

300
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,283
It's just that you two
have never seen them.

301
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,951
Are you

302
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,996
some faraway prince
hiding out in this country?

303
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,248
You're speaking nonsense.

304
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,457
Let's go already.

305
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes, Your Highness.

306
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,299
Let's go!

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,566
At this rate...

308
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,027
He's blocked you
on all social media platforms.

309
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,447
Nu overheard the conversation that day

310
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,657
but not all of it.

311
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,493
So he's misunderstanding me.

312
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,329
Why is it that

313
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,707
when I just want to love someone

314
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,835
it gets this difficult?

315
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,921
If it's this tough,

316
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,797
you should just let him go.

317
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,551
People out there are
waiting to cheer you up.

318
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,137
Why are you burning up?

319
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,680
Are you sick?

320
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:26,725
Huh...

321
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,356
When did you even get this injury?

322
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,900
I'll be fine.

323
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,739
Being so obsessed with that kid

324
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,116
and neglecting yourself

325
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,534
is unhealthy, you know?

326
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,621
I think you should go to a hospital.

327
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:50,624
I know how to take care of myself.

328
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,420
I'm with Man on this one.

329
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,007
If you're not seeing doctors,

330
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,842
then let me take care of your wound.

331
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,677
No.

332
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,303
I'm going to see Nu.

333
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,305
Don't be so stubborn.

334
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,191
Thank you so much, Chain.

335
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,151
But I don’t think

336
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,779
you need to take care of me this much.

337
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,449
I didn't get to see you yesterday, Nu.

338
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,660
That's why incidents like that happened.

339
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,996
I'm actually fine, though.

340
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,711
You're a medical student,

341
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,921
you should be able to take care
of your own wounds, right?

342
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,050
I want you to hear the truth
directly from me.

343
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,303
I beg you.

344
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,097
Make sure he can't get to me.

345
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:54,980
Nu.

346
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,359
Can I take care of you
instead of the bodyguards?

347
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,827
Mm...

348
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,871
I get it, though.

349
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,750
Your partner takes care of you
better than I do anyway.

350
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,418
Chain.

351
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,463
Who are you referring to?

352
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,631
Well...

353
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,217
It's Sun, obviously.

354
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,678
He and I...

355
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,847
It's just a big mistake.

356
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,601
Stuff like that will never happen again.

357
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,780
Whatever bad things
we may have committed against you,

358
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,365
both physically,

359
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,075
verbally,

360
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,701
and mentally,

361
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,662
we sincerely apologize, Your Highness.

362
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,290
May you be blessed with a long life,
good health, happiness, and strength.

363
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,583
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu...

364
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,459
Enough!

365
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,836
I'm your friend, not a monk.

366
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,091
Also, aristocratic terms
are so out of date.

367
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,676
Nobody cares about them nowadays.

368
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,180
Other wealthy kids
don't have such ideas as you.

369
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,308
Their opinions are their own.

370
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,935
Now, thou, when it comes to mine...

371
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,644
- Wait.
- Huh?

372
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,938
When it comes to me,

373
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,107
I really owe you a big time

374
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,859
for being friends with a weirdo like me.

375
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,779
It really means a lot to me.

376
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,030
Aww...

377
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,990
How touching.

378
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,575
Give me a hug.

379
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,452
- Let's do a group hug.
- A group hug.

380
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,745
Come.

381
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,622
Quickly. Time for a group hug.

382
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,515
This time, Professor...

383
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,630
Now, we're back to
being good old friends again.

384
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,924
This means...

385
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,051
I can ask you anything as a friend, right?

386
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,429
Hey...

387
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,725
Your nosy sense is
always tingling, isn't it?

388
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,521
Don't act like you don't wanna know.

389
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,857
Alright, alright.

390
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,109
It's not just you and me, though.

391
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,154
The whole world wants to know, too.

392
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,491
What are you talking about?

393
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,118
It's about Sun.

394
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,330
What's going on
between the two of you, really?

395
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,350
Well...

396
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,605
He's just a senior studying
at the same college.

397
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,107
He's nothing important.

398
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,737
Nothing important?

399
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,481
You've come up with more lies?

400
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,401
In your eyes,

401
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,280
I'm that bad of a person?

402
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,448
I believe in

403
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,200
what I see

404
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,035
and hear.

405
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,579
Doesn’t everything I’ve been trying to do

406
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,209
make you realize something?

407
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:27,919
Realize?

408
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,298
What am I supposed to realize?

409
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,466
Realize that

410
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,474
I like you.

411
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,120
Do you actually hate me this much?

412
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,709
If I'm this horrible of a person
in your eyes,

413
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,919
from now on,

414
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,964
I won't be around anymore.

415
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,505
Pathetic.

416
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,924
If you're here to mess with me,

417
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,469
can you just wait for me
to feel better first?

418
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,431
You think you can beat me?

419
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,475
What?

420
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,645
Because you're Mr. Narut Hemwipat

421
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,773
son of a multi-millionaire?

422
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:12,982
Nope.

423
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,069
'Cause you like me,

424
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,904
so you wouldn't dare do anything to me.

425
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,614
Yeah.

426
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,825
I wouldn't dare do a thing.

427
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,911
What are you doing here, though?

428
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,831
I'm out here worried about you

429
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,084
but if you don't want me around,

430
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,919
I can just leave, you know?

431
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,260
You're not gonna stop me?

432
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,848
I don't know what you want,

433
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,560
but if you wanna make me feel worse,

434
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,689
I just wanna make it clear

435
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,566
that you've won.

436
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,903
You're giving up this easily,

437
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,239
are you really Sun Saharat?

438
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,700
What am I supposed to do, then?

439
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,995
Tell me.

440
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,497
Figure it out yourself.

441
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,291
But you must know that

442
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,252
I've never fallen for anybody this easily,

443
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,172
especially someone childish like you.

444
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,882
You're so not my type.

445
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,509
Why would you say all that
to make me feel even more hopeless?

446
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:22,886
God.

447
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,387
You're so childish.

448
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,058
"I think the reason he did it was that

449
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,144
he has a plan."

450
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,479
- "Right?"
- "Yeah?"

451
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,939
"I just wanna get even with Chain."

452
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,192
"He took my partner from me."

453
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,153
"I just wanna take
someone precious from him in return."

454
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,613
Why are you playing the recording again?

455
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,575
We're not done.

456
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,661
I just got a recording of
the whole conversation.

457
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,723
But you know what?

458
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,684
When I was about to do it,

459
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,229
my feelings changed.

460
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,149
From doing it out of spite,

461
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,737
I actually started falling for him.

462
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,032
Can your mind really change this easily?

463
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,700
Right?

464
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,912
What’s so good about that kid?

465
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,291
He goes from a tiger
to a kitten overnight!

466
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,002
Can you meow for us?

467
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,297
I don't know,

468
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,093
but have you ever
fallen in love with someone

469
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,096
just by looking into their eyes?

470
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,269
- Nope.
- Never.

471
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,773
If you haven't,
you’d better go out there and find them.

472
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,067
Then you'll know

473
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,946
how delightful it feels.

474
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,165
The feeling of delight you said...

475
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,251
How delightful is it, really?

476
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,253
I wanna know.

477
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:52,994
How does it feel?

478
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,372
Having someone precious taken from you

479
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,250
stings, doesn’t it?

480
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,670
Yeah, it hurts,

481
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,342
but it’s not as painful
as what you and Sun went through.

482
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,678
Easy there.

483
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,349
This time,
let Sun be the star of the show.

484
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,937
It's never too late for you
to seek revenge.

485
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,649
Yeah.

486
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,318
I totally forgot.

487
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,196
Today,

488
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:34,202
just making Nu and Sun
get back together again

489
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,999
already satisfies me a whole bunch.

490
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,044
Hey, do you think this camera will do?

491
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,798
No, I don't think so.

492
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,845
What about that one?

493
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:53,680
Where is it?

494
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,058
Make sure nobody's coming this way.

495
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,768
We're in the clear. Hurry.

496
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,311
Give me a moment.

497
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,689
It's done.

498
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,166
I’m not in such a hurry.

499
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,294
The moment Sun slips up,

500
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,881
Nu will come back to me no matter what.

501
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,844
That's because Sun is a huge bastard.

502
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,721
You said he's a bastard?

503
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,014
It's not just Sun.

504
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,601
All of you are fucking bastards.

505
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,354
Before insulting anybody,

506
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,566
worry about yourself first.

507
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,737
If you're being too nosy about us,

508
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,490
I'll make sure
you'll be in a place worse than hell.

509
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,452
I'll give you one hell

510
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,203
of a pain train.

511
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:17,388
This year's University
King and Queen Contest

512
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,599
will be held at
the start of the next month.

513
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:24,604
The highlight of this contest

514
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,524
is the fashion show from
last year's King and Queen.

515
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,151
Please enjoy.

516
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,792
- Woahh!
- Wooo!!

517
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,597
Where is Sun?

518
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,099
Why is Jon in his place?

519
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,188
What?

520
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,524
Why are you looking at me?

521
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:10,858
Well...

522
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,152
Do you know where he is?

523
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,864
How would I know?

524
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:17,740
Huh?

525
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,243
You two are into each other, no?

526
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,373
Into each other? No!

527
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,460
He must have been really sick.

528
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,088
He passed out yesterday.

529
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,236
Uh...

530
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,864
Am I disturbing you?

531
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,866
No, you're not.

532
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,952
Wait, you are...

533
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,538
Four-eyes' bodyguard? Sorry.

534
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,582
Nu's bodyguard?

535
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,250
I'm the head of the bodyguards.

536
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,129
You can also call me his caretaker.

537
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,300
What business do you have with me?

538
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,636
Nu sent you his regards
with this gift basket.

539
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,601
Why is He not here?

540
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,687
Am I too insignificant

541
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,647
for him to come and see me?

542
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,026
I do not think that's the case.

543
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,612
He...

544
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,697
Master...

545
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:40,948
Play it cool.

546
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,909
He has class.

547
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,828
Moreover...

548
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,455
Shush.

549
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,749
He's busy with college activities.

550
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,419
I see.

551
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,547
Really?

552
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,643
I’m just following the condo’s policy.

553
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,979
When a resident is
feeling unwell, I have to...

554
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,772
Hey!

555
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:20,780
By the way,

556
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,115
did you have your medication?

557
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,117
I have taken my medication.

558
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,161
As for food, however...

559
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
With my hand injured,

560
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,084
I can't feed myself.

561
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,380
Having medicine without having food

562
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,090
might upset your stomach.

563
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,384
My hand is all messed up.

564
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,135
I can't do anything, can I?

565
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,553
It's okay, though.

566
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,555
I got you by my side.

567
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,476
Please tend to my wound, please.

568
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,560
Please.

569
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,896
Please!

570
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,356
Fine.

571
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,233
I'll do it

572
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,279
as a thank you for
getting into trouble for me.

573
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,075
By the way, what do I have to do?

574
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,245
All that's left is putting on a bandage.

575
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,249
Where is it?

576
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,792
It's in my bedroom.

577
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,545
Uh...

578
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,005
Ruj, feel free to leave without me.

579
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,172
Yes.

580
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,719
Thank you!

581
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:32,935
Nu!

582
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,401
What's all this?

583
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,488
You said you were starving,
and that nobody was taking care of you.

584
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,534
You just keep lying to me, don't you?

585
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,789
People sent me those.

586
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,333
What do you want me to do with them?

587
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,671
Just send them back,

588
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,923
or simply decline the gifts.

589
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,634
I can't hurt their feelings.

590
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,303
They put their hearts
into sending the gifts.

591
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,347
What about my feelings?

592
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,355
I promise you that

593
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,900
I won't accept any more gifts
from anyone else.

594
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,651
However, you have to help me.

595
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,279
With what?

596
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,157
From now on,

597
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,535
I will tell everyone that
I've got a partner taking care of me.

598
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,662
So...

599
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,624
Please be in this relationship with me.

600
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,754
You always take things too lightly.

601
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,714
What if I say that I'm serious?

602
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,718
Will you say yes?

603
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,225
Please be my lover.

604
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,732
Don't get flustered.

605
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,819
This handsome guy

606
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,030
is all yours.

607
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,160
You...

608
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,871
Why did you have to say that?

609
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,833
I was about to say yes.

610
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,585
So you're saying yes?

611
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:22,670
Wait...

612
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,338
I fumbled.

613
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,631
It's too late now.

614
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,716
With that said,

615
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,594
we're a couple now, right?

616
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,766
If that's the case,

617
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,686
kiss me.

618
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,105
If it's not,

619
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,025
I'll kiss you until you say yes.

620
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,338
Are you actually happy?

621
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,063
I just want you to be happy

622
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,648
just like I do.

623
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,151
This means

624
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,778
you actually love me, right?

625
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,739
We've made it this far,

626
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,824
and you still have no clue?

627
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,002
With my lover being this sweet,

628
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,380
I can't let anyone
lay a finger on you, no?

629
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,218
Don't be so possessive

630
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,762
because

631
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,682
this lovely man

632
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:01,060
is all yours.

633
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,462
Chain.

634
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,137
You look absent-minded.

635
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,725
Do you want me to find a girl
to brighten up your day?

636
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,691
If Nu didn't say no,

637
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,028
it means that I'm not heartbroken.

638
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,575
I do wanna keep your hopes up,

639
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,579
but this time, I think

640
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,831
you should brace yourself.

641
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,313
Here.

642
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,066
Read it aloud.

643
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,454
"This is my sincere intention
to push our school forward."

644
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,248
"It is my desire to ensure
my brothers and sisters

645
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,376
have a wonderful time in this school."

646
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:35,172
"I, Gundam, volunteer to be
the student council president

647
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:39,259
and be the mouthpiece for students,
bringing about change on important issues."

648
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,721
"I promise to do my best

649
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,973
and be the best president I can."

650
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,645
How did I do?

651
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,562
God.

652
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,233
You sounded so great,
you totally deserve the title.

653
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,403
This means that I've done it, right?

654
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,071
I can now speak
in front of everyone, right?

655
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,073
Not yet.

656
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:01,698
What?

657
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,660
You still have to practice,

658
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,620
practice,

659
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,330
and practice

660
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,333
until you can do better than this.

661
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,377
Come on.

662
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,254
Why do you have to be so rough on me?

663
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,173
I don't want you to fail this

664
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,427
because this rival of yours

665
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,678
can do so much better.

666
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,807
Are you flexing, complimenting yourself,

667
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,392
or cheering me up?

668
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,435
Make up your mind.

669
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,189
Okay. I'll go easy on you

670
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:35,566
just a little bit.

671
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:37,943
No need.

672
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,737
I'm gonna practice,

673
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,323
practice, and practice

674
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,825
until I blow you out of the water.

675
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,994
So now, you've gotta listen

676
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,412
listen, and listen

677
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,539
until I'm better than you.

678
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,292
No problem.

679
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,877
Bring it on.

680
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,271
I...

681
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,814
I slipped.

682
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,483
Yeah, I guess.

683
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,403
If you were the student president,

684
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,948
the first thing you ought to deal with
is the trash problem.

685
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,117
Yeah.

686
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,911
I'll clean everything up myself.

687
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,081
I have to practice, no?

688
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,506
"I promise..."

689
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,424
"I promise. Thank you."

690
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:54,811
As your campaign assistant,

691
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,024
I've figured out a way to help you.

692
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,451
I guess you could say that

693
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,703
you’ve already lost before the game begins?

694
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,580
If you think you're going to lose,

695
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,707
you might as well give up already.

696
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,125
He's not gonna lose

697
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,462
because I'm helping him become
the next student president.

698
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,756
This is Mr. Danai and Dr. Orn,

699
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,466
your father's close acquaintances.

700
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,760
I've had my people
look into you for a while now.

701
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,429
I'm sorry for doing this,

702
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,640
but it is necessary.

703
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,309
This is just the beginning.

704
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,478
I can do worse than you can imagine.
