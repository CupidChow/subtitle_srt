1
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:08,644
Hi there all of you oldies, woo!

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,133
Today you are with me, Enjoy, once again.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,066
At Freshy Night Party 2021.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,622
As you all know, our University holds the event every year.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,933
And as we all already know, there is a longer queue each year.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,155
However, for this year, I have to thank Smile, my beloved junior.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,955
For helping me out with the order of the list.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,200
So, let’s not waste much more time.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,733
Let’s start with the first queue.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,755
With Smart!

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,155
Applause applause!

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,888
Smart!

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,555
Such a lovely face.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,000
So, Smart.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,955
What song are you going to sing today?

16
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:50,950
Err…

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,222
I haven’t named it yet actually.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,933
But if I have to put a name on it now, it may be called…

19
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,755
“What if…”

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,755
“What if…”

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,066
You named it yourself like this, so it means that you have also written it yourself, correct?

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,755
Yes, but…

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,555
It’s still a demo song.

24
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,400
But anyway, I hope you guys like it.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,866
Guys, I have to tell you that.

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,377
In order to write a song, it’s not that easy.

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,955
I would like you to tell us a bit about.

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,511
Antecedents of “What if…” How did you come to this song?

29
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,955
Please share with us.

30
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:38,288
It’s a story about me and…

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,466
An elder neighbor that is very close with me.

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,066
We grew up together.

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,466
Ate together, played together and hung around together.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,333
Until one day, I got confused.

35
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,688
So I wanted to know that.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,644
If one day, I am gone.

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,777
How would he feel?

38
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,288
But for me to go and ask him directly, I am not that brave to do so.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,888
That’s why I wanted to...

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,755
Ask him via this song.

41
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,377
Since we have already heard a lot about it.

42
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,000
Let’s not wait any longer.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,266
Let’s listen to the question in Smart’s heart al-together.

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,066
With the song, “What if…”

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,911
Smart.

46
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:56,022
I have tried to not think too much, each time I see you.

47
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:02,488
But my thoughts always end up slipping, each time I’m near you.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,866
Your actions have said.

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,577
As if you had feelings for me.

50
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,600
Is it real?

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,844
Do I think it all alone?

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,288
Going everywhere together everyday like this.

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,866
You call, we talk, for over an hour each time.

54
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,155
But I still have doubts.

55
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,333
Actually, what are you and me?

56
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:42,088
How close are we? Or what is it then?

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,577
What if there are questions from which I wish to know the answers.

58
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,933
What if one day, I say I love you.

59
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,266
What if I wanna be your lover.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,911
I don’t wanna be just your close friend.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,444
What if I have feelings for you.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,644
What if I disappear from you.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,222
Will you just let it be or will you want me to stay?

64
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,533
What if it’s the end of the world today.

65
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,000
What if you want somebody to be with you.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,333
What if the supposition becomes real, what do you think about it?

67
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,244
So awesome!

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,622
Hey, here he comes!

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,977
Hey superstar!

70
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,688
You were great.

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Superstar.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,577
Thank you.
Superstar.

73
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:45,133
Thank you.

74
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,600
Who did you sing the song to?

75
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:51,711
C’mon, let’s go eat.

76
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,133
What?

77
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,911
Let’s go eat.

78
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,244
Again?

79
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,000
Yea, I’m hungry.
Again?

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,688
You guys go ahead first, I will catch up.

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,666
I will stay with him then.

82
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:56,933
Uhh, you come with me now.
I will stay with him then.

83
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,177
Uhh, you come with me now.

84
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:58,688
Make haste then!

85
00:04:58,688 --> 00:04:59,022
Smart, I can stay to accompany you.
Make haste then!

86
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:00,044
Smart, I can stay to accompany you.

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,400
But me, too.

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,066
You were great, superb!
But me, too.

89
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,244
You were great, superb!

90
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,022
And…?

91
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,488
How was it?

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,311
Well…

93
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,310
You did well.

94
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,266
Because I employed your method, Peach.

95
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,577
That’s how I could make it.

96
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:22,311
And when you were on stage.

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,133
How did you feel?

98
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,733
At first, I was nervous.

99
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,644
But when I looked at you.

100
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,555
I could do really well.

101
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,044
So, let’s go eat.

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,022
Sure.

103
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,866
Come, let’s go eat. It’s on me.

104
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,777
Ok.

105
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:51,955
In a nutshell, the song last night…

106
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,288
Who did you write it for, hmm?

107
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,280
Someone nearby.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,688
Why do you bring your face so close up?

109
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,911
Ok, ok, I don’t prank you anymore.

110
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,155
But thanks anyway.

111
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,150
You’re welcome.

112
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,777
Hello there, Smart speaking.

113
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,044
Ah.

114
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,400
Me?

115
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,933
Then, what day should I go for the audition?

116
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,688
What do I have to do?

117
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,911
Ok, got it.

118
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,933
Yes, yes, bye.

119
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,155
Peach.

120
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,822
A music label called to ask me to go for an audition.

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,577
I said already that you would be able to make it.

122
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,777
I’m so excited but…

123
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,977
There are only 3 days left and my song is still a demo one.

124
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,288
C’mon, relax, kiddo.

125
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,733
I will help you write the rest of it.

126
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,422
Really?

127
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,600
Yea, I will write it all.

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,022
How about this?

129
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,422
You come to the audition with me, Peach.

130
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,466
Please, if you are there, I will definitely pass the audition.

131
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,511
And you get to follow your dreams, too.

132
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,800
I have to go anyway.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,977
What do you mean?

134
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,644
Don’t tell me…

135
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:45,733
Yea.

136
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,755
I also got into the audition round
since they came scouting the first group of us.

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,422
Are you serious? Congratulations, Peach!

138
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,800
So…

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,066
Should we go audition as Duo?

140
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,933
Please.

141
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,511
You are main vocalist and I will be your chorus and play the guitar.

142
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,088
Please…

143
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:07,080
Sounds interesting but…

144
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,555
No but please.

145
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,022
Let's go an audition as Duo.

146
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,555
Please.

147
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,422
Please, Peach, please, please, please.

148
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,933
Ok, ok, sure.

149
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:21,422
So we can follow our dreams.

150
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,244
Deal?

151
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,240
Yes.

152
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,488
Oh hey what song are you guys going to sing on the day of the audition?

153
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,888
No ideas yet.

154
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,222
Same with me.

155
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,355
I have been breaking my head for it.

156
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,577
Still, I don’t feel confident about any of it.

157
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,066
Hey.

158
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,777
How about we team up?

159
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,377
Three of us, one team.

160
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,200
Because Peach will do the Duo audition with Smart anyway.

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,777
And we are from different specialization.

162
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,088
Sounds good.

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,777
Ok, count me in.

164
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:09,555
Come, the three musketeers team.

165
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:13,866
Retarded!

166
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:15,288
Hey.

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,711
It’s a gang of three, three of us, dude.

168
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:18,222
Let’s chat about something
that is more useful to life than this.

169
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,822
What about here Peach?

170
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:28,666
What about this then?

171
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,660
This note.

172
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:32,644
Hey.

173
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,640
I think like this is good.

174
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,022
The melody sounds more interesting.

175
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,866
So, let me try to play it.

176
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,400
Umm...

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Peach.

178
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,666
Are you tired?

179
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,777
Not at all. The first part of the song has already been well written.

180
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,222
Really?

181
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:09,022
I will try my best at the audition.

182
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,000
So you can follow your dreams.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,733
Now, it’s no longer just my dream alone.

184
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,600
It’s our dream.

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,977
We have to do it well. The Duo.

186
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,955
Yep.

187
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,511
We must become duo artists.

188
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:29,333
Let’s continue to write.

189
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,177
Here.

190
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,622
I think it has to go higher, or not?

191
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,533
If we go from G to C, it will sound low…

192
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,755
Too low, or not?

193
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,000
Let’s try from G to C then.

194
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,866
Not bad.

195
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,933
Isn’t it strange?

196
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,377
I feel like if it is F, it will sound better.

197
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:36,311
Doesn’t work.

198
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,133
Ok no, no. Let’s try the other.

199
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,244
Hi.

200
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:10,488
Please introduce yourselves.

201
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:15,466
Yes, I am Peach. I am from the Junior Year.

202
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,866
Umm, I am Smart. I am freshman.

203
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,911
Today, we are going to sing the song, “What if…” that…

204
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,155
Both of us have helped each other to write

205
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,733
Sounds interesting that you guys wrote it yourselves.

206
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,266
So, if you guys are ready, go ahead and sing.

207
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:39,933
I have tried not to think too much, each time I saw you.

208
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:47,288
But my thoughts always end up slipping, each time I’m near you.

209
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,555
Your actions have said.

210
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,177
When it looks like you have feelings for me.

211
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,600
Is it ture?

212
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,044
Or was it just me?

213
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,044
Going wherever it is together everyday.

214
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,933
You call and we talk over an hour each time.

215
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,222
Everyone who sees us, they have doubts.

216
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,644
Who are you and me?

217
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,333
How close are we?

218
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,933
Or what else is it?

219
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:35,888
What if, there are questions I want answers to.

220
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,955
What if one day, I say I love you.

221
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,488
What if I want to be your lover.

222
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,488
I don’t wanna be your close friend anymore.

223
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,622
What if I have feelings for you.

224
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,044
What if I disappear from you.

225
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,844
Will you just let it be or will you want me to stay?

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,066
What if the world ends today.

227
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,555
What if I wanna be with you.

228
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:26,311
What if this supposition of “What if” becomes real, what do you think?

229
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,777
Quite good.

230
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,155
Really good.

231
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,800
Yes.

232
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Thank you.

233
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,300
The audition result for both of you is…
