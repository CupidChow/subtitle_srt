1
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,930
Why does it hurt so bad?

2
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,000
Umm, is this thing called “classic guitar”?

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,660
No, this is “acoustic guitar.”

4
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,400
Oh, is it difficult to play?

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,800
Do you wanna try to play it then?

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,530
You want “me” to play?

7
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,200
Sure, come try.

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,400
What?!

9
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
What are you laughing at?

10
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,930
Look, I am laughing at someone who doesn't know how to play, yet still wants to try.

11
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,600
You know? I looked it up and they say this is how to do it, then it is already a song.

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,460
In movies?

13
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,460
Come here, I will teach you some basics.

14
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,530
Fingers. This is how to place your fingers. 2…

15
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,260
By the way, I am Smart, 5th grade.

16
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,800
5th grade still? I am Peach, 6th grade.

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,330
You’re from 6th grade? Sorry that I didn’t call you respectfully since the morning.

18
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,400
It’s fine. As long as I get a guitar pal, everything is okay.

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,060
Where is your house, Smart?

20
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,530
I almost arrived at my house.

21
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,530
This is my house.

22
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh!

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,330
So our houses are neighbors.

24
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,130
Is this your hostel, Peach?

25
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,530
Yes, yes.

26
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,600
Our houses are so close.

27
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,200
At home, I have a music note book. I just bought to use it for some practice. Do you wanna come try it together?

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Sure!

29
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,400
Here, Music note book.

30
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,200
Wanna eat? It’s good.

31
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,330
Do you know? This is my favourite!

32
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,330
But my mum doesn’t like that I eat it. She always complains.

33
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,660
So, if you wanna eat it anytime, just come to my house, alright?

34
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,000
You already said it ok? Don’t take back your words!

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,060
People like me, we are always truthful, c’mon.

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,730
Peach, I have a doubt.

37
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,860
Uh Huh, what kind of doubt?

38
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,200
Well, our houses are neighbors..

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
But why I never saw you before?

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,460
How could you? I just moved in.

41
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,000
From where have you moved?

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,730
Oh, I was living in Chiang Mai. I just moved to study in Bangkok.

43
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,000
My dad has been transferred here for his work. So we came to stay at our Uncle’s.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,600
My dad said that Chiang Mai is now way, way far.

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,260
How did you come, Peach?

46
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,600
Oh, I came by train. And my things came with my dad’s car.

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,400
Wow, by train?

48
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Yes.

49
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,860
You didn’t get to take a train right?

50
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,800
I have always been at home. I rarely go out.

51
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,860
Ok, I will come to share things with you, alright?

52
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Trains emit choo choo sound right. You heard of it before?

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Try this chord. Give me your hand.

54
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,330
Try holding it.

55
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,330
Yea, like that.

56
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,060
Am I doing it correctly?

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,930
You’re good, the sound is no longer strange.

58
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,800
Sorry.

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,530
It’s fine, you can hold my head.

60
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,000
Umm, back at the old house and the old school…

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,130
I didn’t have that many friends.

62
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,400
So, it feels a bit odd.

63
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Hmm, actually, I don’t have many friends, either.

64
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,130
Friends think I talk too much. They don’t wanna listen to me.

65
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,860
Hmm, so..

66
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,530
Let’s be friends, alright?

67
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,330
Yea, our houses are close.

68
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,860
You cannot run away from me.

69
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,080
Hi, new friend.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Keep on playing.

71
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,660
Hold tight.

72
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,860
Here.

73
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,730
Such a baby!

74
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,800
When you don’t eat vegetables, are you ever gonna grow?

75
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,730
People say drinking milk will help you grow and become tall quickly.

76
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,860
That has nothing to do with vegetables.

77
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
You, stubborn kid.

78
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
I am not stubborn.

79
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,530
Why do we have to eat what we don’t like?

80
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,800
Just keep an eye on me.

81
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,930
When I’m grown up, I will do all I want only!

82
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,660
Being an adult is not that easy.

83
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,730
Why do you talk like an old person?

84
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,460
Well, my dad said..

85
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,330
If you are grown up, you have to follow your dreams

86
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,930
Just by listening to that, it already sounds difficult.

87
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:05,930
And, what are your dreams, Peach?

88
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,930
Please, tell me..

89
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,860
Why do I have to tell you?

90
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,730
Please…

91
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,130
No.

92
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,600
Please.

93
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,130
-No.
-Please.

94
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,530
So I can help you out, Peach.

95
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,930
Okay, let’s interchange then.

96
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,860
If I tell you mine, you also have to tell yours, Smart.
Is that fine with you?

97
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,130
If I say it, do not laugh.

98
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,860
Sure, I won’t laugh, I promise.

99
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Well…

100
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,800
I wanna be a singer.

101
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,130
Like..I wanna have my own concerts. I wanna play on stage.

102
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,400
Like..a lot of people come to watch and cheer for me.

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,000
That’s cool, and it’s awesome!

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,530
Totally cool!

105
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,730
I will help you out the best I can!

106
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,930
What about you, Smart, what do you want to be when you grow up?

107
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,930
My dream?

108
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,400
When I grow up, I want to go see your concerts.

109
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,000
I will sit at the front row, right in front of the stage.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,700
Come, let’s eat!

111
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,530
He is so cool playing the guitar.

112
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,200
So awesome!

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,860
Yea, totally!

114
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,930
He swings the guitar, too!

115
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,000
Do you want to try to swing it?

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,060
When up on stage, try it out.

117
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,460
What? You wanna go out to dance?

118
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Did he do it like this just now?

119
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,600
Yes, it really suits you.

120
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,330
Come, come.

121
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,460
This is how they play it.

122
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,530
Sure!

123
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,530
Here, follow him.

124
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,930
Peach.

125
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,460
Peach!

126
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,200
Wake up, Peach!

127
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Wake up, get up and come play!

128
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Let’s play soccer!

129
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
Peach.

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Yea…I am up now. I know, I know.

131
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,530
I will come down in a minute.

132
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,060
Peach.

133
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,930
Peach, wake up, Peach!

134
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,800
Peach.

135
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,130
Okay, I am up.

136
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,130
Why aren’t you awake yet? Do you know what time the appointment is?!

137
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,130
It is almost 8.30 a.m. already.

138
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,200
Yea, yea, okay, okay, come wait inside first.

139
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,660
I will shower and head down.

140
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,060
Get up now! Do not go back to sleep!

141
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,330
Okay.

142
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,660
Mr. Kanthawit.

143
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,060
Do you go to sleep at the dormitory, too, Peach?

144
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,660
Yea, it’s the University’s rule.
