1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,000
Why are you guys so much in a rush?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,100
I told you already that today we don’t go to the class.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,500
No.. we were going to see Smart.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
That boy passed the exams and didn’t tell us anything.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,700
That kid is really smart.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,850
There is no way he wouldn’t make it.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,750
Look, Peach took him for freshman registration.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,500
Yea? Then they should come here soon.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
And we hurried here for that.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,400
Oh, here they come!

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,950
Hey!

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,050
Hi Gun, Gang. Long time no see.

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,400
What’s up? I knew you would make it here.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,650
But that’s good. So, Peach doesn’t get lonely.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,800
But hey Gun, mere compliments are not enough, right?

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,650
Why not?

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,750
For this, we need what is it, man?

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,250
What is it?

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,400
To celebrate, it is!

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,350
But there is one problem like mmm….

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,450
Who is going to buy?

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,600
Lately I have been quite empty-handed.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,400
Peach!

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,750
What’s wrong with you guys? Why do you suddenly make me pay?

25
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,100
Because it’s your beloved brother.

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,600
And he made it here.

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,400
Ok, fine.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,550
Let’s go celebrate this evening then. I will buy.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,500
Yahoo!

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,900
Free food, free food, free food!

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,300
But…

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,250
But I cannot go today.

33
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,450
Why not? You don’t wanna come with us, Smile?

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,150
I really can’t.

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,450
The freshmen have already come. I should go think about Freshy Night Party.

36
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,350
Or else I wouldn’t make it in time.

37
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,750
Then the seniors scold at me for it again. Too annoying.

38
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,100
And, what is Freshy Night?

39
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,500
Oh, Freshy Night? It’s…

40
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,550
A reception for freshmen.

41
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,200
Our Faculty is Faculty of Music.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,100
Therefore, there will be some singing and music playing shows.

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,900
From both seniors and freshmen.

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,800
It’s to bring everyone in the Faculty together. It’s gonna be fun.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,500
Oh hey, Smart, you can sing, can’t you?

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,950
You wanna try it out? I can tell Smile to register your name first.

47
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,450
For your own sake, music records like to scout new kids.

48
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,250
Maybe they like you.

49
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,300
If it’s like that, your future would be really bright, Smart.

50
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,600
Yea…
If it’s like that, your future would be really bright, Smart.

51
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,050
I am not that good yet.

52
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,133
Umm.. I think you are better than us.

53
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,088
How about this? Let’s register your name first.

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,066
Since before Freshy Night Party.

55
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,711
There will be some sort of selection anyway.

56
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,422
If a show is good, that person will get to show themself on stage at the Party.

57
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:23,733
Actually, it is such a good opportunity.

58
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,977
But you can go back and think it over first.

59
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,088
But Peach, you gotta carry out a show on stage.

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,600
The seniors have requested you to do so.

61
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,155
Yea, I know.

62
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,644
I am sooo bored.

63
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,177
Peach, our hot senior.

64
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,888
And when Peach is on stage.

65
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,066
All of my audience is gone. Nobody else stays for my show.

66
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,555
They all go to see Peach.

67
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,555
C’mon Gang…

68
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,022
What is it, why are you sad?

69
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,644
Nothing. I will go cut a tree.

70
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,888
Huh what?!

71
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,644
Wait, look, I think I’m gonna go cut a tree.

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,266
Cut what?

73
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,244
Huh? Well, umm..

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,933
Whenever you tell this joke, you gotta say you have to cut a tree.

75
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,422
Why?

76
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,133
So you can start anew, like planting a new tree.

77
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,844
As a cool person.

78
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,133
The hot guy.
As a cool person.

79
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:57,422
The hot dude.

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,311
I am hot. I am cool.

81
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:01,911
I thought someone like you, Peach, would go to a restaurant.

82
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,288
But then what?

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,155
We end up eating at home again.

84
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,977
Yea!

85
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,755
Because Smart has to come pack up his things for the dormitory.

86
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,222
So why don’t we just eat here?

87
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,066
And it has been a long time since I last came back home, too.

88
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,688
Yea, ok. You…

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,333
Get to eat for free and still complain about it.

90
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,622
Why you change side now, man?

91
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:24,155
Oh, how did you know Smile, Smart?

92
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,066
Didn’t you two just meet today for the first time?

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,622
Oh…

94
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,933
I saw her on your facebook.

95
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,000
Then I know that her name is Smile.

96
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:35,933
Face-u-book-u

97
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,822
What? Well..

98
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,266
Are the classes from freshman year hard?

99
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,977
Is it hard for the first year…

100
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,555
Change of topic so suddenly.

101
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,600
Hey you guys.

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,066
The first year of our Faculty is not hard. You just have to…

103
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,933
Attend all the classes, then you almost got one part of the marks full already.

104
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,288
You can do it, Smart.

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,377
A piece of cake.

106
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,955
Anyway, Smart.

107
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,711
So did you…

108
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,955
Decide to go on stage for Freshy Night?

109
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,777
I am still not sure but…

110
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,355
I heard that you sang last year.

111
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,355
I never thought someone like you would have courage to sing in front of a lot of people, Peach.

112
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,777
That night, Peach became really popular.

113
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,955
Many girls came to scream for him.

114
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,622
He was born there.

115
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,088
We were all shocked.

116
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:25,600
My pal, my pal.

117
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,288
And you?

118
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,711
Ok, if this year you go on stage, Peach..

119
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,311
I will try it out with the audition.

120
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,177
Mmm.

121
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,044
I actually have a song I wanna sing.

122
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,911
A song you wanna sing?

123
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,422
What song?

124
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,622
Yea, what song?

125
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,620
Can’t tell.

126
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,844
If you wanna know, then wait to hear it.

127
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,044
Yea, then wait to hear it.

128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,466
Yea.

129
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,600
Wait to hear it.

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,133
What song again?

131
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:05,600
Not gonna tell!

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,155
I don’t tell!

133
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,555
Ok, how about this?

134
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,688
I will call Smile.

135
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,933
I will tell her to register your name first.

136
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,977
Ok, thanks so much, Gun.

137
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:17,600
Leave some for me.

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,977
So, what is the song you want to sing?

139
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,622
Can’t say.

140
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,177
You deserve it.

141
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,822
Well yea.

142
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,200
Isn’t this piece too big?

143
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:35,400
Gang! Your plate is full, dude!

144
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,844
Yea you guys were busy talking.

145
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,088
I was afraid it would get burnt. So I help you guys eat.

146
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,555
Oh yea? Help? Afraid that it would be burnt?

147
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,022
Yea…

148
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,444
Thank you! Screw you!

149
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,200
Afraid it would be burnt.

150
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,577
Burnt? You don’t eat anymore!

151
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,733
I was hungry.

152
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,222
And it's take too long.

153
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,133
The fire wasn’t hot.

154
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,911
Ok, Smart. I already talked to Smile.

155
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,555
She said umm…

156
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,000
The audition is on the first day of the semester, at noon.

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Yea, and where? They will announce again on the Faculty’s webpage.

158
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,377
Now I have no ideas, either.

159
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,666
So fast!

160
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,022
It’s only a few days away.

161
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,288
What should I do Peach?

162
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,088
Don’t worry, you can do it well, Smart.

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,822
I will look forward to hearing it.

164
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,555
You can do it.

165
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,222
What? What song again?

166
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,844
I said I am not gonna tell.

167
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,533
He said he’s not gonna tell.

168
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,133
Then why do you ask?

169
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,130
I am eating. I haven’t asked anything.

170
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,333
Smart.

171
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,066
Peach.

172
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,311
See?

173
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,977
Everyone else is also newbie.

174
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,777
Nobody is confident.

175
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,133
Just concentrate.

176
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,444
And do how you have practiced it. That’s all.

177
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,066
But…

178
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,844
There are too many people.

179
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,244
I don’t think I can do it.

180
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,888
Let’s go back.

181
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,866
Smart, I am looking forward to hearing your song.

182
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,844
How can you just leave us in the air?

183
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,266
Come here.

184
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,600
The sacred guitar.

185
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,466
It has been blessed since we were small.

186
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,444
Keep fighting! I will see you in the evening.

187
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,444
C’mon, Smart!

188
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,666
So Peach can finally hear this song.

189
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,533
Fighting!

190
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:57,000
Ok, the next one, c’mon up and introduce yourself.

191
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,422
Hi, I am Pangko.

192
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,866
I am lively and I love to sing.

193
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,688
What happened? How did you come here?

194
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,088
I was free and I got bored, that’s all.

195
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,177
That’s why I stopped by.

196
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,111
Oh ok, the next one, c’mon up.

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,688
Hi, I am Smart.

198
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,844
I am an easy-going person and I am quite shy.

199
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,555
I like to play the guitar and to sing.

200
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,466
Oh wow, so much applause!

201
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,444
Can we see your personal pose?

202
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,933
Yea, everyone?

203
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,666
Yes!

204
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,311
His name is Smart, his name is Smart.

205
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,666
He loves to pose like this.

206
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,111
Umm…

207
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,733
I’m Smart. I like to pose like this, like this.

208
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,022
Good! He likes to pose like this, like this.

209
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,133
Ok, the next one, c’mon up.

210
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,133
Yes, hi, I am Jaojom. I am neat.

211
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,244
But if you wanna pick a fight, then bring it on!

212
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,333
The bring it on!

213
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,266
I’m tired.

214
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,933
From studying?

215
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,777
From playing.

216
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,488
Oh, are you guys going somewhere now?

217
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,577
I asked you guys to come help with the Party.

218
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,311
Do you even remember?

219
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,555
Oh yea.

220
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,933
Then come help me think for the Freshy Night.

221
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,022
In a few days…

222
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,020
Yea, where?

223
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,644
Can be under my dorm.

224
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:38,577
Gun!

225
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,400
Can you go send Smart off?

226
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,577
And where are you going?

227
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,800
I will go work with Smile first.

228
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,444
Ok, that’s fine.

229
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,355
I can go on my own.

230
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,577
I wanna take a walk around the University, too.

231
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,088
You sure?

232
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,622
Yea, I will go ahead first. Bye.

233
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,000
See you. Byebye.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,088
Let’s go then. Let’s work.

235
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,177
So much work, and you didn’t come to help.

236
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,888
What about me?

237
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,222
They dumped us?

238
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,022
What should we do? Wanna play games?

239
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,577
Let’s play games.

240
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,177
Hey, but let’s eat first.

241
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,177
-Again?
-I am hungry.

242
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,288
Yea, I also wanna buy some shakes. Let’s go!

243
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,266
Come quickly. I will buy.

244
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,577
What’s with you?

245
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,244
I’m starving.

246
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,080
Smart, you are invited to show in Freshy Night. Congratulations!

247
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:30,000
What to do now Smart?

248
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:33,777
I don’t wanna be on stage.

249
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,377
You bought to eat all by yourself again?

250
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,577
What? Have you ever cared about me, too?

251
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,570
What are you complaining about?

252
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,111
You’re complaining like an old lady.

253
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,400
What old lady? I am your friend, huh!

254
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,133
Here, I have to..

255
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:57,866
Instant noodles without veggies, for Smart.

256
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,911
Well, no. I saw that you..

257
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,488
Were sitting alone for a long time.

258
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,466
And it looked like you were gonna keep on playing for much longer.

259
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,844
I was afraid you would be hungry.

260
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,200
And how did you know that I don’t eat veggies, Gun?

261
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:16,977
Hey, don’t think that only Peach knows.

262
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,111
That you don’t eat vegetables.

263
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,466
I also know it.

264
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,200
I have also been with you since we were young.

265
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,155
Just that our houses weren’t next to each other, that’s all.

266
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,533
Uhh, thanks.

267
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:30,933
And here…

268
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,022
You are practicing the song for the Freshy Night?

269
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:35,020
Yes.

270
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,577
Here, eat first.

271
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,444
Or else the noodles will absorb too much water. When it’s not hot, it’s no longer yummy.

272
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,155
Charge your batteries. Come, let me help.

273
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:00,355
Peach, today I ate fried stir holy basil with minced pork.

274
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,022
But I told them not to put in any holy basil.

275
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:08,288
Peach.

276
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,200
Peach, are you ok?

277
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Yea, fine. I am just thinking about the Party.

278
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,222
Oh yea, the Freshy Night Party is near.

279
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,888
Don’t forget to come see me, Peach.

280
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:15,266
Uhh, here we are. I head out first then…
Don’t forget to come see me, Peach.

281
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,711
Uhh, here we are. I head out first then…

282
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,444
What’s wrong with him?

283
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:26,422
I didn’t do anything wrong, did I?

284
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,866
Hey, what’s your name?

285
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,200
What’s your name?

286
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,577
Your name is?!

287
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,644
Your name is…

288
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,244
You like to pose.

289
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,844
Like this, like this.

290
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,466
You like to pose like this, like this. Oh!

291
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,977
What’s your name? Oh! What’s your name?

292
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh! Your name is…

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,822
Smart.

294
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,244
His name is Smart. Oh!

295
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,866
He likes to pose like his, like this.

296
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,222
What is your name, oh, what is your name?

297
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,755
His name is Am. His name is Am.

298
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,600
He likes to pose like this, like this.

299
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,377
She got shocked. What’s your name?

300
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,370
She forgot her name.

301
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:08,133
She likes to pose like this, like this.

302
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,533
Oh, what is your name?

303
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,711
Oh, your name is!?

304
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,133
Pii.

305
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,933
My name is Pii. I like to pose like this, like this.

306
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:34,755
You didn’t have to pressure yourself that much.

307
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:37,711
Let it go naturally.

308
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,511
If you can make it, good.

309
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,800
If not, it’s also fine.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,111
Well…

311
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,466
I have never played...

312
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,755
In front of this many people.

313
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,111
Well…

314
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,866
I have never played in front of this many people like this.

315
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,244
I only played with...

316
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,955
You alone.

317
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,733
Well...

318
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,622
Imagine that..

319
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,333
You are playing with me alone then.

320
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,333
Not on stage.

321
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:21,911
Just like how we practiced.

322
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,311
The fun way.

323
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:30,022
If it was that easy, it would be cool.

324
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,666
Look.

325
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,911
How many people there are!

326
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:45,488
Then..

327
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,066
Try to choose a focus point.

328
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,111
When I played in my Freshy Night Party.

329
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,977
I also used the same method.

330
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,066
How?

331
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:00,422
Well…

332
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:03,622
Just search for a point to place your eyesight on.

333
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,644
A point where you look.

334
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,200
And you don’t feel pressured,

335
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,822
or uncomfortable.

336
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,533
But relaxed.

337
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,266
Just like you are playing for that person alone.

338
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,022
I don’t get it.

339
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:24,222
You don’t get it?

340
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,044
Let’s do it this way.

341
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,666
You will.

342
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,488
Look at me, Smart.

343
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,844
So you don’t feel shy.

344
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,111
Thanks.

345
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:51,155
You got it?

346
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,200
Hmm?

347
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,133
Look at me.

348
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,688
So you don’t get embarrassed.

349
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,488
I know.

350
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:01,480
Let’s see?

351
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Play for me.

352
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,644
The song you wrote, how is it so far?

353
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,488
I can let you hear it.

354
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,288
But only the melody.

355
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,355
If you wanna hear the lyrics, you gotta wait until I am on stage.

356
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,733
Ok.

357
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,730
Let’s see?

358
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,266
Well, it’s a story about..

359
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,533
Me and one neighbor that I feel so close with.

360
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,555
And?

361
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,644
So, the song last night.

362
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:32,640
You wrote it for who? Hmm?

363
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,288
I will try my best at the audition.

364
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,280
So you can follow your dreams, Peach.
