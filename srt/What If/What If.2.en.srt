1
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,000
Whoa, just by looking at the pile of books, I am already way sleepy.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Don’t be a crybaby, Peach.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,260
What on earth is this anyway that an 11th grader tutors a 12th grader?

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,060
But I didn’t ask you to come tutor me.

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,600
But your dad did.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,200
Dad? My dad?

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Look, your dad said, “I told him to go tutor with his friends, but he never goes.”

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
“Told him to go to tutoring school, he doesn’t go, either.”

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
“All he wants is just to enter the Faculty of Music, Music and Music.”

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,400
You think that in the Faculty of Music, no theory will be given at all, Peach?

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,860
True that, of course there will also be some theory exams.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,800
But they are just basic, easy theories.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,660
Anyone could do it. There is no need of tutoring at all.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,200
Ok, try making this exam for me, then.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,460
Basic and easy.

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,730
Sure.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,860
What are you looking at? Do it, it’s basic and easy.

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,200
Can you not pressure me?
What are you looking at? Do it, it’s basic and easy.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Stop pressuring.

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,260
Basic and easy exam.

21
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,930
But why did you get only 24 out of 100, Peach?

22
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,530
Well, umm, well…

23
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,200
Last night I didn’t sleep much. That’s why my brain doesn’t work that well.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Stop giving me excuses, Peach.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
If you want to enter the University you want..

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,330
You need to pay more attention to tutoring lessons.

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,860
It’s your own future.

28
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,930
Yea, I know.

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,260
Are you another dad of mine?

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,200
Peach!

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,130
Don’t be mad! Are you hungry, that’s why you are mad?

32
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,460
Shouldn’t we take a break to grab something to eat first?

33
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,800
Then we can have some desserts, and later, we can come back to the tutoring classe

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,930
I am not hungry.

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,400
No?
-Mmm.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,130
Wait here then, I will go buy some food for you.

37
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,460
Fried rice as always?

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,640
Whatever, I am not hungry anyway.

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,800
Why do you need to make sound now?

40
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,530
Thanks.

41
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,400
Try and see if it’s good, Peach.

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,730
After eating, we have to hurry to tutor more, Peach.

43
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,330
Nope.

44
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,330
Is it good?

45
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,600
Not bad.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,660
Look, this item for example, you need to solve the equation here first, Peach.

47
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,330
So you can find the answer over here.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,530
Peach!

49
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,060
Oh, Gun, are you here for Peach?

50
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,200
Uhh, yea. But if it’s not a good timing, it doesn’t matter.

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,060
I can just go.

52
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,130
Wait up, Gun!

53
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,060
Oh, Gun, what’s up?

54
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,860
I wanted to ask you to come to the band practice.

55
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,660
It’s just that Gang booked a practice room.

56
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,060
Sure, what time?

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,060
No, you cannot go.

58
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,130
You have to stay for more tutoring lessons, Peach.

59
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,060
But we can tutor during the day.

60
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,930
And then I go for the band practice in the evening with my friends.

61
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,460
Peach, didn’t we already have a deal?

62
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,330
That you would pay more attention to the tutoring lessons.

63
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,330
Ok, ok, don’t raise your voice. It’s fine. So…

64
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,800
Actually, what he says is correct.

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,730
You stay here for more tutoring classes.

66
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,530
Because singing, you already can do it well.

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,660
We are more burdensome at this point.

68
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,930
Uhh, I go first then. Looks like the storm is coming.

69
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,600
Is this brother or father?

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
What are you complaining about?

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,930
Smart.

72
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,600
That’s my friend.

73
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,130
Your senior.

74
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,660
So?

75
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,400
You are about to take the exams, keep that in mind already!

76
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,530
Ahhh, ok, ok.

77
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,460
I give in.

78
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,460
Let’s look at this problem.

79
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,330
For this one, you have to solve the equation here first, so an answer for this item can be found.

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,800
Do you still make the same mistakes, Peach?

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
Do you even get it?

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,260
Item 88 that you are confused about, the answer is 1.

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
Got it?

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Determine frequency distribution table.

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,130
Uhhuh.

86
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,000
This range of points, which one is correct?

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Which one in here is correct?

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,860
Well, 2 is correct.

89
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,200
Because if Gene A and Gene B are in the same Chromosome..

90
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,460
You have to like, make up new cells.

91
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,060
And what about the next item?

92
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,400
You want me to tell you all the answers?!

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Here we have to use…

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,530
This one is intro, oh, you have to play this one first.

95
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,600
Place your index finger on the second string.

96
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
The second string, here.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Ah, yes.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Another finger, uhh, the ring finger.

99
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,130
The third string.

100
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,930
This one?

101
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,260
I guess, yea.

102
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,660
Man, when is it going to be 2pm?

103
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,930
I am about to piss myself already!

104
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,860
Yea, why does one minute take this long?!

105
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,200
Am I gonna get in?

106
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,730
Amen!

107
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,000
I wish we all could get in the same faculty, abracadabra!

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,730
Look, Peach, it’s 2pm now!

109
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,730
Really?! Is it?!

110
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,660
Wait up, refresh the website!

111
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,000
Refresh the website!

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,460
Mr., Mr., Mr., Ms. Ro…Mr., Mr…

113
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,130
Peach, here is your name!

114
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,660
You got in!

115
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,600
Only me left.

116
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,260
Me first, me.

117
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,600
My name, where is my name?

118
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Mr. Kantawit.

119
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,800
Yes!

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,460
Congrats to all of you!

121
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,660
That you could get in the same faculty. Now you are definitely not going to be lonely!

122
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,800
Oh true! At first I was scared.

123
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Adapting to the new wide world of University..

124
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,200
While having you guys with me, I feel better about it.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,730
You are such a big-mouth, Gang.

126
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,930
I know that you only feel good..

127
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,930
Because then Peach can help you out when you have to take exams of music subjects.

128
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,460
Hey, why are you so negative about me, Gun?

129
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,860
He is not that type of a person.

130
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,660
Let’s keep on eating.

131
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,130
What could I help you guys out with?

132
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,200
If I didn’t have Smart,

133
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,730
I wouldn’t have made it to pass the exams.

134
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,200
Thank you, 11th grade boy.

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,660
You’re welcome.

136
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,400
Oh, here is a gift, a prize.

137
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
For the 11th grader.

138
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,860
He already cannot finish eating, give me instead!

139
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,060
Your problem!

140
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,330
Man, give me yours!

141
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,660
Hey, it’s 10 baht each.

142
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,930
I gotta pay?

143
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,000
What kind of pork is this?

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,470
What?

145
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,470
What pork? / What’s this pork?

146
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,900
Pork, what pork is this, do you know?

147
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,970
Ok, no no, he doesn’t pay attention. We can talk on our own.

148
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,370
I am almost a turtle from eating this.

149
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,500
Here, veggies, you want them?

150
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,620
I am always a turtle, man!

151
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,100
Gang, you have eaten so much. It’s not strange why you are so full.

152
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,420
I am still growing. Here, look at my tummy, you see?

153
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,170
We finished the salty dishes, now let’s move on to the desserts!

154
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,170
I am so touched by your generosity.

155
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,170
I always keep fighting.

156
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,050
If my dad saw, we would be in trouble.

157
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,700
Don’t you worry.

158
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,520
I already surveyed outside of your dad’s room.

159
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,800
All lights are off, I think your dad is already asleep.

160
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
You are really prudent.

161
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,970
I would be the one in trouble.

162
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,970
Man, don’t say that.

163
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,070
Peach, what are you doing? If he wants to drink, let him try.

164
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,970
C’mon, Smart wants to drink.

165
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,970
I just wanted to smell it.

166
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,900
Oh, so you don’t drink?

167
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh..

168
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,870
You too?

169
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,900
Right, I don’t want it. You guys go ahead.

170
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,020
Oh, what should we do, dude?

171
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,420
All for us!

172
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Great, let’s go!

173
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,720
Nicely cold.

174
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,250
By the way, when do we have to move to the dormitory?

175
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh, true.

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,150
If I am not mistaken.

177
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,320
I think next week.

178
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,820
After finishing with all the registration.

179
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,970
Then we can start moving things in the dormitory.

180
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,650
Next week already?

181
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,120
Uhh, Peach, you are moving to the dormitory, too?

182
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,720
Yea, it’s the University’s rule.

183
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,050
All freshmen have to stay in the internal dormitory.

184
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,900
And wait until the second year to be able to…

185
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,820
Move to live outside on our own.

186
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,520
Yea, I heard that, too.

187
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,550
There are many activities of college hazing.

188
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,770
And we will have to go back late everyday.

189
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,600
That’s why they make us stay in the dormitory.

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,700
And you have to attend the college hazing?

191
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,970
Yea, I don’t wanna be a part of it.

192
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,970
Actually, I don’t want to, either.

193
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,150
Hey, why are you guys overthinking it?

194
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,900
It’s like a new eye-opening experience.

195
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,350
We get to meet new friends.

196
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,870
This is already University, it’s a new life.

197
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,020
Yea, will there be girls?

198
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,970
Of course, that’s a must.

199
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,700
Then I will be attentive to all college hazing activities.

200
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,320
What is your name? Oh!

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,350
What is your name? What is your name?

202
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,820
You’re losing control of yourself.

203
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,670
Have you finished?

204
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,370
Why didn’t you tell me that you are going to the dormitory tonight already, Peach?

205
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,150
Who is Smart?

206
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,800
Smart?

207
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,900
Peach!

208
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Hi, Smile.

209
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
I am Smart.
