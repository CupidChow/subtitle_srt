1
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,200
What’s that?

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,775
What are you laughing at?

3
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,200
Well, look, I’m laughing at someone who doesn’t know how to play but wants to play.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,025
Here, look, here.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,175
From what I have watched, they say this is how to do it.

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,725
Then it’s already a song.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,475
But that’s in movies.

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,225
Huh, come here, I will teach you some basic.

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,850
Fingers here, do it like this.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,100
Two…

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,000
Do I have to bring it to you, too?

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
Yea, that’s why I asked you, that day.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,050
That I was going to get it today.

14
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,500
ok. I will buy it later.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,700
Ok, I will buy.

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,100
Ok, I can buy it myself, man!

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,800
Hi, Gun, Gang.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,100
Oh, Smart, what’s up? You come here to see Peach?
Hi, Gun, Gang.

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,500
Oh, Smart, what’s up? You come here to see Peach?

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Yes.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,900
Today, you guys going for registration on the first day of the University?

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,400
Yea, then we will go ahead to stay at the dormitory tonight.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,150
Here, new uniform. How’s it?

24
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,100
You go to the dormitory tonight?

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Yea.

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,250
Peach must be busy.

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,650
Maybe that’s why he forgot to tell you, Smart.

28
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,450
I guess so then.

29
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,150
Oh, he's here.

30
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,900
Oh, Smart.

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,650
Here you are. I was about to walk to you.

32
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,000
When will you coming back?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,950
Umm, well…

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,000
Peach, we will bring the bags to my dad first.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,850
It’s just my dad has parked and waited for long time.

36
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,900
Ok fine. Thanks, man.

37
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,550
Why are you frowning?

38
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,450
Are you upset with me? Hmm?

39
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,700
Why didn’t you tell me that you are going to the dormitory tonight already?

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,850
Well…

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,500
I have been busy lately.

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,150
About classes registration..

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,400
Packing, and also moving to the dormitory.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,850
I haven’t had much time, sorry.

45
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,250
And when are you coming back?

46
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,200
I am not sure yet.

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,600
I think… I will have to finish managing this and that at the University first.

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Maybe I will come back before the semester starts.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,750
Or maybe next semester break.

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,350
Oh, really?

51
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,150
Smart, look at me.

52
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,500
You are already in Grade 12, so take good care of yourself.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,450
And concentrate on reading books.

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,750
If you wanna come to see me at the University.

55
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,450
You can always call me.

56
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,250
Take care of yourself, too, Peach.

57
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,550
Don’t stay up too late.

58
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,250
Hmm…
Don’t stay up too late.

59
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,650
Or you won’t make it to the morning classe
Hmm.

60
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,450
Or you won’t make it to the morning classes.

61
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,550
Sure.

62
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,800
Peach.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,750
I will take the exams and follow your path.

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,000
Yea.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,450
See you later.

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,450
Byebye.

67
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,400
Why don’t you update anything at all?

68
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:52,400
<i>'How are the University and the dormitory so far'</i>

69
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,500
Too many vegetables?

70
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,400
♪I know there must be questions that I want to know♪

71
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,850
<i>Smart: How are the University and the dormitory so far?</i>

72
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,350
<i>Peach: The dorm is good. I feel comfortable here. What about you?</i>

73
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,200
<i>Smart: I’m trying hard on tutoring classes. So I can go to the same place as you.</i>

74
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,250
Peach!

75
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,400
What are you doing here? I was looking everywhere for you.

76
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,300
Umm, next time let me know first that you’re coming.

77
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,500
Everyone has been looking for you

78
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,150
Ok, I come.

79
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,150
Go, go!

80
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,600
Hey, are you ok?

81
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Do you miss home?

82
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,250
A bit.

83
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,150
Why don’t you go home some time?

84
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,450
Smart must be waiting for you.

85
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:42,000
I want him to concentrate on his reading for exams for now.

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,850
But..

87
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,750
He is extremely intelligent.

88
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,750
He will pass the exams, doesn’t matter what.

89
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,600
But if I go back..

90
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Smart will waste his reading time still.

91
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,300
Hmm, just for a little bit more, I can wait.

92
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,600
But for me, I am very confident that...

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,950
Smart will surely be able to pass the exams and follow you here.

94
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,000
I am confident about that, too, man.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Yea.

96
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Let’s see, how far have you been practicing? Show me.

97
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,250
Sure.

98
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,950
Hi, Peach.

99
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,950
Ok, you are already on the way to your exams yea?

100
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,150
Yes. How did you know that I have exams today?

101
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,500
Well, my friend’s brother is from the same grade as you.

102
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,800
I heard them talk, so I thought about you.

103
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,050
Anyway, keep fighting!

104
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,800
What about you? How are you, Peach?

105
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,450
You didn’t come back to visit me at all.

106
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,050
Here is the deal. Pass the exams and then we will meet each other here.

107
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,150
Peach, c’mon here. Mind has been waiting too long for me.

108
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,150
Quick!

109
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay, okay. I gotta go first.

110
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
See you then, Peach.

111
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,800
Here I am!

112
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,100
You’re late for classes, and also for the exams.

113
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,500
If the teacher doesn’t count my attendance, you guys have to take responsibility.

114
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,750
Dude, don’t blame them. We are late ourselves this time.

115
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,150
It’s just I was talking on the phone with my brother.

116
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,950
Brother Smart, wasn’t it?

117
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,550
Man, you guys talk too much. C’mon, let’s go to the class.

118
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,750
Who is Smart?

119
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,250
Peach’s beloved brother.

120
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,000
They have sticked together since elementary school.

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,150
Such a gossiper of you.

122
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,850
But who is Smart then?

123
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,350
Yea, will tell later. / You haven’t finished telling.

124
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,500
Oh whoa, you have waited.

125
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,400
Is it true?

126
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,150
<i>Peach : Tomorrow, the University’s results will come out.</i>

127
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,800
<i>Smart : Tomorrow, the first round of the University’s exam results will come out. I’m so nervous.</i>

128
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Coz you have been with just friends, I guess.

129
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,700
I still see, I can still see.

130
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,500
Wait, here.

131
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,100
Man, cannot any longer.

132
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,000
The bed at my mum’s house…

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Hey Gun.

134
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,650
You don’t share your meal with me again?

135
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,150
Hey, don’t!

136
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,100
I’m dizzy. Let me sit first.

137
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,750
Are you okay? Come sit here.

138
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,650
Umm, Peach, can I ask you something?

139
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,850
You wanna ask me in this condition?

140
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,700
Ok, ok, bring it on.

141
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,450
Who is Smart?

142
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,850
Smart?

143
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,850
Smart.

144
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,500
Smart is my younger brother.

145
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
We grew up together.

146
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,800
We lived next door.

147
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,850
That’s why we are really close.

148
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,950
I think…

149
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,650
Smart is like my real brother.

150
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,750
Ah ok.

151
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, that’s it.

152
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,850
And is Mind feeling better?

153
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,300
Yea, a lot better.

154
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,350
So, should we head back already?

155
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,750
Let’s go, get up y’all.

156
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,550
Why sleeping? Get up, quick!

157
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,300
C’mon, quickly. Ouch, so heavy.

158
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,650
Get up.

159
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,950
Ouch.

160
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,500
Over here.

161
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Concentrate on your walk!

162
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,440
<i>Smart : Tomorrow, the first round of the University’s exam results will come out. I’m so nervous.</i>

163
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>Peach : Sorry, I was drunk last night. Let me know when the results come out.</i>

164
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,240
<i>Smart : Not gonna tell ya.</i>

165
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,550
<i>Peach : Oh. But someone like you must have made it through. I look forward to seeing you already.</i>

166
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,950
You naughty boy.

167
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,850
Who are you talking to? Why are you in such good mood since early in the morning?

168
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,350
Silly, I’m only talking to my younger brother.

169
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,450
Anyway, you have arrived late today, huh?

170
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,850
Got hungover?

171
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,650
You weak drinker. Such a low-tolerant drinker.

172
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,450
I woke up with really heavy head.

173
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,450
How about Gun and Gang? They haven’t come yet, either?

174
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,900
Those two?

175
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I haven’t seen even them, not even their shadows.

176
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,100
Are they even awake yet? Let me give them a call.

177
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,950
Peach.

178
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,450
Oh, hey, Smart.

179
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,200
You didn’t want to wait for the results to come out first?

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
They already came out.

181
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And…

182
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If I didn’t pass, why would I even be here then?

183
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,900
Well-done, bro.

184
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Oh, where do I have to go to report myself?

185
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
I will take you there.

186
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,450
Sure.

187
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,800
Oh, Peach, you don’t go to the class?

188
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Mmm..

189
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,700
Skipping one day won’t hurt that much right?

190
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,300
And this is…

191
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,600
Oh, this is Smart, my younger brother.

192
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
You remember? I told you about him the other day.

193
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,850
Hi Mind. I am Smart.

194
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,850
Instant noodles soup with no veggies for Smart.

195
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
Peach, are you ok?

196
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,400
Here it is. I go ahead first then.
