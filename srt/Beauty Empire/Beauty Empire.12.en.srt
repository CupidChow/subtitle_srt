00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,813
Mom is missing?!

356
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,565
This is for you.

357
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,566
Jeju Island?

358
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,444
I hope that someday we
could go there together.

359
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,405
It’s a good thing you found your way home.

360
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,701
You dare show your face here?

361
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,870
This is what you want, isn’t it?!

362
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,746
It’s all about this, isn’t it?!

363
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:17,914
Mmm!

364
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,042
Life is a game...

365
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,295
Just play fair.
