[CLARA] If you're going to talk to me

367
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,032
about getting rid of her...

368
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,408
You did the right thing, Mom.

369
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,743
What?

370
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,455
Did you wake up from your nightmare?

371
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,998
Seems like it.

372
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,584
What is happening, Eddie?

373
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,836
Why the sudden change?

374
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,172
One thing's for sure,

375
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,464
though, Mom.

376
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,551
Velma killed Helena.

377
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,844
It's all because of me.

378
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,306
Just because I slept with another woman.

379
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,849
I did this.

380
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,228
It is my fault my wife is a murderer.

381
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,495
[EDDIE] You know what to do here, right?

382
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,818
The message I'm sending needs
to stick in Noreen’s mind.

383
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,952
