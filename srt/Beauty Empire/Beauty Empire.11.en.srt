00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,095

187
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,941
Oh Miss Velma!

[GATE CLANKING]

189
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,028
Please, come in.

190
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,614
Were you able to talk to Shari?

191
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,996
Here, have some juice.

192
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,455
There.

193
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:40,087
Gee, even I don’t have an idea what’s
going on with that daughter of mine.

194
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,507
Maybe it’s become her habit to ignore us.

195
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,760
She’s even acting like that towards you.

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,137
I want to apologize.

197
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,930
Don’t worry. I will talk to her.

198
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,182
[SCOFFS] There’s no need.

199
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,810
I’m just worried about her.

200
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,729
How about you?

201
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,817
[STUTTERS] Of course, I worry about her.

202
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,279
That’s the reason why I’ve been
trying to call her.

203
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,575
But I thought maybe she’s hiding
because she did something wrong.

204
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,329
I feel so embarrassed about it
that she’s also doing it to you.

205
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,333
Because you contributed a lot to
whatever she has right now.

206
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,710
Um...

207
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:26,342
If I were you, Miss Velma, I would discipline Shari.

208
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,222
Try working with my other daughter.
She’s prettier and wiser.

209
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,852
And she’s been joining pageants before.
So Shari would be worried

210
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,396
- about being replaced anytime.
- [SCOFFS]

211
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,816
Are you hearing yourself?

212
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,236
Are you trying to be funny, Miss Velma?

213
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,739
Of course, I do!

214
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,199
I’m not deaf.

215
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,493
I just cleaned my ears earlier.

216
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,413
Oh my god, I think coming here was a huge mistake.

217
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,832
Pardon?

218
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,753
Well, your daughter is missing, right?

219
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:07,174
But instead of being concerned, this is your initial reaction.

220
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,259
What kind of a mother are you?

221
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,263
Shouldn’t you be protecting her
and defending her?

222
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,394
You know what, the first time Shari approached me,

223
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,480
she was begging me to work for my company.

224
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,065
And I accepted her.

225
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,609
Because she said she would help you.

226
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,945
To improve the quality of your life.

227
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,948
What I don’t understand is

228
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,410
in spite of the fact that Shari is helping you,

229
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,120
you still treat her badly.

230
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,080
I could never do that.

231
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,291
Because if I were her, I wouldn’t last.

232
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,505
I will not allow myself to be sucked
dry by opportunistic leeches.

233
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,258
Do you understand?

234
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,054
You know what, Shari has done so much for you, guys.

235
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,890
The least you could do is be thankful.

236
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,809
Wait a minute.

237
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,311
You’ve been talking for a while now.

238
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,647
You keep speaking in English.

239
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,026
You’re insulting me in my own house.

240
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,529
I let you in this house with respect.

241
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,907
And you’re not a priest to keep preaching.

242
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,950
Okay, let’s go.

243
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,785
Time’s up, goodbye.

00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,996
Where are you going? I’m not yet done with you.

Sir Eddie did this to me, Shari.

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,430
it turns out to be Sir Eddie?

You might regret your accusations.

Shari, I’m telling the truth.

262
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,527
Are you sure?

263
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,825
Maybe you were the first one to make a move

264
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,160
and seduced him so he thought it’s okay?

265
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,079
Shari, I am not that kind of person.

266
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,958
I told you about this because I thought you’re
the first person to understand me!

00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,793
Helena, you thought I would understand?

I understand you have dreams.

269
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,882
So you snaked your way to Sir Eddie, right?

Let me guess.

271
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,303
You would probably blackmail him
if he didn’t choose you.

00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,430

Admit it that you like Sir Eddie.

you're interested, he would love you back?
