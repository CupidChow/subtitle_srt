370
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,515
That's from my house.

371
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,600
That's private.

372
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,935
You think this is acceptable in court?

373
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,440
[NOREEN] What do you need from me?

374
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,942
When you called me earlier,

375
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,112
you said you have something important to say.

376
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,837
[EDDIE ON VIDEO] Velma and Noreen, they're
working together to take me down!

377
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,007
They want to punish me for
what I did to that woman!

378
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,053
For killing Helena!

379
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,222
That's right, Mom.

380
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,431
I killed Helena.

381
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,060
I pushed her off of that damn building.

382
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,614
I know the reason why you
have been doing all of this.

383
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,991
You will get justice

384
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,785
for your sister.

385
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,998
I'm going to give you a copy of this video.

386
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,293
You can use it

387
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,296
as evidence against Eddie.

388
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,632
Why are you doing this?

389
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,303
You know this will be bad
for your son and for you!

390
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,431
I am doing this for him.

391
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,645
This is my way of protecting him from himself.

392
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,316
He needs to pay for all of his sins.

393
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,653
I love my son.

394
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,363
I love him very much.

395
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,574
I don't want to lose him.

396
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,078
I would rather that he pay for his crimes.

397
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,207
As long as he is there and alive.

398
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,386
Thank you very much.

399
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,811
[HELENA ON VIDEO] You're a monster!

400
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,565
Everyone will know the truth!

401
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,073
[EDDIE CHUCKLES]

402
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,455
I'm done with this.

403
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,791
[EDDIE] This is done!

404
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,376
- [EVA SCREAMS]
- [CHARING] Gino!

405
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,253
Noreen!

406
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,463
My daughter!

407
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:20,922
Let's go to her!

408
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,132
Let's go there!

409
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,097
[NOREEN SHRIEKS]
Don't come any closer!

410
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,475
Surrender now!

411
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,309
Not another step!

412
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,227
I will blow this woman's brains out!

413
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,064
[CLARA] Don't hurt him, that's my son!

414
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,106
Please!
Ma'am!

415
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,815
Eddie.

416
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,484
Put down your gun.

417
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,736
Ever since before,

418
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,363
you didn't care about me.

419
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,739
That's not true!

420
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,616
[NOREEN] I thought you were on a hiking trip?

421
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,701
I thought you needed something
to calm you down.

422
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,749
Well, I felt that...

423
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,835
I left something behind.

424
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,630
I think that's you.
