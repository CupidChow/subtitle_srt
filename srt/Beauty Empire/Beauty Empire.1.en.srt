718
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,664
It's so hot outside.

719
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,292
But look at me. I'm still fresh, like an angel.

[JESSIE LAUGHING]

721
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,255
[MARTIKA] But run and don't walk because guys,

722
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,383
this will be sold out really quickly!

723
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,968
Just remember the name,

00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,055
Pantasya Brightening Serum

725
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,348
with Nourishing Hibiscus.

726
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,730
The formula of the
serum can be stolen?

727
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,733
It's not just the formula that she stole.

728
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,901
Even the packaging,

729
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,027
down to the ingredients.

730
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,279
She just translated gumamela to English!

[SCOFFS]

733
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,202
Not everyone thinks of putting
gumamela in their serum.

734
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,537
Then you should file a lawsuit!

735
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,830
Isn't that what they call

736
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,207
Intellectual Property Theft.

737
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,961
Where are you going?

738
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,380
I'm going to confront the thief.

739
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,507
Okay, I'll come with you.

00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,174
No Migoy, I can do this.

00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,051
I can handle it.

Is Shari here?

Do you have an appointment with Ma'am Shari?

745
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,611
No, but is she there?

746
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,989
I'm sorry, ma'am we're not allowed
to just hand out information like that.

747
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,074
So she's there.

What's the problem?

Well!

You aren't allowed to steal,
but that Shari stole from me!

launch Velma Beauty,
