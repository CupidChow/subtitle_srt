out of Velma Beauty?

533
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,861
[VELMA SCOFFS] You tell me, Shari.

534
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,697
You're the one acting like your life is a circus.

535
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,413
Miss V, look, I get it.

536
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,335
You're mad at me because I launched my own product without your permission.

537
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,048
But you know for a fact that
we needed a new product.

538
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,342
Shari, you stole!

539
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,012
You stole her formula!

540
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,275
My sister and I were so thrilled
when she got accepted here.

541
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,526
Are you sure you don’t know her?

542
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,527
No, I don’t know her.

543
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,031
Did you have anything to do with her death?

544
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,742
You know, we’ve been friends for a long time,

545
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,951
but I feel like I still don't know you.

546
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,161
You’re kind of a mystery.

547
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:54,996
So, what’s your plan?

548
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:59,249
Honestly, everything I’m doing is for my sister.

549
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,877
But do you understand why we have to do this?

550
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,754
[UNSURE] Is it Lilet?

551
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,298
Because if we tell her that we know
everything about her sister,

552
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,967
it’s going to open a can of worms.

553
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,345
All our hard work will go to waste.

554
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,722
You’ll pay for this, Shari.

555
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,643
You’ll wish you were the
one who vanished,
