the reason for my success this time,

suddenly have access to my life.

You’re set to take over Miss Velma’s role.

For every shot you take, you get to
ask me anything.

Whatever happened to her was her own doing.

Still, I’m certain she wasn’t a shadow

[NOREEN] I thought your mother wanted
you to stay in Seoul.

I was able to talk my way out of it.

I didn’t want trouble in my bar.

But in any case, don’t allow yourself
to be treated that way.

Why? She’s always mean to you.

Don’t you have your own office

Oh. I thought you’d be flattered.

how happy the board is, finally.

for the success of this campaign.

180
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,873
Even if we all know who truly
deserves the credit.

181
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,335
Excuse me.

182
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,091
Okay! I’m ready to shoot now!

183
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,509
Let’s go!

184
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,844
Hi, Tara!

185
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,515
Okay...

186
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,489
[SYLVESTER] Miss Shari.

187
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,613
Shari?

188
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,367
What’s wrong?

189
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,914
Nothing, madam.

190
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,085
Just something that happened at the photoshoot.

191
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,466
Does it have something to do with Velma?

192
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,594
Don’t worry.

193
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,929
I have the perfect remedy

194
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,349
for a woman’s tears.

195
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,226
Come on.

196
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,854
Come with me.

197
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,156
[TARA] I’m going back to Seoul now.

198
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,910
I have to fix the mess I left there.

199
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,458
Noreen, thank you so much.

200
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,878
You have been there for me
when I needed it the most.

201
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,838
You didn’t give up on me.

202
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,717
And for that, I’m very grateful.

203
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,638
For someone who knows what
you’re going through,

204
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,848
I couldn’t let you face that all alone.

205
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,933
Thank you.

206
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,477
You have been very accommodating,

207
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,147
especially understanding about my situation.

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,108
My best friend forever!

209
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:39,777
You know,

210
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,902
I will miss you.

211
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,487
I think I found a friend in you.

212
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,823
You’re my BFF!

213
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,241
You’re close with her?

214
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,450
Stop messing with me.

215
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,661
I’ll shut you up.

216
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,663
Sorry about my friend.

217
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,915
Come on, it’s fine.

218
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,666
Your family is so kind.

219
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,460
I am glad that I met them.

220
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,004
Call me when you’re in Korea, okay?

221
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,173
And good luck with your plans.

222
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,761
I hope you find everything
that you’re looking for.

223
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,767
But also, you have to take care of yourself, okay?

224
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,354
I don’t want you
to get hurt in any way.

225
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,359
Just call me and let me
know if you need my help.

226
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,360
Okay?

227
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,279
I will, Tara.

228
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,613
Thank you.

229
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,072
I appreciate it.

230
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,283
I’ll miss you.

231
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,624
My BFF!

232
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,709
I will miss you.

233
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,502
Take care of yourself.

234
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,880
- Say hi to your Mom for me!
- Alright. [LAUGHS]

235
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,673
Go ahead.

236
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,759
Let’s go. Bye.

237
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,222
- Bye!
- Move away! Move away!

238
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,017
She smells so good!

239
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,449
[SHARI] Madam Clara, thank you so much for these.

240
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,493
You’ve spoiled me too much.

241
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,038
I feel like I don’t deserve it.

242
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,498
But it feels good, right?

243
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,083
Like they say,

244
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,130
the best therapy is retail therapy.

245
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,425
I agree.

246
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:36,310
Snakeskin, cowhide,
or crocodile leather bags hit different.

247
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:42,483
It’s like they’re giving us power.

248
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:49,740
And it feels like we absorb their power, too.

249
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:55,328
I know it sounds superficial,

250
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,832
but that’s how I feel.

251
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,421
Because, as you know,

252
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,424
I grew up with nothing.

253
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,100
That’s why you’ve dreamt
of entering this business.

254
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,227
And I’m just wondering,

255
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,773
why did you choose the beauty industry?

256
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:30,656
I grew up with very low self-esteem.

257
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,830
I feel like I wasn’t worthy of anything.

258
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,749
I was an outcast.

259
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:51,719
It felt like I didn’t belong
in the society I grew up in.

260
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,849
Even in my own home.

261
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,855
It’s because I am a product of…

262
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,317
A product of what?

263
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,160
My mother being raped.

264
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:28,130
So she treats me differently
compared to my siblings.

265
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,303
Even if she won’t tell me anything,

266
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,225
I can feel it.

267
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:52,821
I can feel that she is blaming me
for ruining her life and her career.

268
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,455
So when I met Miss Velma,

269
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:09,588
and she saw me and treated
me like her daughter,...

270
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,056
Oh, I’m sorry.

271
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,476
I’m really sorry.

272
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,731
It seems I shared a lot
already, Madam Clara.

273
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:34,987
At least we’re closer now.

274
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,241
Because you already know a lot about me.

275
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,535
Apologies.

276
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:45,624
Shari, I’m so sorry for
everything that has happened to you.

277
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,045
But I have to admit that

278
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,715
I had my doubts about you before.

279
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,221
Until I saw the campaign, especially now,

280
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,640
after I heard your story.

281
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,231
Now, I am convinced that it’s you, it’s you.

282
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,192
I am what?

283
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,445
That you are the perfect replacement

284
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,200
for Velma as head of Velma Beauty.

285
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:25,247
She needs to get off her
position to save this company.

286
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,586
Madam Clara, Miss Velma will never allow that.

287
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,214
We need to work together.

288
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,885
But, ma’am…

289
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,802
Shari.

290
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,220
You entered this company

291
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:45,309
not to be in the shadow of Velma forever, right?

292
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,311
Am I right?

293
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,856
So you just have to take the risk.

294
00:19:51,732 --> 00:20:01,074
You need to find a partner who has
the same drive and passion as you do.

295
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:07,706
I think I know the perfect person for that role.

296
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,301
[JANA] You have my vote.

297
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,138
[NOREEN] No. You were really after her earlier.

298
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,182
[GINO] Did it for the clout.

299
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,226
Who’s that?

300
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,276
Shari De Jesus?

301
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,533
What came over you?

302
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,994
Why’d you suddenly come here?

303
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,958
I did not come here to pick a fight, Noreen.

304
00:20:55,796 --> 00:21:00,592
I came here to apologize

305
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,263
for everything that I said last night.

306
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,973
You’re right.

307
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:12,271
We both have dreams to replace
Miss Velma in her position.

308
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,149
We just have different reasons.

309
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,654
I’m willing to fight her.

310
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,991
But I need your help.

311
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,785
I thought…

312
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,496
Miss Clara picked you to help me

313
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,542
to take Velma Imperial down.

314
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,888
Who’s that?

315
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:48,849
[CLARA] It was you.

316
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,019
You conceptualized the
whole idea of that campaign ad.

317
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,604
[VELMA] Did I hear it right?

318
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,735
That you're proposing to promote
Shari as COO of Velma Beauty?

319
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,903
Shari will be perfect for that position.

320
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,823
[CLARA] Why are you against it?

321
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,450
She will be the successor to your throne.

322
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,701
[VELMA] I’m still alive.

323
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,369
No.

324
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,995
I will not step down.

325
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,165
[CHARING] Is it okay if we leave you
for a moment here, Miss Grace?

326
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,958
Of course.

327
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,250
I’ll take care of Miss Eva.

328
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,585
Thank you.

329
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,420
So he’s a policeman, huh?

330
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,466
[JANA] You should ask permission first
before touching their things here.

331
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,177
[NOREEN] I know you are threatened by Shari.

332
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,511
But come on.

333
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,223
You are Velma Imperial.

334
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,853
The true queen of Velma Beauty.
