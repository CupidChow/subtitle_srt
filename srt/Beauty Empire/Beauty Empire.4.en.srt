A victim looking for justice,

352
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,708
- oppressed and helpless.
- [SHARI] Stop!

353
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:17,627
Who am I?

354
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:20,839
I'm the one you stole
the serum formula from.

355
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:22,841
In Korea, remember?

356
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:25,801
Didn't I give you a sample serum,

357
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:28,263
and I even said
it was made from Gumamela?

358
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:31,306
I wanted you to give it to Miss Velma,

359
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,725
but to my surprise,

360
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,601
Pantasya Serum now exists!

361
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,395
And to my surprise,

362
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,772
it also contains Gumamela!

[SHARI SCOFFS]

364
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:41,609
[SHARI] Excuse me,

365
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,569
it's not even a unique idea.

366
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,030
Stop acting like you
don't know anything, Shari.

367
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:48,824
You wouldn't have been able to come up
with it if it weren't for the sample product I gave you!

368
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,784
Why would I even steal a formula

369
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:53,455
from a nameless brand?

370
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:57,876
[NOREEN] Maybe it’s because
you have no originality.

371
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,546
[SHARI] I am the brand.

372
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:09,219
[VELMA VOICEOVER]
And just when you've underestimated her...

373
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,723
[VELMA] Remember the serum that
Shari copied from you?

374
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:13,641
[SHARI SCOFFS LIGHTLY]

375
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,394
Maybe it’s best if we forget about that,

376
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,314
for the sake of Velma Beauty.

377
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:22,942
Anything for Velma Beauty.

378
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,906
[VELMA VOICEOVER] And just when you think
she has already become an ally...

379
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:29,991
I forgive you now, Shari.

380
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,711
[VELMA VOICEOVER]
She will stab you in the back

381
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,506
before you even know it.

382
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,730
[VELMA VOICEOVER]
This is a story of vengeance.

383
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:10,985
It’s easy to judge a woman
who’s after revenge.

384
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,478
[VELMA VOICEOVER]
But if you listen to her story,

385
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:49,357
and the answers to her questions,

386
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,570
will you still curse her?

387
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:12,505
Or be her number one fan?

388
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:26,894
This is their confidential project.

389
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:30,981
You should start planning

390
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:33,359
on how to cause a scene.

391
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:38,488
[NOREEN] Let's relaunch two new products,

392

one that I've made, and
another that Shari made.

Did you hear what she just said?

395
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:47,414
Case closed immediately, sir?

396
00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:48,207
Gardo.

397
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,501
Just keep quiet.

398
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:51,377
Give me your phone.

399
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:52,461
My phone? Why?

400
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:55,922
Well, duh? I need to make sure you
weren’t the one who leaked that video!

401
00:23:55,923 --> 00:24:00,303
Can you check Miss Alfonso’s
phone for any incriminating videos?

402
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:01,387
Uhh-

403
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,681
Is there a problem, Noreen?

404
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:09,812
Was it you who
leaked Shari’s video?
