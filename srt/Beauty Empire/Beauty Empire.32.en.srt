00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:12,247
I felt like I died that day.
[KRISELDA SOBS]

183
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:26,553
But I still pushed through joining Velma Beauty, but not to dream anymore.

184
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,265
[KRISELDA VOICEOVER] What I wanted to do...

185
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,060
is to kill Eddie.

186
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,444
You know what, Noreen?

187
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,363
I looked deep into his eyes.

188
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,365
[KRISELDA GASPS]

189
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:57,084
But he didn't recognize me.
[KRISELDA LAUGHS LIGHTLY IN DESPAIR]

190
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,377
He didn't know me.
[KRISELDA LAUGHS LIGHTLY IN DESPAIR]

191
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:01,755
[KRISELDA EXHALES] How-

192
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:03,965
How come? Why?

193
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:09,638
How could he not remember the
face of the person he violated?

194
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:17,854
Only a demon could do something like that.
[KRISELDA SIGHS SHARPLY]

195
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:30,826
Noreen, have you decided?

196
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,162
Are you gonna be the new
CEO of Velma Beauty?

197
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,794
Yes, I'm accepting the position
of the CEO of Velma Beauty.

198
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:43,088
Great news.
Welcome.

199
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,465
In one condition.

200
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,426
And that is?

201
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,178
Tell me what really happened.

202
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:52,596
[KRISELDA SOBS IN DESPAIR]
Noreen.

203
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:54,390
I’m begging you, stand by me.

204
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:55,432
I can’t face this alone.

205
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:56,476
[KRISELDA SOBS]

206
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:00,897
If that’s the case, then we need to win Velma over.

207
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:05,861
We have to find a way to bring her to our side.

208
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:13,910
Us women, we’ll fight back against his game.

209
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:19,040
Eddie Imperial is good
at hiding his crimes.

210
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:22,961
I’m sure Sixto is backing him.

211
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:25,172
I just thought of one way.

212
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,425
One of us has to go undercover.

213
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:30,927
I'll do it.
