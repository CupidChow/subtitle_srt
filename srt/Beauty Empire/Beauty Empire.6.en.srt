That it was a mistake for you to marry
someone like me, who’s older than you.

355
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:10,243
That's not true.

356
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:11,828
Really now?

357
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:18,459
When I couldn’t get pregnant, you cheated
on me with someone younger!

358
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:22,422
Eddie, you broke me.

359
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:25,758
[VELMA INHALES DEEPLY] You broke me so many times.

360
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:32,056
[VELMA INHALES DEEPLY] My body, my soul, my spirit.

361
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,601
[VELMA INHALES DEEPLY] And now you wanna try again?

362
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,731
And what if it doesn't work out?

363
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,443
[VELMA INHALES DEEPLY] What's gonna happen?

364
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:49,991
It's gonna work. We have to try.

365
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,992
[VELMA SIGHS IN DESPAIR]

366
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,786
It's gonna work.

367
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:59,000
We'll have our family, and we'll be happy.

368
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:03,212
Don't hurt me again, please.

369
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,883
[VELMA SOBS] Don't hurt me again.

370
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,596
Never again.

371
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,188
[EDDIE KISSES VELMA]

372
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,609
[VELMA CONTINUES TO SOB SOFTLY]

373
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,279
He’s my friend.

374
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,406
He helped me with the presentation earlier.

375
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:33,158
He even insisted on taking me home.

376
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:35,328
You need to learn how to get along.

377
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,747
So here you go—drink up.

378
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:38,998
Migoy!

379
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,540
[NOREEN] My luggage is really missing.

380
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,417
[ALEX] How come?

381
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,751
[NOREEN] I don’t know.

382
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,003
[SHARI] You’re so careless!

383
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:46,046
I have all my luggage with me.

384
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:47,799
How about you?
Where’s yours, careless woman?

385
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:50,343
[SYLVESTER] I’ll do my best to have
your luggage sent over, Noreen.

386
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:53,638
No need—it won’t arrive in time
for the presentation to Tara Park anyway.

387
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:56,056
The deck is online so
I’ll just use that instead.

388
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,517
But what about the products?

389
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:58,934
How will you handle that?

390
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:00,895
It’s fine. I’ll think of a way, alright?

391
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,396
[NOREEN SIGHS]
I can do this.

392
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,315
I will not give up.

393
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:06,733
That’s the spirit.

394
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,569
Keep the fire inside you burning.
