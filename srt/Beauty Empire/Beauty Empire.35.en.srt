I am ushering you towards a new era.

190

I'm inviting them as a sign

205
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,383
that we can still co-exist
in the beauty world.

We were just invited to the
upcoming Velma Ball.

I mean,

222
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,276
just when we thought that
Miss Velma had been exiled,

223
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,862
she suddenly appears
out of nowhere!

224
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,116
Only to say that she is back.

225
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,992
And not just back,

226
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,119
she's also claiming her throne

227
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,872
by launching her
own beauty brand!

she's not just going
to loosen her grip on the crown.

231
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,795
You know, Martika, I really think this

232
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,090
is going to be a duel of beauty
in the next few days.

233
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,675

are still in Velma Beauty.

236
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,931

to be an intense clash,

237
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,850
and showdown of beauty,

238
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,643

to treat me like this?

Because...

270
