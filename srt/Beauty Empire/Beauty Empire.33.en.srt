Are you going to be the new

Soon enough I'll be able to call the shots.

202

And one of the shots I want to make
is the one where you're beside me.

I'll accept the offer, only if,

00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:02,508
We checked out Noreen's tip
about the prostitution ring,

214

but we didn’t find any evidence.

215

Everyone had already cleared
out from the location.

216
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:13,061
They managed to pack up and vanish
before my team even got there.

has to go undercover.
