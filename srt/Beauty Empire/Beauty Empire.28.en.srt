179
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,780
You'll be safe here.
Uncle Chief is here.

180
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,865
And you have lots of company.

181
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,533
They can take care of you.

182
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,245
Well, just make sure that Alex is safe.

183
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,291
Please, bring him home.

184
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,669
Dasco, what happened?

185
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,380
The storage room caught fire this morning.

186
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,090
The owner got killed.

187
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,300
The owner?

188
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,345
Alex?

189
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,263
Initial impression: faulty gas tank.

190
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,434
Someone must have ignited a fire that
resulted in the burning of the area.

191
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,230
And it just so happens
that Alex was in here?
