Yes.

180
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:29,368
I already told her about Eddie killing your sister.

181
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:40,129
I’ve also explained to her who Marie Armani
really is, and why I became her.

182
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,185
Miss Velma, now that you know
what really happened,

183
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:02,026
and the truth about your
husband, how do you feel?

184
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,031
What's your take on this?

185
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,168
Miss V, you gotta say something.

186
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,761
That's not Eddie's
only mistake, Miss V.

187
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:36,101
We have plenty of evidence proving
that your husband is a pimp.

188
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:41,398
He runs a prostitution ring that involves women
who are unaware that they're being sold.

189
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,235
Your husband is a criminal.

190
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,697
I was one of his victims,

191
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,699
and that's what made
me want to seek revenge.

192
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,411
That’s also why Marie Armani came to life.

193
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,249
Miss V, your husband is a monster.

195
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,922
Why am I only learning this now?

196
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,133
Why did it take me so long to realize?

197
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:19,478
Because he blinded you by using
your insecurities against you.

198
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,485
It’s time to face the truth, Miss V.

199
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,198
Your husband has so many victims.

200
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,784
He’s evil.

201
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,999
And he killed people like they’re rats, Miss V.

202
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:48,090
Just easily disposing them.
Like what he did to Alex.

203
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,219
They’re trying to pass it off as an accident,

204
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,140
but they can’t forever hide the fact that they killed Alex!

205
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:09,278
Most of all, he betrayed you.

206
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,116
For someone who claims to love you,

207
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,287
it was all too easy for him to lie

208
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,040
just to save himself,

209
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,708
and pass the blame on to you.

210
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,794
Enough is enough.

211
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,632
Miss V.

212
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,844
Can you please wake up?

213
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,683
It’s just plain stupidity if you still choose him.

Stop playing the martyr, Miss Velma.

Fine, I'm a martyr.

217
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,330
I'm stupid, I’m foolish, and I'm an
idiot when it comes to love.

218
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:07,503
What can I do? I was just
a woman who loved.

You are a strong woman!

from standing up to a bully.

I'm no longer a part of the
reinventing of Velma Beauty?

Well, apparently Madame Clara considers
you and Miss Velma a package deal.

224

So, now that she's gone-

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,842
My contribution to Velma Beauty’s
success is significant, Noreen!

226
00:18:55,467 --> 00:19:02,557
Madame Clara’s first task for me as
CEO is to remove unnecessary products...
