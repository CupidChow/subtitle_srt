00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,341
Noreen is lucky.

370
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,135
She might get a moment
with that man in South Korea.

371
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,262
Just because he’s good-looking
doesn’t mean he’s kind.

372
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,472
Who knows, he might be hiding something.

373
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,223
So, who do you think looks good together?

374
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:31,892
You and her?

375
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,769
If you like the attention
that Alex is giving you,

376
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,145
just know it doesn't
mean anything to him.

377
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,855
I’m busy with my goal.

378
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,774
And that is to collaborate
with Tara Park.

379
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,611
I've got one rule for myself:
not to stoop down to your level.

380
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,030
Miss V, I have already worked on your request.

381
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,531
It will explode by tomorrow.

382
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,283
Perfect.

383
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,701
It’s an honor to light
the Olympic torch.

384
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,953
Let the games begin.
