in the beauty game, I don’t really care.

184
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,819
Because this is the war we’ve been craving for.

185
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,238
IKR. I know, right?

186
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,324
It’s been trending for a week in social media.

187
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,870
Everybody’s talking about the
showdown between the two.

188
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,747
Factions have been forming.

189
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,001
So, are you team Velma Timeless Beauty?

190
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,671
#Team Vel-Mother of all?

191
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,966
Or Team Shari Beauty Reborn.

00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,344
[MARTIKA] #ShariWillWin

193
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,346
[LAUGHS]

194
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,433
[JESSIE] But let’s not forget
that whoever wins this showdown

195
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:53,062
will be crowned the CEO of Velma Beauty.

196
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,565
[MARTIKA] So choose your queen wisely.

197
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,777
[JESSIE] Who will you vote for?

198
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,880
Sir.

199
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,300
Sir, Noreen left their house.

200
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:29,183
Your mission was compromised the moment
you sent me that flash drive.

201
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,476
That’s why they sabotaged you.

202
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,145
You weren’t careful.

203
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,190
I’m so sorry, sir.

204
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,443
Sir, what’s your next plan?

205
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,278
With them?

206
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,614
Or with you?

207
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,241
Sir.

208
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,911
Sir, are you going to have me killed?

209
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,412
I’m begging you, sir.

210
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,915
I have a family that depends on me.

211
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,168
Grace, I can kill you any time.

212
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,214
But I’m not stupid.

213
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,176
It would be too obvious if
I were to get rid of you.

214
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,097
But you already said that you have a family, right?

215
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:19,065
Sir. I will do anything and everything.

216
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,443
Just don’t get rid of me, please.

217
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,258
I want you to disappear.

218
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,427
Forever.

219
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,678
Do you understand?

220
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,305
If I hear anything about you—
If you speak,

221
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,890
if you show yourself...

222
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,352
I won’t hesitate to kill your entire family.

223
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,364
Leave.

[PHONE VIBRATES]

225
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,565
[GARDO MESSAGE] Noreen confirmed.

226
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,175
Grace Biglang-Awa.

227
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,803
You may have the face of an angel,

228
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,597
but you’re actually a devil.

[PHONE VIBRATES]

230
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,941
[ALEX MESSAGE] Noreen can we meet?
I have something important to say.

231
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,757
Go ahead, Migoy.

232
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,174
I’ll be fine here.

233
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
Thanks for accompanying me here.

234
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:52,970
Of course.

235
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,097
I got you.

236
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,893
Alright. I’ll go ahead.

237
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,897
Hey, Alex.

238
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,444
Do you remember my friend, Migoy?

239
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,029
Oh. Yeah.

240
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,617
So what’s up?

241
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,620
What’s the important thing you want to say?

242
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,298
Shari.

243
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,719
She has something important to say.

244
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,348
Okay.

245
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,647
[NOREEN] What is it?
Why aren’t you saying anything?

246
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,903
Tell her, Shari.

247
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,113
You promised me.

248
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,744
[SHARI INHALES NERVOUSLY]

249
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,671
[SHARI] Noreen.

250
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,310
I think-

251
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,528
I think Miss Velma-

252
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,495
I think Miss Velma killed Helena.

253
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,837
[HELENA] Just take it easy.

254
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,547
Shari?

255
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,507
Let's go home.

256
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:59,138
[SHARI] Helena was my first friend in Velma Beauty.

257
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,265
Then why did you betray her?

258
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,809
Because I was jealous of her.

259
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,812
Because she was always the perfect one.

260
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,607
Miss Velma often praised her.

261
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,985
[HELENA] Cheers!

262
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,529
[SHARI] I saw you put something in Helena's drink.

263
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,408
[EDDIE] Whatever you’re insinuating here,
I don't appreciate it.

264
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,369
Are you trying to get on my good side?

265
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,914
[SHARI] It's not my fault that
you gave Sir Eddie motive,

266
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,293
and it's not my fault that you're a flirt!

267
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,377
[SLAPS]

268
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,630
[HELENA] I reached out to you because I thought
you were my friend, Shari.

269
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,341
I thought you would understand
what I went through.

270
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,760
I don't know which hurts more...

271
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:45,142
The abuse I experienced,
or my friend refusing to listen to me.

272
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,898
For someone who grew
up without any friends,

273
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,900
I didn't know how to be one.

274
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,360
[SHARI] I was too late,

275
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,864
and I was too drunk.

276
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,662
Deep inside Noreen...

277
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,291
I knew something bad happened.

278
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,379
And you did nothing?
