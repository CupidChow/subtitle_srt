[UNKNOWN VOICE] Did you miss me, Noreen?

357
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,501
I have new information for you.

358
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,928
Why was Noreen's mother here?

359
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,930
And why was she making a scene?

360
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,848
Who knows?

361
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,725
Stop thinking about it.

362
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,479
Your job from now on is
to follow Noreen around

363
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,231
and let me know exactly what she's doing.

364
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,733
Focus on her.

365
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
And the...
[EXHALES]

366
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,700

[SCOFFS]

368
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,536
Shari, that's all for show!

369
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,038
A smokescreen.

[EXHALES]

371
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,958
So that we know everything she does.

372
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,461
Actually, Mother is right.

373
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,591
Noreen is so good, she knows
how to play her cards very well.

374
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,554
You're overestimating Noreen too
much, Miss V, it's just pathetic.

375
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,102
You know, one thing that I've learned in
this business is not to underestimate anyone.

376
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,187
Most especially the pathetic.

377
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:22,901
That's why the silly decision you made
earlier when you threw a tantrum is wrong.

378
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,695
You need to control your damn self.

379
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,115
Instead of embarassing me,

380
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,826
what you do is

381
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,369
make her life difficult,

382
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,371
and beat her.

383
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,625
Fine.

384
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,586
Even if I can't stand her and

385
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,880
we're not on the same level.

386
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,966
I'll keep her around

388
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,094

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,060
I just have one request, Miss V.

[VELMA EXHALES]

What is it?

392
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,570
Please stay in my corner, Miss V,

393
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,616
because you're the only person I can trust.

394
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,414
Shari, I'm always gonna be on your side.

395
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,168
Okay?

396
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,801
Miss V,

397
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,803
Rupert has an update.

398
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,597
I'm listening.

399
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,143
So, um, Miss, I've taken a look
at the source of the video,

400
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,437
just like what you've asked me to but

401
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,398
unfortunately it is really untraceable.

402
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:49,279
I hope you can give me a few more
days just to check on everything but,

403
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,449
I've made sure that this won't spread anymore.

[MASKED INDIVIDUAL] Hello Noreen.

00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,694
I hope you received the folder containing
the marketing collaboration with Tara Park.

407
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,365
I did receive it, thank you.

Were you the one who spread Shari's video?

Yes.

410
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,206

[VELMA] Shari, that is just a show!

00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,947
A smokescreen.

avoid them for a bit.
