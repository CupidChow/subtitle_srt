And forgive that wounded, insecure,

361
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,801
abandoned, scared Velma in me.

362
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,686
[NOREEN VOICE OVER] All of this began
with a simple dream,

363
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,105
with me and my sister, Helena.

364
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,611
Through a beauty soap,

365
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,946
we could rise out of poverty.

366
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,372
[NOREEN] But when Helena was killed,

367
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,335
that dream turned into anger and
a burning desire for revenge,

368
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,088
to make those responsible pay.

369
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,049
I shut from my mind the possibility

370
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,594
that Shari and Velma were victims too.

371
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,806
And that was my biggest mistake.

372
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,188
I had forgotten that every person has a beauty

373
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,440
that is buried under layers of hurt,

374
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,112
and pain inside that's just
waiting to be seen by others.

375
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,796
And isn't that true beauty?

376
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,756
The beauty of the heart.

377
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,386
How we lift others up, by having a beautiful soul.

378
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,181
When we choose kindness over competition.

379
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:58,395
By having empathy. When we
see beauty in every woman.

380
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,439
And not just in ourselves.

381
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,526
Every woman has her own unique beauty.

382
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,823
Beauty belongs to all of us.

383
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,034
It’s for every shade, shape, and size.

384
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,834
And that's where we'll find true beauty.

385
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,296
In a world where we learned to
celebrate the beauty of others.

386
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,217
And this is my beauty empire.
