1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,970

2
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:43,510

3
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,590

4
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,980

5
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,900
Mom?

6
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,610
Of course, I've eaten.

7
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm doing well.

8
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,580
I was okay, but not anymore.

9
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm going to a cafe to relax for a bit.

10
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,120
Why are you being so negative?

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,490
You should encourage me to try,

12
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,400
but you're telling me to give up

13
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,980
You're being pessimistic.

14
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,040
A dream?

15
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,600
Why can't you see this as a dream?

16
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,330
I should drink a very strong cup of coffee and start again.

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,230
All right.

18
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,370
Thank you, Mom.

19
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,390
I'll call you later. Bye.

20
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,190

21
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,480

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,740

23
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,890

24
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,400

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,690

26
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,190
You must've gotten the hang of it, Kim Joo Hee.

27
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,870
No, I'm only trying to meet the deadline.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,240
Is yours not doing well?

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,240
It's the same thing every day. It's probably because I finished it a long time ago.

30
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,610
I'm so jealous of you!

31
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,880
What are you doing there?

32
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,310
Is that a bat?

33
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,460
It's a cat. The one that hangs around here often lately.

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,630
It's for Ga Won.

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,010
Ga Won's here now.

36
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,580
Welcome.

37
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,370
Will you be drinking it here?

38
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,120
Yes, well...

39
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,450
I'll have the brewed coffee.

40
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,870
I'm here alone, but can I have the table for four by the window?

41
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,460
Yes, of course.

42
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,710
I'll bring the coffee to you.

43
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,070
Is there a time limit?

44
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,540
The cafe closes at 8 p.m. so you can stay until then.

45
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,590
The wi-fi password is at the bottom of the receipt.

46
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,140
Thank you.

47
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,650
Hello!

48
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,250
You must've waited a long time.

49
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,850
Oh, is Ga Won here?

50
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,200
Ahjussi, can I get an iced americano? 
  (T/N: term for a man around your father's age)

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,930
Iced americano. Wait a bit, please.

52
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,360
What did you make today?

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,550
I went for a classic today and made a croissant.

54
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,370
Here. It's a gift from me.

55
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,070
What is it?

56
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,470
It's the drawing I saw a couple of days ago!

57
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,560
I love it, Unni! 
  (T/N: term women use to call slightly older women, like sister)

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,650
- Isn't it pretty? 
 - It's so cute!

59
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,230
- Should we have a taste? I'm so hungry. 
 - Oh, yes!

60
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,670
Let's! I'm so hungry, too.

61
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,620
Let's hurry and eat.

62
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,860
Let's enjoy it.

63
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,540
Here you go.

64
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,040
It's so pretty.

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,250
Can I try it now?

66
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,820
It tastes so good!

67
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,800
Here.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,620
Do you want a bite?

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,450
 Thank you.

70
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,470
 Enjoy.

71
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,530
I only ordered one cup of coffee.

72
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,000
The cold coffee tastes fine,

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,910
but try the hot one first and compare the two.

74
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,160
Thank you.

75
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,640
And this was brought in by one of our regulars who's learning how to bake.

76
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,200
It's not something that we sell so don't be burdened by it.

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,330
Thank you!

78
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,800
 ☕&nbsp;𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮&nbsp;1

79
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,170

80
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,730
Done!

81
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,630
Should we grab gamjatang and soju? 
  (T/N: Gamjatang is pork bone soup)

82
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,370
Sounds good to me!

83
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,370
Nice!

84
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,200
Did Hye Ji have dinner?

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,430
Oh right. I have a daughter.

86
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,060
Gosh, I'm so out of it.

87
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,820
Hye Ji, have you had dinner yet?

88
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,780
If you didn't yet, I wanted to grab gamjatang with Ahjussi Seok.

89
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,050
Make fun of you?

90
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,230
Sorry. I'll see you at home later.

91
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,220
Did she already eat?

92
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,350
She wanted to eat gamjatang but couldn't get a hold of me

93
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,570
so she's upset because she just ate something else.

94
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,190
She's my daughter, but she's something else. She's very straightforward.

95
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,310
What a coincidence that both mom and daughter would both crave gamjatang.

96
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,010
Moms and daughters are like that.

97
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,210
Oh my!

98
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,660
Did you already receive feedback?

99
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,440
She texted this morning that she wanted gamjatang.

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,350
No wonder I had a sudden craving for gamjatang today.

101
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,370
Gosh, I should pull myself together.

102
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,450
Moms and daughters are like that.

103
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,040
What?

104
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,870
Let's go.

105
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,970
You came by the store earlier...

106
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,320
Did you leave something behind?

107
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,860
No.

108
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,030
Then what brings you here?

109
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,940
I... want to learn about coffee.

110
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,700
I can recommend a few places to you.

111
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,560
No, I want to learn from you.

112
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,240
My store is just a small neighborhood café.

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,100
I don't plan on hiring anybody since there's no trouble handling it myself.

114
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,610
Just because the owner isn't having trouble doesn't mean that the customers don't find things inconvenient.

115
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm not trying to be irrational.

116
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,800
My college tuition and maintenance expenses...

117
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,340
I was able to make money for all of that by working part-time at cafes.

118
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,750
I'm sure I can also... contribute to your café.

119
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,270
So you've worked in a cafe before.

120
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,000
Then you could be helpful.

121
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm thankful, but I'm not looking for anyone. We have to go because we have to get something to eat.

122
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,660
You need to take responsibility!

123
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,660
Responsibility for what?

124
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,080
My life.

125
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,610
Have you been drinking?

126
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,180
Why would I need to take responsibility for a customer I met for the first time today?

127
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,440
I've changed my life plans after tasting your coffee.

128
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,760
God shot.

129
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,950
If you made me a cup of coffee that would change my life,

130
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,760
you need to take responsibility for the life of the person who drank that coffee too.

131
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,820
This career isn't as sweet and impressive as you think.

132
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,810
Can't you tell just by considering the time I'm heading out to dinner right now?

133
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,140
Don't do it.

134
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm telling you this with responsibility.

135
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,250
If I continue to follow you, it'll be considered stalking, so I won't go too far!

136
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,370
Enjoy your dinner!

137
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,770
Youth.

138
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,180
Indeed.

139
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,440
You liked him.

140
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,560
What?

141
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,540
Stop pretending. That guy from earlier.

142
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,740
Well...

143
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:36,590
When I first started, people looked down on me,

144
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,980
but now, being a barista can be someone's dream.

145
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,460
And so? Are you going to help him achieve that dream?

146
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,730
That is another matter.

147
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,830
Why do you complicate things so much?

148
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,870
So you didn't like me taking care of the cafe by myself?

149
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,080
It's not that I didn't like it. I feel bad for you.

150
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,800
Why? I've been doing well so far on my own.

151
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
What about the future?

152
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,560
If you think about it, the old ones, myself included, are so weird.

153
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,070
They judge people based on how much they earn, the size of their homes, and the engine capacity of their cars. They even comment on people's personalities.

154
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,110
For them, it all comes down to numbers, except age.

155
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,030
Does that mean age is important or not?

156
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,340
This is a good topic.

157
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,240
I think I can write something with this theme.

158
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,600
You're here to relax, but you're talking about work again.

159
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,550
I guess I am your muse after all.

160
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,310
I agree. My treat today.

161
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,200
He's as brave as children are these days.

162
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,720
But he was very polite, so he didn't seem like one of them.

163
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,450
Just say you're not sure.

164
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't even know my own daughter after living together for seventeen years.

165
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,900
I think it's because I'm a veteran.

166
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,390
Veteran? "Back in my day..." 
  (T/N: She literally says "Latte is horse," which is Korean slang for elderly people saying "back in my day.")

167
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,340
Don't be like that. The younger generation doesn't like that.

168
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,270
But don't I deserve to? I really am a latte maker.

169
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,000
I guess he does.

170
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,170
Where did you learn all those terms?

171
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,310
The young customers told me

172
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,460
that I always start my sentences with "Back in my day."

173
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,010
So I asked them what they meant.

174
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,100
And they told me they say that to old people

175
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,350
who try to lecture them.

176
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,930
Did they say that to your face? That must've been so upsetting.

177
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,510
- You drink soju with a red cap, right? 
 - That's right.

178
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:46,130
I'm not shaken when they criticize my food

179
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,780
because I know my food is the best.

180
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,400
But if they don't want to come to my restaurant because of my complaints,

181
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,110
then this will get me in trouble.

182
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,590
So... I'm trying to shut my mouth

183
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,090
these days.

184
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,770
- You should learn from her. 
 - Okay.

185
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,070
Enjoy your food.

186
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,770
Thank you.

187
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,420
She's amazing.

188
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,550
Shall we drink?

189
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,500
Of course.

190
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,920
Gosh, back in my day, the mildest soju had 20% of alcohol, but nowadays, the strongest one has 20%.

191
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,350
You started your sentence with "Back in my day."

192
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,450
Goodness!

193
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,750
Hello, Boss.

194
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,090
If you're not here as a customer, leave.

195
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,270
Oh, I wanted to ask you something.

196
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,140
The coffee I drank yesterday was from Antigua, Guatemala, right?

197
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,190
And?

198
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,080
They're such a popular coffee bean, which I sold and drank often when I worked part-time.

199
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,260
It's also known to be smoky since it's grown in fertile soil in a volcanic area.

200
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,160
But I didn't feel that at all from your coffee.

201
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,570
Instead, I tasted a sweetness.

202
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,170
Did I get that flavor profile right?

203
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,790
- Let me ask something as well. 
 - All right.

204
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,260
Jeju Island is also volcanic, right?

205
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,400
But do their tangerines have a smoky aroma?

206
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
No.

207
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,430
Now that you mention it, you're right.

208
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,310
That's because it's a roasting issue, not a soil issue.

209
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,470
Roasting any coffee bean to be dark roast will give it a smoky flavor, right?

210
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,550
However, I don't think that's the best way to preserve the individuality of the coffee beans.

211
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,400
Everyone has their own tastes though.

212
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,600
So you did taste it properly.

213
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,780
That's why you roast coffee beans yourself.

214
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,980
Thank you.

215
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,140
Hello.

216
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,810
Thank you again.

217
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,920
What are you doing here?

218
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,810
Hello! Can I ask you something?

219
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,660
Me? I don't really know much about coffee.

220
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,150
That night, you said something.

221
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,750
What did I say?

222
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,580
It sounded something like "gatcha."

223
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,040
Oh, "God shot"?

224
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,370
What? Can you repeat it?

225
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,210
Oh right. I had something to ask you, too.

226
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,210
- Me? 
 - Do you remember the song you heard that day?

227
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,640
Song?

228
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,550
The song that was playing when you woke up snoring.

229
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,760
I'm a music columnist, and I've been making the music playlist for this cafe.

230
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,510
I got curious all of a sudden.

231
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,690
I... don't remember it.

232
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,310
Hello.

233
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,650
Can I ask you something?

234
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,030
Do you have some time to spare?

235
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,150

236
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,030
What's your name?

237
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,110
It's Go Bi. Kang Go Bi.

238
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,100
Every moment in life is an obstacle that must be overcome. 
  (T/N: "Go Bi" in Korean can mean "obstacle.")

239
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,970
That's right, it is.

240
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,980
- But the meaning behind my name— 
 - Hold on.

241
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,270
Weren't you here for coffee?

242
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,470
I just had an idea.

243
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,560
- Thank you! 
 - No, I should thank you!

244
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,580
We call that one cup of coffee, that might inspire someone or change someone's life,

245
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,950
a god shot.

246
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,100
This explains it all.

247
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,550
What?

248
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,090
I have something to ask you.

249
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,350
Hold—

250
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,220

251
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,190

252
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,350
Can I ask you something?

253
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,330
Welcome!

254
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,920
Ahjussi, Ahjussi. I found out about that person outside.

255
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,830
Who is he?

256
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,680
A question killer.

257
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,240
A question killer?

258
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,140
He's curious about so many things. Asking about the people in the neighborhood, if the birth rate is high,

259
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,740
if there's a large variety of businesses in the area,

260
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,620
if the owner of this building is self-made or if it was inherited from their parents, etc.

261
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,630
His questions are never-ending!

262
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,400
What do you want?

263
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,160
I want an iced americano.

264
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,730
Come in for a second.

265
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,460
Me?

266
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,680
Let's introduce ourselves. My name is Park Seok.

267
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,740
My name is Kang Go Bi.

268
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,050
- The meaning behind my name— 
 - Mr. Go Bi.

269
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,940
Can you make a latte?

270
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,810
A latte?

271
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,370
Oh yes, a latte.

272
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,420
I can make one.

273
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,420
Come in.

274
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,410
If you need anything, let me know.

275
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,050
Okay.

276
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,450
I guess you weren't kidding about having worked at a cafe before.

277
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,940
- Is it good? 
 - I didn't say it was.

278
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,230
I wasn't able to show off my skills completely.

279
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,230
I can't help but be stuck with my old habits

280
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,970
so I'd rather be able to drop honorifics to the person that I'm going to teach and give a monthly paycheck to.

281
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,300
What?

282
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,660
Would that be okay?

283
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,740
Then...

284
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,120
Come by at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.

285
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,940
Let's start by signing a contract first.

286
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,490
Am I officially hired?

287
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,390
Thank you!

288
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,710
You can get going now.

289
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,700
I've created a mess so I'll just clean that up.

290
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,560
Start tomorrow.

291
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,510
Okay.

292
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,120
Then I'll be off first.

293
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,190
See you tomorrow!

294
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,220
You forgot one thing.

295
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,800
What?

296
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,150
The meaning behind your name, Go Bi.

297
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,580
My parents named me Go Bi after the Gobi Desert. To live a pure and broad life.

298
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,750
Go Bi.

299
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,360
What a nice name.

300
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,970

301
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:19,930
 Welcome!

302
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,260
 Did you hire a part-timer?

303
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,620
 The owner here is no joke.

304
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,500
 How does it feel to be out and about during work hours like this?

305
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,440
 He'll be okay, right?

306
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,780
 Did the owner change?

307
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,920
 Is the owner not here?

308
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,600
 Do you want us to drink this?

309
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,810
 I was craving this cafe's coffee. This is my lucky day.

310
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,940
 Why are you doing this to me? All I wanted

311
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,160
 was to have a good cup of coffee. Is that so hard?
