1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,720

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,040

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
Choose the tastiest one of the two.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,040
- A blind test? 
 - The beans are the same, right?

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,950
It was made with the same dripper, but the tastes are different...

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,920
The extraction method was the same too.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,820
For me, it's the right one.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,390
For me, the left one!

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,330
- The right one for me. 
 - The right one for me, too.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,650
How interesting.

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,500
Tell us why it is interesting, please.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,550
The left one that Mi Na chose used beans that were freshly roasted,

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,930
and the right one used beans that were roasted two weeks ago.

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,630
No way! I thought you roasted them at different points.

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,890
Can you get this kind of flavor from two-week-old roasted beans?

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,860
Besides the storage time, everything else is the same.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,780
Amazing.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,690
I thought freshly roasted beans were the standard for delicious coffee.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,450
That is not always the case.

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,000
I heard that if you leave it for too long, oil forms on the surface of the beans, which quickly oxidizes so it is not good.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,590
The amount of oil depends on the variables of the fat content of each fresh bean, roasting time, and firepower.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,280
There are opinions that say the bean's oil speeds up the acidification and lowers the taste,

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,190
but it is not really a problem if you store it well.

24
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,970
If anything, some people enjoy that oiliness.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,740
Then storing it is the problem. What will you do with the leftover beans in stock if they are not sold quickly?

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,620
There may be a lot of people who feel repulsed from the fact that the beans are two weeks old, too.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,320
That's why I'm torn. It's not like I can give up on the taste.

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,640
That's very unlike you, Sir.

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,810
Then what is like me?

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,040
You never compromise when it comes to taste.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,320
Didn't you know, Go Bi? This person is a total sales guy.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,560
I'm just not at the point of being a charity worker.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,790
If he had only thought about money, then he wouldn't even have done the blind test.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,960
Honestly, the freshly roasted beans were tasty too.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,350
It's only because the maturity of the two-week-old beans was so overwhelming.

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,610
I'm still testing if that maturity can be maintained until three weeks so don't be too disappointed.

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,650
I wouldn't say I'm disappointed.

38
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,630
There are so many variables to coffee.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,390
I thought that was only the case for cartoons.

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,730
Baking too.

41
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,580
That's why it is fun. The process of identifying each variable and controlling it.

42
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,880
I also just had an interesting thought.

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,890
What is it?

44
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,380
My thoughts are still a little all over the place so I will try after gaining some more experience.

45
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,110
Shouldn't it be the opposite of that?

46
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,230
You should try in order to gain experience.

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,760
It goes around and around.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm reminded of someone who said that data, not experience, is the most essential thing when controlling a variable.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,150
Choi Hurt?

50
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,900
Did that person say that?

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,930
That's a little ambiguous.

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,090
That person has always been a little fun.

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,280
 "Fun," you say?

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,350
 He only makes me feel uncomfortable.

55
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,960
 Choi Hurt?

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
I think I have heard of him before...

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,240
Don't you know him? He's a super famous blogger who writes critiques.

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,960
 But aren't videos more trendy than writing nowadays?

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
 He's famous for not following trends.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,830
 He's cynical and harsh, but what he says isn't wrong.

61
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,560
 You're right. Nobody reads long posts these days.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,810
 Anyway, he's someone who once changed the fate of a cafe,

63
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,270
 with one sentence he wrote and spoke.

64
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,410
They even say, "For wine, you go to Robert Parker. For coffee, you go to Choi Hurt."

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,260
Don't you think he came up with that saying and made it popular himself?

66
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,790
 What a joke. A complete joke...

67
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,000
 Do you have some sort of problem?

68
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,330
 The way you talk...

69
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,480
 - is exactly the same as your coffee. 
 - Excuse me?

70
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,430
 I wasn't going to say anything because it's a waste of my time, but I guess I'll have to answer you because you keep asking.

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,900
 I can feel this sense of pride.

72
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,870
 Not from your coffee, but from that tattoo.

73
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,360
 You think you're making something amazing because you're standing over there, don't you?

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,530
 That? It is all fake.

75
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,890
 Hey, let's talk.

76
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,730
 I seem nice, right?

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,020
 A little.

78
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,570
 In the time it takes you to choose your tattoo designs

79
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,260
 you should pick out the defective beans instead. I'm done talking!

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,600
 That crazy punk.

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,290
 You would feel a little bad for him, too, if you hear his story...

82
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,340
What story?

83
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,250
 Apparently, he used to be a promising barista who used to dominate in all sorts of competitions.

84
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,000
 Then why did he suddenly become a critic instead of making coffee?

85
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,620
 Caffeine sensitivity. He can't sleep if he drinks coffee.

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,570
You're about to ask how can he be a coffee critic when he doesn't drink coffee, right?

87
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,440
Yes!

88
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,480
 He drinks less than someone who makes it.

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,470
 It is not that he can't drink it at all.

90
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,150
 He can still drink just one cup before six o'clock.

91
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,830
 He drinks one cup in twelve separate sips so if he doesn't like the taste of it, he will only take one sip per cafe.

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,040
They say he goes around to a total of twelve shops in one day.

93
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,020
Don't ask me. Don't ask me.

94
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,260
Did you enjoy the coffee?

95
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:48,490
You just... asked that to be polite, right?

96
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,600
I asked because I'm really curious about the customers' opinions.

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,060
Wow, how interesting.

98
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,150
Excuse me?

99
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,820
The interior, objects, plates,

100
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,860
and up until the desserts, it is the best.

101
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,790
Thank you so much!

102
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,680
Except one thing,

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,650
the coffee.

104
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,720
Are you saying that compared to everything else, the coffee's taste lacks—

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,030
No, no, no. It's just

106
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,890
black water. No more or less.

107
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,350
Sir, no matter the case, you shouldn't speak like that.

108
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,920
You said that you were curious about the customer's opinion, though?

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,660
Why did you even open a cafe when you have no affection for coffee?

110
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,810
- I really love coffee! 
 - "Love"?

111
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,330
An antique shop,

112
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,860
or an event studio. You should change your business to either one.

113
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,610
That would make both of us happy, don't you think?

114
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,420
How did he review 2dae Coffee?

115
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,110
"A coffee that was made by someone who loves coffee."

116
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,670
"The skills of a master artisan who perfectly controls all the countless variables."

117
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,100
"Taste that makes you believe that you're happy at least in the moment you drink it."

118
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,680
But I have never seen him at the store.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,630
Does he not want to be happy these days?

120
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,630
Are you really curious?

121
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,750
Welcome!

122
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,240
- Long time no see. 
 - Oh.

123
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,130
There are so many empty seats, why here?

124
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,410
He has to receive other customers, too. Do you see me as someone who doesn't even know such basic manners?

125
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,260
I see.

126
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,310
Long time no see, Choi Hurt.

127
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,480
Over here is my employee, Kang Go Bi.

128
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,360
Look here, Newbie.

129
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,090
Are you really curious about why I don't come to 2dae Coffee often?

130
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,560
I don't like hearing the way you're talking to me when we just met, but I do want to hear your reason.

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,220
Because it is always the same no matter when I come.

132
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,250
It is the same right now too...

133
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,940
Is that so?

134
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,930
I think a huge variable showed up.

135
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,930
Go Bi Oppa has completely adjusted to 2dae Coffee too now.

136
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,920
This is the problem with people who are set in their ways.

137
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,770
They're locked up inside their own fortress

138
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,250
and lose objectivity.

139
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,850
At least help increase their sales and then complain about variables.

140
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,690
You're still as straightforward as ever.

141
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,100
What would you like today?

142
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,130
One cup of filtered coffee, please.

143
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,430
Using two-week-old beans.

144
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,710
What are you saying?

145
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,040
Don't play dumb.

146
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,520
I came fully knowing.

147
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,910
You conducted a blind test just now.

148
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,450
Ga Won? Did you happen to post it on your social media?

149
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,640
I did post it, but my account is private!

150
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,780
I may have posted it.

151
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,290
My fingers automatically...

152
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,580
I was a little surprised by the picture of the orange cappuccino too.

153
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,600
This kind of menu at 2dae Coffee?

154
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,850
It's not for sale yet so why don't you order something different?

155
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,340
Don't worry.

156
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm also someone who writes with my own principles and ethics too.

157
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,370
All right, then...

158
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,170
I think I will get going now.

159
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,600
It's time for me to go to my part-time job, too.

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,040
What's wrong? I think it'll be fun to hear his review—

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
"Fun"?

162
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,150
You have to work, too, Mi Na. Let's hurry and go.

163
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,690
I saw a mackerel and stone together on my way here. Would you like to go and see it together?

164
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,010
Oh, really? Where, where, where?

165
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,140
Go safely.

166
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,230
Goodbye!

167
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,390
 ☕ 𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮 7: Mix and Match

168
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,680
Here's your coffee, Sir.

169
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,730
- It doesn't fit. It doesn't. 
 - Pardon?

170
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,840
The orange cappuccino, it's your idea, right?

171
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,450
Yes, what about it?

172
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,100
Did you ever think that the traditions of 2dae Coffee are being tested because of you?

173
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,300
There are times when being tested only makes something clearer too. Enjoy your drink.

174
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,950
 Hey, stand over there. I will take a picture for you.

175
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,670
 - Did it come out well? 
 - It did. Take a look.

176
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,690
 Take the inside too.

177
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,420
 The inside too?

178
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,540
Get out, right now.

179
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,460
Welcome!

180
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,710
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

181
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,530
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

182
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,600
Are you sure this place is famous?

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,590
It's a place that Choi Hurt recommended in the past.

184
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,380
But if he recommended it in the past, it might not taste good anymore.

185
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,250
They don't even have a big variety of beans.

186
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,020
Quietly.

187
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,110
Who is that guy?

188
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,020
What's up with him?

189
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,020
- I'm sorry, it's because he's a writer. Don't worry about him and make yourselves comfortable. 
 - Okay.

190
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,640
Okay.

191
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,820
- Shall we take a picture? 
 - Okay!

192
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,500
Try lifting it up.

193
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,150
Oh! It came out well.

194
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,210
It came out well.

195
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,930
I don't like it.

196
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,070
Sir! This is Yirgacheffe, right?

197
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,250
Yes, that's right.

198
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,760
But it doesn't have the sour taste of Yirgacheffe.

199
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,150
- Oh, that's because— 
 - It's not "sour taste," it's acidity.

200
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,890
Just ignore him.

201
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,040
Just mind your own business.

202
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,390
Is that what you really want?

203
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,570
Of course.

204
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,850
I mean, this is my business.

205
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,160
And your customer wants me to mind my business.

206
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,050
The coffee that you're all drinking right now without even knowing what it should taste like,

207
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,880
it's a G2-grade green bean that comes from the region of Kochere.

208
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,980
Made by the washing process.

209
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,550
Oh, washed is the process of soaking the cherries in water,

210
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,820
for 24 to 36 hours to ferment it.

211
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,230
Oh, 'Why did he stop talking about coffee and then start talking about cherries?'

212
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,720
I would think you're not stupid enough to think of the cherry fruit,

213
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,850
but just in case, the cherry that I'm talking about here...

214
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,740
I'll let you know that it's the fruit inside a green coffee bean.

215
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,440
All right, then! Why... do they ferment it?

216
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,560
Because the flavor and aroma become fuller.

217
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,950
These particular green beans are full of sweet flavors.

218
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,280
You roast it so that the acidity and sweetness made a perfect harmony.

219
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:20,400
I guess that's why you taste the body much stronger than the acidity, right?

220
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
- So what? 
 - What's wrong with him.

221
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,010
We are saying it doesn't taste good to us.

222
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,930
Oh, my... what to do?

223
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,650
I mean... don't make yourselves a fool by showing off how ignorant you are.

224
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,480
Me saying that you should try to understand the roaster's intention,

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,980
is this, this... Is this so hard?

226
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,260
What do you mean, "ignorant"?

227
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,230
Ig-no-rant.

228
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,370
You crossed a line.

229
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,320
What are you doing right now?

230
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,050
I know doing the dishes is tough.

231
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,820
Can you please think of how I would feel, too?

232
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,540
I'm just trying to explain it to them.

233
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,870
You're making me feel a little... uncomfortable.

234
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,880
The subtle acidity of orange and the aroma of flowers.

235
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,240
You can taste the solid structure thanks to the sweetness added to it, can't you?

236
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,170
Moreover, it lingers a long time.

237
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,600
This makes you appreciate Yirgacheffe's different charm.

238
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,450
It is definitely a beautiful coffee.

239
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay?

240
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,280
That is your review.

241
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,160
We have our own reviews, too, so please leave.

242
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,460
Oh, r-reviews?

243
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,330
But how dare you give reviews?

244
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,140
- When you don't know anything? 
 - What did you say?

245
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,770
- I'm sorry. 
 - You think you can earn anything without effort?

246
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,850
No, you'll just fatten the wallets of businesses,

247
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,440
who upload attractive cupping notes for crap coffee and sell them at an expensive price!

248
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,400
- You should stop! 
 - Hey!

249
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,170
Do you have no pride?

250
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,980
I'm saying what you should be saying right now!

251
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,180
I'm sorry... you must be very offended. I will give you a refund for the coffees.

252
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,040
You don't have to give us a refund.

253
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
Let's go.

254
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,070
Why do I have to feel like I'm committing a crime when I'm drinking coffee that I paid for?

255
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,970
He's a customer whose affection for coffee is a bit much... I apologize.

256
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,400
It's not your fault, but you shouldn't let anyone in like that.

257
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,840
If you let customers like that in these days, you'll go out of business.

258
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,950
No, no, no! I'm not done talking yet.

259
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,620
Listen carefully! Yirgacheffe is a province if you compare it to Korea.

260
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,270
Kochere is a county. There's a number of green beans that are produced over there.

261
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,940
But you're saying if it's Yirgacheffe, there always has to be acidity?

262
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,170
Oh, then since it is the same Gyeongbuk Province,

263
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,960
Andong apples and Mundong apples all taste the same?

264
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,080
Is that so? Oh, I didn't know then!

265
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,640
You should stop, Choi.

266
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,550
- Choi? 
 - Choi Hurt?

267
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,860
No way.

268
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,630
Let's go.

269
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,500
If you like something, the first thing you should do is show some respect to the subject!

270
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,950
Although you're probably just pretending to like it anyway!

271
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,350
Are you happy now?

272
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:17,030
Sunbaenim, if you're at 2dae Coffee's level, isn't it manners to tell customers what they need to know?

273
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,380
You're right.

274
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,300
Which is why I'd like for you to leave.

275
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,660
I will go even if you beg me to stay.

276
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,940
After I drink my last sip of the day.

277
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,170
Please leave right now, immediately.

278
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,110
A cup of well-made coffee makes a different flavor when it gets cold too.

279
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,300
You have no right to drink coffee!

280
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,650
How many people do you think... have the same amount of right to drink coffee as me?

281
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,530
Is it okay to disrupt a business just because you know about coffee?

282
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,450
Is a reviewer the same as a gangster?

283
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,780
Do you like Pyeongyang naengmyeon? I like it. 
  (T/N: Cold noodle dish)

284
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,100
Why are you suddenly talking about Pyeongyang naengmyeon?

285
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,090
People who pretend to be obsessed with it by explaining the noodles with incorrect information...

286
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,400
do you think I will do this to people like that, too?

287
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,190
Within my field,

288
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:12,190
it's a reviewer's duty to speak when needed, not like a  gangster's right that you think it to be.

289
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,730
What about respect towards the person who makes it?

290
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,400
If you came to a cafe, you should at least show basic common courtesy towards the barista!

291
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,520
Hold on, hold on. "Barista"?

292
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,360
Are you talking about yourself?

293
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,850
Who else is speaking except for me right now?

294
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,770
Sunbaenim, is this guy really a barista?

295
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,730
If not, then what is he?

296
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,200
He could be a waiter or a cashier.

297
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,350
That is it for me today.

298
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,040
Are you blatantly looking down on me right now?

299
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:51,580
Sunbaenim, this coffee you made with two-week-old beans, you probably heard all the compliments you wanted to hear,

300
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,890
but the stale smell at the end is a bit of a shame.

301
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,070
The lasting impression was a little shaky so I didn't really like it.

302
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,160
Although it was exponentially better than the coffee shops I've been to today.

303
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,700
That's completely accurate.

304
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,800
This is why I like you.

305
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,780
I think the reason is lack of concentration. You should work on your stamina more.

306
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,310
And you...

307
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,610
if you want to be recognized as a barista,

308
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,900
prove it. Not with your words, but with coffee.

309
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,160
Hold on.

310
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,160
Sit down again.

311
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,820
What is it?

312
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,020
You said to prove myself.

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,830
Go Bi...

314
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,150
I still have time and I didn't drink the last sip I was going to take.

315
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,660
But why...

316
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,180
do I need to bet my last sip of the day with an uncertain cup of coffee?

317
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,770
You'll know once you drink it.

318
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,240
Kono dripper and water regulating valve for one-week-old beans...

319
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,750
this is the idea you said you thought of just before?

320
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,390
Yes, I'm going to try it.

321
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,620
But using Choi as your test subject is a little...

322
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,860
Using a Kono dripper with your skill level also...

323
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,220
I practiced a lot.

324
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,140
They say he says the right things

325
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,750
so even if I fail, I will still gain something I guess.

326
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,910

327
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,670
A Kono dripper when you're a mere beginner...

328
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,550
you chose it knowing that because of its short rib, it can easily over-extract, right?

329
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,410
He talks too much.

330
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,620
You even attached a valve to that

331
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,880
and are using the dot brewing method?

332
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,760
How pathetic... just pathetic.

333
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,630
You know that rather than fancy techniques, design abilities are more important, right?

334
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,690
No, no. I told you.

335
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,590
Not with words, but with coffee.

336
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,430
I think the extracting time is a little too long.

337
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,510
I really just wasted my time.

338
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,510
Take it back.

339
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,770
Just taste it instead of talking. You still have time left.

340
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,830
It is obvious even if I don't try it.

341
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,590
It is obvious that it will taste murky and bitter with that long of an extracting time.

342
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,110
If you insisted on tasting the two-week-old beans, this is the least you can do.

343
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,560
I don't want to leave a rough feeling on the tip of my tongue, though.

344
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,990
But then again, what you're saying isn't wrong.

345
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,080
Wow, Sunbaenim!

346
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,640
W-Wow... this guy!

347
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,030
It's a combination of negative nuances.

348
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,970
How could you serve this and say it's coffee.

349
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,830
You need to tell me what the weaknesses are.

350
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,780
Just one thing. The water temperature is too low.

351
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,650
Because I lowered it to 83 degrees.

352
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,560
You really must be out of your mind, or you didn't get enough sleep yesterday.

353
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,370
Sunbaenim! This guy is the variable.

354
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,710
A bad variable.

355
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,180
Excuse me!

356
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,560
You need to try to understand the maker's intentions if you're a reviewer.

357
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,030
If you're going to trash it, you should do it.

358
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,150

359
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,170
- Hello! 
 - Hi. Oh, that, that.

360
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,340
I think you left it out yesterday and didn't wash it.

361
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,140
No, I took it out on purpose yesterday.

362
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,810
Pardon?

363
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,720
I thought the flavors might open up if I let it rest for a day.

364
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:50,510
Is this the leftover coffee from the tasting yesterday?

365
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,320
Wasn't this the original intention of your idea?

366
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,080
Yes.

367
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,520
I thought it would get better after time, but I had to leave it out before six so I mimicked a cold brew.

368
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,750
Do you not like it?

369
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,830
It's definitely better than when you freshly brewed it.

370
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,220
But this is just a mimic of cold brew. It's not an actual cold brew.

371
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,490
It doesn't get better just because time passes.

372
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,380
I guess so.

373
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,420
But there's still a meaning to trying.

374
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,820
Beans that haven't been roasted properly show their flaws more clearly when you extract them at a low temperature.

375
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,300
If I didn't have your temperature... I couldn't even have dreamed of trying this out.

376
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,320
I never taught you that, though.

377
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,590
I'm studying the rest in my spare time.

378
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,080
Is that the intention behind serving it in a tumbler instead of a paper cup too, then?

379
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,950
Yes.

380
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,100
Although that person probably didn't even drink it and threw it away.

381
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,570
No, I'm sure that Choi tried it and read your intentions.

382
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,190
Do you like that guy?

383
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,880
You should've gotten mad countless times in yesterday's situation, but you just held yourself back.

384
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,650
That is not an issue of like or dislike.

385
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,990
It is an issue of how fiercely one approaches their work.

386
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,780
Sincerity?

387
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,590
It is an attitude that is hardly welcomed these days.

388
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,490
That is also mine and Choi's commonality.

389
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,720
With you?

390
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,880
Either way, he's not a very likable person...

391
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,070
No matter how good business is, you feel empty if you don't have someone who can read your intentions.

392
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,060
Whether it's a compliment or criticism,

393
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,100
Choi is still one of the reviewers who write after trying to accurately read the maker's intentions.

394
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,800
Speaking of the devil.

395
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,450
I thought my ears felt like they were burning since this morning...

396
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,870

397
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,960
Did you try drinking it?

398
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,580
A total of three sips...

399
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,840
One was to figure out your intentions.

400
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,970
The other one was because I was suspicious of the first sip I tasted.

401
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,700
You extracted it like a cold brew,

402
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,030
and you probably used a ceramic cup because a paper cup might taste of pulp.

403
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,960
No matter how well you extract it and serve it in a good tumbler,

404
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,180
three hours after the extraction,

405
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,560
it'll drastically start to lose the aroma and flavor.

406
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,830
After 6 p.m. yesterday,

407
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,020
you just went ahead,
without caring if I drank it or not,

408
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:55,210
and even wrote a warning about drinking it within three hours.

409
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,220
Are you done?

410
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,420
Thanks to you, I came here without getting a wink of sleep.

411
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,210
Done.

412
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,390
What about the last sip?

413
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,190
To enjoy.

414
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,300
You really can't lie.

415
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,330
You could've just drank it the following day. Why did you risk it?

416
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,650
Sunbaenim...

417
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,870
He's a pretty charming character,

418
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,340
who doesn't want to disturb others and, for some reason, gives off a vibe that you can trust him.

419
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,090
The fact that he expected I'll be giving him a review,

420
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,350
while returning the tumbler...

421
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,960
he turned out to be quite a meticulous strategist.

422
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,420
Excuse me. I didn't expect that at all.

423
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,130
Anyway, I will get going since I have a lot of cafes I need to try out.

424
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,790
Is he still a bad variable?

425
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,790
I will edit that slightly

426
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,730
to a strange variable.

427
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,630
Hold on!

428
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,770
Strange, s-strange, strange! They only call me back when I reach this point!

429
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,700
What is it?

430
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,890
You caused a scene yesterday.

431
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,610
You're forbidden from entering for one month.

432
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,750
Sunbaenim, that rule... Are you still holding onto it?

433
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,220
I made that rule thanks to you.

434
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,820
I have no reason to come here within a month,

435
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,720
if I went by my normal schedule...

436
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,960
- Turns out you don't only just respect each other. 
 - Gosh...

437
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,590
That troublemaker...

438
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,720
If I want to verify that strange variable...

439
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,990
I still need a lot of data.

440
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,750
I can't believe he banned me from entering.

441
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,000
 Are you open?

442
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,660
 Then let me explain the menu–

443
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,330
 - No thanks. Give us the same thing. 
 - Hey.

444
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,910
 Three cups of coffee here.

445
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,830
 If you look here, there are many different types of coffee.

446
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,050
 - If you tell me your preference— 
 - I have no preference. Just give us three cups of what I drank last time.

447
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,240
 Why does he even come if he's going to do this? I'd drink it just so it wouldn't be a waste of money at least.

448
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,140
 Hey, Young Man!

449
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,090
 Young Man!

450
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,490
 Hey, Young Man!

451
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,280
 Please stop coming now...

452
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,540
 Will he stop coming?
