1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,480
Oh, you were home!

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,590
I'm at my office, not home.

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,190
Did I disturb you?

5
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,970
No... you've been coming by often.

6
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,300
Yes, well... I have a lot of gatherings and stuff.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,710
Gosh, I'm tired.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,420
Well, then you should've just stopped by to see me. Why did you buy all this stuff when I don't even cook.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,190
Do you think I was going to have you cook? I bought them so I can cook for you.

10
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,550
Why?

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,780
What do you mean, "why"?

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,540
Goodness... Ahn Mi Na!

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,320
Why are the side dishes that I made last week still here?

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,760
I don't even have time to eat.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,200
Then do you starve?

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,900
Sometimes.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,930
Gosh.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,030
I told you to change out this refrigerator, didn't I? How can you call this tiny thing a refrigerator?

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,990
I'll be back after I finish what I was working on. The deadline is just around the corner.

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,700
All right.

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,670
But Mom, didn't you wear that last week too?

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,310
Yes, so?

23
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,960
You should change out your clothes first.

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:50,060
 ☕ 𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮 _ 9: Relative But Also Absolute

25
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,440
You don't have cooked rice.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,080
Where did you put the rice?

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,410
I don't have any rice.

28
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,650
You don't have rice?

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,400
I eat well. Don't worry.

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,660
I didn't even ask you.

31
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,810
But you... Have you gotten thinner?

32
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,440
Maybe it's because I work out so much these days.

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,140
I think you're the one who got thinner, Mom.

34
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,970
Are you working out these days?

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,920
I have to if I want to live.

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,600
Is it a dinner gathering today?

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,500
No... tomorrow.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,910
Then why did you come today?

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,260
- To see my daughter's face! 
 - Oh...

40
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,580
Not because you fought with Dad again?

41
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,380
Excuse me, do you not have Panama Geisha coffee beans?

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,330
Oh, no... our café doesn't sell those beans.

43
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,390
Then what about El Paraiso Lychee?

44
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,840
We are not a specialty café, so we don't. My apologies.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,290
Oh, those were specialty beans I see...

46
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,070
I'll come back next time.

47
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,910
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye!

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,400
There's been a significant increase of customers looking for specialty beans these days.

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,740
The third wave is flowing over to 2dae Coffee too it seems.

50
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,570
Do you know the third wave, too, Teacher Joo Hee?

51
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,110
I don't know if you know, but my lover makes coffee.

52
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,160
The first wave was instant coffee,

53
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,950
the second wave was franchise cafés with Starbucks as the representative,

54
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,150
and variation menus with espresso.

55
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,470
Then the third wave is none other than the specialty coffees.

56
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,090
Then are you saying that specialty coffee came to be because of the third wave?

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Wasn't that it?

58
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,840
Teacher, stop teasing your pupil who needs to learn more and quickly tell him.

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,080
The term "specialty" had existed before that already.

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,150
The point of the third wave is the mindset.

61
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,080
"Let's break away from the simple and standardized franchise coffees."

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,210
"The starting point of that is in the green beans." Is this what you're talking about?

63
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,150
You've studied a bit.

64
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,970
I have no time to go around and taste them, but I can at least read about it.

65
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,550
I guess you can say it's the desire to connect the producers to the consumers even more closely.

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,870
It started from the mindset of wanting to share the story of what it took to make a cup of coffee.

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,720
There was a reason why it shifted from just categorizing by countries, but people know the cultivating and working environments now.

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,670
It does make people look quite cultured, though.

69
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,320
I can feel confidence from them too.

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,630
But I don't know if it's that people don't know the original intent or forgot about it...

71
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,850
iI's a little disappointing to see fellows in this field approach it too much like a trend.

72
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,680
They sell because it's expensive and people buy it because they think, "It must be delicious because it's expensive."

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,020
It does seem a little pretentious too.

74
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,150
I would think it probably depends on who made it, how, and who drinks it.

75
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,960
Your conclusion is vague again.

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,140
What do you think, Go Bi?

77
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,250
I'm curious, but I'm still not quite sure.

78
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,070
This is fine. How much more fashionable do you want me to be?

79
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,650
You always wear those clothes. You also said you have a lot of gatherings these days too.

80
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,480
Did I?

81
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,560
You said you don't have time too! Let's go buy clothes next time!

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,880
Gosh... if I knew you would voluntarily spend money I wouldn't have to do this.

83
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,080
Since we're talking about this...

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,930
don't you think you should buy and wear some proper clothes too?

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Over there... it's my go-to café.

86
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,640
Is that so?

87
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,580
Shall we get a cup of coffee before we go?

88
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,150
You said you wanted to go shopping for clothes, though.

89
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,170
I thought you said you didn't want to. Gosh.

90
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,310
Do you think there is an absolute standard to taste?

91
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,640
- Hello. 
 - You're here!

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,900
We have another debate member.

93
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,570
You came right on time. Hurry and sit down.

94
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,720
- Oh, my M-Mom is here... 
 - Oh.

95
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,660
Hello.

96
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,870
Shall we sit?

97
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,720
Did you choose?

98
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,680
What should I drink?

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,720
Should I recommend you something?

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,570
Is it okay if I drink what my daughter recommends?

101
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,970
Mom... you're embarrassing me.

102
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,280
Of course, Mi Na knows better than me.

103
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,220
Then can you give us two lattes? One iced and one hot.

104
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,930
Yes, I'll prepare it for you right away.

105
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,850
Please enjoy.

106
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,410
Mi Na's very awkward... maybe because she came with her mom.

107
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,510
- Is that what you like? 
 - Yes.

108
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,750
I drink it from time to time.

109
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,120
She was like that too when you first came.

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,910
What? Me?

111
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,540
He really is a little oblivious.

112
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,180
I never thought I was someone who made others feel awkward.

113
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,630
It's the situation, not the person.

114
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,920
He's right. No one treats customers as comfortably as you do.

115
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,330
Although sometimes... I think I heard you make your boss feel uncomfortable.

116
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,350
Is it writer's block? I can't seem to pick up my brush...

117
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,600

118
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,780
 Let's eat! Come on out!

119
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,340
Mi Na. I said, let's eat.

120
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,760
Let me sleep just a little more. Just a little...

121
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,860
Sleep after you eat lunch. The sun's been up for hours already.

122
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,740
- Oh, my d-deadline! 
 - What?

123
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,470
- My deadline... 
 - Wh-Wh-What's wrong?

124
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,530
Mom, get out, quickly.

125
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,100
- Quickly, quickly. 
 - What?

126
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,160
Go, go, go.

127
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,100
Damn it.

128
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,360

129
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,500
Yes, Sir!

130
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,890
Oh, yes.

131
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,900
I fell asleep while I was writing the concluding line.

132
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,210
I know you gave me a good opportunity... Yes.

133
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,930
Yes... I'm sorry.

134
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,480
Hey, Mi Na?

135
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,100
Yes?

136
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,370
Could you maybe check something out for me?

137
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,360
What is it?

138
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:21,280
This thing... I don't know how to set my profile picture.

139
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,980
What is it?

140
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,170
I taught you this last time.

141
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,350
Look here. The picture of the flower is here—

142
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,810
No, no. Not that one. I mean the background picture.

143
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,500
The way to do it is the same.

144
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,480
Which one? Did you decide which one to use?

145
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,510
Decide whichever suits me best in your opinion.

146
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,530
It's your phone, you should decide. Why do you always ask other people—

147
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,800
You said you were busy.

148
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,110
What?

149
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,440
I've been asking you to draw one for me for a while, but you would never.

150
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,860
Well, that's because I don't know what you want, Mom.

151
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,090
I'll think about it.

152
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,980
What's this? You don't have a single selfie... it's all pictures of flowers.

153
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,380
It's pretty.

154
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,150
What is this? Is this your medicine?

155
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,390
What's wrong?

156
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,360
Why are you talking about medicine all of a sudden?

157
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,500
Well, you're the one who took a picture of it.

158
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,160
It's medicine for cold and body aches.

159
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,080
I've been so forgetful these days so I took a picture.

160
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,640
Body aches? Why do you get body aches?

161
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,680
Give it here. I'm not done yet.

162
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,410
I think it'll be better if I choose one and tell you, right?

163
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,880
Well... all right then.

164
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,640
Seriously.

165
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,420
What is it? Did something happen?

166
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,160
Oh, nothing... what is it?

167
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,090
Is there something you want to eat for dinner?

168
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,800
Are you not going to go home today?

169
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,980
I'll go after I make you dinner. I'll stay over if it gets too late.

170
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,860
Mom... can't you help me out a little?

171
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,120
What are you saying?

172
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,140
I need to work.

173
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,210
It'll only take a few seconds for you to tell me what you want to eat.

174
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,320
Food is not important right now.

175
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,390
No matter how busy you are, you still have to eat!

176
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,080
Mom, there's a flow to work.

177
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,950
It keeps getting cut off because of you!

178
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,850
I don't know stuff like that very well.

179
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,160
I'll just figure it out myself.

180
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm not asking you to cook for me right now!

181
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,450
Just leave me alone, please!

182
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,030
Then what do I do?

183
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,030
Welcome.

184
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,340
You came alone today.

185
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,470
Yes, because Mi Na's a little busy with work.

186
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,310
Take your time to look and call me when you decide on a menu.

187
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,680
Could you give me a latte, please? Iced.

188
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,210
Yes, I'll prepare it for you right away.

189
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,900
Did you happen to...

190
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,920
Yes?

191
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,830
I was wondering if you chose it because it's something that Mi Na orders often?

192
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,740
You're right.

193
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,930
Then you'll have to change your seat first.

194
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,620
Pardon?

195
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,140
It's a filter coffee made from Ethiopia Sidamo beans.

196
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,340
Thank you.

197
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,450
Is this... the scent of flowers I smell?

198
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,000
It's bright and radiant, but definitely not light.

199
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Just like Mi Na's personality.

200
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,010
Mi Na is like that?

201
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,610
They're also beans that Mi Na actually likes too.

202
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,650
She's quite sensitive, isn't she?

203
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,810
If an artist isn't sensitive, that's much more strange.

204
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,800
That's true too.

205
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,340
She wasn't always like that.

206
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,260
There's a sensitivity that sees familiar things in an unfamiliar way.

207
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,770
Mi Na's that type so I don't think you have to worry too much.

208
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,820
I really don't know my child.

209
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,070
She's a customer who comfortably lets off steam here so I'm always grateful.

210
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,360
You should also comfortably stay a long time and go.

211
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,890
Are you going somewhere?

212
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,390
I'm going to rest a little.

213
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,630
Oh, yes, yes!

214
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,910

215
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,970

216
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,840

217
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,670
Where are you, Mom?

218
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,560
Did you go home?

219
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,980
I asked where you are!

220
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,990
Mom!

221
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,710
Oh gosh, what's wrong with you.

222
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,690
You scared me!

223
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,110
Why didn't you tell me! I didn't know anything!

224
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm so sorry, Mom... I was so wrong.

225
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,250
You sure notice things really well.

226
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,280
It's my fault. It's mine.

227
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,860
I can't live without you, Mom. I really can't, Mom.

228
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,470
You know that, right, Mom?

229
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm all right.

230
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,280
It's early so the probability of curing it completely is high.

231
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,230
What do you mean you're "all right" when you're not!

232
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,170
I'm really sorry.

233
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,430
It's all right, it's all right... I'm all right.

234
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,710
Don't cry.

235
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,120
I'm so stupid.

236
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,680
What? How so?

237
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,250
I mean... I didn't even know you were going to the hospital early in the morning.

238
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,220
I just thought you were going hiking again.

239
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,110
Then did you think I ran away over here because I fought with your dad?

240
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,910
That's what I'm saying.

241
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,490
I fooled you well then.

242
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,480
Sit down, Ma'am.

243
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,700
Mom, I have a favor to ask you.

244
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,730
What is it?

245
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,350
Your bibim guksu... I want to eat that.

246
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,410
No, you're tired, right? Should we just order something?

247
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:23,510
You're probably the only daughter who's so careful to ask her mom to cook for her.

248
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,380
Do you think so?

249
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,160
- Is it okay if it's a little noisy? 
 - Gosh!

250
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,230
Of course.

251
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,190
Then get working.

252
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,190
I'm not even going to call you this time!

253
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,750
I'm sorry for being sensitive.

254
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
You're done.

255
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,710
Aren't you hungry?

256
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm used to it now. I'm not hungry yet.

257
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,240
Shall we have a cup of coffee?

258
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,010
Right now?

259
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,110
This is Ethiopia Sidamo, right?

260
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,430
That's right.

261
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,440
This is amazing! How did I never think to drink this iced?

262
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Because there are no customers who ask for filter coffee with ice.

263
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,820
That's true too.

264
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,460
Don't you like the specialty job? Your answer last time seemed unsure.

265
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:50,040
I'm wondering if there's even a reason for me to be interested in specialties when I can drink coffee like this.

266
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,410
I think, in the end, the roaster's heart and sincerity is what's important.

267
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,890
This is a specialty bean.

268
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,160
Pardon?

269
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,500
Eom Sang Ho, the CEO who came by last time. They're the beans I got from him.

270
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,670
You said it was Ethiopia Sidamo, though...

271
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:14,720
Yes. Ours is Sidamo G2, CEO Eom's is Sidamo Guji G1.

272
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,050
Why are you putting me to the test again?

273
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,820
No, I just wanted you to try drinking it without any prejudice.

274
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,840
I guess this is what specialty is.

275
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,020
The maker's talent, efforts, and sincerity... all these are very important.

276
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:42,700
But there's definitely a difference that can't be overcome with just that.

277
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,220
I haven't known you for very long, but I'm confused every time.

278
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,890
A stubborn boomer who has turned his back to the world surprises you at times?

279
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,400
Yes.

280
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,730
I admit that I'm stubborn, too.

281
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,520
But I'm also insanely curious about coffee that other people make.

282
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,630
A boomer with a lot of curiosity?

283
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,060
I'm sorry, Sir.

284
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,210
I'll work harder!

285
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,670
Are you done?

286
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,940
It took some time. Were you waiting for me?

287
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,240
Come sit. I just need to boil the noodles.

288
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,470
I really wanted to eat this.

289
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,520
You finally feel like my child now. Eat a lot.

290
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,190
Let me look at your phone.

291
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,040
Why?

292
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,400
I couldn't change your profile picture.

293
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,630
- Let's see. 
 - Hey!

294
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,830
Look at it later after we're done eating.

295
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,600
Really? All right, then.

296
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,350
Mom... I'm going to go home.

297
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,850
What?! No! Don't come!

298
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,000
What was that? Why are you so against it?

299
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,480
I didn't want to tell you until the end because I knew you'd be like this.

300
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,930
What if something happened and you didn't tell me?

301
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,270
That's not going to happen. I'm not going to die.

302
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,870
No... even if I die, you should live doing what you want to do and live happily.

303
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,170
That's my wish.

304
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,270
Why aren't you wishing for yourself, but wishing for your child?

305
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,760
Did I?

306
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,730
Then... I'll have to wish instead of you.

307
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,820
What did you say?

308
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,870
Please let my mom be healthy,

309
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,600
until all my unknown 100 volumes of books gets published...

310
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,740
That... isn't something that'll be done quickly right?

311
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,210
Well... let's just say you're going to be immortal.

312
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,570
It's delicious.

313
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:45,750

314
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,660

315
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,150
 Go on a business trip tomorrow.

316
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,920
 After only ever seeing a 1.2 kg roasting machine in the store, seeing one this big... Wow!

317
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,930
 What brings you here?

318
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,050
 It's tempting after seeing it for yourself, right?

319
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,630
 I don't know.

320
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,240
 How dishonest of you.

321
