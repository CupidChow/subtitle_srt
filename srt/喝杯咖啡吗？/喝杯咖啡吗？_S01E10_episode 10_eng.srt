1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,960
I know that I'm stubborn too.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,920
But I'm also dying to know the taste of coffee that other people make.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,290
A very curious boomer?

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,920
Gosh...

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,300
I'm sorry, Sir! I will try harder.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,550
Go on a business trip tomorrow.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,940
Business trip?

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,280
To CEO Eom's store.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,250
Oh, are you going to get beans from him?

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,210
No.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,130
Oh, then...?

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,810
As a field trip. That's part of work too.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,480
I would be happy to!

14
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,810
Oh, Go Bi! Welcome.

15
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,820
Hello, Sir.

16
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,130
Oh, right. Say hello to our lead barista Lee Seung Woo.

17
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,330
You're Kang Go Bi, right? I have heard a lot about you.

18
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,350
About me?

19
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,200
Yes, I'm someone who went to Mr. Park to learn about coffee but got rejected.

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,370
Please pass on some of your know-how to him.

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,130
Shall we take a look around our store first?

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,340
This is basically the ground floor.

23
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,370
Our use of space doesn't seem to be the best because we tried to make it look cool.

24
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,290
- Let's go to the roasting room first. 
 - Okay.

25
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,190
This way.

26
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,030
Wow! I thought it would be vaguely similar to the scale of 2dae Coffee.

27
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,840
- Hyung Seok and I might still only be friends up to now because we have different directions. 
 - Oh...

28
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,350
Then do you do all the roasting yourself, Sir?

29
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,320
No... I'm just someone who hands out the paychecks.

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,250
Two roasters from the US and Colombia are in charge of the roasting.

31
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,420
Armando over there.

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,860
Hi, guys!

33
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,700
Wow, you even have a separate roaster.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,030
Well, I feel very reassured since they're currently judges in major international competitions, such as "Cup of Excellence."

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,420
Did you say, "Cup of Excellence"?

36
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,300
Wow! That's incredible!

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,360
All right then, this way.

38
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,710
Besides the fear of payday returning, it's all fantastic.

39
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,190
After only seeing a 1.2 kg roaster in the store, seeing something this big...

40
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,000
Wow! This is just...

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,320
I always tease Hyung Seok that he's the president of hole-in-the-wall shops.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,360
Hyung Seok says I'm not a barista, but a corporate businessman.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,210
Let's go up to B1.

44
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,730
Okay.

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,680
Your mother said I could use it until I wanted to leave.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm the building owner now so I'm not sure why you keep bringing up my mom.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,280
You must know, too, Ki Jung.

48
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,270
In the twenty years that I've been here, there has never been a single issue between the landlord and the tenant.

49
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,470
I'm going to keep it that way going forward too.

50
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,690
You're right. It's not like I don't know that.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,770
But then why are you suddenly asking me to leave?

52
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,430
Because there is a need for change at this time.

53
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,490
I don't really like your mannerisms and whatnot.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,670
Please consider even raising the monthly rent and think about it one more time—

55
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,770
No, but that's not it. I have something I want to try out here.

56
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,980
If I wanted to raise the rent, I would've already done so.

57
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,190
Well then, good luck with your business for the remaining time.

58
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,960
I hope you understand.

59
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,780
How about you close a little early, and we go and get some Soju?

60
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,330
I can't do that when I made a promise to the customers.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,370
Right... that wouldn't be Park Seok.

62
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,250
I guess I was craving it.

63
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,490
If you want to drink Soju, you can buy it, and then pour it into a cup. I will allow that.

64
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,630
How can you make jokes right now?

65
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,750
I understand he's doing things by the law, but it's a little coldhearted.

66
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,050
It's my fault for not preparing anything because I met a good landlord.

67
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,850
Why are you making me all sad?

68
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,770
You sent Go Bi to CEO Eom at this time on purpose, right?

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,790
I can't say I didn't...

70
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,550
It does seem a little soon, right?

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,430
We made this station here, but it's not operating because we are short-staffed.

72
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,410
I feel like there would be a lot of baristas who would want to work here, though.

73
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,740
Well, I can't let just anyone work here because they want to.

74
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,360
But then coincidentally from Hyung Seok,

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,650
I heard about you, Go Bi.

76
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,070
Pardon?

77
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,810
- Sit wherever you feel comfortable. I'll make a cup of coffee. 
 - Okay.

78
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,800
This here... isn't a competitor of 2dae Coffee.

79
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,820
- What brings you here? 
 - Well, what other reason would there be for a coffee critic to go check out cafes?

80
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,340
Oh, that's true but—

81
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,790
I should be more curious about why someone from the same industry came by someone else's store.

82
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,450
During store hours too.

83
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,780
Dressed up all nicely like this too.

84
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,050
I'm on a field trip.

85
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,670
It's tempting, isn't it? After seeing it for yourself.

86
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,470
I'm not sure...

87
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,450
How dishonest of you.

88
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,730
You can't even dream of this equipment at 2dae Coffee.

89
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,870
How about you say that at 2dae Coffee?

90
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,010
You have a good spirit, but you're not smart.

91
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,630
I'm not talking to Sunbae Park, but to you.

92
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,780
Do you really have to share our table?

93
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,500
It's manners towards the café to share a table when you can.

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,930
Nobody asked you for those manners.

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,750
- El Paraiso Strawberry. It's coffee that's cultivated from a high-altitude region in Colombia called Cauca. 
 - Oh...

96
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,810
The quality is fresh, but there's still a good amount of body to it. But the smell of strawberry... Wow!

97
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,900
Central American coffee has weaker characteristics than African coffees

98
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,230
so they're very interested in experimental manufacturing methods.

99
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,360
Are you not going to talk about the sour taste?

100
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,300
I thought you said it's "acidity," not a sour taste?

101
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,020
Do you think I don't know it means the same thing?

102
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,690
- It's the people who can't refute it when I point it out that are the problem. 
 - Goodness...

103
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,250
You're definitely a little twisted.

104
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,290
Anyway, the balance is great as it's not just the acidity that stands out.

105
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,760
You have good taste buds, though.

106
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,270
It's true that we were able to discover what we call, "sour taste," thanks to specialty coffees,

107
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,580
but I also do feel a little falsely accused because of the prejudice that it must only have a strong sour taste.

108
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,210
I think it'll be really good if you just had competitive prices.

109
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,480
13,000 won for one cup is a little...

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,920
It uses experimental farming and manufacturing methods that even skilled farmers risk failure with.

111
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,960
That's how we can get beans with strong characteristics.

112
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,910
Suffering from altitude sickness, endemic diseases, and whatnot...

113
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,670
The roaster's passion to find farms that are like hidden gems is essential too.

114
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,680
The barista is the last thing.

115
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,220
It needs to be precisely extracted using suitable equipment.

116
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,210
That's how we can be rewarded for all the hard work that was put into it.

117
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,610
You could've just said, "It can't help but be expensive," instead of that whole mouthful.

118
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,090
I never thought Choi would tell me that I talk too much.

119
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,180
All right, you get why it's expensive now...

120
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,520
You'll probably want to ask whether or not it's worth the price, right?

121
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,330
Excuse me?

122
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,810
I'm a coffee critic.

123
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,540
Would you mind if I asked you a question?

124
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,120
We don't know anything. No, thanks.

125
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,310
Don't be like that Chul Sang. We have to communicate.

126
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,780
Ask us the question.

127
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,140
Oh, all right... Do the two of you come here often?

128
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,810
Yes, of course.

129
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,480
Out of curiosity, do you know what coffee you're drinking right now?

130
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,750
Well, mine is the Panama Geisha,

131
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,130
and Ju Eun's is the Colombian... What was it?

132
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,620
The El Paraiso Rich.

133
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,990
It's really expensive, but it suits my taste buds.

134
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,630
What do you taste from it?

135
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,190
If you ask like that, there's nothing for us to say.

136
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,430
You're right, it's not like we're a critic or something.

137
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,180
- Either way, it's different. 
 - Oh...

138
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,980
All right, then.

139
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,920
You saw that, right?

140
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,400
It didn't seem like you got much from that conversation.

141
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,600
In one glance, they're clearly financially comfortable people.

142
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,050
But it's not like they're in the age group to come here to flex and take pictures to boast on their social media either.

143
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,280
They can't even accurately analyze the taste either.

144
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,610
But why would they come here every time to drink coffee that's more expensive than a meal?

145
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,490
- Because it's delicious. 
 - Oh?

146
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,140
- Correct. 
 - Gosh.

147
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,350
That's a given.

148
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,260
Something really good... doesn't require an explanation.

149
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,520
Your body just intuitively reacts to it.

150
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,600
Teacher Choi Hurt, I'm deeply flattered.

151
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,260
I'm just doing my job.

152
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,800
You know I paid for what I'm drinking for, too, right?

153
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,730
Wh-What are you doing?

154
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,770
I'm just doing my job, too.

155
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,970
You promised that you wouldn't go talk to other customers.

156
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,350
- Here, too? 
 - Wow!

157
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,240
Did you hear about 2dae Coffee too?

158
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,740
Let's meet again soon, Go Bi.

159
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,190
Okay, I'll see you next time.

160
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,780
Choi?

161
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,320
Don't come for a month, Choi Hurt.

162
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,590
Today seems really unfair, though.

163
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,730
Also, I only got to drink two sips of that expensive coffee.

164
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,580
Do you want me to extend it to two months?

165
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,220
I'll come back in one month, I guess.

166
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,820
All right.

167
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,040
I have nothing to tell you even if you follow me.

168
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,060
I didn't even expect that.

169
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,980
Let's both quietly go our own ways.

170
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,390
Let me ask you one thing.

171
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,240
Don't just change your style in front of me. Be a little more polite.

172
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,570
Is CEO Eom's café that great?

173
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,270
Are you asking me that because you really don't know?

174
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,690
In the end, it's the power of money and the taste of money.

175
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,020
Money is a skill too.

176
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,010
What?

177
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,260
It's not my opinion, but I'm asking you. Do you agree?

178
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,770
No, not at all.

179
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,330
But... What is the reason you look down on it?

180
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,760
"Look down"? Me?

181
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,030
You think that anyone could do that much if they had money.

182
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,000
Honestly, yes.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,010
What point does it need to score above according to the Specialty Coffee Association for it to be a specialty coffee?

184
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,650
You're the one who completely looks down on me.

185
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,110
80 points.

186
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,750
There are countless places,

187
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,750
overflowing with money and ambition, so they use green beans that scored over 90 points,

188
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,420
then roast that into 80 point beans and extract them into 70 point coffee.

189
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,260
It's the same thing as burning 2++ grade Hanwoo beef and then having customers pay the original price.

190
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,270
People who would make a huge fuss if it were a barbecue restaurant would open up their wallets with a smile on their faces at a coffee shop.

191
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,330
Are you saying that CEO Eom's store uses 90 point beans to make 90 point coffee?

192
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,130
It's at the level where even if the assistants make a mistake from time to time, the points won't go down.

193
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,720
Then 2dae Coffee makes 70 point coffee with 70 point green beans?

194
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,460
It's at the level where it raises even a few more points through roasting and extraction.

195
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,450
Wow, my boss is amazing.

196
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,000
That can never turn a mid-size car into a luxury sedan, though.

197
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,090
I learned a lot.

198
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,640
I understand your feeling of wanting to bring back your stolen heart in any way possible.

199
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,200
You went too far ahead again.

200
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,200
If not, never mind.

201
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,130
I'm back.

202
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,950
You should've gone straight home. Why did you come back?

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Sir?

204
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes?

205
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,400
Speak.

206
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,670
Aren't you curious?

207
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,990
About what?

208
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,440
How Met Café was.

209
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,670
Eom Sang Ho, that punk. He teased that we are a hole in the wall, didn't he?

210
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,310
Are you going to send me there?

211
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,480
Why? Wasn't it nice?

212
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,280
It was nice...

213
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,720
to the point that it made 2dae Coffee look shabby.

214
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,790
I'm relieved.

215
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,630
How strange...

216
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,970
shouldn't you be more relieved if I liked this place more?

217
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,700
I feel re-energized to work even harder after experiencing something new.

218
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,820
I'll see you tomorrow.

219
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,520
CEO Eom, he called me not long ago.

220
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,280
He wants to try working with you.

221
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,030
So what?

222
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,610
Rest a few days and start going to work over there.

223
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,150
Are you firing me?

224
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,130
Yes.

225
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,080
This doesn't seem right.

226
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,130
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,760
Why are you suddenly doing this?

228
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,470
It's not sudden. It's something that I have been thinking about.

229
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,120
Is it because my paycheck is a burden?

230
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,830
That's not it.

231
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,970
Then you have to discuss it first.

232
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,910
Or are you being considerate? For me to get a better opportunity?

233
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,820
"Better opportunity," I guess it'll be a better opportunity.

234
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,530
But that is something for you to judge.

235
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,760
Then what is it?

236
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,440
2dae Coffee... I want to run it the way I used to.

237
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,230
What Choi said was right.

238
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,500
After you came, I changed, and 2dae Coffee changed a lot too.

239
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,400
"'Changed"? It didn't even change that much.

240
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,900
- I'm having trouble understanding— 
 - For someone who has been working alone for twenty years,

241
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,030
even a small change makes a big difference.

242
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,820
You don't think that change is a bad thing, though.

243
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,530
It was good.

244
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,200
I thought it was good, but...

245
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,820
I have no certainty right now.

246
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,970
Eat some food as you drink.

247
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm eating.

248
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,120
Seok?

249
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,460
Yes?

250
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,170
Did you really have to do that?

251
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,180
Yes.

252
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,620
Why do you keep giving one-word answers? Doesn't that frustrate you?

253
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm probably not nearly as frustrated as Go Bi.

254
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,810
Why are you smiling?

255
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,030
You're breaking my heart.

256
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,560
Why am I smiling?

257
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,420
How pitiful... So pitiful...

258
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm in a good mood!

259
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,360
Why are you just standing there instead of going in?

260
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,600
I was going to go after I said goodbye to you.

261
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,030
Are you leaving right away? Have a cup of coffee before you go.

262
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,530
No, I'll come next time.

263
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,500
Next time when?

264
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,310
I don't think I can come for a while because I'll be busy,

265
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,300
but someday...

266
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,290
Thanks for your hard work.

267
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,600
I feel bad for only receiving from you when I didn't do much.

268
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,940
Thank you for everything.

269
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,840
Be healthy.

270
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,990

271
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,940
 Hyung Seok?

272
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,600
 Does the coffee taste all right?

273
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,850
 It's not bad for free coffee... I guess.

274
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,400
 I was right... It was Baek Jong Gil.

275
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,220
 You're saying this guy... is that guy?

276
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,720
 Get it together, please. Until when are you going to live like this?

277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,860
 What's wrong with living like this?

278
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,600
 Pardon?

279
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,160
 Goodbye.

280
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,450
 Come again!
