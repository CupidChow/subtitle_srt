1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,050
We should each lunch.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,300
Go Bi?

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,610
Yes?

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,670
We should eat lunch.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,490
Yes, we should.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,210
Let's go.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,150
Who'll watch the store then?

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,910
I don't really have an appetite right now.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,240
You should go first.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,380
All right.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,730

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,290
 ☕ 𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮 _ 6

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,930
I guess the lunchtime rush was no joke today?

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,710
It wasn't busy.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,750
But then why is Go Bi so out of it?

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,220
Because it's not busy.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,810
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,350
Welcome!

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,630
Ms. Joo Hee! Long time no see!

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,860
Seriously. Have you been doing well too, Ms. Kim?

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,110
Yes.

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,640
We came by to give you this.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,850
Just put the cookies in that bag.

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,500
I was going to come get it on Tuesday morning.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,260
- We came to return it and also to eat lunch. 
 - Oh!

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,010
Then I'll give you the cookies when you leave, okay?

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,790
Hey, did you solve that problem?

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,620
Yes, the taste came back once I changed the grinder's blade as you told me to.

29
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,360
It looks like there's not much of a problem on the outside... but that actually affects the taste?

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,000
Seriously... Nothing is easy.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,230
There are some things you can only see after observing it for a long time.

32
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,730
I don't see it, though.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,470
- Enjoy the meal! 
 - Thank you.

34
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,790
Thank you for the food!

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,840
Is Ga Won still doing her best?

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,310
She's always the same.

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,980
That's a relief... You were really worried because she lost her way for a moment.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,470
Me?

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,810
I wasn't worried.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,270
Come on... You were!

41
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,330
Only for a very short moment.

42
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,630
But there wasn't anything I could do.

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,940
It's better to give up quickly when you know it won't work.

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,380
The two of you surprisingly have some similarities.

45
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,820
Ms. Kim and I?

46
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,320
There are some things you can only see after observing it for a long time.

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,550
It's delicious!

48
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,180
Eat up.

49
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,280
So what will you do?

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,340
There's nothing I can do.

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,930
She'll have to overcome it herself.

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,510
You see, you see?

53
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,820
Oh, hold on!

54
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,790
- Did you think of some writing material? 
 - No...

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,070
Ga Won has been begging you to make a collaboration menu since a long time ago!

56
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,540
But it didn't happen because you rejected her big time.

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,140
I didn't reject her big time.

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,170
It's the same thing!

59
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,850
Anyways that... What do you think about leaving it up to Go Bi?

60
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,260
No... I don't think so.

61
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,350
What the...

62
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,370
Why are his words and facial expressions contradicting each other?

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,820
Are you not hungry?

64
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,670
I'm okay.

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,140
- Hi, Go Bi! 
 - Hello.

66
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,210
- One cup of Americano, please. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

67
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,480
Go eat lunch.

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,170
I'll go after I make Ms. Joo Hee's coffee.

69
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,860
Did everyone go on a group vacation or something?

70
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,910
You really don't have a lot of customers these days.

71
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,500
I know, right?

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,140
Why? Are you worried that the store isn't making money?

73
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,360
No.

74
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,830
That's a firm answer.

75
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,150
I think that the owner has something to say.

76
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh, you...

77
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,280
Would you like to try to make a new menu?

78
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,520
"New menu"? Me?

79
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,240
What, can't you?

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,530
I'll think about it while eating lunch.

81
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you going to eat for lunch?

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,990
I'm not sure.

83
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,450
Why are you so curious about what someone else is going to eat?

84
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,370
No, because the tteokbokki we had for lunch yesterday... 
  (T/N: Tteokbokki is Korean for rice cakes)

85
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,750
was delicious!

86
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,550
Oh, yes! You said you like tteokbokki, right?

87
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,810
The tteokbokki in front of the school here... It was really delicious.

88
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,070
Eat tteokbokki for lunch?

89
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,280
Why? Can't we do that?

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,580
Did you eat spicy and strong-flavored food during store hours?

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,570
This guy eats fire jjamppong for lunch often too.

92
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,980
I don't even really eat Kimchi during store hours...

93
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,750
That's surprising.

94
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,320
I'll go eat lunch and come back.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,040
Where did he learn that stuff from?

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,280
You.

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,480
It's not me... No... I eat kimchi.

98
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,410
There's nothing I can do.

99
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,720
- I'm sorry... 
 - It's our favorite's first comeback performance though!

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,930
I'm also wondering if I have to live like this, too!

101
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,020
This is seriously...

102
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,800
Wow!

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,390
Can you hear it?

104
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,350
Hear what?

105
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,400
A kind of cracking sound.

106
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,330
What are you saying?

107
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,520
We can't just let this go.

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,620
Then what?

109
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,380
Tteokbokki?

110
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,200
- All right! 
 - Oh, really?

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,710
- She's fallen for our trap! 
 - Yes!

112
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,940
What are you doing?

113
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,090
I have to warm up.

114
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,860
Those two girls...

115
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,830
Hey! Let's go together!

116
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,430
- Thank you for the food! 
 - No problem.

117
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,440
I thought you said if you eat strong flavors, you can't taste bread?

118
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,330
You said that you don't even want to look at flour tteokbokki because you eat flour so often.

119
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,170
You two are the ones who cut me loose!

120
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,630
Gosh... even that shamelessness is perfect too.

121
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,560
- Ma'am! Two more portions of tteobokki, please! 
 - All right.

122
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,230
Ma'am. One tteokbokki, soondae, fried food set, please.

123
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,530
Can you give a lot of liver for the soondae and mix them all up in the sauce, please.

124
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,060
Oppa Go Bi?

125
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,220
Oh, Ga Won?

126
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,370
- Ga Won? 
 - Oppa?

127
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,460
What Oppa?

128
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,270
I guess you came to eat tteokbokki.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,710
No... There's no way I would eat tteokbokki during working hours... I came for the fried stuff.

130
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,760
You said you wanted the tteokbokki, soondae, fried food set!

131
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,640
Oh... Why are my words not coming out right...

132
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,030
Please take out the tteokbokki and soondae in the set.

133
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,110
Don't mix it in the sauce... I'll dip it in soy sauce.

134
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,280
You could've just asked for fried food then... goodness...

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,060
Take it.

136
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,940
The two portions of tteokbokki you ordered.

137
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh... you eat tteokbokki, I see.

138
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,220
No... my friends said they were going to eat it so... Hey...

139
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,360
Ga Won... your mouth. You have tteokbokki sauce.

140
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,280
No, not that side, the other.

141
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,030
More above.

142
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,170
I'll get going now!

143
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,850
Good luck, and let's talk again.

144
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,460
All right!

145
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,980
Oh, Ga Won is coming!

146
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,710
Joo Hee... can you tell her for me?

147
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,420
Me? Why?

148
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,450
She may get the impression that I just dumped it onto Go Bi after I said I wouldn't do it...

149
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,600
My mouth was itching so I'd be happy to!

150
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,030
You'll tell Go Bi yourself, right?

151
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,330
I'll have to.

152
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,770
That's right. In the end, the people concerned will have to make the decision.

153
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,650
I'll get going.

154
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,960
Hi, Ga Won!

155
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,920
Ms. Joo Hee! Hello!

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,440
Ga Won! Your wish will finally come true!

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,410
What are you saying?

158
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:40,490
You'll have to hear it from the other person involved. Good luck with Go Bi!

159
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,830
I'm cheering for the both of you!

160
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,930
Goodbye.

161
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,710
All right!

162
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
With Ga Won?

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,660
Then do you have an idea you can do by yourself?

164
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,580
Well no... That's not it, but...

165
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,150
Will there be anything I can do with a baby?

166
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,390
A "baby"?

167
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,230
What about you?

168
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,950
I'll do my best.

169
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,110
Leave the wrapping up to me and go.

170
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,270
Pardon?

171
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,200
It's time for Ga Won to be wrapping up too.

172
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,680
Yes... then I'll get ready to leave.

173
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,440
"Baby"?

174
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,770
Are you going to go after practicing today, too?

175
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,450
Yes, I'll have to.

176
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,660
All right, then I'll go home first. Lock up well.

177
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,200
Okay! Go home safely.

178
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,390
Hello.

179
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,710
Go Bi? What brings you here at this hour?

180
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,050
I have something to talk about with Ga Won.

181
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,580
Is that so?

182
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,380
Talk to her then.

183
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,430
It's nothing urgent so I'll wait outside.

184
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,340
Ga Won? Is he a little weird?

185
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,960
Pardon?

186
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,230
Let's go home together.

187
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,370
I'll be waiting.

188
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,490
I don't think he's someone like that...

189
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,460
Don't worry and go home.

190
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,990
I have things to do, too.

191
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,370
Go in and make bread.

192
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,460
Are you not going to change before you leave?

193
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,570
Yes.

194
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,140
- No... 
 - Excuse me?

195
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,690
I'm not changing and I'm not going home yet.

196
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,710
- Okay... then let's talk here— 
 - No.

197
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm... a high school student.

198
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,530
That's right... a twelfth grader.

199
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,370
Even if I'm a twelfth grader... I'm still underage.

200
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,370
Oh, I'm sorry! I came by after work so the time—

201
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,070
It's good to see you always using honorifics with me and having good manners.

202
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,880
But... I think any feelings beyong than that... It's not right.

203
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,770
Pardon?

204
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,290
I... feel a little uncomfortable.

205
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,420
I'm not interested in dating.

206
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,410
What was that?

207
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,580
What is this! You made me the weird person!

208
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm really sorry, Ga Won...

209
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,220
I didn't even imagine something like this would happen.

210
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,760
Did I... leave it up to your own interpretation too much?

211
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
Ms. Joo Hee... are you laughing right now?

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
No... I didn't laugh.

213
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,650
How can you laugh right now, Ahjussi?

214
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,070
I'm not laughing.

215
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,330
Seriously, what is this? How can I come here again? It's so embarrassing!

216
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,910
It's Go Bi.

217
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,860
I'm going!

218
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,890
You're going to come again, right?

219
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,010
I don't know!

220
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,660
I'll tell Go Bi properly this time.

221
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,030
Don't do anything. Nothing!

222
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,780
Ga Won!

223
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,780
She got caught.

224
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,630
She sure did.

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,070
Oppa Go Bi... hello...

226
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,990
I thought about what happened yesterday—

227
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,920
No... don't think about it.

228
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,990
I'm sorry...

229
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,360
Do you want to come by when I'm closing up later?

230
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,240
Pardon?

231
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,860
We have to do it... The collaboration.

232
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,170
All right.

233
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,110
You came early!

234
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,690
I thought you finished at this time.

235
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,960
I'm only getting started.

236
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,150
Go Bi?

237
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,330
Hello. I came to finish the conversation I couldn't yesterday with Ga Won.

238
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,390
Not dating, but about the new menu.

239
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,330
Oh... is that so? You're all working so hard even after work.

240
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,680
Then I'll go first.

241
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,020
- Go home safely! 
 - I'll see you next time!

242
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,030
Would you like to come in?

243
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,190
Can I do that?

244
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,140
Of course!

245
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,110
Weren't you going to make bread?

246
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,180
I'm going to make a confit.

247
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,940
"Confit"?

248
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,150
It means to preserve. It's a cooking method where you boil an ingredient for a long time.

249
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,730
You keep repeating the same process.

250
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,630
It's called "zest blanchir."

251
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,220
It's a process where you disinfect and take out any bitter or unwanted flavors.

252
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,750
Then you're done?

253
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,110
I didn't even boil it down in sugar water yet.

254
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,550
Complete!

255
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,590
Did you only complete one ingredient after all that?

256
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,590
- That's right. 
 - Wow...

257
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,650
What do you plan on making with this?

258
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,630
- Orange Madeleine. 
 - Oh.

259
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,860
Then do you only use this confit and no syrup?

260
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,300
Yes.

261
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,860
I'll stop here for today.

262
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,610
I thought you were only getting started?

263
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,570
I feel pressured, too, because someone is waiting.

264
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,780
I'm sorry, because of me...

265
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,810
Ahjussi Seok knows that on days I work part-time I end late because I practice.

266
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,780
I think he did that because he knew.

267
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,870
What?

268
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,420
For me to watch and learn.

269
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,670
I didn't teach you anything, though.

270
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,860
He can be quite crafty.

271
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,540
Let's go.

272
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,990
Go where?

273
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,610
You said you're done. Are we not going to go?

274
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,950
Cooking done, cleaning starts. Don't you know?

275
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,530
That's right.

276
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,370
I'll help you. Let's do it quickly and talk about the menu on the way home.

277
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,860
Hold on.... you also know that the cleaning method isn't the same either, right?

278
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,660
Right.

279
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,580
Just stay still. I'll finish it quickly.

280
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,530
I want to ask you something.

281
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,590
Was it ever tough for you?

282
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,240
What are you saying? Every moment is tough.

283
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,010
No, not tough because you're busy and it's hard, but tough because there are no customers and you have nothing to do.

284
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,660
You're a baby...

285
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,180
Excuse me?

286
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,620
When it hadn't been that long after I started working part-time at the bakery,

287
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,290
I thought that being busy was the toughest thing or when you deal with a rude customer.

288
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,190
But it was the toughest when I felt bored because there were no customers.

289
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,790
I wasn't the only one then.

290
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,250
You know waiters, right?

291
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,700
Yes, I know. People who serve.

292
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,610
Wrong.

293
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,030
People who wait.

294
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,710
It was a word-play!

295
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,340
It's not a joke.

296
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,990
Whether it's a bakery owner, coffee shop employee, woman, or man...

297
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,290
they're all waiters in the fact that they all wait for customers.

298
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,980
What's this feeling... of suddenly feeling so small?

299
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,370
It's what I heard when I joined the bakery and thought of quitting... from Ahjussi Seok.

300
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,870
Mr. Park...

301
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,790
The conclusion is very heart-warming too.

302
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,100
Don't tell me...

303
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,490
If you can't endure the waiting, you should quit as soon as you can.

304
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,370
Is he saying I should or shouldn't quit?

305
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,340
That's Ahjussi Seok's style.

306
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,390
How did you endure it, Ga Won?

307
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,160
I asked Ahjussi Seok the same thing. It's easier than you think.

308
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,770
You have to love this job enough...

309
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,190
to endure the boring and hopeless times you're waiting for customers. He told me to ask myself that.

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,330
Orange cappuccino?

311
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,020
Yes.

312
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,510
It's pretty good.

313
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,180
I'll try roasting something that will pair with this.

314
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,850
Okay.

315
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,820
Tell me what needs to be fixed.

316
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,750
First off, the milk froth is too low.

317
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,870
Besides the fact that there's milk froth... Is there really a reason to call this a cappuccino?

318
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,820
Do you think it's because of the orange syrup?

319
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,910
I think it's a problem with the balance.

320
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:07,650
In a variation menu, if you miss one thing in the espresso, milk froth, or syrup, it's a failure.

321
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,740
The taste of milk is too overpowering.

322
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,260
I matched it to 55 degrees, where you can taste the sweetness of milk, though...

323
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,380
It's fine if you raise it up to 65 or 70 degrees.

324
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,590
I don't think there's necessarily a problem with the temperature... Plus, around 55 degrees is a 2dae Coffee characteristic too.

325
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,320
Oh, then should I try switching it to a stronger bean?

326
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,650
If the flavor of espresso becomes stronger, it may cause a reverse effect.

327
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,990
Then what can we do?

328
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,820
I gave the diagnosis so you'll have to find the answer.

329
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,160
Should we try changing the cup?

330
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,030
The cup?

331
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,170
From 300ml to 180ml.

332
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,340
Oh, if the mouth becomes smaller, the froth will naturally become thicker... it'll be balanced too!

333
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,740
That's right.

334
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,250
Anyway... it's overall a little hazy.

335
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,360
Like you these days.

336
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,740
Me? Was I like that?

337
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,770
Give it some impact.

338
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,910
Stimulate one's curiosity with the appearance and have a flavor that can live up to it.

339
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,550
Okay.

340
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,090
 It definitely got better after I changed the cup, but...

341
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,760
 the expresso is a little...

342
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,250
 Ristretto, where the extraction time is short and the amount is little.

343
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,760
 Okay... extracting double shots of ristretto.

344
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,030
 Mix it into a 180ml cup with syrup inside.

345
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,390
 Pour steamed milk.

346
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,030
 I placed a slice of orange to give it some impact...

347
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,460
Wow! You can even see the gold ring. You made this properly!

348
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,750
What a perfect couple!

349
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,910
If you're all done with the pictures, shall we try tasting it?

350
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,530
- But the orange madeleine doesn't look much different from a regular madeleine on the outside. 
 - Oh!

351
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,230
Oppa Go Bi said he'll be making an orange cappuccino so I didn't top it with anything.

352
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,410
Starting from the usage of ingredients to the recipe... this is a proper collaboration.

353
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,500
Your coffee is here.

354
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,840
Sit down so we can taste it together.

355
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,560
Okay.

356
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,390
Oh, you know you have to drink the cappuccino like you're biting an apple because of the foam right?

357
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,650
Without a doubt!

358
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,380
Thank you for the drink!

359
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,330
I was worried that it might be too sweet because of the syrup... but it's not!

360
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,990
You're right. The harmony of coffee, milk, and syrup is just right!

361
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,950
What about you, Sir?

362
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,730
I agree.

363
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,410
All right then... I'll try eating the madeleine.

364
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,320
I think I can understand why you didn't top it with an orange!

365
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,780
The pairing of it is good when you eat it together.

366
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,590
You didn't bring it as soon as you made it.

367
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,980
Why? Is it not good?

368
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,890
No, the orange peel's chewy texture and scent...

369
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,750
It's done right.

370
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,380
You know your stuff, Ahjussi Seok.

371
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,760
The confit sticks better to the bread when you eat it after a little time rather than eating it right away.

372
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,260
Like 2dae Coffee and Kang Go Bi?

373
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,760
Pardon?

374
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,950
Oppa, have you still not found your way?

375
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,070
No...

376
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,350
He didn't tell you, but your boss was really worried about you.

377
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,630
What worry are you talking about?

378
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,360
Your mouth, mouth...

379
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,570
You see, in this neighborhood...

380
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,360
did all the "master's of holding back what you want to say" gather here?

381
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,370
How does everyone live when it's so frustrating?

382
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,210
Thank you to everyone for caring.

383
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,510
I should be thanking you instead.

384
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,340
Thanks to you, I have a new goal.

385
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,830
What is it?

386
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,540
I want to become a proper waiter.

387
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,220
Did this person decide to go somewhere else?

388
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,560
I'm not sure...

389
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,230
Why are you talking about a waiter instead of becoming a proper barista?

390
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,950
You should eat.

391
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,750
Okay.

392
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,750
Welcome!

393
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,970
Welcome.

394
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:06,960

395
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,050
 Choi Hurt? I think I've heard of him before.

396
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,060
 Don't you know him? He's a super famous blogger and critic.

397
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,200
 He's cynical and harsh, but he's not saying anything wrong.

398
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,710
 Sir, even so, if you say it like that...

399
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,750
 What a crazy punk.

400
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,740
 That person has always been a little interesting.

401
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,400
 What about 2dae Coffee's review?

402
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,940
 Are you really curious?

403
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,890
 Long time no see. Choi Hurt...

404
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,390
 He was a person who changed the fate of a café with one sentence he wrote and spoke.
