1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:09,970

2
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,080

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,190

4
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,340
Are you here on your day off?

5
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,250
You're one to talk.

6
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,830
I... Are you here to make the sample roasting?

7
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,730
I came to rest.

8
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,080
What?

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,790
I deserve a break at least once a week, too.

10
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,690
Are you done?

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,340
Yes.

12
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,020
It's not bad.

13
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,900
That doesn't mean it's good either.

14
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,010
You've improved a lot in a short time.

15
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,530
I need to try as if my life depends on it.

16
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,670
And what if you die like that?

17
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,970
Then it wouldn't be coffee anymore; it'd be poison.

18
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,970
You know what I mean.

19
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,570
I'm just worried you'll get tired quickly.

20
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,090
What?

21
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,630
You need to rest. Your sense of smell and taste are very sensitive to tiredness.

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,750
Was that why?

23
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,280
When I was struggling with the espresso and grinding machine settings,

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,500
I was flustered because everything started to taste the same after drinking so many.

25
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,630
But isn't that something only someone like you can say?

26
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,240
Is it?

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,020
No matter how good a person's sense of smell and taste is, you can only decide if you've already collected some data.

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,100
A newbie like me needs more experience.

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,020
You do have a point.

30
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,340
The water flow.

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,910
What?

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,570
Be calm and keep the water flow steady.

33
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,990
I understand.

34
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,150
Not right now. Take it slowly.

35
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,490
Rest a little.

36
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,570
After lunch.

37
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,360
Lunch.

38
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,030
Pho.

39
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,780
Sounds good.

40
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,460
What are you thinking about?

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,230
I'm thinking about how you thought to draw this.

42
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,580
I wasn't thinking. I just drew it.

43
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,390
If you eat it yourself, you'll get a stomachache.

44
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,690
Mom, she can't understand.

45
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,740
She said if I eat it by myself, I will get a stomachache.

46
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,220
Oh, we'll share it.

47
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,350
Enjoy it.

48
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,600
Thank you!

49
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,080
Try coloring that one.

50
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,280
Hello!

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,260
Park Seok, hello!

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,670
Hello.

53
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,960
This is Kang Go Bi, our new family at the cafe.

54
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,820
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,470
He'll be here often.

56
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,970
Mi Na, you're here, too.

57
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,980
You must be here to eat, too.

58
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,600
An art lesson?

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,550
What? Yes.

60
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,090
Are you volunteering your skills?

61
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,580
No, I'm the one that's learning.

62
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,750
I'll have a plain pho.

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,890
I'll have the bahn mi.

64
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,780
Bahn mi is sold out.

65
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,520
Oh, I was debating. Then I'll have bun cha.

66
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,490
Thank you.

67
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,160
Of course.

68
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,800
Bye.

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
Goodbye.

70
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,750
Bye.

71
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,040
It looks like a lot of Vietnamese people frequent this place, too.

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,420
You miss food and people from home once you leave it behind.

73
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,750
It's the same no matter where you go.

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,050
Enjoy the food.

75
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,480
Thank you!

76
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,700
 Thank you.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,030
Mr. Park, here you go.

78
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,320
I can see why they do well.

79
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,160
It wasn't like that from the beginning.

80
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,250
Did the taste change?

81
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,620
It was tasty from the beginning.

82
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,740
Then what happened?

83
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,270
The store owners in the area were being territorial.

84
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,160
Once word got out that it was good and business was going well,

85
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,730
they were saying nonsense, that they were taking away their customers, and whatnot.

86
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,460
They would leave bad reviews and such.

87
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,690
People are so—

88
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,870
Were they like that because they're foreigners?

89
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,620
Not really. People in this business aren't forgiving, even if they're family.

90
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,460
The restaurant business is scary.

91
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,370
How did they survive?

92
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,940
What do you mean how?

93
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,170
They just did, hoping for the best.

94
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,090
The owners in this area need to be thankful for that restaurant.

95
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,960
Why?

96
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,080
This area was dead until people started lining up for that restaurant.

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,170
Oh, what a turn of events.

98
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,710
He's the customer that left the restaurant before us.

99
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,510
I guess the machine ate his coins.

100
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,320
He'll end up breaking it like that!

101
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,940
Stop!

102
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,930
Stop!

103
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,250
Can you speak English?

104
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,120
I can't speak English.

105
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,520
Oh, you can speak Korean.

106
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,420
Of course.

107
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,050
Then are you Korean?

108
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,710
No, I'm Vietnamese.

109
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,100
My father is Korean.

110
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,940
Is the machine not working?

111
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,720
I put in a coin, but nothing is coming out.

112
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,880
I already went there. They said they didn't know.

113
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,160
I have coins. Do you want them?

114
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,170
Why?

115
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,620
If you're doing this because you need the coins.

116
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,660
I want to drink coffee. I have coins.

117
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,140
I have a cafe, do you want to come? I'll serve you a cup of coffee.

118
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,470
No, it's all right.

119
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,090
It's nearby.

120
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,940
No, I don't want to.

121
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,490
You must like machine coffee.

122
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,720
I think there's another one right over there.

123
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,190
That one doesn't taste good.

124
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,950
Just because it's from a machine doesn't mean they all taste the same.

125
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,140
I wanted to have a coffee from this machine for the last time.

126
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,340
The last time?

127
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,040
My working visa is expiring so I'm leaving Korea tomorrow.

128
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,540
My name is Kkwang.

129
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,710
My name is Park Seok.

130
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm Kang Go Bi.

131
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,090
The customer service number is faded.

132
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,980
I know the number.

133
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,130
Nobody uses their own money to get coffee from a vending machine nowadays.

134
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,600
That's why I'm going to get rid of it.

135
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,940
- I even exchanged bills to get coins... 
 - Oh, my.

136
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,680
I have finally met a nobleman who will pay for all my bills.

137
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,830
This here... I filled it up with new ingredients

139
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,920
and changed the settings so that it'll come out even without coins...

140
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,580
Drink as much as you want.

141
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,500
But... the taste didn't change, right?

142
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,540
Don't worry.

143
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,940
The ingredients and the mixture, it's all the same. I've never changed it once.

144
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,930
You should have a cup before you leave, too, Madam Hwang.

145
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,050
After I check on my store, I'll have to come back later for a cup...

146
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,720
since it's the last time.

147
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,570
I'll pull out a warm cup for you.

148
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,410
You're such a sweet man.

149
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,660
Young man... are you not interested in gamjatang?

150
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,270
I like it very much!

151
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,580
It's a scouting offer...

152
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,270
- There was a time when I made Mr. Park's life very hard. 
 - Gosh...

153
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,120
Don't worry about it.

154
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,950
Life...  You really don't know what's going to happen.

155
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,210
- Go back safely. 
 - Goodbye!

156
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,970
Madam Hwang said she'd be handing that over to the junk dealers, but I guess you ended up taking it over, Mr. Park?

157
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,820
I can't say that I took over, but I opened a pop-up store.

158
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,300
Oh, a pop-up store is—

159
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,400
I know, too. You don't have to explain it.

160
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,490
Then is it only for today?

161
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,030
Yes, have a cup before you go. It's free!

162
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,490
Free? Sounds good.

163
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm on my way to go pick up a customer now. I'll swing by later after I show some homes.

164
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,950

165
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,610
This is what I came for.

166
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,020
Over there and behind that... I built those buildings.

167
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,900
Oh, you were at the construction site.

168
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,120
I was walking around by myself during my lunch break when I discovered this.

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,350
Work was tough, and I was so lonely, but I endured each day by drinking coffee from here.

170
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,550
Thanks to this, I'll be going back to Vietnam safe and sound tomorrow.

171
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,820
You've done something great.

172
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,110
Thank you for letting me drink this one last time.

173
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,790
You're leaving after doing something so great.

174
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,790
Which one do you want, Go Bi?

175
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm all right.

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,950
The coffee here is really delicious. You should try it.

177
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,880
It's okay.

178
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,180
 Hello!

179
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,380
Thank you.

180
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,580
But how did you think of putting a vending machine here?

181
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,410
I was curious about that, too. The atmosphere is good here, but it also seems a little random.

182
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,630
I guess you're right.

183
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,790
But you see here... it's right in the center of the three-way crossing.

184
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,470
- I felt like people would take a cup as they passed by. 
 - Gosh...

185
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,280
This Noona, what an ungrateful Noona!

186
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,110
Who was it that picked out this spot for you when you were debating where to put the vending machine?

187
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,130
I can't really remember...

188
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,220
It's from so long ago that my memory is all blurry.

189
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,250
Right here! I was the one who got you electricity from this house with the blue front gate!

190
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,160
How ungrateful.

191
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,370
Mr. Nam, you did a good deed, and Madam Hwang earned money. That's good enough then.

192
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,530
Thanks to that, you shed blood, Mr. Park.

193
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,090
Whenever I think of that, I always feel bad.

194
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,290
- Let's all have a cup! 
 - Let's do that.

195
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,180
- Cheers! 
 - Yes! Come on.

196
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,210
You must have a lot of stories tied to the vending machine too.

197
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,250
For stories like that, an entire day wouldn't be enough to talk about it.

198
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,290
It'll be endless once we start talking about it, but just one!

199
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,880
Sometimes some customers are a perfect match with a particular home.

200
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,340
They say they like the place but won't make a decision.

201
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,100
For me, it doesn't matter which punk takes it since my commission is the same,

202
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,780
but from a realtor's standpoint, you want to match the home with someone who suits it.

203
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,420
At moments like that! I'll say, "Shall we have a cup of coffee?"

204
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,040
Then I'd bring them over to this vending machine and treat them to a cup.

205
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,920
After I give them a little time,

206
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,460
I'll say, "You'll regret losing that house, but let's get going then."

207
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,680
That surprisingly got them to sign the contracts!

208
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm sorry, but can you tell it again one more time?

209
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,040
This story? Why?

210
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,500
Sometimes some customers are–

211
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,040
No, no! Like that... No!

212
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,600
Gosh, this is hard!

213
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,560
Kkwang! Kkwang, you do it!

214
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,230
Thank you.

215
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,100
- I'll start. 
 - Okay.

216
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,810
This is it for my story.

217
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,370
- But this... Will it be aired somewhere? 
 - Oh...

218
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm not sure, but not yet.

219
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,830
When people do this, people would say things they want to say, too.

220
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,190
Oh, if you have something you'd like to say, you can!

221
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,380
I wasn't even able to properly say goodbye to the chief from my last construction site.

222
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,660
Hyungnim Sung Bae! It's me, Kkwang.

223
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,370
Next time I come back, I'll make sure to come see you.

224
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,810
Thank you! Be healthy.

225
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,460
Are you planning to come back to Korea again?

226
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,320
I actually... I came to see my father,

227
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,170
but I couldn't find him.

228
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,620
I want to come back again.

229
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,570
There were a lot of difficult situations,

230
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,530
but I met good people, and there were a lot of fun moments too.

231
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,380
Could you tell me just one?

232
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,850
Koreans would say, "Kkwang's life is 'kkwang'!" and laugh.
 (T/N: kkwang sounds like "fail" in Korean)

233
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,650
At first, I thought it was a compliment.

234
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,390
In Vietnamese, Kkwang means "light."

235
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,160
To say my life is a light... It's beautiful.

236
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,320
But after I found out that Kkwang means "failure" in Korean, I got a little angry.

237
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,950
But it's okay now,

238
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,610
because I believe that my life is a light.

239
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,550
My mother-in-law...

240
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,900
she criticized me so much

241
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,420
for working instead of taking care of my husband at home.

242
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,060
She said, "How much can you earn from the small change you get from selling food."

243
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:31,090
But with that "small change" I brought my family out of poverty.

244
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,130
I did that, but then she said,

245
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,740
how I didn't earn that much money so why did I make my husband feel small or not with that.

246
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,010
It drove me crazy.

247
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:51,650
Whenever that happened, I'd go find the only vending machine in the neighborhood and get myself a cup of coffee.

248
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,880
I calmed my heart while drinking.

249
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,390
Memories about the coffee from the vending machine...

250
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,000
It was my first time drinking it today, though.

251
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,710
It doesn't apply to me.

252
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,800
You should do it!

253
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,170
I don't have memories about the vending machine coffee...

254
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,370
I wonder if something like this is okay too?

255
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,320
When I was young, I went to the hospital a lot because I was weak,

256
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,380
but to make things worse, I was a scaredy-cat so I'd cry when we got the hospital door.

257
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,650
Whenever that happened, my mom used to get me milk from the vending machine.

258
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,810
Not regular milk... but powdered milk. You know, the sweet one.

259
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,650
Afterward, I often lied that I was sick so that I could drink that.

260
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,190
Not knowing it was breaking my mom's heart.

261
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,420
I suddenly miss my mom...

262
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,410
No, I won't do it. I don't... I have nothing to say.

263
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,170
Come on! You have to say something!

264
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,600
I won't say something that's not worth anything.

265
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,330
Hold on. I'll try to persuade him.

266
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,160
Mr. Park!

267
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,870
- Say something, please! 
 - Everyone already did it!

268
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,800
Hold on!

269
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,750
Do you have any memories related to vending machine coffee?

270
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,800
You don't have any either, right?

271
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,740
I have one, but...

272
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,530
the generation gap is exposed with this.

273
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,910
Then tell us, please.

274
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,290
Her name was Min Ji...

275
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:07,080
I drank it a lot with my best friend from high school while going to the study room.

276
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,570
She said that drinking vending machine coffee was the best way to wake yourself up.

277
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,130
Did you really not feel sleepy?

278
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,490
Yes...

279
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,510
Although we ended up chatting all night instead of studying, thanks to that...

280
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,110
Chatting is our strength.

281
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,190
Right...

282
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,230
Unni?

283
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,320
The scene is clear, but...

284
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,200
I can't recall what we talked about.

285
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,960
You can meet up here and just ask.

286
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,560
Unni, let's go together!

287
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,180
Put it here.

288
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,950
You're drinking a lot.

289
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,620
Three cups?

290
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,680
It's four cups.

291
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,740
You didn't drink because you were counting that, I see.

292
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:02,110
Does it look a little degrading because a coffee shop owner is drinking vending machine coffee?

293
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:09,850
No, but for someone so particular about the taste of coffee, I wonder if it's because of your unexpected friendliness?

294
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,540
"Unexpected"?

295
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,730
It's not obvious, for sure.

296
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,980
Do you know how Mr. Nam and Madam Hwang said they felt bad towards me just now?

297
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,220
Oh, right! I was meaning to ask you about that.

298
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,820
When it hadn't been that long since 2Dae Coffee opened... I showed up right here.

299
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:39,620
Those were the times when I only made coffee to win, but my store had zero customers.

300
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,350
The neighborhood's gathering spot was in front of this place, though it was unacceptable to me.

301
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,720
Just how delicious was it...

302
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,490
I was curious, but I was prideful too.

303
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:58,200
After hesitating for a long time, I went at night and secretly drank it.

304
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
For the first time...

305
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
How was it?

306
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,020
It was delicious.

307
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,680
Is that it?

308
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,800
Can you explain using expert terminologies?

309
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,810
Mixture...

310
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,730
The mixture was good too, but there was something more than that.

311
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,570
The area in front of the vending machine and the people who gather here.

312
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,710
I drank one cup of this, but strangely, I felt myself become small and shameful.

313
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,110
Not a winning coffee, but a coffee you drink together.

314
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:45,510
Who would've known I would come to realize that life motto at that moment?

315
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,820
How is it?

316
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,190
Did I get influenced by your story or something?

317
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,170
It's delicious!

318
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,340

319
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,390
 We have to eat lunch.

320
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,580
  - Go Bi! 
 - Yes?

321
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,110
 I guess the lunchtime rush today was no joke?

322
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,670
 It wasn't busy.

323
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,870
 But then... why was Go Bi out of it?

324
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,490
 How about you leave that to Go Bi?

325
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,660
 Would you like to try making a new menu?

326
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,500
 New menu?

327
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,950
 I have something I want to ask... Was it ever tough?

328
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,320
 Yes, every moment is tough.

329
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,940
 I made the diagnosis so you have to find the answer.
