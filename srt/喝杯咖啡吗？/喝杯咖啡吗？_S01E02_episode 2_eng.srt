1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
Hello.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,690
It's your first day.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,180
Yes.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,650
Let's get along well.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,590
Thank you, Sir.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,950

8
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,420
Welcome!

9
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,970
Did the owner change?

10
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,280
The signage is still the same...

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,520
Hello, it's still the same owner.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,840
- I just hired an employee. 
 - I see.

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,260
Hello.

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,730
- What can I get for you today? 
 - I want an Iced Americano, please.

15
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,280
Your Americano is ready.

16
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,190
Welcome!

17
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,850
Did you hire a new part-timer?

18
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,610
He's family.

19
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,700
I've seen you outside the store. I guess you were part of the cafe after all.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,310
Congratulations.

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,240
Is that something to congratulate him for?

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,460
The owner here is no joke.

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,470
Please come in as often as possible during your lunch break.

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,520
We're the ones that should be in your favor. It's our precious lunch break.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,260
Please look after us.

26
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,070
Grab the drinks when they're ready.

27
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,090
It's lunchtime.

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,150
I brought sandwiches for us. Do you want one?

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,690
We'll provide you with lunch so you don't have to bring packed lunches anymore.

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,420
Yes, Sir.

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,930
But I don't think I can have lunch with you today. Kim Joo Hee contacted me just now.

32
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,480
Did something happen?

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,830
I hope it's nothing.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,970
Don't worry about the store and take your time.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,890
You called me out for lunch, but instead, you made me hike?

36
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,350
It's a nice view out here.

37
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,480
This feels nice.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,990
Let's eat kimbab.

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,290
Kimbab?

40
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,830
Oh!

41
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,430
- Are you hungry? 
 - Yes.

42
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,740
It looks delicious.

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh!

44
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,990
How does it feel to enjoy your time like this during the week?

45
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,040
It's nice.

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes? But is it okay for you to take advantage of this on Go Bi's first day of work?

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,280
Why not? It didn't seem like he knew where I was really headed.

48
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,450
Let me have a bite.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,020
It's delicious.

50
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,360
Thank you. Come again.

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Welcome!

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,890
Where is... the boss?

53
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,100
He's on a date.

54
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,800
Therefore, filter coffee is unavailable at the moment.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,750
I'd like an espresso, please.

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,430
Okay, Ma'am.

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,930
The payment...

58
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,470
- I'll do it on my way out. 
 - Sure.

59
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,950
I wonder if Go Bi is doing okay.

60
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,770
No wonder. There was a look of uneasiness.

61
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,380
Right? No matter how many part-time positions he's had at cafes...

62
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,730
No, I meant you.

63
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,820
Oh. I'm okay.

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,330
Let's go.

65
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,450
Why? It's all right, we can stay a little longer.

66
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,530
Only those who have the experience know how to enjoy it. The same goes with knowing how to enjoy your free time like this.

67
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,310
Do I look like I can't relax?

68
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,980
Let's go back to CafÃ© 2Dae.

69
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,070
Awkward.

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,220
How was your date?

71
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,510
Are you on your way out?

72
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,920
Yes.

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,190
Bye!

74
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,320
- See you! 
 - See you.

75
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,400
Welcome!

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,430
Wow! You look great like that!

77
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,020
Have you eaten?

78
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,820
Yes, Sir.

79
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,980
What about the customers?

80
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,660
Seven people came by.

81
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,130
Four of them left because you weren't here. Two people ordered Americanos, and one person ordered an espresso.

82
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,600
Let's have a cup of coffee.

83
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,690
Wow.

84
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,690
Let's see.

85
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,210
I live for this.

86
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,850
What do you think?

87
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,370
How should I put it... It's like that feeling of meeting a friend in your dreams.

88
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,010
A friend?

89
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,670
A friend you fought with and are no longer friends with.

90
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,390
I thought that things wouldn't get better

91
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,750
because of the bitterness and sourness towards each other.

92
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,270
Preferences don't come naturally. They take time.

93
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,770
He really does love taking his time.

94
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,810
But how many people do you think actually drink coffee according to their preferences?

95
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,030
For me, coffee helps me stay awake so I can work.

96
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,990
Truthfully, for me, too.

97
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,550
Oh, is that what it was?

98
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,130
I'm sure some people have tasted the coffee from here and had a newfound preference, too.

99
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,600
Did you guys fight again?

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,010
What?

101
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,710
The friend?

102
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,960
Oh, no. We hung out.

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,840
We played in the flower fields, ate fruits.

104
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,380
We even shared chocolates.

105
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,810
That's nice.

106
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,910
Then why don't you try making that friend again?

107
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,940
- What? 
 - Espresso.

108
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,360
Sure.

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,240
Let's see.

110
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,590
Oh... This...

111
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,160
The grinder and espresso machine have been reset.

112
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,560
All of a sudden?

113
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,420
What's the problem?

114
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,560
We should call the companyâ€”

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,690
- Why should we call the company when I reset it? 
 - What?

116
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,800
Set the machine and try to recreate an espresso that tastes just like the one you just had.

117
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,170
I'll give you one hour.

118
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,740
It's not some Korean cuisine battle.

119
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,440
What are you going to do if a customer comes in?

120
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,900
You're right.

121
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,610
What do we do?

122
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's go somewhere else. There are cafes everywhere.

123
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,050
I heard the coffee is good here, though.

124
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,270
Let's go.

125
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,630

126
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,770
Hi, Ga Won!

127
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,660
Welcome, Ga Won.

128
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,050
I thought the machine was broken.

129
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm broken.

130
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,540
The theme for today changed from "the part-timer's first day of work" to "the reckless training session."

131
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,630
Aren't you too much? It's his first day of work.

132
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,720
I think it's ready now.

133
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,860
Do you want us to drink this?

134
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,320
Because you two will give appropriate feedback.

135
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,690
Then is this free?

136
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,810
How is it?

137
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,450
I think I'm late.

138
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,970
It's almost time.

139
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,410
I'm off!

140
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,380
She must be busy.

141
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,680
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,420

143
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,680
Are you done?

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes.

145
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,090
Let's get going.

146
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,770
Can... I stay a bit longer?

147
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,390
Why?

148
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,800
I'll make sure to set the machine back to normal.

149
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,980
It won't happen overnight.

150
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,030
That's true...

151
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,390
However, even if I go home right now, I'll only think about this.

152
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,120
Okay, then.

153
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,400
Make sure you lock up properly.

154
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,570
I thought it to be too easy.

155
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll make up for the loss and the coffee beans from today.

156
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm the owner.

157
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,590
I'm also the one who will take responsibility.

158
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,460

159
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,980

160
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,520
Yes, Manager Park. I'm back.

161
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,370
I'm on my way home.

162
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,980
It's all right. Who cares about who was the one to go?

163
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,390
But what's up? Why are you calling at this hour?

164
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,060
What are you saying?

165
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,610
Stop talking in circles and get to the point.

166
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,330
What did you say?

167
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:34,400
They're really asking for too much. They're asking a person who isn't even home yet to write a report by tomorrow morning?

168
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,920
Did the deputy director ask you to do this?

169
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm the one who went on the business trip! How would you be able to write the report?

170
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,890
This jerk.

171
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,200
No, not you. He's calling.

172
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,020
I'll talk to you later.

173
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,490
Director!

174
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,410
I got back safely.

175
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,000
Tired? I'm okay.

176
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,920
Yes...

177
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,310
It should have been closed by now.

178
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,150
 Pressure set at nine bar. Water temperature set to  93 degrees.

179
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,410
 I zeroed out the filter.

180
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,170
 The fragrance is also good.

181
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,940
 Measure out exactly eighteen grams and level it out again.

182
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,840
 Tamping.

183
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,010
 Total extraction time is thirty seconds.

184
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,570
 Extract amount, 30 ml.

185
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,130
 There's no reason this would taste badly.

186
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,990
Welcome.

187
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,280
I was really craving this cafe's coffee. This must be my lucky day.

188
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,370
But is the owner not here?

189
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,730
He's already gone home for the day. The store is closed.

190
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Aren't you making coffee right now?

191
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,530
That's true, but... I'm sorry.

192
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm the one who should apologize.

193
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,220
I'll just have a double shot espresso and leave. It won't take long.

194
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,690
I can't...

195
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,020
I don't think I can get through tonight without that cup of coffee.

196
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,330
Please?

197
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,780
 Just now, it was too bitter and dry due to over-extraction.

198
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,190
 So I'll set the grinder to make the grinds a little more coarse.

199
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,600
Why are you doing this to me?

200
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,410
I'm going crazy because of the director at work who only cares about being successful.

201
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,650
All I wanted was to have a good cup of coffee.

202
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,970
Is that so hard?

203
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,500
You're here.

204
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,900
Did you go home late?

205
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,530
No, not too long after you left.

206
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,520
Let's start with an espresso.

207
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,120
Sure.

208
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,640
Who is that? Oh! Ji Young! It's been a long time.

209
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,010
I've been busy these days.

210
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,940
You were working that machine all night long. I guess it broke down after all.

211
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,170
That's not itâ€”

212
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,360
I realized I left without paying for my coffee yesterday.

213
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,660
I came because of that and to have a cup of your coffee.

214
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,980
You don't have to pay for yesterday's coffee.

215
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,570
Today, we don't have espresso.

216
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,970
It doesn't look like it.

217
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,740
He's researching right now.

218
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,810
That's great. Let me help with that research.

219
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,800
- Give me a cup. 
 - I don't think I can do that.

220
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,030
- Why not? 
 - It's a matter of keeping up with CafÃ© 2Dae's reputation.

221
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,020
You weren't hurt by what I said last night, right?

222
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,690
I want to give you a perfect cup of coffee.

223
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,560
That determination is great,

224
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,440
but how will you achieve the perfect shot without any feedback?

225
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,690
I'll help you with it.

226
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:05,360
That way, you'll finish your research faster, and I can have a cup of his coffee sooner.

227
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,980
Don't... you have to go to work?

228
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,160
Can't you see how relaxed I am because I took the day off?

229
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,230

230
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,380
Manager Park, is there something wrong with the report?

231
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,330
 Did you see her yesterday?

232
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,040
I guess it was worth all that trouble. Thank you for the good news!

233
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,570
So what?

234
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,190
What are you saying? Stop talking in circles and get to the point.

235
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,420
Afternoon? Today?

236
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,480
I took the day off, and they're still asking for me to do a presentation?

237
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,650
Do they think I'm some kind of a machine?

238
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:53,220
That they can press a button and can get whatever reports and presentations they want?

239
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,620
They're taking things too far. I'm hanging up!

240
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,610

241
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,380
Let's get started.

242
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,460
What?

243
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,530
Espresso.

244
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,900
Is this rice water or coffee? It's so bland.

245
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,410
Are you sure you measured the beans correctly?

246
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,080
I matched the leveling to be eighteen grams like before.

247
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,790
- You changed the grinding settings, didn't you? 
 - Yes.

248
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,740
Remeasure it.

249
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,580
Don't trust your eyes.

250
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,180
This tastes... salty?

251
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,710
Salty?

252
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,560
- You're taste buds are... 
 - Over-extraction.

253
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,700
She tasted it exactly how it is.

254
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,000
I made sure to keep the extraction time to be exactly thirty seconds.

255
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,510
If the circumstances change, then you need to make additional changes accordingly.

256
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,230
It doesn't matter if it's twenty-five seconds.

257
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,400
Look at the way the coffee drips!

258
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,040
You told me not to trust my eyes.

259
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,970
The feeling.

260
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,060
It's bitter.

261
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,520
I changed the grind to be a little more coarse, and it's bitter?

262
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,010
Did you clean the grinder before changing the settings?

263
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,960
- What? 
 - The finer grinds from earlier must have gotten mixed up with the coarse grinds.

264
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,430
You need to be prepared to throw away at least two cups

265
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,740
or adjust the extraction time taking into consideration the grinds that were mixed in.

266
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,360
He probably expects you to do the latter, right?

267
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,900
Just toss two shots.

268
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,140
All right.

269
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,220
Don't just stand there and watch after pressing the extract button.

270
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,210
You need to watch the extraction drip for the first few seconds.

271
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,530
Watch if it drips evenly.

272
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,920
If it doesn't, then it probably wasn't leveled off properly when you were tamping.

273
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,080
Making sure it's 25 ml or 35 ml isn't what's important.

274
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,580
Look at the amount and the color. Don't think about anything else.

275
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,790
What you need the most right now, is the ability to

276
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,140
decide on what you want your outcome to be, and how you're going to achieve it.

277
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:32,040
I didn't know making a cup of espresso was such hard work.

278
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,740
Indeed.

279
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,740
I thought all it took was a push of a button.

280
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,290
That's right. All it takes is a push of a button.

281
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,710
It's a shame that all the hard work that takes place before that push of a button gets overlooked.

282
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,490
That's me.

283
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,250
Me?

284
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,840
I think it'll taste different this time.

285
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,360
- Where are you going? 
 - To work.

286
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,590
- You said you took the day off. 
 - Thank you.

287
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,720
Was that last espresso okay?

288
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,780
Not you, but him.

289
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,120
I was comforted while being here.

290
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,200
I guess my espresso calls for work.

291
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,710
You contributed as well.

292
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,640
Is that so?

293
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,000
There are times when just the fact that someone acknowledges your hardships can be comforting.

294
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,480
Or she's drunk off of caffeine.

295
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,790
Was it okay?

296
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,360
It's good enough to sell.

297
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,960
- That meansâ€” 
 - Being able to sell it and being good are two different things.

298
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,710
Let's get ready for the lunch rush.

299
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,380
All right, Sir.

300
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,940

301
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,500
 Welcome.

302
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,050
 Hello. Yes, Mr. Kim.

303
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,630
 Yes, I'm in the office.

304
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,350
 Was our cafe an office?

305
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,560
 We'll order a drink later.

306
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,150
 Isn't that customer taking things too far?

307
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,660
 He barely ordered two drinks and stayed the entire day.

308
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,070
 I'm sorry, but can you move your feet?

309
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,640
 He hasn't shown up in a few days.

310
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,360
 Is he not returning because of me?

311
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,330
 Why did you act like that if you can't handle the aftermath?

312
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,560
 Do you know when you concern yourself over something for some reason?
