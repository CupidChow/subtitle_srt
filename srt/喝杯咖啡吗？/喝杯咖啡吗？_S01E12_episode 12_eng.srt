1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
 I'm declaring a public emergency of international concern

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,770
 over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus—

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,180
 WHO's emergency committee,

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:18,060
 is focusing on the speed the virus is spreading, where cases of infection has rapidly increased to 10 times in a week.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,660

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,730
 As the Delta Variant spreads, in Russia, there have been over 20,000 confirmed cases

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,270
 in nine days.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,000
 Even just looking at all of Europe, there has been an increase with newly confirmed cases again as of a week ago.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,780
 The number of people who received their first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,610
 is 2,078 people.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,180
 Just five months since vaccines became available,

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,370
 four out of ten citizens have completed their first shot.

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,140
 80% of the population over 16 years of age who are eligible for the vaccine have been vaccinated.

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,460
 There are evaluations saying that we are actually close to gaining herd immunity.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,470
 Even after the government's declaration that COVID-19 has ended,

17
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,980
 there seems to be no sign of recovery from the stagnant economy.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,590
 You see signs for rent here and over there too.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,430
 Instead of seeing customers through the store's glass windows, you only see darkness.

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,630
 From a state of seeing empty stores every two stores down,

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,460
 it has now become an array of empty stores.

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,680
☕ 𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮 12: Sweet and bitter comforts

23
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,790
Sir?

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,360
Yes?

25
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,030
Never mind.

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,740
Mi Na.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,390
Yes?

28
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,100
Never mind, too.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,540
Just in case I won't be able to make silly jokes like this anymore.

30
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,230
Are you really going to shut down?

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm debating.

32
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,020
I was able to hang in there thanks to meeting a good landlord.

33
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,580
The landlord's son must be the only one celebrating.

34
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,490
Who would've known a day like this would come?

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,420
This bastard flies.

36
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,550
Welcome. Oh, Ms. Kim!

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,330
Hello, Mr. Nam.

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,690
What brings you here?

39
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,140
I'd like to find out the current list prices.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,400
The current list prices?

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,520
For your house?

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,730
Yes. Do single homes not get good prices these days?

43
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,530
Just the land price for that house would be a lot!

44
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,230
Hold on a second.

45
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,080
What is it?

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,950
I think I sort of get it now.

47
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,920
There was someone who asked me to call them if you came by.

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,540
Here.

49
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,610
Hello?

50
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,270
 Mom!

51
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,460
Seo Hye Ji!

52
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,880
Hye Ji, that's not the case.

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,490
I'm sorry, I'll come back next time.

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,930
- You do that. Go back safely. 
 - What do you mean?

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,140
Oh! You need to give my phone back, though!

56
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,190
There may be a rush of customers in the evening.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,290
It's not like this is the first time. Are you disappointed every day?

58
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,370
Of course.

59
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,630
We are doing something good, thanks to it.

60
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,240
I miss the days we sold out before the sun set.

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,040
Did those days even exist?

62
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,830
When are you going to release the new menu?

63
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,520
New menu?

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,550
You're researching gelatos.

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,550
I still have a long ways to go.

66
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,220
It may look simple, but it's actually really hard.

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,360
 Traffic information on Highway 18.

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,610
Hey, go home after you finish with that.

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,680
Today too?

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
Yes.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Okay.

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,490
Are you all right, Joo Hee?

73
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,850
There has never been a safety net with my job anyway.

74
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,240
There is nothing to make it more difficult or not.

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,070
Me, too. I've always worked contact-free by myself.

76
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,490
Unnie Mi Na was talking about 2Dae Coffee, though.

77
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,840
Oh, right.

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,940
Was that what you meant?

79
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm still not sure.

80
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,410
I never thought of that person separately from 2Dae Coffee before.

81
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,380
Your Iced Americano is here.

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,500
- Ahjussi? 
 - Yes?

83
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,050
Nothing.

84
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,330
Is it a trend? The three of you?

85
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,550
Don't smile. You look even sadder.

86
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,110
I'm not sad.

87
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,290
You're sad. That's being sad.

88
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,010
Tragic male lead.

89
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,830
Are you developing a new menu, too?

90
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,420
All of a sudden?

91
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,120
He's on the verge of closing down. I'm sure he's smarter than that.

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,960
I asked because my boss is doing that.

93
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

94
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,760
Is she making something these days?

95
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,810
Gelato.

96
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,260
Gelato? Gelato is good. Wow, but...

97
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,440
it looks simple but making that chewy texture is probably really, tough.

98
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I guess that's why she said she still has a long way to go.

99
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,840
Hearing about Ms. Kim, it seems like our Mr. Park may be up to something, too?

100
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,320
What's that smile?

101
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,140
I heard you asked for me?

102
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,240
Oh, yes. Sit down.

103
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,310
The reason I wanted to see you,

104
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,640
is that our customers are slowly increasing now.

105
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,350
But the impact recently has been no joke.

106
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,550
Yes, that's right.

107
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,810
Which is why...

108
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,990
what do you think about leaving this place for a while and doing something else?

109
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,480
Do you mean something like unpaid leave or an advised resignation?

110
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,640
What are you saying?

111
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,190
Pardon?

112
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,640
I was busy opening branches in the midst of all this.

113
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,110
I was initially going to hire a new employee to oversee the foreign farms.

114
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,130
Could you oversee our foreign farms?

115
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh...

116
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,790
Pardon? Me?

117
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,390
It's not a bad opportunity,

118
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,940
but it requires you to roam all over the mountains and remote areas.

119
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,590
It will be quite tough.

120
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,780
No, I would love it!

121
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,470
I was thinking about asking you to look over the branches if you rejected the offer because it was tough.

122
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,010
You have no issues with traveling abroad, right?

123
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,130
I-I can leave immediately.

124
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,390
It's good that you're young.

125
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,450
It's not confirmed yet so give it some good thought.

126
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,930
Okay.

127
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,170
You keep giving me good opportunities. Thank you, Sir.

128
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,980
Don't mention it. I took you away from your busy schedule.

129
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,660
- You can go and get back to your work. 
 - Okay.

130
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,750
Oh, right. Go Bi?

131
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,700
Do you keep in touch with Hyung Seok these days?

132
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,890
No.

133
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,070
It seems like he's going through a really tough time these days.

134
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,000
I wasn't able to contact him separately.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,720
He's never been the type to show it.

136
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,140
So I was wondering if you had heard anything from him.

137
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,150
Anyway, get back to work.

138
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,580
What do you think?

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,550
I like it.

140
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,710
Really?

141
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,980
What is this? Why is it so delicious?

142
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,160
It's really chewy!

143
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,160
It's a clean sweet taste. Shall we try making an affogato?

144
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,370
I thought that, too.

145
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,550
Now that I think about it, why has 2Dae Coffee never had affogato before?

146
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,530
Because it's hard to find good gelato.

147
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,180
Tomorrow is our day off, what are you doing?

148
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,890
I have time.

149
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,140
Tomorrow? Why?

150
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,550
I want to invite a few more customers and do a taste test...

151
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,270
Oh, that sounds good.

152
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,560
Well, that's that, can you please put one shot of espresso in what I was eating?

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,960
I need to try roasting something that'll go with this.

154
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,800
- Oh... 
 - I'll also try to make it so that the gelato complements the affogato more.

155
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,260
All right, all right. Sure, you have to.

156
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,220
Are you really going to close down?

157
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,930
I don't see that man anymore.

158
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,250
Who?

159
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,630
Jung Kyu. I wanted to go and eat together if he were here today.

160
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,990
He's doing well.

161
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,340
Well, I'm not sure if he's doing well, but it seemed like he was doing his best.

162
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,450
That's a relief.

163
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,600
You know everything.

164
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,160
A lot of things happen here you see.

165
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,610
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

166
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
This is nice.

167
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,010
But why aren't you answering me? Will you really close down?

168
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,660
Is it something I can keep doing just because I want to?

169
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,970
You really know how to make someone speechless.

170
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,340
2Dae Coffee will have its own fate I'm sure.

171
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,970
Let's go.

172
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,420

173
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,830
- I feel like I see you all every day, but it's our first time gathering like this. 
 - You're right.

174
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,980
Thanks to you two, we're getting spoiled.

175
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,540
It's raining.

176
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,080
Should we put those two tables together over there?

177
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,210
How was the coffee today?

178
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,040
What do you think about Robusta?

179
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
Why are you talking about Robusta all of a sudden?

180
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,080
It's usually used in instant coffees because the scent is weaker, but the bitterness is stronger than an Arabica, isn't it?

181
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,980
Is that it?

182
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,940
You still haven't given up that habit of testing others.

183
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,520
People say it lowers the quality, but starting from the cultivation, harvesting, and processing of it,

184
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,170
it has never received as much care as an Arabica so the result is expected.

185
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,780
Also, unlike the Arabica, it does well fighting off diseases and pests and grows well anywhere.

186
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,280
Robusta's potential is infinite. Are you satisfied?

187
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,460
There's a café that's experimenting with the potential of Robusta.

188
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,700
- Even you, too? 
 - Gosh.

189
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,270
Leave me be so I can at least pretend to be a little young.

190
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,670
You all think of Arabica when it comes to brewed coffees.

191
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,840
But when blending espressos, you mix about 20% of Robusta in it.

192
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,060
Why?

193
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,690
That's how they both bring out the taste in the other and balance it out.

194
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,110
It's like someone and someone...

195
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,680
You're right. It would've been nice if he came today.

196
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,570
To try to keep the flavor of the gelato I made alive,

197
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,140
Mr. Park blended the coffee by increasing the ratio of the Robusta.

198
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,580
What does that mean?

199
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,370
Affogato means to pour.

200
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,190
It means quickly pour and drink it.

201
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,180
The rain is stopping.

202
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,670
It's so sweet that it even melts my heart.

203
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,970
Eating it together after trying it separately,

204
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,500
it's so much better.

205
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,100
Isn't this like how the sweetness goes up if you sprinkle salt on watermelon?

206
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,140
Correct.

207
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,840
How strange.

208
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,630
Don't you like it, Madam Hwang?

209
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,560
No, no. I was really struggling these days,

210
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,060
but now that I'm eating this, it feels like it'll work out.

211
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,630
That's persuasive.

212
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,700
Where can we even eat this from now on?

213
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,130
There are many ways that I can make this for you.

214
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm sure this too shall all pass.

215
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,770
Let's do whatever we can to hang in there.

216
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,450
Sure thing!

217
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,720
"The game ain't over until it's over." Yogi Berra.

218
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,580
- Yogi what? 
 - Yo-?

219
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,920
He's an American baseball player.

220
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,980
It's sweet and bitter.

221
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,320
This is the taste of life.

222
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,420
Ga Won? How old is our little Ga Won?

223
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,190
Ms. Kim, just how tough were you on the child?

224
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,820
Me? Oh, no!

225
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,950
Say something, Ga Won!

226
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,540
It's delicious.

227
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,450
Wow, Joo Hee is still very active on her social media.

228
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,460
Apparently, there's only one gelato left.

229
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,360
Who do you think it's for?

230
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,740
Well, that's...

231
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,580
But I never join in on things like this.

232
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,520
What?

233
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,490
Where many gather like this and laugh and socialize.

234
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,440
I just hate this kind of stuff. At least for me.

235
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,770
You seem that way.

236
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,360
- But— 
 - Anyway, that's it.

237
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,030
I need to go to more places before it's 6:00 p.m.

238
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,420
You startled me. What are you still doing there?

239
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,700
Do you know?

240
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,580
What?

241
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,800
You're like a Robusta.

242
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,120
Am I a green bean? How could you say that to my face?

243
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,700
If you don't like that, then forget it.

244
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,380
Long time no see.

245
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,280
Sir!

246
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,220
Have you been well?

247
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,060
Same old for me. What brings you here?

248
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,400
Oh, I was just passing by here.

249
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,560
Aren't you working today?

250
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,820
Yes... I ended a little early.

251
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,070
What about you?

252
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,110
- It's my day off. I'm in customer mode. 
 - Oh...

253
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,180
You used to do that.

254
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,280
Shall we have a cup of coffee?

255
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,120
I would like that.

256
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,580
It's a Robusta espresso that I matched to Ms. Kim's gelato.

257
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,470
Thank you.

258
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,840
It's the last cup of today. You were lucky.

259
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,250
I've always been a little lucky.

260
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,480
Thank you for the coffee.

261
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,080
What do you think?

262
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't you like it?

263
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,840
I can't hold it back.

264
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,540
What can't you hold back?

265
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,600
It's delicious.

266
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,070
How anti-climactic.

267
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,030
How is it?

268
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,800
It's so delicious.

269
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,370
Is that what you learned from Sang Ho?

270
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,820
I'm asking you to use some professional terms.

271
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,340
I missed this taste.

272
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,880
You never tasted this before.

273
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,600
You know what I mean.

274
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,510
Sir?

275
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,170
Can I...

276
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,790
be a 2Dae Coffee employee again?

277
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,400
You can't.

278
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,260
I really think I can be helpful to you right now.

279
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,310
I'm not sure.

280
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm the human Robusta.

281
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I make the Arabica stand out and have many possibilities.

282
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,840
It was good seeing you after a while. Let's meet again.

283
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,620
You're doing this again. Should I or should I not tell CEO Eom tomorrow?

284
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,510
It's your choice whether or not you quit CEO Eom's store. It's my choice whether or not I hire you as an employee at 2Dae Coffee.

285
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,470
But currently 2Dae Coffee has no plans of hiring an employee. The end.

286
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,680
You're so stern.

287
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,920
Did you happen to get kicked out because CEO Eom is struggling, too?

288
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,610
Are you two really close? He's preparing to expand his business.

289
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,430
Really? I'm jealous.

290
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,800
Then are the people not nice?

291
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,960
They are people who are overflowing with hospitality, kindness, and consideration.

292
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Then what is it? Is it because you pity me?

293
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,010
Why would you quit such a nice job?

294
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,600
Are you asking me that because you don't know?

295
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,390
I'll tell you honestly.

296
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,610
There are way too many regular customers.

297
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,710
Do they torment you? Do they abuse their power as customers?

298
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,440
I can't memorize all their names.

299
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,590
You improved a lot.

300
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,380
Are you finally giving me credit now?

301
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,840
But I don't want an employee with bad memory, either.
