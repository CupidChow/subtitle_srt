1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,770
 I'm not a very picky person. 

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,610
 The same goes for when I'm choosing a cafe. 

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,330
 Cafes that are too big are ruled out 

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,290
 because of the possibility of big parties being present and they tend to have loud conversations. 

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,920
 The kindness of staff members increases the favorability of the cafe. 

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,000
 But if they're too kind, then it becomes a burden. 

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
 Music shouldn't be so loud that it could interrupt one's work. 

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,370
- Isn't the volume too loud? 
 - What?

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,530
 I can't concentrate because I can hear the conversation from the table next to me. 

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,000
Can you increase the volume of the music just a little?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
What?

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,220
Manager.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,330
- He's well known. The cafe villain. 
 - Oh, him?

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,740
Just do as he asks.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,960
 The temperature should be set so that it is neither too hot nor too cold once a person takes off their jacket. 

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,860
 Why is it so cold? 

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,530
 It's so hot. 

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,330
 There should be separate restrooms for males and females and they should be within the cafe. 

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,430
 There should also be a window seat so that one can stare out, but it can't face west. 

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,260
 When the sun is setting, one's eyes will tire, and it makes it harder to work on the laptop. 

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,580
 Enjoy. 

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,800
 I don't understand the use of disposable cups when it's not for takeout. 

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,110
 And if possible, I prefer the use of ceramic cups, rather than mugs. 

24
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,040
 The taste of the coffee? Of course, it has to be good. It's a cafe. 

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,520
CEO.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,900
Why here, when you could be at the office?

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,940
 He makes a good point. 

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,460
 Tasty coffee is provided. 

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,450
 And it is a quiet and free space to work in. 

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,500
 It even provides you the chance to network. 

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,210
 All except for the fact that I'm an introverted person. 

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,320
 But then again, I'm short on money too. 

33
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,380
 You say there's no such thing as a cafe that you could use as a personal office space? 

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,510
 No way. 

35
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,680
 They just don't last long. 

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,420
 You're very picky. 

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,090
I'm not that picky.

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,370
You are.

39
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,640
Let's take a look. A startup, you say.

40
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,100
Yes. A startup—

41
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,370
I know. You don't have to explain.

42
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,490
Start.

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,510
Yes, start.

44
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,960
It's still in the works, but—

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,550
I'm sure it'll be a huge success.

46
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,730
Oh, here. This looks like a great place.

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,020
Oh really?

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,530
It has everything you need.

49
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,000
However, it is on the pricier side.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,370
Excuse me?

51
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,560
Oh, Sir. I'm not looking for an office space.

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,620
You said you were.

53
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,770
Oh, no. A place you can use as an office.

54
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,200
That's what I mean.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
A place that you could use as an office, but that has the ambience of a cafe.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,330
No, no. A coffee shop.

57
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,150
I'm looking for a quiet coffee shop.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,370
Then why did you come here?

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,300
I wanted to get information.

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,010
Information...

61
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,070
Welcome.

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,330
Welcome.

63
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,850
Hello, Mr. Kim.

64
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,340
Yes, I'm in the office.

65
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,700
Yes, I'm free to talk.

66
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,260
Oh, I see.

67
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,740
That's all right.

68
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,440
But thank you for looking over the materials and providing feedback.

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
Thank you.

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,420
I'll contact you again next time.

71
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,230
Thank you.

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,730
Was our cafe an office?

73
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,430
I'm not sure.

74
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,380
   

75
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,120
   

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,790
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

77
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,250
Yes, hello, Sir. Did you by chance...

78
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,480
read my project proposal?

79
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,030
Oh, not yet. I see.

80
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,680
No, I'm good.

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,840
It's okay. I can wait.

82
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,470
One of my regulars who's taking a baking class made this. You should try it. It's delicious.

83
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,830
You don't have to. I already feel bad for staying here too long. Thank you so much.

84
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,660
It's not for sale so please feel free to try it.

85
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,390
You can stay here as long you want.

86
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,640
Thank you, Sir.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,580
Thank you.

88
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,270
Mr. Kim's cookies aren't selling well today.

89
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,440
At the bottom of page sixty-three of the proposal I sent you,

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,110
I wrote a detailed explanation.

91
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,290
Yes, that's right.

92
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,760
I need to get back to the office, Sir.

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,120
I'll call back as soon as possible.

94
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,530
Yes, yes. I'll be grateful.

95
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,660
There are 1.57 billion cows in the world and it was such a hot discussion topic in New Zealand...

96
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,050
that they now call it a "fart tax." This part needs to be included.

97
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,390
We must include the topic of cow farts.

98
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,920
Excuse me. I'm so sorry, but I'm trying to step out to go eat.

99
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,440
What?

100
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,280
Oh, I'll order another cup of coffee when I'm back.

101
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,710
I'm so sorry, but can you watch over my seat?

102
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,650
Okay.

103
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,840
Thank you.

104
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,290
Hello, Sir, are you there yet?

105
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm on my way!

106
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,650
Welcome.

107
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,060
Over here.

108
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,080
Have you eaten?

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,240
Yes.

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,240
We'll order in a bit. Let's finish what we started talking about first.

111
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,010
I took a look at everything you sent over.

112
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,870
I think we should share our values first and continue the discussion.

113
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,680
The focus shouldn't be on the sales performance.

114
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,180
I think it should be on the environment.

115
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,650
Welcome.

116
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,820
- Are you Mr. Park Sung Ming? 
 - What?

117
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,220
You told me to come as quickly as possible.

118
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,040
But why do you keep complaining that I should drive safe?

119
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,370
I've never done that.

120
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,320
Sir?

121
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,920
Over here.

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,010
Sorry.

123
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,430
Welcome.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,910
Mr. Park, aren't there any seats?

125
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,660
If it's okay with you, the bar seats are open.

126
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,850
I've always wanted to have a drink at a place like this.

127
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,570
But still, those seats don't seem appropriate for a client.

128
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,450
I'll come back next time.

129
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,170
I'll come back again next time.

130
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,170
I apologize.

131
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,430
Come again!

132
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,130
Isn't he being too much?

133
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,500
About?

134
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,820
He barely ordered two drinks and stayed the entire day.

135
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,840
At least, he ordered two cups. Even if it's one cup, I can't complain.

136
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,080
He hasn't just done this once or twice, it's been a week.

137
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,490
That must mean our cafe is just that great.

138
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,690
At this rate, he'll hang up his own sign for his business.

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,060
I hadn't thought of that.

140
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,660
It's not like we are running a charity.

141
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,600
He should just work at home if he's going to be like that.

142
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,100
Were you ever able to study productively at home?

143
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,210
I'm sorry, but can you move your feet?

144
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,550
Go Bi.

145
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,490
Let's start with this side.

146
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,110
All right.

147
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,110
Oh, look at the time. I'm sorry.

148
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,700
It's still business hours. Take your time.

149
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,190
No, it's almost time. I should head out.

150
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,700
It's nice to see you so focused on your work that you lose track of time.

151
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,770
I found an investor that's interested in my work.

152
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,380
   

153
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,020
Go Bi.

154
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,930
Yes.

155
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,060
What time do we close?

156
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,640
Eight p.m.

157
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
And that means?

158
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,700
Customers can stay until 8 p.m.

159
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,170
I should clean up after 8 p.m.

160
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,360
That's right.

161
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,040
I'll see you tomorrow.

162
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,990
But a customer who abuses our good intention can ruin the cafe's atmosphere.

163
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,260
He makes me angry.

164
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,440
Who?

165
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,720
You know who.

166
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,740
I think we've talked about this enough.

167
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,350
Is he Voldemort? Can't I even mention him anymore?

168
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,500
Voldemort?

169
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,890
Voldemort.

170
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,540
I'll see you tomorrow.

171
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,900
What was that?

172
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,060
   

173
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,230
Welcome.

174
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,830
You're open early today.

175
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,890
I'll order in a bit.

176
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,550
This—

177
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,550
I'm sorry, but can I move these boxes?

178
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,190
That might be a little difficult to do right now.

179
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,010
Hello.

180
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,610
Why don't you have a seat and wait a second? We'll move them for you.

181
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,610
Thank you.

182
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,290
- The feed is made from seaweed? 
 - Yes.

183
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,440
The amount of methane gas that four cows let out is equal to that of one car.

184
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Methane is a greenhouse gas that is twelve times worse than carbon dioxide.

185
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,070
But after feeding the cows seaweed feed,

186
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,770
the methane emitted by the cows decreased by 80%. After reading the study...

187
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,400
I thought it would be a good business item.

188
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,540
So you're trying to produce that?

189
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,470
No, that's not it. I'm building a network

190
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,760
of researchers among people in the feed, livestock, and fishing industry.

191
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,990
They're well aware that this is the right direction,

192
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,560
but because of their interests and business practices

193
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,200
they can't step up to take the initiative.

194
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,980
So you're making a platform to convince them.

195
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,920
That's my goal. Well for now,

196
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,120
it's an online store that sells seaweed.

197
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,130
I can feel your good intentions.

198
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,420
You know how ESG  (environmental, social, governance)  businesses are trending,

199
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,380
I believe that any company that's trying to use all means to increase their sales...

200
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,390
will fall in the end.

201
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,590
Thank you.

202
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,620
Have a seat.

203
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,660
Sure.

204
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,290
Do you want your usual order?

205
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,780
I'll try today's coffee.

206
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,150
Is Colombia Supremo okay for you?

207
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,140
I'll go with my usual.

208
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,020
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,810
I thought he was ungrateful and annoying.

210
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,790
You shouldn't have done that even if he was annoying.

211
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,850
If you're going out to eat, you can leave your stuff.

212
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,800
No, there's an urgent meeting so I'm leaving early.

213
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,300
Yes. Oh!

214
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,810
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,610
It's fine.

216
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,280
He apologized only to me, right?

217
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,520
He hasn't come by in the last few days.

218
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,220
Do you miss him, now that you haven't seen him in a few days?

219
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,140
Not quite.

220
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,470
I'll get going.

221
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,940
You worked hard today. Good work.

222
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,130
Aren't you leaving?

223
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,690
Is he not coming back because of me?

224
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,040
Who? Voldemort?

225
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,050
You know how some people...

226
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,390
strangely get into your mind?

227
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,750
You can't even be mean to people. Then why were you cold towards him?

228
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:32,070
He calls himself a businessman, but he's so simple-minded. He can't succeed like that.

229
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,540
Have you heard of Elephant House?

230
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,030
Elephant House? Is it a zoo?

231
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,350
It's a cafe in Edinburgh, Scotland.

232
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,140
The coffee there must be well known.

233
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,740
I'm don't know since I've never had it.

234
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,090
But it's well known as the cafe where JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter.

235
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
She was a single mother on government benefits,

236
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,700
and she wanted to write a book. That is a fantasy,

237
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,360
but JK Rowling made that happen.

238
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,930
She would go on walks with her daughter in a stroller, and when her daughter would sleep, she'd go to Elephant House,

239
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,530
order a cup of coffee and write.

240
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,290
I wasn't aware of that,

241
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,580
but that's amazing.

242
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,370
Imagine if that cafe owner had kicked her out, saying there was a time limit to use the cafe.

243
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,960
Do you think Harry Potter would have been possible?

244
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,370
There are other cafes.

245
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,730
Not all the beans on this tray are going to be coffee beans.

246
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:46,440
Cafes have good compatibility with some customers just like how some coffee beans have certain profiles that fit them.

247
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,290
Welcome!

248
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,150
Hello.

249
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,590
It's been a while since you came.

250
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,020
Yes, I got a few offer proposals for my project...

251
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,910
I've been busy presenting my project to all the interested investors.

252
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,450
You must be looking into an office space now.

253
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,580
Actually, I'm here to meet an investor that's interested in my project.

254
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,150
Here?

255
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,080
It might be a good idea to change your meeting place.

256
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,380
But the investor wanted to meet where I work.

257
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,350
And I think that I might have more confidence meeting the investor in my seat.

258
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,670
But it doesn't look like they're going to leave anytime soon.

259
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,500
What can we do?

260
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,210
Oh, it's okay. I still have time so I'll wait it out.

261
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,360
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

262
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,850
We're in the midst of testing out how well a dessert pairs with a test sample of coffee beans.

263
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,920
And so?

264
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,100
If it's okay with you, I'd like for you to taste test and provide us with some feedback.

265
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,090
Sure, that sounds good.

266
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,860
That's fine.

267
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,940
It's free, right?

268
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,540
Of course, but I was hoping to have you test it out at the bar seats.

269
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,010
Sure, it doesn't matter.

270
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,620
It's very still unclear. I think it's unrealistic.

271
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,500
I think so, too.

272
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,300
But I want to invest in it.

273
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,730
We can do it if it's in the right direction.

274
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,710
I hope we get along well.

275
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,520
Thank you!

276
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,060
How is it?

277
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,410
It's good.

278
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,200
Right?

279
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,420
Should we get going?

280
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,000
Sure.

281
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,290
The coffee was great.

282
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,320
Thank you.

283
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,480
He'll find an office soon so he'll stop coming here. You must be disappointed.

284
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,760
No, not at all. We're just grateful.

285
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,310
I must have troubled you a lot. Thank you for everything.

286
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,390
You taught me that our cafe can become The Elephant House so I'm grateful to you, too.

287
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,910
Elephant House?

288
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,490
Come by once in a while when you need to take a breather.

289
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,460
That sounds like a plan.

290
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,670
Oh, can I get a business card?

291
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,570
Sure, here you go.

292
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,200
We've been looking into changing the coffee beans in our office because our current one isn't that great.

293
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,890
We'll contact you within the next few days.

294
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,890
Thank you.

295
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,390
Goodbye.

296
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,220
Thank you!

297
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,130
Come again!

298
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,160
Did we just get a business deal?

299
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,340
It seems that way.

300
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,190
 I'm having a bad day. 

301
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,170
 There are no coffee beans wherever I go. 

302
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,880
 And I keep getting stupid calls. 

303
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
 Hello! 

304
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,960
 Can you put some coffee in here? I'll be going soon. 

305
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,830
 It's not that... 

306
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,440
 What's this? How dare you come here? 

307
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,690
 I wasn't going to say this but... 

308
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,530
 Are you even providing much for Hye Ji when your column doesn't make enough money? 

309
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,140
 He came again? 

310
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,120
 Hye Ji, I'm sorry.
