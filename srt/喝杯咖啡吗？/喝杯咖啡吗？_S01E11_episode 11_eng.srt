1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,710

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,030

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,850
Excuse me?

4
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,690
Me?

5
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,990
Gosh, it is noisy. I can't sleep.

6
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,810
I think something is missing.

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,840
What is it?

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,900
Drums. We need drums.

9
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,650
You know what song this is, right?

10
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,000
Tommy Emmanuel?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,710
It is my song. The title is "Boomer Warning."

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,970
The title. It is good.

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,120
What is it?

14
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,160
Would you like a cup of coffee?

15
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,100
Why?

16
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,540
The youth these days, the way they even approach music is different from back in our days.

17
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,420
You do music, I see.

18
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,180
No, I don't.

19
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,950
I thought the person's performance just now was all right.

20
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,010
That is because you don't really know music.

21
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,510
You're right.

22
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,190
I have only worked on coffee.

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,840
Does the coffee taste all right?

24
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,600
Well, it is not bad for free coffee.

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Goodbye.

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,160
Have a good day.

27
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,660
 ☕ 𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮 11: Light and Noise

28
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,380
Come again!

29
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,810
Do you want me to come again?

30
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,510
Yes.

31
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,210
I didn't pay, though.

32
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,740
You will probably pay if you come again.

33
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,730
I have money.

34
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,750
I guess the coffee wasn't to your liking.

35
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,330
You're right.

36
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,350
Then don't pay next time either.

37
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,170
I will take the money when the coffee is worthy of it.

38
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,540
Then suit yourself.

39
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,640
This is how you steam. Then if you press it like this, the extractor will operate.

40
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,070
The boiler is down here.

41
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,820
- Oh, it is down there. 
 - Yes.

42
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,020
Hello!

43
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,390
- Welcome! 
 - What brings you all the way here?

44
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,740
- Do you know them, Go Bi? 
 - Yes.

45
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,100
I will watch over here so go and see them.

46
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,340
- Is it okay if I do that? 
 - Yes.

47
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,020
How could you just leave without even saying goodbye?

48
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,380
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,230
How does it feel working in a place like this?

50
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,730
It feels like I leveled up.

51
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,710
You made the right decision.

52
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,760
People have to swim in bigger water.

53
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,070
Is the boss doing well?

54
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,280
- His condition these days is— 
 - He is doing very well.

55
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,520
He's doing well.

56
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,670
Seeing another person standing next to you instead of Ahjussi Seok,

57
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,030
- something feels— 
 - Much more easy on the eyes.

58
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,230
It's good.

59
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,730
Oh, gosh. We took too much of your time away from work.

60
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,970
Oh... I can't really be away for too long.

61
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,310
These are our signature menus so please enjoy!

62
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,000
Please come by the counter when you leave.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
- Okay, thank you! 
 - You can get going.

64
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,430
Thank you for the coffee.

65
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,120
Isn't he doing a little too well?

66
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,170
His face... it has lightened up. It sure has.

67
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,090
It was always that way.

68
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:41,030
Even if we were at each other's throats and fought in the past, it was still fun to work together.

69
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,890
Youngsters these days don't even know how to work together,

70
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,440
they don't even want to.

71
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,840
It is sad, right?

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,950
I think they all think of it too easily.

73
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,800
It is because they all lack discipline.

74
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,490
Seok Pil, you,

75
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,990
even though you're dressed that way, your spirit is still the same.

76
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,210
What am I going to do with this guy?

77
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,500
What is wrong?

78
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,750
Hyung, let's get it together.

79
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,450
Until when are you going to live like this?

80
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,740
What is wrong with living like this?

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,820
The world changed a long time ago, yet you're still going on about drummers.

82
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,070
Won't you do anything?

83
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,770
I'm doing stuff, too. In my own way.

84
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,940
What are you doing?

85
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,130
Why do I even bother?

86
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,800
So? Will you join us or not?

87
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,690
Dressed like that?

88
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,980
What is wrong with this?

89
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,350
Why did you cut your hair?

90
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,390
What about you then?

91
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,160
I don't do it.

92
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,490
You said you do, in your own way.

93
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,160
Hey, let's stop. I'm tired.

94
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,320
What we did in the past... It is just noise.

95
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,240
A past I just want to erase now.

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,200
Hey. You can't talk like that.

97
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,470
Forget it, forget it. Let's just get up.

98
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,870
Was the coffee all right?

99
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,320
Yes. Thank you. It was really good.

100
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,310
It wasn't that good for me.

101
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,800
Then excluding the person who didn't enjoy it, it's ₩6000 for one cup.

102
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm sorry, he's normally not like this. I will pay for both cups.

103
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,820
Hey, I will pay for this.

104
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,950
Will you?

105
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,190
What? Go on out. I will be out after I pay.

106
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,750
You don't have to.

107
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,490
I will stop by from time to time if I ever have to pass by this area.

108
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,450
Goodbye.

109
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,060
Put it on the tab, please.

110
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,540
We don't keep tabs.

111
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,530
Can you write down your phone number?

112
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,050
You can take your ID.

113
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,140
Come again.

114
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,530
Did he come often before?

115
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,290
No, recently.

116
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,850

117
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,680
Oh...I was right.

118
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,150
Baek Jong Gil.

119
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,030
Look here.

120
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,220
This person... is that person?

121
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,840
Yes. He was the vocalist slash guitarist for the Black Metal band, Dead Seed.

122
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,460
Metal? Do you listen to stuff like that too?

123
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,350
What? Can't I?

124
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,920
Does he no longer do it?

125
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,980
It isn't that he is not doing it, he can't.

126
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,540
Why not?

127
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,970
The drummer died in a car accident.

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,580
After that, he completely disappeared from the indie scene.

129
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,500
He couldn't find a new drummer, I see.

130
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,460
He didn't find one.

131
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,690
They took a step forward into the darkness that they were desperately searching for

132
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,740
so they no longer had a reason to continue anymore.

133
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,760
Would it be okay if I sit for a moment?

134
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,190
I'm doing something right now so please come later.

135
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,580
You're Baek Jong Gil from Dead Seed, right?

136
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,910
Yes, what about it?

137
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,190
Could I ask for your autograph, please?

138
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,880
We didn't even make a lot of copies...

139
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,780
I'm a fan. My name is Kim Joo Hee.

140
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,410
Are you writing poems?

141
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,030
I'm just scribbling.

142
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,190
Thank you!

143
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,510
How was the coffee today?

144
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,410
It was bitter.

145
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,110
Goodbye.

146
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,070
Are you happy?

147
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,200
I am!

148
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,790
So noisy.

149
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,400
This thing actually rings, I see.

150
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,460
Yes?

151
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,110
What?

152
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,410
Okay.

153
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,170
- He's here. 
 - Oh.

154
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,650
I'm not someone to run away without paying back ₩6,000.

155
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,650
I'm a businessman, too, you see.

156
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,800
What should I do first?

157
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,770
Cleaning? The dishes?

158
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,900
Can you please see if that boy over there has talent?

159
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,580
Tae Hyun, say hello.

160
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,020
Hello.

161
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,370
Did you write this?

162
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,830
It is Seashells Tied.

163
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,250
This song was that song...

164
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,960
- I was told that if a boy can play this much when he didn't learn from anywhere, it makes him a prodigy. 
 - Oh...

165
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,130
Right?

166
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,970
Prodigy...

167
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,680
Can you give me your guitar for a moment?

168
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,050
Can you try playing after me?

169
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,840
Don't feel pressured. Be comfortable.

170
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,940
Mom...

171
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,830
Are you crying, my son?

172
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, don't cry. Why are you crying?

173
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,370
- What is wrong with him? 
 - It is okay.

174
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,030
Don't cry, don't cry.

175
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,450
Hey, wait a moment, Sir.

176
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,370
Yes?

177
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,050
Please take Tae Hyun in as your student.

178
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,980
Mom?

179
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,710
I was looking for a teacher who wouldn't go easy on him.

180
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,670
In return, could you push him as hard as you can?

181
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,850
Whiplash. It is my favorite movie.

182
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,190
What's wrong with her?

183
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,570
Madam, could you listen to what I have to say?

184
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,780
 What? I brought him over because of you.

185
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,450
 How could you introduce us to a man like that?

186
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,420
 You saw how he played, right?

187
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,740
It is Costa Rica Tarrazu coffee.

188
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,330
I no longer owe you anything, right?

189
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,010
Yes.

190
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,980
This coffee was made with green beans that went through honey processing.

191
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,690
There is a subtle fruity acidity and strong sweetness to it. It is a coffee that lingers for a long time.

192
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,150
Enjoy it slowly.

193
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,950
You were pitying me then.

194
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,190
I don't understand what you're saying.

195
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,040
Sir, you want to be a nice person, don't you?

196
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,780
Normally green beans from Central American coffee naturally have weak characteristics,

197
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,990
but that weakness got people interested in more experimental processing methods.

198
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,060
Honey processing is a good reflection of Costa Rica's processing methods from that interest.

199
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,150
Even so, coffee is all the same in the end.

200
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,970
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

201
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,110
You're so twisted like a pretzel!

202
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:22,300
You're right. It was taken from the South American processing method called Pulped Natural, only the name was changed.

203
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,690
In the end, it is a copy.

204
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,900
For music too. I hate people who just copy other people's work.

205
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,550
But Costa Rican farmers didn't stop at just copying that, instead they subdivided the steps of Honey Processing more.

206
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:42,460
From white to black. With more diverse flavors and easier names.

207
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,250
This is why the name "Honey Processing" has become a standard of its own now.

208
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,870
You're doing what I did to the boy just now, right?

209
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,710
Trying to make me feel small by showing off your knowledge?

210
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,160
You really don't get it.

211
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,920
How is saying that "we should still try to make something out of it" the same as scaring a child away?

212
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,040
Madam, you have a temper.

213
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,760
I'm not a "Madam," but a regular!

214
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,020
Regardless, from now on, whether our coffee is tasty or not, it is free.

215
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,380
Come by whenever you want.

216
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,820
Should I post a picture on social media and write a sentimental post for you?

217
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,450
That is what you want from me, right?

218
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,450
I have never given you coffee out of pity, not once,

219
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,460
but I think I will have to do that from now.

220
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,380
See? You're finally showing your true colors.

221
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,800
They're all the same.

222
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,220
Isn't it okay to pity someone who has given up on himself?

223
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,660
What do you want?

224
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,920
I don't want anything.

225
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,370
You have a talent.

226
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,860
I don't have anything like that.

227
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,360
You do.

228
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,550
You have low blood pressure, but you have the talent to give others high blood pressure.

229
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,590
That is not the first time I have heard that.

230
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,690
Just do it!

231
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,850
- Do what? 
 - Music.

232
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,940
I won't.

233
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,720
Can't you make a song for your friend who is no longer here?

234
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,800
Isn't that what true courtesy is?

235
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,990
You even wrote all the lyrics anyway.

236
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,770
No matter how much I look at him... It is a little...

237
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,080
The picture is too awkward.

238
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,650
You're right.

239
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,610
Madam Min!

240
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,300
Mr. Park, you haven't been doing well, have you?

241
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,820
I'm all right. Have you been well?

242
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,240
You know me, because of the one son that I have,

243
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,300
I'm going to die early.

244
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,730
Mom! I'm a grown man too—

245
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,410
For someone who says he's mature—

246
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,790
Oh, you had customers. Excuse us, please.

247
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,780
It is all right, Madam. Please carry on.

248
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,630
Oh, okay.

249
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,630
Whatever Ki Jung, this punk said, our promise is still valid.

250
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,370
You only think about making delicious coffee for a long time.

251
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,390
What are you doing?

252
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,170
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,540
I will live as a better person.

254
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,020
You have to drink a cup of coffee.

255
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,370
I would love to, but next time.

256
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,290
This punk went around making a mess of so many things so I don't have enough time in the day.

257
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,180
Mom... I just tried to make things better—

258
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,760
Do you think any idiot can run a business?

259
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,600
My apologies.

260
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,340
You think it looks easy because he was in the same spot for twenty years, don't you?

261
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,150
All right. S-Stop. Stop it.

262
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,400
Do you really think the world is your oyster?

263
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,470
All right, then!

264
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,750
- Go back safely. 
 - Goodbye.

265
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,950
Bye.

266
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,970
Will Go Bi not come back even if he knows about this?

267
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,730
He's someone who left without even knowing it was closing down.

268
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,540
Was he always that ambitious?

269
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,320
It's probably not that simple.

270
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,950
Ahjussi? Should I try contacting Oppa Go Bi?

271
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,260
No, don't do that.

272
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,950
I'm here to pay back the coffee bills.

273
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,090
Mom! I got the car out, what are you doing here?

274
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,500
I don't know, you punk. Just quickly come in.

275
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,950

 - Sir?

295
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,020
 - Ahjussi? 
 - Yes?

296
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,340
 It's nothing.

297
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,640
 Is it a trend?

298
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,260
 Don't smile. You look even sadder.

299
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,070
 You keep giving me good opportunities. Thank you, Sir.

300
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,590
 I won't take any more of your busy time. Go on down back to work.

301
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,020
 What do you think?

302
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,440
 It's good.

303
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,740
 What is this? Why is it so delicious?

304
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,910
 Should we try making an affogato?

305
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,060
 What are you doing tomorrow on your day-off?
