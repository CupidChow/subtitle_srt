1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,640
Welcome, Sir.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,770
I understand very well what you're saying. It's not that I don't know,

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,090
but it's because we still have some time left.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,140
Is that what my mother said?

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,720
No–

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,420
Yes? Did she say that last month?

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,490
To me...

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,460
Are you open?

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,590
Oh, not yet... but come on in.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,760
Thank you.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,570
It might be a little hectic because of our opening preparations, will that be okay?

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,130
Of course.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,000
I will take the filter coffee.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,620
Oh, for me...

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,860
Just give me whichever one you want.

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,080
Then I will explain the menu for you a little—

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,530
No, no need. Just give me the same thing.

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,420
Then I will prepare two cups of filter coffee.

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,680
Captain Lee?

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,310
- Are you upset with me? 
 - "Upset"? No way.

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,160
You didn't do anything wrong, Chief Kim.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,840
However... I'm only asking for you to see my side, too.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,250
What about mine?

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,370
No matter how young and inexperienced I am, can someone treat a construction company employee so rudely?

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,120
No, they definitely can't,

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,210
but you know our technician well, too, Chief Kim.

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm not comfortable around him, either. Only my position is higher...

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,140
He's someone I need to serve while I work, too.

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,420
If you fire that man... what does that make me?

31
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,710
Did I ask you to leave?

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,840
Just fire that man.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,150
Is he the only technician?

34
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,870
Not all technicians are the same.

35
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,970
He's an expert. A total expert!

36
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,960
He's amazing at his job. You admit that too, right, Chief Kim?

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,110
His job? Yes, I guess so...

38
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,800
Then that is enough.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,330
Let it go once for my sake, please?

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,170
If it seems like I bent over this time, then in the future I will also—

41
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,830
Oh, come on! This isn't my first time. I will talk you up so people won't look down on you.

42
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,360
If I go to the site right now, I will say,

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,600
"We are all on the verge of getting fired because of you, Hyungnim."

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,240
"Are you going to pay our bills?" I'm going to crush that guy!

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,030
Chief Kim?

46
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,450
Okay... I will think about it.

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,420
Gosh.

48
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,570
It's so tiring.

49
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,460
Gosh, seriously.

50
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,910
I guess my drip techniques still need a lot of work.

51
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,480
But at least one person finished it all.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,380
Why come to a cafe if he was going to do this?

53
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,670
I would try drinking it so at least my money doesn't go to waste.

54
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,250
Did you recommend something from the menu for him?

55
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,260
No.

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,640
You have to recommend him something—

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not that I didn't, I couldn't do it.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,820
He said, "No."

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,740
Then there's nothing you can do about that.

60
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,950
You talk about it like it doesn't concern you at all.

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,230
I suddenly feel really competitive.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,120
If you come next time...

63
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,280
Will he even come again?

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,320
No... I'm sorry.

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,650
But... did something happen?

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,160
No.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,320
You seem a little...

68
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,130
Forget it. I'm just sensitive this morning.

69
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,280
Hyung Sung Bae, are we going somewhere?

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,760
We said we were going to talk over some coffee. We are almost there.

71
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,370
Are we going all the way to Busan or what?

72
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,090
There are a ton of convenience stores. We need to quickly drink a can of coffee and take a nap.

73
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,560
We just need to go a little further. We are almost there.

74
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,250
What do you think, Hyungnim? A good atmosphere, right?

75
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,090
This isn't our style, though.

76
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,360
Do you want us to go in like this?

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,590
Have you been here before?

78
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,040
Of course, that's why I brought you here.

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,340
 ☕ 𝓔𝓹𝓲𝓼𝓸𝓭𝓮 8: Hipster

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,000
How could we not?

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,640
Hey, three cups of coffee here!

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,420
- Welcome. 
 - Yes, yes!

83
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,630
Over there.

84
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,320
Do you want us to drink here?

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,660
Are you trying to punish us?

86
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,070
Don't be so untrendy. We should come to a place like this once in a while.

87
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,310
Let's just quickly drink a cup and go.

88
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,030
Hello, Sir. You came again!

89
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,840
He recognizes me.

90
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,640
If you look here, there are a lot of coffee varieties. If you tell me your preference—

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,450
"Preference"? No, just give us three cups of what I drank last time.

92
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,930
Are you talking about the filter coffee?

93
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,420
Yes, that one. Give us that.

94
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,760
- Here, here. 
 - Welcome.

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,530
We have to start from here. Hyungnim! Can you take a look?

96
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,290
I already know everything. Why are you laying it out?

97
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,280
I'm telling you not to keep doing things your way. You're killing me, Hyungnim.

98
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,500
Do you see?

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,740
You came here to punish me, didn't you?

100
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,130
You're trying to intimidate me so I can't say a word, right?

101
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,340
Well, I can't say stuff like this in front of the workers!

102
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,110
Why is it taking so long to pour a cup of coffee?

103
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,830
Are you sure you ordered correctly?

104
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,390
Why are you being like this, too, Young Man?

105
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,920
Hey, Young Man! How much longer will it take?

106
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,480
Filter coffee takes a little time. I'm almost done.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,060
Oh, right! What did you talk about with Chief Kim yesterday?

108
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,690
That's right! Why aren't you talking about that bastard?

109
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,110
Give me a moment to look honorable, too, please.

110
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,790
Look at this punk.

111
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,300
You saw Chief Kim just now. He didn't say anything because we sorted it out well.

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,020
So exactly how did you sort it out?

113
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,530
What do you mean, "how"?

114
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,990
I crushed that young bastard!

115
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,920
How?

116
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,870
"We can't work without Hyungnim Ho Seok."

117
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,580
"Our entire team will pull out so look for someone else quickly."

118
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,900
Sung Bae, you're the man.

119
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,220
I didn't get the position of Captain by playing a round of Go Stop. This is the least I can do.

120
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,980
Thank you for waiting.

121
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,120
I thought you were brewing oriental medicine or something.

122
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,930
I think a lot of people must've died while waiting for coffee, right?

123
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,920
If you wanted something fast to drink, an Americano would've been good.

124
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,490
Oh, Americano! Isn't this an Americano?

125
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,330
This coffee was made by pouring boiled water slowly over finely grounded beans in a filter.

126
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,690
It's also called a hand drip because you use your hands.

127
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,870
Oh, this is a hand drip...

128
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,010
The flavor and aroma are amazing, but it takes some time.

129
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,700
How annoyingly complicated and complex.

130
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,050
Americano's are faster because you just have to mix espresso that was extracted from a machine with water.

131
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,570
It all looks the same, though, right?

132
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,770
Try savoring the taste while drinking it slowly.

133
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,040
- We have no time. Just quickly down it, and let's get going. 
 - Okay.

134
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,540
So hot! Gosh.

135
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,710
I thought it was bitter last time because of my mood, but it's the same.

136
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,070
This coffee seems a little different.

137
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,410
Do you even know anything?

138
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,920
Just quickly drink it and get up.

139
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,000
Gosh... so bitter.

140
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,030
Go and eat, Sir.

141
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,930
He drank it all today, though.

142
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,370
Yes.

143
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,580
Is that not good enough for you?

144
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,400
You saw, right? He downed it. He didn't drink it.

145
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,210
I suddenly miss Choi Hurt...

146
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,730
Oh, no, no, no... that's not right either.

147
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,270
Hey, Young Man!

148
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,670
Oh, your notebook?

149
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,830
Oh, it was here, I see!

150
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,830
Yes, it's here.

151
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,380
Bring it to me. I'm busy.

152
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm so frazzled.

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,690
Thank you, thank you. I will come again!

154
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,610
Good bye.

155
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,510
Please stop coming now.

156
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,630
Will he stop coming, though?

157
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,740
Why do you keep doing that? You're scaring me.

158
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,380
Go and eat.

159
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,710
Hello?

160
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,550
Yes, this is 2dae Coffee.

161
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,530
Oh, yes, hello.

162
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,160
Yes, of course, I remember you,

163
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,010
but we don't do deliveries.

164
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,170
We are not even listed in the delivery app.

165
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,780

166
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,230
Young Man, the coffee's here. Bring Hyungnim and the guys over.

167
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,290
Hey, Young Man!

168
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,510

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,020
Thank you!

170
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,740
Don't you have something sweeter? Like an iced mocha or caramel latte?

171
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,670
I recommended it, but...

172
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,360
- Did you ever hear about filter coffee? 
 - No.

173
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,610
This is what you call a filter coffee.

174
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,710
The flavor and aroma live up to the expensive price. Try it, you punk.

175
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,750
This is an Americano, though...

176
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,930
It's nice and hectic here with the rain and all.

177
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,930
I'm treating our team big time for all the hard work

178
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,800
so comfortably drink it up and let's energize ourselves!

179
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,460
I'll drink it later!

180
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,660
It already melted a lot while I brought it over so you have to drink it now for it to be good.

181
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,110
It's all the same thing. Just leave it.

182
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,320
I would rather just drink cold water. Why would you waste money on this bitter thing?

183
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,550
Gosh, Hyungnim...

184
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,100
That's what I'm saying. You shouldn't spend your money on stuff like this and just buy us soju later.

185
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,370
It's raining too.

186
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,520
I will treat you when we are done!

187
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,690
Is this really filter coffee?

188
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,150
That guy...

189
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,100
- I will get going. 
 - Oh!

190
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,490
Okay, Young Man! I'll order with more variety next time!

191
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm not "Young Man", but "Barista."

192
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,230
Also, our store doesn't do deliveries so don't order anymore.

193
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,230
Are you upset?

194
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,930
No. I'm angry.

195
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,330
What?

196
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,340
What's wrong with him?

197
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,660
- Oh... a-all right then. Why don't we go and rest now? 
 - Oh, yes!

198
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,610
Let's rest.

199
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,210
It's finally my lunchtime now.

200
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,360
I skipped my meal and delivered it in the rain because I know your work is tough.

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
- Don't you think this is a little wrong? 
 - Come on!

202
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,290
Each person's preference can be a bit different. Don't be so sensitive after hearing something a little negative—

203
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,790
Do you even have a preference?

204
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,000
Are you looking down on me because I work at a construction site?

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,130
Did I not pay for the coffee or what?

206
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,590
The money isn't the problem.

207
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,240
You don't take my recommendations, and you even lie about the menu.

208
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm doing this because the time and effort I put into a cup of coffee are being looked down on.

209
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,660
What about making buildings then? Forming the base, building the formwork, nailing metal, using tools.

210
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,060
You think that anyone can do it after learning it for half a day, right?

211
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,720
I never looked down on what you do, Captain.

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,010

213
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,810
Are you still angry?

214
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,860
Yes.

215
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,130
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

216
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,670
I told you not to go, but you insisted on going.

217
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not taunting you so don't misunderstand.

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,130
That's why I'm angrier... He didn't recognize my sincerity.

219
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,370
You...

220
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,170
pitied them, don't you think?

221
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,620
What do you mean?

222
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,810
I'm just wondering, if a big company's CEO did that, would you have done it...

223
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,280
You might've cussed him out, but I don't think you would've delivered it for him.

224
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,530
Don't you think, inside your heart already, you thought of those people differently from other customers?

225
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm sure it was out of goodwill, but it wasn't equal treatment.

226
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,410
I'm embarrassed.

227
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,770
Have you heard of "banco" before?

228
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,680
That's what they call a bar table in Italian.

229
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,720
Our 2dae Coffee's bar table is made to sit like this, but originally the plan was that.

230
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,880
Oh... a concept where you stand, quickly drink and go?

231
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,890
People think of Italy when you talk about espressos, but did you know it's surprisingly rare to find well-made coffee over there?

232
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,810
Oh, really?

233
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:08,900
They make their beans by dark roasting cheap green beans with high caffeine content to the point of almost burning them.

234
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,640
Oh, I did hear that most people drink it with sugar.

235
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,400
It masks the flaws of cheap beans while adding sweetness to them too.

236
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,040
So it's perfect for busy laborers to down a cheap and delicious cup of coffee before heading to work.

237
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,180
The atmosphere is just a plus.

238
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,840
I didn't know that.

239
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,850
This spot... was originally made for that purpose.

240
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

241
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,790
Seok Hyung, have you been well?

242
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,060
Say hello, this here is my coffee-making junior, Eom Sang Ho.

243
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,480
- This here is Kang Go Bi. 
 - Oh!

244
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,510
I've heard a lot about you.

245
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,680
I thought you were a customer... Hello.

246
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,920
We will get going first so you wrap up quickly today and go home to rest.

247
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,980
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye, Sir.

248
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,540
Go Bi! Let's have a cup of coffee together next time!

249
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,180
Okay. I'll see you next time.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,390
What brings you here?

251
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,330
I just dropped by after my company dinner nearby.

252
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,060
Are you closed?

253
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,410
Yes... but come on in.

254
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,350
My clothes may seem fine, but my feet are full of dirt.

255
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,430
Oh, that's why you called me from over there last time too.

256
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,300
I just... wanted to apologize and go.

257
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,680
- "Apologize"? 
 - Well, you know...

258
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,080
There are no coffee shops that allow us in... I didn't know how lucky I was.

259
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,250
Young Man...

260
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,730
Oh, no, Barista... you were so friendly

261
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,170
so I made a mistake.

262
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,410
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,100
I was going to go and apologize to you, too.

264
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,700
- Come on in. I'll give you a cup of coffee. 
 - Gosh...

265
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,970
you already cleaned everything up... I don't want to cause you more work.

266
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,930
Cleaning is my job.

267
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,020
Don't worry and come on in.

268
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,630
Okay then.

269
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,930
Excuse me a little.

270
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,550
Where? Sit over h-here?

271
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,820
Yes, sit wherever is comfortable.

272
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,680
- Oh, but can you drink coffee at night? 
 - Gosh!

273
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,500
Even after ten cups of coffee, I fall right asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow.

274
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,150
Don't worry.

275
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,370
That's good. I had a few cups that I wanted you to try.

276
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,650
"Few cups"? Not filter coffee?

277
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,640
Yes, espresso.

278
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,740
Oh, that thing you drink from a tiny glass?

279
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,870
Just the look of it is already so bitter, so for me, it's a little...

280
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,820
You came to apologize, right?

281
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,280
It came out so quickly.

282
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,680
Try a sip without stirring it first. Just a little.

283
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,160
Your character seems to have changed a little.

284
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,780
It's not that bitter, only slightly.

285
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,670
But why is this a little sticky?

286
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,240
You felt it correctly then.

287
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,400
The feeling of a well-made espresso is different.

288
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,280
Now try it after stirring it well with a spoon.

289
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,090
Stir it?

290
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,790
Why is it sweet?

291
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,630
Caffe con zucchero. It means coffee with sugar.

292
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,090
The "caffe" in front is talking about espresso so it's called Espresso con zucchero too.

293
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,720
I thought people who put sugar in their coffees are called country bumpkins?

294
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,060
- Well... I guess Italians are country bumpkins so that's why they drink it that way. 
 - Oh...

295
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,940
Goodness.

296
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,360
It's aromatic!

297
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,470
The sugar not only masks the burnt flavor but also maximizes the bean's uniqueness.

298
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,480
It's a completely new world.

299
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,260
My boss's roasting skills are so good, which is why our beans don't taste burnt.

300
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,220
That's why the sugar highlights the fruity aroma of the beans more.

301
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,100
What a wicked little thing.

302
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
This is a "macchiato."

303
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,240
It means "stained." After extracting espresso over milk froth,

304
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,100
it looks like the surface is stained. That's why it's called this.

305
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,700
This is "con panna."

306
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,360
"Panna" means fresh cream.

307
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,670
All this... Did you make them because of me?

308
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,580
- They're all part of our menu. 
 - Gosh!

309
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,520
You should have told me to drink this to begin with! You didn't because it's expensive, right?

310
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,130
It's from a single shot menu, and you'll get a take-out discount if you drink it standing and go...

311
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,620
three cups will total up to around ₩7,000.

312
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,280
What? It's cheaper than the fancy canned coffee they sell at the convenience store!

313
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,400
I originally didn't think to recommend this to you, but someone gave me a hint.

314
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,600
I don't know who that is, but what a noble man.

315
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,670
But it's so interesting... you properly felt what I was going for.

316
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,040
That's probably because you made it properly.

317
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,350
Even without an explanation I knew right away after trying it.

318
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,260
Thank you.

319
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,230
This building is the same too.

320
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,660
Even if the person who made it doesn't blabber about it, you can tell right away.

321
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,600
I've been working as a formwork carpenter for twenty years.

322
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,990
"Formwork carpenter"?

323
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,550
You know what formworks are, right?

324
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,070
Before pouring concrete over, the structure you make with wood?

325
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,430
O-Oh! It's that!

326
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:47,750
People who work on construction sites... our words and actions are a little rough.

327
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,660
Gosh... don't say that.

328
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,720
But for me, calling what we do "simple physical labor,"

329
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,810
I just can't understand that.

330
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,410
It doesn't sound right.

331
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,910
"Simple"? What do they mean, "simple"? Does that mean our job is simple?

332
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,980
But if we made a 1 cm mistake in our formwork,

333
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,750
the building will be ruined. How is that "simple physical labor"?

334
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,270
Your taste buds aren't simple either.

335
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,720
Is that so?

336
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,080
You just had a preference to begin with.

337
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,570
Really?

338
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,190
Then... give me one more cup.

339
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,810
I think you drank too much.

340
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,420
- Do you think so? 
 - Yes.

341
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,120
I will still sleep well, though.

342
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,220
But if you drink four cups, I don't think you can sleep.

343
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,290
You memorized it, right, Hyungnim?

344
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,460
How long have you been a carpenter?

345
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,210
Gosh, stop patronizing me again.

346
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,370
Young Man?

347
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,610
You just worry about yourself.

348
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,720
Hold on.

349
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,570
Shoes...

350
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Wel—

351
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,270
What would you like?

352
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,820
Cafe con zucchero.

353
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,070
Cafe macchiato.

354
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,720
Cafe con panna.

355
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,460
Oh, Sir...

356
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,200
Did we say something wrong?

357
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,000
- No, that's not it. The plastic bags... You don't have to do that. 
 - No, no, no!

358
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,100
That would be rude of us. It's fine.

359
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,190
It's fine.

360
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,410
How hip.

361
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,160
They're real hipsters.

362
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,220
Cheers!

363
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,800
- Drink a little bit. You're not supposed to take big sips. 
 - Okay.

364
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,600
- Hello. 
 - Yes?

365
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,850
- You look so cool... would it be okay if I took a picture of you all? 
 - Oh!

366
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,160
Sure, go ahead.

367
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,380
If you give me your cellphone, I'll take a picture for you.

368
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,810
- Oh, you're going to take one using ours? 
 - Yes.

369
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,850
The pattern... go like this.

370
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,300
- All right. 
 - Yes, yes.

371
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,650
How, how?

372
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,780
- You already look great just the way you are. 
 - Okay.

373
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,240
- I'll take a picture then! 
 - Okay!

374
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,070
One, two, three!

375
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,420
Cheese!

376
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:57,030

377
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,810
 Hello. My m-mom is here.

378
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,240
 Hello.

379
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,320
 Maybe because she came with her mom, Mi Na looks really awkward.

380
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,260
 Ahn Mi Na! Why do you still have the side dishes I made for you last week?

381
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,560
 You have no rice?

382
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,560
 Is there anything you want to eat for dinner?

383
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,040
 Mom, just get out, quickly. Quickly, quickly.

384
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,630
 She's like that?

385
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,930
 She's someone who comfortably cools off steam here. So we're always grateful.
