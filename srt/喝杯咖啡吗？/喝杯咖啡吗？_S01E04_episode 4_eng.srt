1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,510
Where did it go?

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:15,990

3
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,320
Mom! Mom! Mom!

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,900
Mom! Have you seen my PE uniform?

5
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,020
Mom! Wake up!

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,840
Why are you wearing this?

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,910
Give it back!

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,020
- Give it back! 
 - Hold on!

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,780
I don't have time for this!

10
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,030
This is so warm.

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,150
They make uniforms so well these days.

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,120
What are you saying? Take them off, okay?

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,800
Fine.

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,990
Your toast is ready!

15
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,200
I don't have time.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
Seo Hye Ji, hurry and sit down.

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,970
- I told you, I'm late. 
 - You're not late yet.

18
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,720
And so what if you're a little late.

19
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,150
Are you satisfied? I'm going now.

20
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,750
Are you joking?

21
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,270
Think about the person who made it for you!

22
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,420
That's why I took a bite.

23
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,230
If you were going to make it for me, you should've made it sooner.

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,940
Now I have to brush my teeth again when I get to school!

25
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,260
That little brat.

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,790
She never loses.

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,830
Editor Jae Young, why are you calling so early?

28
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,410
What?

29
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,260
What about it?

30
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,110

31
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,650
What is this?

32
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,460
It's for you to have a taste of the coffee that you'll be taking.

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm grateful, but I'm sort of in a rush.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,390
Can you give me the tumbler without warming it up first?

35
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm doing this while the coffee is being prepared anyway.

36
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,560
Your coffee is ready.

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,850
Thank you.

38
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,870
Can you wash this for me too?

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,220
We don't. We only set the temperature by warming up the tumbler.

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,890
- Can I have it in a paper cup then? 
 - Sure.

41
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,240
Thank you for the coffee.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,300
Did it taste all right?

43
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,030
Your coffee is ready.

44
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,020
Thank you.

45
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,670
- Goodbye! 
 - Come again!

46
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,840
It's overwhelming with both of us working. How did you manage to do it by yourself?

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,260
Are you asking for a raise?

48
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,370
Not yet.

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,230
Setting the temperature of the tumbler is a given...

50
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,160
But?

51
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,500
I wonder if it's necessary to provide a tasting of the coffee.

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,000
Because the majority of customers don't like it?

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,010
Exactly. Customers during the morning and afternoon rush have no time to spare.

54
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,190
What about how it tastes?

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,880
I guess the stainless steel does take away from the aromatics of the coffee...

56
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,240
- I'm sorry. 
 - You don't have to be sorry about that.

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,870
Both the environment and time are important,

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,440
but I can't give up on the flavor of the coffee either.

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,780
It's something that I'm stubborn about.

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,100
But if you don't have the leisure to do so, wouldn't you not be able to enjoy the flavor of the coffee either?

61
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,600
Even if the endnote was narrated accurately?

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,860
Yes... it's a question only possible under the circumstances when one's too busy.

63
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,490
You do have a point.

64
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,470
But "majority" doesn't mean everything.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,810
What?

66
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,830
The customer just now.

67
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,010
Oh, her.

68
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,760
Shouldn't customers like her set our standard?

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,480
Of course.

70
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,980
I guess so.

71
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,050
Clean up.

72
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,610
All right.

73
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,850
Jae Young.

74
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,050
- Jae Young. 
 - Yes?

75
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,690
Joo Hee!

76
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,600
It's been crazy because of the deadline, right?

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,250
Yes.

78
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,890
But what brings you here?

79
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,180
I wanted to talk to you in person.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,050
We ran out of coffee beans this morning.

81
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,090
Well... up to now I very much understand the contributor's position.

82
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,440
I know the editor has been taking care of it.

83
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,070
But suddenly erasing a sentence and everything... I couldn't really understand it.

84
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,460
It's like that for me, too...

85
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,570
It's rare to see a writer like you, who always meets the deadline,

86
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,130
and doesn't need an editor looking over you.

87
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,690
But why this time?

88
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,570
It's because this is a male magazine...

89
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,990
It's not like it was a female magazine last time...

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,280
That's true... but there's been stuff these days,

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,270
where it's better to wipe out anything that might cause any unnecessary misunderstandings...

92
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,620
Female artist, continued experience, marriage problems...

93
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,170
I guess I took it too far?

94
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,020
That's not it, but...

95
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,390
we're saying, there won't be an issue without them.

96
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,760
This is about Teacher Jung Mi Jo's music, not some random person.

97
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,040
Is this what you think, too?

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
Yes.

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,110
I forgot that the editor-in-chief changed.

100
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,880
That's not the only reason, butâ€”

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,630
It's not like I wrote about picking a fight with men.

102
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm not even thinking about that,

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,910
but I was being too greedy. Just talking about music will be enough.

104
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,490
Thank you.

105
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,990
Shall we go out and get a cup of coffee?

106
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,720
I didn't even have one cup so I'm feeling a little out of it.

107
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,450
I want to do that, too, but...

108
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh, sorry. It seems like I took too much of your time.

109
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,930
No, don't worry. I'm both sorry and grateful for making you come all the way out here.

110
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,910
Don't mention it! I'll get going.

111
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,650

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,580
Hi!

113
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,970
Sorry for coming before lunch break was over.

114
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,820
Can you put my coffee in here today? I'll be out of your way right after.

115
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,340
It's not that...

116
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm having such bad luck today.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,630
Everywhere I've been today, the coffee is low, and I keep getting useless calls.

118
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,620
Are you talking about me?

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,680
What? How dare you come here.

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,400
Is there a law that prevents me from being able to enjoy a cup of coffee that I pay for?

121
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,920
Or you could have picked up my calls.

122
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,240
Come out here. Let's talk outside.

123
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm not done with my coffee.

124
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,820
It's nice and quiet here. Let's talk here.

125
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,590
People are going to rush in here soon.

126
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,250
Thank you for the coffee, Sir. The coffee here is surprisingly good.

127
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,840
Thank you.

128
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,460
How much does it take to start a business like this?

129
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,680
Maybe I'll start a coffee shop like yours.

130
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,600
Come out here.

131
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,920
Why are you being so sensitive today? I'm not here to pick a fight with you.

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,280
Excuse me, but this counter is used for food and drinks, so you can't lean on it.

133
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,990
It's all right. I usually send my clothes to the dry cleaners after one wear anyway.

134
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,710
Do you want to get more advice on starting a business? Or should I get going first?

135
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,680
I don't need advice.

136
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,440
Sit down, and let's talk.

137
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,900
Watch out!

138
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,600
What was that?

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,070
It's water.

140
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,560
What?

141
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,450
I'm sorry, I'm a newbie.

142
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,600
Killing my style.

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
We'll compensate you for the cleaning fees.

144
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,940
I'm not sure what Joo Hee has told you, but I'm not that kind of person.

145
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,490
And... you should educate your employees properly.

146
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,130
Come again.

147
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,230
Goodbye.

148
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,820
I could never tell a person like that to come again.

149
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,430
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,700
Thanks.

151
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,930
No.

152
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,270
Why don't you think about it a little before you say something?

153
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,410
For someone who's asking for a favor, you still have this ability to look down on someone.

154
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,880
How is this asking you for a favor?

155
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,380
I've talked to people in real estate, and it's pretty consistent.

156
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,430
They all say that it's reached the peak right now, and it's only going downhill from here on out.

157
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,100
Right now is the time.

158
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,930
Joo Hee! Joo Hee, are you listening?

159
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,070
Yes, I am.

160
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,020
I'm listening to my ex-husband asking me to sell my house and lend him the money.

161
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,710
I wasn't going to take it this far, but...

162
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you even able to provide for Hye Ji properly by writing for that column?

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Other moms are around their children twenty-four hours a day,

164
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,380
dropping off and picking up their kids from Daechi-dong.

165
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,170
- Even if you couldn't do all thatâ€” 
 - You want to fight with me, don't you?

166
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,660
What I'm saying is you need money!

167
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,170
That way, you can do what you want to and provide for our child.

168
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,400
I'm telling you, it's not worth it for you to continue that way.

169
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,950
I'm giving you the opportunity to invest.

170
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,930
How could you be so shameless?

171
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,300
Not even a word of apology or asking for a favor.

172
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,630
I'm not doing this to only benefit myself.

173
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,620
Oh, right!

174
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,320
Joo Hee. Joo Hee! I'm Hye Ji's father.

175
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,300
Don't you think I feel sorry toward her?

176
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,140
I'm only like this so that I can become a father she can be proud of!

177
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,760
Is that why you cheated on me?

178
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,890
Why did you need to bring that up?

179
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,320
My business this timeâ€”

180
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,590
Forget it.

181
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,700
This isn't your first time so I can't even pretend to care anymore.

182
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,850
Anyway, I reject your proposal.

183
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,510
Joo Hee!

184
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,350
Think about Hye Ji!

185
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,410
She left her cellphone.

186
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,320

187
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,730
 Where are you? You're not even reading my messages.

188
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,150
 It's only thirty seconds past the time we're supposed to meet,

189
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,960
 but my heart is about to explode because I miss you so much!

190
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,030
- Excuse me... 
 -  Don't say anything.

191
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,330
 Not a word.

192
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,710
 Oppa can wait, even if it's for thirty years.

193
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:22,000
 But if I wait for those thirty years, I won't be able to do anything.

194
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,840
 Let me sing you a song that shows how I feel.

195
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,970
Hold on! Hold on!

196
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,380
 Ji?

197
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,090
Ji?

198
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,490
I'm Ji's Mom.

199
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,150
Hello, Ma'am.

200
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,650
Hi Kyu Hong. Studying is hard, isn't it?

201
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,250
Studying? He's probably tired from playing around.

202
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,440
My phone.

203
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,900
You two are the same age, right?

204
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,580
What are you talking about? Don't you know that we're middle school classmates?

205
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,200
I do.

206
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,570
I knew, but I wondered if he was sick for a while and had to delay enrolling in school.

207
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,410
Anyway, thanks! We'll get going.

208
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,070
Goodbye, Ma'am.

209
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,190
See you next time, Oppa Kyu Hong!

210
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,840
Mom! Don't be like that!

211
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,990
Your feelings aren't going to change, right?

212
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,980
They won't. Ever.

213
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,950
Did something happen between you two?

214
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,940
Seo Hye Ji! What should we have for dinner tonight?

215
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,770
Aren't you going to have dinner with Ahjussi today? I was going to eat dinner with Kyu Hong today.

216
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,050
Sure, then take my card.

217
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,760
Awesome! Mom's card!

218
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,900
What are you going to eat?

219
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,940
Maybe hamburgers or pizza?

220
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,150
- I'm craving something oily. 
 - No!

221
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,150
Feed him something light.

222
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,430
Not something heavy.

223
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,290
Bye!

224
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,910
I'm home.

225
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,350
Mom?

226
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,080
What are you doing there?

227
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,180
You're here.

228
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,660
I was a little tired.

229
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,340
Why don't you go in and sleep?

230
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,720
Hye Ji.

231
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,410
What?

232
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,460
Should we move?

233
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,150
All of a sudden? Why?

234
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,010
The house is old, and it'll be nice to have a fresh start.

235
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,210
And I heard that the prices on the housing market are good too.

236
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,190
I like it here.

237
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,890
If you want to move, then we can.

238
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,220
Was he here?

239
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,340
No.

240
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,540
Do you know who I'm talking about?

241
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,300
It's not that.

242
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,840
I'm guessing Dad did come by.

243
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,030
Did he ask to borrow the money that you'd get from selling the house?

244
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,900
He said he's in an emergency because one of his investors pulled out suddenly.

245
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,300
He said he'd return the money as soon as possible.

246
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,970
Do you trust what he says?

247
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,990
He's your dad after all.

248
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,890
You'll need to start preparing for college soon,

249
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:17,120
and it made me wonder if I haven't prepared enough, thinking about how much money you'll need when you get to college.

250
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,340
Did he forget how he kicked us out and filed a lawsuit so that he can live with that wench who he cheated on you with?

251
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,240
Now that he lost, he wants you to sell the house and lend him money too?

252
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,970
He's really a jerk.

253
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,060
How could you use such language about your dad?

254
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,810
You used to curse him, too!

255
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,840
That's becauseâ€”

256
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,700
He only thinks about himself.

257
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,750
He's pretending to care about me and is using you!

258
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,610
Don't ever bring that subject up again.

259
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,380
I'm not any different.

260
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,760
What?

261
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,750
Your cellphone.

262
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,670
Why are you bringing that up?

263
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,140
Why didn't you call me to bring it to you?

264
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,670
- That's becauseâ€” 
 - You didn't call on purpose,

265
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,210
because you know how busy and hectic my life is.

266
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,980
Thinking about that, made me sadder.

267
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,070
My daughter was unable to say anything out of consideration for her working mom.

268
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,190
It makes me wonder how much hurt I've caused her.

269
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Mom, don't think like that.

270
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,140
Hye Ji, I'm sorry.

271
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,340
Why are you apologizing?

272
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,820
I'm so proud that such a hardworking person is my mom.

273
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,360
What?

274
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,050
Why are you making me emotional?

275
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,030
I'm going to live like you.

276
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,110
Except for the fact that you met someone like dad.

277
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,370
Hey! You were saying all the right things. Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

278
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,860
- Are you leaving? 
 - Yes.

279
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,690
You worked hard. See you tomorrow.

280
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,920
Are you just leaving?

281
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,130
Yes.

282
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,990
Are you going home?

283
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,050
Of course.

284
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,540
What about this?

285
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,330
Oh, that.

286
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,090
You should return it to her.

287
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,900
Should I?

288
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,250
I filled it with coffee.

289
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,240
See you tomorrow!

290
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,950
Okay.

291
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,950
Is Hye Ji sleeping?

292
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,470
I don't know. She could be pretending to sleep.

293
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,850
You know to use the thermos bottle as an excuse to come over now.

294
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,110
Park Seok... you've gotten better!

295
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:03,520
You did a good job holding back even when my ex-husband and his girlfriend were gently provoking you.

296
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,950
Losing my cool won't help with dripping coffee at all.

297
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,980
Right. That's Park Seok's charm.

298
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,450
I can't picture you breaking a pot with a porter filter.

299
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,980
I'm sorry... for not being able to do anything.

300
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,870
I was going to go again after seeing that jerk. But I couldn't because I was embarrassed.

301
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,110
Don't misunderstand.

302
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,530
Thank you.

303
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,040
This somehow ended up... being my first cup.

304
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,350
But this coffee tastes different.

305
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,730
Is it because it's in the thermos?

306
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,350
Really?

307
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,960
Go Bi...

308
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,540
The scent is really familiar.

309
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:42,450
Oh, my gosh! I didn't clean it after putting odeng broth inside when I ate tteokbokki with Hye Ji!

310
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,140
It can happen... It can happen.

311
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,900
Oh, whatever! Stop drinking it!

312
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,550
I'm serious. Out of all the coffees I've drunk out of a thermos bottle,

313
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,400
this is the most delicious.

314
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,150
Gosh, seriously...

315
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:29,980

316
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,470
 Is the machine not working?

317
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,990
 I put a coin in first without thinking, but it won't come out.

318
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,960
 I came here to drink coffee for the last time.

319
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,900
 "Last time"?

320
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,980
 Who uses their own money to drink coffee from a vending machine these days?

321
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,460
 That's why I'm going to get rid of it.

322
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,920
 You must have a lot of stories tied to the vending machine too.

323
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,180
 For stories like that, not even an entire day would be enough to talk about it.

324
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,120
