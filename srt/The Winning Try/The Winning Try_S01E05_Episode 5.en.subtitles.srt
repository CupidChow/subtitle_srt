EPISODE 5

00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,822
NURSE'S OFFICE

4
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,400
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

5
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
Ga-ram.

6
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,710
Are you all right?

7
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,546
Ga-ram, what's wrong?

8
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,339
It's because…

9
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,842
What is it? What's wrong?

10
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,010
I told you to stop drinking too much.

11
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,350
Geez.

12
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,352
-Drinking?
-Yes.

13
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,982
He drank with me to celebrate
the Rugby Team passing the tryouts.

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,111
I mean…

15
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,739
Come. He'll get punished
if the vice principal finds out.

16
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,034
I'll hide him in my room
so he can sober up, all right?

17
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,120
-What?
-Get going.

18
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,497
Coach Bae, please keep it a secret.

19
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,499
-Okay.
-Go on then.

20
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,293
-Yes.
-Go on.

THE WINNING TRY

THREE YEARS AGO

23
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,966
SANG-GI

24
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,139
Ga-ram, why aren't you at training?
Did you sleep in?

25
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,309
Hey, Sang-gi.

26
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,977
Coach was looking for you.

27
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,565
Why are you quiet? Are you there?

28
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,194
I told him you were in the restroom.
Hurry up.

29
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,612
Okay.

30
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,366
I'll be there. Yeah.

31
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,018
-Are you all right?
-I think it's a cramp.

32
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,521
Don't be a baby. Get up.

33
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,356
-Hey!
-Get up. Come on.

34
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,399
Let's go. Hurry.

35
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,984
Hey, Ga-ram. What's wrong?

36
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,235
I think I have a cramp.

37
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,404
He's trying to avoid training
by making a fuss.

38
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,321
Damn you.

39
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,699
Come on, focus.
The finals are just around the corner.

40
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,700
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,868
-Get back to it.
-Yes.

42
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,797
Myasthenia Gravis?

43
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,757
I've never heard of it before.

44
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:04,387
It makes your muscles
abnormally weak or tire easily.

45
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,557
The exact cause
hasn't been discovered yet.

46
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,351
That can't be right.

47
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,645
You know who I am.

48
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,771
I'm Ju Ga-ram.

49
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,567
Why would an athlete of all people
get a disease like this?

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,945
A disease doesn't discriminate.

51
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,407
Anyone can get a disease.

52
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,746
What about rugby?
I can still play though, right?

53
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,601
Mr. Ju Ga-ram.

54
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,529
Your regular checkup
was due a long time ago.

55
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,158
What about your medicine?
You must have taken it all by now.

56
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,826
I still have some left.

57
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,663
Since you had paralysis,
let's do the EMG first.

58
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,082
Next time.

59
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,001
I have to go back to school today.

60
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,630
If respiratory paralysis recurs,
even a slight delay can be fatal.

61
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,757
The paralysis was only temporary.

62
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,884
I had a lot going on recently.

63
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,511
As for my breathing,

64
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
I've been checking it, as you can see.

65
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,682
I'll get tested next time.

66
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,198
WE WISH FOR HANYANG HIGH'S VICTORY

67
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,955
Hello.

68
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,998
-Hello.
-Hi.

69
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,007
Today's lunch is so good.

70
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,884
-Did you get more?
-Yes.

71
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,553
-It's your second plate?
-That's enough.

72
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,222
Eat your food.

73
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,894
Can alcohol dehydrogenase
increase with age?

74
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,941
It can, if you keep drinking.
But it puts a strain on your liver.

75
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,361
Why? Did Ga-ram ask you for a drink?

76
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,864
Are you crazy? Why would I drink with him?

77
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,240
What is it, then?

78
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,244
I can't believe he drank
until his legs gave out,

79
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,706
especially since he'd never drunk before.

80
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,166
Do you have lingering attachments?

81
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,792
No freaking way.

82
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,085
Then stop caring about him.

83
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,797
What's it to you if he drinks alcohol
or bathes in it?

84
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,257
Rugby Team!

85
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,219
Let's practice after lunch.

86
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,598
How? The Track and Field Team
has the field all day.

87
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,853
Stir-fried spicy pork. Nice.

88
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,812
Do you want some?

89
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,988
Here, have some tea.

90
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,490
Okay.

91
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:16,204
Now that the Rugby Team has a new player,
let's redistribute the field time.

92
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,707
They should be able to train.

93
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,586
The track and field coach said

94
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,298
the summer off-season training paid off.

95
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,758
That's great news.

96
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,303
Okay. So?

97
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,765
The school shouldn't break their momentum.

98
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,894
What if changing the training schedule
causes their records to drop?

99
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,979
How will we look them in the eye?

100
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,483
Let Coach Ju find a place.

101
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,404
There must be a spot somewhere
for the Rugby Team to train.

102
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,492
Are you saying they can practice anywhere

103
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,496
as long as they don't affect other teams?

104
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,414
Yes. Sure.

105
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:01,916
Okay.

106
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,799
-What are we doing here?
-I don't know why we're here.

107
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,510
Doesn't he look familiar?

108
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,011
Wait? Isn't that Seok-bong?

109
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,555
-Nice.
-Seok-bong.

110
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,098
You're all here.

111
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,766
-Hello.
-Hello.

112
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,603
Hey, swimming genius.

113
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,899
Why did you call us to the pool?

114
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,034
This is Hanyang's Rugby Team!

115
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,289
Damn it…

116
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,832
-What?
-What?

117
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,132
Let's go!

118
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,387
Darn it.

119
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,888
Wait, please don't touch me.

120
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,557
-It's all right.
-I don't want to.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,392
I really don't want this.

122
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,603
-One.
-I said no.

123
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,812
-Two.
-Come on!

124
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,188
-Three!
-I said no!

125
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,864
Focus.

126
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,618
Seong-jun, Ung, Seon-ho,
and Ju-yang are on one team.

127
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,161
-Okay.
-The rest are on the other.

128
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:25,583
Each half is ten minutes long.
Touch the ball on the edge for a try.

129
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,500
-Okay!
-Okay!

130
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,880
The losing team will clean up
and wash the winners' swimsuits.

131
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,298
Okay!

132
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,424
Start!

133
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,761
Go, go!

134
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,603
Get the ball. Hurry!

135
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,406
LET'S FILL THIS POOL WITH SWEAT

136
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,576
Was this Ms. Kang's plan all along?

137
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,411
That would definitely help them.

138
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,288
The water reduces the chance of injury,

139
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,667
and they can do
both cardio and strength training.

140
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,585
I should try it with my players too.

141
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,008
There's no need to worry.

142
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,136
The Swim Team will be back next week
after the competition.

143
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,888
That'll put an end to this.

144
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,139
Foul.

145
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,475
But we still need to keep an eye on them.

146
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,644
Okay. I'll keep an eye on them.

147
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,615
Did Nak-gyun refuse
to renew your contract?

148
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,245
He is always in the way of everything.

149
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,414
I feel rather relieved.

150
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,457
I became a player-coach

151
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,710
because no pro team would take me
when I still wanted to play.

152
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
But now,

153
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,550
I find myself thinking,
"How can I last longer as a coach?"

154
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,718
I want…

155
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,013
to give it my all again.

156
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,852
One of my players mentioned
they will retire after this year,

157
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,438
so we'll probably have an opening.

158
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,315
But at your age, we can't take you
without experience on Team Korea.

159
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,610
I understand.

160
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,696
Pass the coming national tryouts.

161
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,406
Then I'll see what I can do.

162
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,492
-You can do it, right?
-Thank you, Sang-a.

163
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:43,929
Even when using someone else's gun,
every shot hits the target.

164
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:50,853
How could you score zero points
ten times in a row, U-jin?

165
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,274
Do you plan to quit?

166
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,359
No.

167
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,028
Then why did you shoot like that?

168
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,866
How could an athlete
lose on purpose when competing?

169
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,832
Now?

170
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,125
Did you just arrive now?

171
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,920
I took a half-day off
in case I was going to be late.

172
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,837
A half-day off?

173
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:22,009
Our team has been utterly humiliated.
I can't even hold my head up.

174
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,386
But you took a half-day off?

175
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,016
It's because her coach is so thoughtless.

176
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,187
She pays attention only to her training,
not to her coaching duties.

177
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,105
That's why
something so ridiculous happened!

178
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,609
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,862
What would be a fitting punishment
for you?

180
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,450
CAPTAIN: SEO U-JIN
VICE-CAPTAIN: NA SEOL-HYEON

181
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,576
Seo U-jin.

182
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,496
You're no longer the captain.

183
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,626
As of today,
Seol-hyeon is our new captain.

184
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,753
Me?

185
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,050
I-ji, I'll let you train
as much as you want.

186
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,219
We'll begin with the basics.

187
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,387
Posture training.

188
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,641
Until the end of the day,
you'll stand here and do posture training.

189
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,851
Okay. Get started.

190
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,567
SHOOTING RANGE

191
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,362
TRAINING

192
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,280
REST

193
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:59,273
You're not a robot after all. I mean,
she is getting punished because of you.

194
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,402
-Do you have time to worry about others?
-Do I need time to do that?

195
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,168
It's too narrow here.

196
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,755
The parking lot? There are too many cars.

197
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,218
If I crush all their cars,
will they give up the field out of spite?

198
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,637
Would they?

199
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,684
What's that for, Ms. Kang?

200
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,394
Is this your home?

201
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,939
Why are you here all the time?

202
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,900
I can't do it at the security office
with the vice principal on my neck.

203
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,239
Here's the rent.

204
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,117
What is this?

205
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:57,331
You have to manage your blood sugar
early if you want to keep eating sweets.

206
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,669
You're the one who eats them all.

207
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,131
It was all for you.
I wanted you to eat less sugar, Ms. Kang.

208
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,552
HANYANG HIGH FLOOR PLAN

209
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,638
Is the pool not enough?

210
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,223
Not even close.

211
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,976
That was only a temporary measure.

212
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,979
We need a proper field.

213
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,933
You're trying to make a statement.

214
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,686
Put your arm down!

215
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,067
Geez. You're something, indeed.

216
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,070
If you still want to shoot, go for it.

217
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,565
Are you all right?

218
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,069
I want to say that I am,
but as you can see…

219
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,239
This is because of me.

220
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,575
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,079
This wasn't all because of you,
so don't worry.

222
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,417
You were right.
It's never okay for any athlete to lose.

223
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,299
You get treated the way I do
if you don't win.

224
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,764
So win at all costs. Don't be carried away
by Ga-ram's nonsense.

225
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,432
Or you'll end up like me.

226
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,727
I'll see you tomorrow.

227
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,998
I can't believe you actually did it.

228
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,751
And what if I hadn't?

229
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,839
I had to make sure he owed me good,
so he wouldn't complain about my training.

230
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,174
I know, but still…

231
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,095
If I pass the national tryouts,
Sang-a can get me on her team.

232
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,972
She coaches there, right?

233
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,851
I have to give it my all in this tryout.

234
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,436
This is my last chance.

235
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,815
Hey, did you hear?

236
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,401
Hell broke loose in the Shooting Team.

237
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,861
Coach Bae was punished all day.

238
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,571
-U-jin lost her captaincy.
-What?

239
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,865
-When?
-Today.

240
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,158
Isn't that crazy?

241
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,827
Because of the special admission tryouts?

242
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,744
Of course.

243
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,497
There would be no other reason.

244
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,712
I'll go apologize.

245
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,674
It's all because of me.

246
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,050
Why would you apologize?

247
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,469
It wasn't because of you.

248
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,472
What?

249
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,766
I asked her to let us win.

250
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,312
She wouldn't lose
just because you asked her to.

251
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,396
How would you know?

252
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,400
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

253
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,111
This is driving me nuts.

254
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,284
She didn't need to go that far.

255
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,913
That's not it.

256
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:11,126
There was so much to do as the captain.
It interfered with my training, so I quit.

257
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,008
Good job.
Being a captain won't do you any good.

258
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,259
I know.

259
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,596
Then why make me anxious?

260
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,557
Is it that hard
to send the training log right away?

261
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,101
I won't be late starting tomorrow.

262
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,741
Did you eavesdrop? Are you a stalker?

263
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,618
Come on. I'm no stalker.

264
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,412
I just overheard it.

265
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,501
Are you all right?

266
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,212
What do you mean?

267
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,757
I heard you got scolded
and lost your captaincy.

268
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,843
-Sorry.
-Why would you be sorry?

269
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,808
I accused you of snitching
on our archery plan.

270
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,938
You got punished too,
just for doing me a favor.

271
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,774
Right, snitching.

272
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,777
Apology accepted.

273
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,739
But you had nothing to do
with the tryouts, so don't apologize.

274
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,534
You don't have to lie.

275
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,953
You did it
because I asked you to let us win.

276
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,121
That's not true.

277
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,668
Then why did you do it?

278
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,795
I have no reason to tell you, do I?

279
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,840
Well, hey…

280
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,050
Did you know?

281
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,138
My coach and your coach
were a legendary couple at school.

282
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,431
So?

283
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,765
What's your take on that?

284
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,438
Is that something I need to think about?

285
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,358
It's just when you play
while relying on each other…

286
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,032
What was it? I think it creates synergy.

287
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,663
You should think about it.

288
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,669
It looks like they're hurting each other
rather than creating synergy.

289
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,005
Come on, just…

290
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,799
take some time to think seriously about--

291
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,301
Seong-jun.

292
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,304
How can you still be so clueless
when you're all grown up?

293
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,767
I mean… At times like this,

294
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,311
I just want to be there for you.

295
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,104
I've told you, haven't I?

296
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,899
Leave me alone.

297
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,074
I can't seem to do that.

298
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,366
Dang it.

299
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,162
Geez, oh goodness.

300
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,667
Hey. He just got dumped.

301
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,129
He got rejected.

302
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,631
What is he doing?

303
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,552
Darn it.

304
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,476
A spacious place where they can run
at full speed after kicking the ball.

305
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,771
A suitable opponent
with low risk of injury.

306
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,482
Is there a way
to solve these two issues at once?

307
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,650
Seok-bong.

308
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:27,948
Where did he go,
leaving the restaurant unattended?

309
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,700
All right. Come on in.

310
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,329
Since we won, it's on the house.

311
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,831
Order everything on the menu!

312
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,750
-It's on me.
-Fries?

313
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,751
Coach Ju!

314
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,587
SANGYEONG MORNING SOCCER CLUB

315
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,839
It's not that bad.

316
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,425
-Considering it doesn't have rugby posts.
-Right?

317
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,094
-Nice.
-Wow.

318
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,470
-Coach Ju.
-Yes.

319
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,139
Do we train here from now on?

320
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,935
Yes. I got permission
from the principal to train outside.

321
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,148
The ground is so nice
and well taken care of.

322
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,858
Let's unpack and get going.

323
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,317
No, hold on.

324
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,862
There is one thing
we need to do before that.

325
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,322
What is it?

326
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,491
It's a warm-up. Yes.

327
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,994
Shouldn't we unpack first?

328
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,495
We do warm-ups all the time.

329
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,290
-For goodness' sake.
-Darn it.

330
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
What is it?

331
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,003
SANGYEONG

332
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,635
-You're here.
-Coach Ju?

333
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,970
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

334
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,472
Are these the ones you talked about?

335
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,850
-Yes.
-Awesome.

336
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,728
They remind me of the good old days.
Especially that one.

337
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,776
We went to a lot of trouble
since it was a favor from our ace, Mr. Ma.

338
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,738
Are you going to make us sweat today?

339
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,657
Of course. Look how buff they are.

340
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,202
-You can trust me.
-Okay.

341
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,120
Shall we warm up then?

342
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,747
-Okay.
-Go, Sangyeong!

343
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,042
Let's go!

344
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:09,424
-I thought we were training.
-Yes, after an hour of soccer with them.

345
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,052
Also, this is training too.

346
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,262
I played soccer until middle school.

347
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,598
They didn't do soccer,
but always played sports.

348
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,809
Those old guys don't stand a chance.

349
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:24,898
Really? You never know until you play.
But you do have a point.

350
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,067
So, we'll add some rules.

351
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,861
-The rugby rules.
-What? Rugby rules?

352
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,364
No passing forward.
Just sideways or backward.

353
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,782
To score…

354
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,533
Since there's no try in soccer,

355
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,995
you score only when you drive the ball
to the post. Okay?

356
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,581
-That's easy.
-Okay.

357
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,582
We'll go get them!

358
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,584
-Let's get them sweating.
-Yes. Let's go.

359
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,599
Let's do this!

360
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,601
Go, Sangyeong!

361
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,816
Foul! We're playing by rugby rules.

362
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,858
Hand over the ball.

363
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,361
Yes!

364
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,738
What? You can't start right away.

365
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,576
-Nice.
-Foul!

366
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,911
-What?
-Why?

367
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,955
The ball rolled forward
when you dropped it. Foul.

368
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,039
I blocked it.

369
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,375
You should have caught it.
Give the ball back.

370
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,422
Two, three.

371
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,098
If you shoot, it's a foul.

372
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,144
-Grab it.
-Okay.

373
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,395
Oh, right.

374
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,983
Foul!

375
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,609
-Come on, Captain.
-Warning!

376
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,111
Captain.

377
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,878
Coach Ju, you were good today.

378
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,713
You're a fine referee.

379
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,923
Wait. Was it you?

380
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,301
I thought Son Heung-min was here.

381
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,470
No, I'm Ronaldo.

382
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,722
-Goodness.
-Hold on.

383
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,476
You weren't Messi?
Oh, you're the guy from the sign shop.

384
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,810
Today was just my day.

385
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,356
Geez. Did I crush young dreams?

386
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,483
Yes, Messi. You were too hard on them.

387
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,401
-Sorry.
-See you next week.

388
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,696
I'll gather more people.
We can split into two or three teams.

389
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,782
Let's play even harder.

390
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,743
Thank you. We'll be waiting!

391
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,203
Sure. Nice job.

392
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,829
-See you.
-Okay.

393
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,581
-See you!
-Bye.

394
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,957
I'm so hungry.

395
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,667
Good game.

396
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,336
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

397
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,004
-Everyone, get up.
-I'm hungry.

398
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,215
-Let's start practice now.
-Come on!

399
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,301
We're going to die, Coach.

400
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,261
-We can't get up.
-We can't.

401
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,306
Attention.

402
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,933
Yes.

403
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,271
We only have seven players
for a seven-player game.

404
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:16,236
That means you all need
to have the strength to play full-time.

405
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,322
-Is that even possible?
-You have to do it to become champions!

406
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,616
Champions?

407
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,451
He's right.

408
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,123
Our goal is to be the champions
of the Nationals.

409
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,382
We need to achieve this
so our third-years can get into college.

410
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,884
That will attract new recruits.

411
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,972
That's the only way
for the team to survive at our school.

412
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,643
Isn't that a bit unreasonable as a goal?

413
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,270
So what? Are you going to give up?

414
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,939
You want to play rugby.

415
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,614
I do.

416
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,241
Guys, let's get up.

417
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,534
Yeah?

418
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,164
Let's play rugby.

419
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,423
Endure it. All right.

420
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,931
No. Do it again.

421
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,114
You're almost there. Let's go.

422
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,576
Run as fast as you can
to the Rugby Team's room!

423
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,458
They must be coming back
from training outside.

424
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,003
Ga-ram is a good rugby player, indeed.

425
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,632
That's why the kids listen to him
without complaining.

426
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,425
Which is not good, right?

427
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,345
Why is he riding on the handcart?

428
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,472
That's not very teacher-like.

429
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,773
What are you doing?

430
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,777
Hey, do you think
we can really win the Nationals?

431
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,866
Stop the nonsense and sleep.

432
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,370
Why do you always come at me?

433
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,541
Why? Do you think we can't win
because we don't have synergy?

434
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,210
What synergy? Cut the crap.

435
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,381
When you play while relying on each other,

436
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,882
it creates synergy.

437
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,800
Hey!

438
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,805
-How do you know that?
-Synergy.

439
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,850
Stop staring and answer…

440
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,447
I believe in Coach Ju.

441
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,287
I'm going to do whatever he says.

442
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,205
I really want to win.

443
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,083
We should get some sleep
if we want to win.

444
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,835
-Okay.
-Good night.

445
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,048
COLLEGE RUGBY TEAMS

446
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,134
I see. You can't do it then, can you?

447
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,470
Got it. Maybe next time, then.

448
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,388
Yes.

449
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,890
Okay.

450
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,905
MATCH APPLICATION

451
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,615
A practice match against a pro team?

452
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,368
Other schools have already set up
practice matches with one another,

453
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,536
so there's no room for us.

454
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,832
Fortunately, OK Rugby Club
doesn't have a match that day.

455
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,209
Didn't you use to play for that team?

456
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,504
They're probably still not fond of you.

457
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,466
I had to beg them.

458
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,638
I have to beg a lot of people
now that I'm back.

459
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,473
You only just realized that?

460
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,686
We have a practice match.

461
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,898
It's against OK Rugby Club.

462
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,441
-What?
-Pardon?

463
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,028
OK… A pro team?

464
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,532
What if they bury us alive
during the practice match?

465
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,659
You don't want it?

466
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,993
-Not at all.
-I don't mean that…

467
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,163
-I love it.
-Yes.

468
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,625
They have more than ten national players
on their team.

469
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,878
Are we up against Team Korea, then?

470
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,421
It would be an honor.

471
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,050
Let's give it a try!

472
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,093
Yes!

473
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,344
Okay.

474
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,805
It's at 2:00 p.m. on the 13th.

475
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,348
-At 2:00 p.m. on the 13th.
-The 13th.

476
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,351
Let's prepare for a good pounding, guys.

477
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,979
-Yes!
-Yeah!

478
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,483
Okay. To the pool.

479
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,943
It's not time yet.

480
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,736
It hasn't been ten minutes, Coach.

481
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,321
-Stop grumbling and come.
-Already?

482
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,326
-Myeong-u.
-Captain, pass.

483
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,121
Next, Ju-yang.

484
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,957
Yeong-gwang.

485
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,005
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

486
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,716
Don't you want to play against Team Korea?

487
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,301
Focus.

488
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,014
I can't believe
Myeong-u's telling us to focus.

489
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,016
I thought I was hearing things.

490
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,310
Nice. Catch!

491
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,730
-On the 13th.
-On the 13th.

492
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,898
-At 2:00 p.m.
-At 2:00 p.m.

493
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,650
-At 2:00 p.m.
-On the 13th.

494
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,651
On the 13th.

495
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,569
At 2:00 p.m.

496
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,528
At 2:00 p.m.

497
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,115
I'm so beat.

498
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,290
What are you doing?

499
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,084
It's nothing.

500
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,129
-Let's go running.
-What?

501
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,758
Stop the nonsense
and do well during the game.

502
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,301
Am I the only one who's excited?

503
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,218
You're too excited.

504
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,553
-Ung, do you want to run?
-Yes.

505
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,847
Persuade them. Let's go running.

506
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,016
-Let's go.
-It's roll call soon.

507
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,601
-We can't go out.
-Let's go.

508
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,478
-Drag him out.
-What about roll call?

509
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,104
-We'll be back for it.
-Hurry.

510
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,189
Yeong-gwang already left.

511
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,236
Yes?

512
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,696
Coach, it's me, Yeong-gwang.

513
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,662
Right. Come in. Hey.

514
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,541
What's gotten into you?

515
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,001
Come and sit here.

516
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,629
Yes. All right.

517
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,257
I have something to tell you.

518
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,425
Okay.

519
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,344
All right.

520
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,678
What is it?

521
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,556
I can't play the practice match.

522
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,601
What do you mean?

523
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,812
The police entrance exam is that day.

524
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,729
What?

525
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,786
TRAINING ABSENCE REQUEST LETTER

526
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,371
TO TAKE THE POLICE EXAM…

527
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,419
Do you really want to be a police officer?

528
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,767
Yeong-gwang.

529
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:49,355
You know how important this semester is
as a rugby player

530
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,316
for you and the guys.

531
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,111
They won't take responsibility
for my life.

532
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,780
You may have made a good living
as a rugby player,

533
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,407
but I don't stand a chance.

534
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,242
You know it too.

535
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,327
So you're going to run away?

536
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,997
Is that it? Without even trying?

537
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,665
I don't care if you disapprove.

538
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,126
I'm going to take the exam anyway.

539
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,431
TRAINING ABSENCE REQUEST LETTER

540
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,183
TO TAKE THE POLICE EXAM…

541
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,393
Say that again.

542
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,895
You heard it.

543
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,855
Don't you know how big a chance this is?

544
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,275
I knew that jerk would do this one day.

545
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,444
I'm done treating you with respect.

546
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,528
Do as you wish.

547
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,448
I can't let you guys ruin my life.

548
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,034
This jerk.

549
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,704
No, stop.

550
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,542
-Hey!
-Just talk it out.

551
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,461
Say it again.

552
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,254
That jerk is talking crap.

553
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,714
Stop!

554
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,301
Darn it.

555
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,847
A fist fight among the players?

556
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,849
-But Yeong-gwang--
-Seong-jun.

557
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,231
Fighting is not allowed,
no matter the reason.

558
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:18,527
You only fight in the stadium
until the last whistle blows.

559
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,196
Isn't that the rugby spirit?

560
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,576
Run until you understand
what you did wrong.

561
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,744
Go.

562
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,912
Okay.

563
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,871
-Okay.
-Okay.

564
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,809
You may have made a good living
as a rugby player,

565
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,728
but I don't stand a chance.

566
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,521
You know it too.

567
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,233
Oh Yeong-gwang.

568
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,874
What are you doing out here?

569
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,588
I don't want to get beaten.

570
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,633
Come on out.

571
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,610
Any change of thoughts?

572
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,154
No.

573
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,158
As a rugby coach,

574
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:36,374
the one I'm responsible for
is rugby player Yeong-gwang,

575
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,834
not the one
who wants to be a police officer.

576
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,002
Take responsibility?

577
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,254
How are you going to do that?

578
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,965
By winning the Nationals?

579
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,217
Do you think that's possible?

580
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,638
You had recruiters lined up
at your graduation,

581
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,266
so you can't understand
what I'm dealing with.

582
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,353
I didn't expect you to understand.

583
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,897
I don't need your permission.

584
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,565
Wait.

585
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,251
If you must go,
show me how determined you are.

586
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,336
HANYANG

587
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,924
Perform 300 drop kicks,
and land 200 of them.

588
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,845
-Then I'll let you go.
-Are you serious?

589
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,931
Even a pro player misses one
out of two drop kicks.

590
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,977
And 300 drop kicks are equal
to a week's worth of practice.

591
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,479
So you're not going to do it?

592
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,773
Is that how determined you are?

593
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,616
One.

594
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,664
Two.

595
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,127
Three.

596
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,513
A hundred ninety-eight.

597
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,772
Do it again.

598
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,548
Again.

599
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,312
Three hundred.

600
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,455
How many did you make?

601
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,000
A hundred and sixty-three.

602
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,002
I was never…

603
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,089
going to make 200 shots anyway.

604
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,840
You said it yourself,

605
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,845
even a pro player
misses one drop kick out of two.

606
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,516
Doesn't that make you
better than a pro player?

607
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:47,106
Mo Sang-gi wore Number Five

608
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,569
for Team Korea in the 2022 Asian Cup.

609
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,575
He was a fly-half, just like you.

610
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:04,790
He drop kicked 300 times
right here 20 years ago.

611
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,711
He landed 147 of them.

612
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,508
Who says you don't have potential?

613
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,972
Everyone reaches a point
when they can't play anymore.

614
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,558
When that moment comes…

615
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,896
I don't want you to have regrets.

616
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,319
For me…

617
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,572
rugby was everything.

618
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,161
I thought…

619
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,331
it would be the same for you.

620
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,086
I only saw it from my own perspective.

621
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,673
I apologize for saying…

622
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,926
that you were running away.

623
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:22,910
Here.

624
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,205
Open it.

625
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,543
TRAINING ABSENCE REQUEST LETTER

626
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,131
One day,

627
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,719
when the time comes
for you to leave the field,

628
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,264
I hope…

629
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,893
it's on your own terms.

630
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,609
Be back soon.

631
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,197
All right.

632
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,283
Kick it up a notch.

633
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,036
Faster!

634
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,919
Yang Seung.

635
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,924
Let him off the hook today.
I told the opponents to go easy on him.

636
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,342
Why can't you do it?

637
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,804
I wish I could, but I'm the coach.

638
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,098
Let's trust
Sangyeong Morning Soccer Club's ace.

639
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,558
This is all your fault.

640
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,187
Hey! You better not play!

641
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,275
I can't believe him.

642
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,281
This concludes the test.

643
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,949
Put your pen down.

644
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,956
2025 POLICE ENTRANCE EXAM
WRITTEN EXAM

645
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,640
YEONG-GWANG PASS!

646
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,353
I support you no matter what you decide,
Yeong-gwang.

647
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,398
Sorry for not speaking nicely.
You know I didn't mean it, right?

648
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,108
Let's eat something good after the test.

649
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:04,279
Yeong-gwang, my friend.
Whatever you decide, you have my support.

650
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,572
Sorry for messing with you.

651
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,158
I hope you pass the exam
and make lots of money,

652
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,327
so you can buy me chicken and 50 pizzas.

653
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,703
From cute Seon-ho.

654
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:15,499
Yeong-gwang, sorry for yelling at you
because I wanted to play the match.

655
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,209
Go, Ung!

656
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,632
It hurts.

657
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,759
Let's give it a try!

658
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,639
Let's go.

659
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,484
You're missing the match,
so I hope you do well on the test.

660
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,028
I'm sorry…

661
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,030
for hitting you.

662
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,253
Yeong-gwang won't be coming, will he?

663
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,757
-You said we should let him go.
-It wasn't just me.

664
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,677
-You wrote in the letter too.
-Because you wrote first.

665
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,638
-Don't put it on me.
-Why? Do you guys need him to play?

666
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,181
-No.
-No.

667
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,559
We've trained hard, haven't we?

668
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,518
Yes.

669
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,229
Let's give it everything we've got.

670
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,856
-Okay.
-Yes.

671
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,611
Hanyang!

672
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,695
-Hanyang…
-Hey.

673
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,197
-It's a cab.
-Is it Yeong-gwang?

674
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,157
Hold on.

675
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:32,951
Could it be…

676
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,578
-Yeong-gwang.
-Let me see.

677
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,080
-I think it's him.
-No way.

678
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,459
-Aren't you going to hurry?
-Sorry.

679
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,587
Why did they bring so many players?

680
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,423
-Why's he late?
-It's Yeong-gwang.

681
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,926
-Hey.
-Yeong-gwang.

682
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,679
Yeong-gwang, you came.

683
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,348
-How?
-Yeong-gwang.

684
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,307
You came.

685
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,563
I don't think it's my time to leave yet.

686
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,693
Welcome.

687
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,699
-Oh, my goodness!
-Let's hurry!

688
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,119
-Should we start passing?
-Get ready.

689
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:17,746
You can leave.

690
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,207
Take it easy.

691
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,209
-Hurry.
-Pass the ball.

692
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,587
-Stop!
-Why?

693
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,339
-Let's see my try again.
-Come on.

694
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,509
Wow. How'd you pull that off?

695
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,344
That was amazing.

696
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,514
Why are you so happy?
We lost after scoring only 12 points.

697
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,099
Hey, that's 12 points.

698
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,768
We scored 12 points against a pro team.

699
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:43,647
Dude, how could you fail the kick
after practicing it all night long?

700
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,234
If you'd made all the kicks,
it would have been 14 points.

701
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,487
Still…

702
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,283
I was touched.

703
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,954
I was moved.

704
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,414
Then, me too!

705
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,042
-Seriously?
-Get off, Seon-ho.

706
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,001
Go away. Seriously.

707
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:05,961
Move, Seon-ho.

OK RUGBY CLUB 41:12, LOSE

709
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,908

00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,078
well done!

711
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,338
Today, we scored 12 points
and lost the match.

712
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:58,847
But this will be
our lowest-scoring game of the season.

713
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,726
What's our goal?

714
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,103
Winning the Nationals.

715
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,690
You know we didn't pass
the preliminaries last year.

716
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,986
You think it's impossible?

717
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,784
I mean, I think it might be possible.

718
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,829
We're not who we used to be.

719
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,124
I trust you guys.

720
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:31,797
So you should trust yourselves too.

721
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,387
Let's make a miracle happen.

722
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,689
-So cheesy.
-He's the worst.

723
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,775
Let's do it!

724
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,657
It was a bit cheesy, but…

725
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,410
I mean why not…

726
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,205
Okay. Hanyang!

727
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:09,125
Hanyang!

728
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,293
Let's go!

729
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:20,804
I never thought the Rugby Team
would be able to score against a pro team.

730
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,764
What?

731
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,433
-Are you moved, Heung-nam?
-No.

732
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,312
We should do something about them.

733
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,523
It's true. They are posing a threat now.

734
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:35,235
Even as someone who doesn't know rugby,
I could tell they're much better.

735
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,570
Ga-ram, that dude.

736
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,656
Did he get coaching training
while he was hiding or what?

737
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:44,286
Right? What did he do
in those three years of hiding?

738
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,122
-Pardon?
-Look into it, Coach Bang.

739
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,209
Tail him or ask around,
do whatever it takes.

740
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,254
Will that make me
the head of academic affairs?

741
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,843
I'll look into it.

742
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,992
-Goodness.
-You did good.

743
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,494
Your breathing is stable. Well done.

744
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,039
-When did you come?
-I'm not bothering you, am I?

745
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,749
No way.

746
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,167
I have something for you.

747
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,586
Give me your hands.

748
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,756
Here!

749
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,717
What? These were discontinued.

750
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,677
How did you get them?

751
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,597
Now that you have these,
make sure you do well, I-ji.

752
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,724
Yes.

753
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,645
Okay. Keep practicing. I'll get going.

754
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,521
-Okay.
-Good luck.

755
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,065
Thank you.

756
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,399
Let's go!

757
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,276
Bye.

758
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,110
It's on.

759
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,657
Who are you rooting for?

760
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,201
U-jin, of course?

761
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,121
She's…

762
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,540
I'm not worried about her.

763
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:59,295
Between Seol-hyeon and Coach Bae,
who do you think will win?

764
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,507
Of course, Coach Bae.
She has more experience.

765
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,384
No, I think Seol-hyeon will win.

766
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,429
She is overshadowed by U-jin,
but she's the runner-up.

767
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,264
Coach Bae is well past her prime.

768
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,855
Come on.

769
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,732
-Yeong-gwang, seriously.
-Why'd you…

770
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,817
He doesn't know how to read the room.

771
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,402
-I'm serious.
-She was Coach's…

772
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,699
Are you okay, Coach?

773
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,078
What? Yes, I'm fine.

774
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,121
It's starting.

775
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,204
1. SEO U-JIN, JEONG MI-RA,
BAEK JU-YEONG, BAE I-JI

776
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,086
4. BAE I-JI

777
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,675
CURRENT 4TH: BAE I-JI, HANYANG HIGH

778
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,344
Go, I-ji!

779
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,099
Delivery.

780
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,144
Geez, you surprised me.

781
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,689
-Has I-ji's match started?
-She's doing great.

782
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,195
At this rate, Seol-hyeon won't make it.

783
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,406
5. NA SEOL-HYEON

784
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,451
Only the top four qualify.

785
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,037
Yes. But they're only halfway through.

786
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,123
Seol-hyeon has time for a comeback.

787
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,128
Coach Bae seems to be in great condition.

788
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,261
The gap is getting wider.

789
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,934
CURRENT 3RD: BAE I-JI, HANYANG HIGH

790
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,354
See? I told you Coach Bae would do great.

791
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,939
Hey, stop making a scene.

792
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,274
The match isn't over yet.

793
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,943
She found her momentum.
The pace will continue.

794
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:31,072
-Do you want U-jin to win first place?
-Hey, what? What's with the nonsense?

795
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,740
-Come on.
-It makes total sense.

796
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,117
It totally makes sense.

797
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,584
5. NA SEOL-HYEON

798
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,175
1. SEO U-JIN, 3. BAE I-JI
5. NA SEOL-HYEON

799
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,743
Wait, I don't see Coach Bae.

800
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,620
Has she been eliminated?

801
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,080
No. She must have gone to the restroom.

802
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,042
You can go out in the middle of shooting.

803
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:25,960
Right?

804
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,505
Where is Coach?

805
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,966
He must have gone to the restroom.

806
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,040
What are you doing?

807
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,836
-Seol-hyeon's elimination is on you.
-I'm here as a player.

808
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,255
So?

809
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,925
Are you really going to beat your student?

810
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:18,304
-I'm doing my best at the game--
-Stop being foolish.

811
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,224
Do your best as a coach.

812
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,103
Let Seol-hyeon qualify.

813
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,356
Are you asking me to rig the game?

814
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,774
Darn it.

815
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,609
Don't bring up such a scary word.

816
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,113
Anhyeon City Hall Team?

817
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:40,201
Sang-a said she'd accept you
if you passed the tryout, right?

818
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,329
But you should know.

819
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,914
She's only a coach.

820
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,709
The head coach and I go way back.

821
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,877
Do you think it'll be any different there?

822
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:56,009
In this small world of shooting,
burying you would be a piece of cake.

823
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,720
Do you want this
to be your retirement match?

824
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,935
Think carefully,
unless you want to ruin your life.

825
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,735
It's all right.

826
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,157
It's okay.

827
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,940
Don't mind him.

828
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,818
Just focus on shooting.

829
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:00,657
Focus.

830
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,614
Ga-ram!

831
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,909
Hey, what's wrong?

832
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,336
4. NA SEOL-HYEON
5. BAE I-JI

833
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,729
Do you want this
to be your retirement match?

834
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:17,066
But at your age, we can't take you
without experience on Team Korea.

835
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,278
I'll call off the contract deal.

836
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,615
Burying you would be a piece of cake.

837
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,578
You should retire
before you humiliate yourself even more.

838
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,789
You're done.

839
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,719
Hey, what's wrong with Coach Bae?

840
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,106
SEONGLIM HOSPITAL

841
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,865
4. NA SEOL-HYEON: COMPLETED

842
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,374
2. SEO U-JIN: QUALIFIED

843
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,757
What's going on?

844
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,095
-She just has one shot left.
-Hurry!

845
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,275
4. NA SEOL-HYEON: QUALIFIED

846
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,156
I came in fourth.

847
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,170
EPILOGUE

848
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,830
I-ji is at a really critical moment.

849
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,291
She got kicked off her pro team
three years ago

850
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,252
after giving up the national tryouts
to look for you.

851
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,464
This is her last year
as a player-coach too.

852
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:11,217
She needs to make
the national team this time.

853
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,386
You should help her.

854
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:18,432
SHOOTING TEAM

855
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,978
THE WINNING TRY

856
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,688
The Presidents Cup is approaching.

857
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:08,482
Coach Ju is practically shunned
in the rugby world.

858
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,318
No scout is going to watch
Hanyang High's match.

859
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,987
We'll make them come somehow.

860
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,323
We are strong!

861
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,534
He's making rapid progress.

862
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,913
Why is my daughter being dragged
into this filthy rumor?

863
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:27,543
You don't know what it's like to fear
becoming useless overnight.

864
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,627
Have you gone nuts?

865
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,381
In rugby, you never know when, how,
or what will force you to retire.

866
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,176
I don't know what you're hiding,
but hide it well.

867
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,510
Until someone finds out.

868
