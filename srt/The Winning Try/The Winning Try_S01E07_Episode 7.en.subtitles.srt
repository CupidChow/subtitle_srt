2022 ASIAN RUGBY CUP DOPING INVESTIGATION

00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,511
Mr. Ju, are the doping allegations true?

6
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,055
-Where did you get the substances?
-What's its name?

7
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,850
Did you do it alone?
Or are others involved too?

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,362
I'm going to retire.

00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,047
Give us a minute.

11
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,640
What are you doing?

12
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,395
Did you really dope?

13
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,524
You didn't, right?

14
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,537
Say something, for God's sake.

15
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,583
-Say what?
-Ga-ram!

16
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,670
Give me an excuse, at least!

17
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,214
Would it make any difference?

18
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,382
What?

19
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,016
How could you…

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,852
How could you do this to me?

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,520
-Sang-gi!
-You can't do this.

22
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,189
Let go!

23
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,528
You're nothing to me, jerk.

24
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,131
Be gone for good.

25
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:10,064
Ju Ga-ram, who shocked the nation
with a doping scandal,

26
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,901
has announced his retirement and vanished.

27
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,821
-Fans are appalled by the devastating
-The number you have dialed…

28
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,615
-truth about…
-I-ji, where are you going?

29
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,532
Hey, I-ji!

Excuse me. Are you all right?

35
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,773
-Are you okay?
-Did he faint?

36
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,900
-Please call 911.
-Are you okay?

37
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,277
-Goodness!
-Should we do CPR?

38
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,057
Myasthenia Gravis.

39
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,689
Is that why you disappeared
three years ago?

40
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,033
Is this the truth
behind Ga-ram, the juicer?

EXAMINATION ROOM
JU **-RAM, NEUROLOGY

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,010
It has relapsed.

44
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,892
The acetylcholine receptor antibody levels
have visibly increased.

45
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,687
The respiratory system
is the biggest problem.

46
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,064
On this CT scan,

47
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,901
you can see a lump on the thymus
that could possibly be a tumor.

48
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,029
Given its size and location,
surgery will be necessary.

49
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,616
We'll schedule it
once we receive the detailed results.

50
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,327
Can it be operated on right away?

51
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,620
No, I-ji.

52
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,789
I can't undergo surgery.

53
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,834
The Presidents Cup is coming up soon,
and the Nationals are in two months.

54
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,337
They can't compete without a coach.

55
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,546
Doctor.

56
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,634
Please let me get through
just three more months.

57
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,809
Since I can't force you to have surgery,

58
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,353
I will prescribe medication instead.

59
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,064
Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.

60
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,722
I'm sorry you had to find out like this.

61
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,683
Were you even going to tell me?

62
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
I was.

63
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,061
When?

64
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,230
Three years ago…

65
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,070
before the national tryouts
when you shot all tens. That day.

66
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,781
-I-ji.
-Yes?

67
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,827
Apparently, I'm unwell.

68
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,665
Why didn't you tell me then?

69
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,503
It was a crucial moment in your career.

COACH JEON, PRINCIPAL, SEO U-JIN

72
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,311
Let's go back to school.

73
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,188
Go back to school?

74
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,314
I-ji.

75
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,357
How can I, after seeing you like that?

76
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,527
Why would you oppose surgery
when it's a viable treatment?

77
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,904
I told you.

78
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,282
For the third-years Seong-jun, Myeong-u,
and Yeong-gwang,

79
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,242
this is their last chance.

80
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,661
I can't let them miss it.

81
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,247
What if they find out
you're risking your life for them?

82
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,625
Do you really think
they'll be grateful then?

83
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,586
If you collapse, just like
how I broke down three years ago,

84
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,588
-the players will--
-Just three months.

85
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,842
Please turn a blind eye
for just three months.

86
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,727
So if I keep my mouth shut,
it all goes away?

87
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,316
You're such a jerk.

88
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,374
-Coach!
-Coach!

89
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,211
-What is it?
-Have you seen Coach Ju?

90
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,885
I don't know.

91
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,222
Did he run away after all that talk
about dominating the Nationals?

92
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,765
He's the one who got me into rugby.

93
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,893
-Let's go catch him.
-We need to find out where he is first.

94
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,562
-We should persuade--
-There he is!

95
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,813
Where?

96
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,982
-Coach!
-Coach!

97
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,734
-Coach!
-Coach!

98
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,405
-Coach!
-Coach!

99
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,198
What's going on?

100
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,994
How could you go missing
with the match coming up so soon?

101
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,413
The whole school flipped out.
We'll be punished again.

102
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,622
Seriously!

103
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,543
I really thought you ran away,
for God's sake!

104
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,794
Geez. Quiet down.

105
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,505
-Why would I run away?
-Everyone thought you bailed.

106
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
Come on, he's still our coach.

107
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,008
Don't ever go…

108
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,513
-I-ji.
-You're going nowhere.

109
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
-I-ji.
-Don't move.

110
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,641
Come on!

111
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,105
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

112
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,608
It just doesn't make any sense.

113
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,151
You fell asleep at the sauna?

114
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,195
All that hard training left me sore.

115
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,575
I was going to shake off my fatigue,
but ended up falling asleep.

116
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,789
Coach Ju, do you take an ambulance
to the sauna?

117
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,420
We confirmed that an ambulance
came last night.

118
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,467
Only Coach Ju and Coach Bae
were missing from the school.

119
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,436
Okay. Now that Coach Bae is here,
tell us what happened.

120
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,526
Even if they were taken by an ambulance,
it's a personal matter.

121
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,444
No, it isn't.

122
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,323
A coach's health isn't a personal matter.

123
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,495
The school needs to know
whether or not they can coach students.

124
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,292
If he needed an ambulance,
he's in no condition to train anyone.

125
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,880
Also, we ran into each other
at the hospital the other day.

126
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,890
You seem to go there often.
If it wasn't for Coach Ju, was it you?

127
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,518
Do you really have a problem, Coach Bae?

128
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,771
She has nothing to do with this.
Actually--

129
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,855
I have the yips.

130
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,695
What? You said you didn't have it.

131
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,073
Yes. I didn't want to admit it back then.

132
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,826
I couldn't pull the trigger
when I was training.

133
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,664
And I slammed my fist out of anger
and cut my hand.

134
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,749
I-ji. I mean, Coach Bae.

135
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,336
Be honest. Ga-ram went to the hospital.

136
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,966
He went with me
because I needed a guardian.

137
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:02,346
It just so happened that Coach Ju
was there at the time. By chance?

138
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,474
-Yes.
-You expect us to believe that?

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,519
Coach Bae.

140
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,522
Do you even know what that means?

141
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,193
It means you would have to stop coaching
from now on.

142
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,656
We can't entrust our players to a coach
who can't even shoot.

143
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,705
Do you still insist
that you have the yips?

144
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,011
Yes.

145
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,638
That's not true.

146
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,223
Coach Ju.

147
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,726
Thank you for yesterday.

148
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,146
I'll get a doctor's note
if you don't believe me.

149
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,689
You need proof, right?

150
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,237
I-ji.

151
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,865
This isn't right.

152
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,618
This is my problem.
Why did you take the bullet?

153
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,411
I told them the truth.

154
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,996
I do have the yips.

155
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,414
You knew about it too.

156
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,169
Let's take it back.

157
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,089
-Let's go back, and tell them honestly--
-And say what?

158
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,094
"I was hospitalized for Myasthenia Gravis.
It's so bad I need immediate surgery."

159
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,930
Are you going to confess like that?

160
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,723
What comes after that?

161
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,226
Didn't you say it was their last chance?

162
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:35,314
If the school finds out, you won't last
three days, let alone three months.

163
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,775
Go do your job.

164
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,610
I'll take care of myself.

165
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,487
I-ji.

166
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,000
I…

167
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,961
I'm sorry…

168
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,590
for putting so much on you.

169
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,724
I promise.

170
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,892
By any means,

171
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,603
we'll win the Nationals.

172
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,776
And I'll find a way
to help you get over your yips.

173
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,491
Just hang in there.

174
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,980
There's something suspicious

175
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,816
-about Ga-ram.
-It's definitely strange.

176
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,613
It's also fishy that I-ji said
he went to the hospital with her.

177
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,240
You said you saw him at the hospital.

178
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,825
Yes, I certainly did.

179
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,621
The real problem is
whether we can get concrete evidence.

180
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,290
There's the medical and privacy law.

181
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,627
We can use other channels to get them.

182
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,504
Right. Did you check the doctor's note?

183
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,674
It'll get here tomorrow,
so I'll check it then.

184
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,678
But seriously. I-ji, that idiot.

185
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:35,768
She must have hated me back then
to the point that it gave her the yips.

186
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,144
Why would she hate you?

187
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:42,232
To be honest, I told her
to make Seol-hyeon qualify.

188
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,818
And she listened to me.

189
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,030
-To her, it felt like rigging--
-Coach Jeon.

190
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,660
You're drunk. Watch what you're saying.

191
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,163
Yes, I'm drunk. Sorry.

192
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,668
Jong-man, you don't have to worry
about Heung-nam.

193
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,254
He's on our side. Aren't you?

194
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,756
Of course.

195
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,883
I've been on your side since day one.

196
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,010
-Let's drink.
-Yes.

197
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,304
Think of me as an older brother.

198
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,193
Hello.

199
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,081
Let's go, Hanyang.

200
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,048
You just got out of the hospital, idiot.

201
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,194
I'm sorry, I-ji.

202
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,572
You knew all along, didn't you?

203
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,367
Why Ga-ram disappeared.

204
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,453
Where he was.

205
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,249
You knew the whole time
I was looking for him like a madwoman.

206
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,626
He wanted to tell you himself.

207
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,339
That's probably one of the reasons
he came back to the school.

208
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,343
But how could he deceive me like that?

209
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,514
Because I had no idea,
I cursed him every day.

210
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,727
"You can't be happy."

211
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,106
Is that why he ended up like that?

212
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,234
That's a ridiculous thought.

213
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,613
Was I really that hard to trust?

214
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,157
It's not that he didn't trust you.

215
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,452
He didn't want to be a burden.

216
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,832
It's a miracle
that he's standing like that.

217
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,335
That was how bad he was.

218
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,133
He thought you would shoot better
if you were oblivious to the truth.

219
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,052
How would that be possible?

220
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,304
Ga-ram…

221
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,270
Ga-ram was part of my routine.

222
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,859
What if they find out
you're risking your life for them?

223
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,778
If you collapse, just like
how I broke down three years ago,

224
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,072
-the players will--
-Just three months.

225
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,660
Please turn a blind eye
for just three months.

226
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,123
You're such a jerk.

227
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,836
ANADROL

228
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,374
I see.

229
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,544
You had the yips.

230
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,259
I told you to tell the Association this,
didn't I?

231
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,471
People wouldn't have
misunderstood you then.

232
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
YIPS SYNDROME

233
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,269
Considering this,
I can't give you any coaching tasks.

234
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,069
I can manage the team just fine.
You don't do the paperwork anyway.

235
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,321
-I'll do it.
-No.

236
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,282
That's a job for a qualified coach.
You don't have a say in it.

237
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,994
It's bad for the players

238
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,914
to have a coach with the yips
in the shooting range.

239
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,877
Pack your stuff. You're banned
until you're fully recovered.

240
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,422
Good luck with that.

241
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,511
What? Why aren't you practicing?

242
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,543
SHOOTING RANGE
RESTRICTED AREA

243
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,420
MATCH ENTRY FORM - INDIVIDUAL

244
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,088
Fill it in carefully.

245
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,465
Write your correct blood type
and position.

246
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,634
Don't lie about your height and weight.

247
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,137
I won't.

248
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,223
WEIGHT: 99.8 KG

249
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,686
These forms will be handed to the hospital
in case of an accident.

250
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,651
WEIGHT: 115 KG

251
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,448
What is it?

252
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,076
Well…

253
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,037
It's the Shooting Team.

254
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,246
Go on.

255
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,625
Coach Bae was kicked out
from the shooting range.

256
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,008
Here are the player profiles
for the Presidents Cup.

257
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,097
I checked the doctor's note for Coach Bae.

258
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,516
Recovering from the yips isn't easy.

259
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,103
People usually retire
if they get the yips at that age.

260
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,191
Coach Bae is anything but usual.

261
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,665
SHOOTING TEAM

262
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,252
Goodness.

263
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,798
What are you doing?

264
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,176
You're not allowed here.
Are you ignoring me?

265
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,053
I'm outside the shooting range.

266
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,931
Why so rebellious?
Are you standing up to me?

267
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,476
I'm suspended as a coach.

268
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,978
But not as a player, am I?

269
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,189
You can't even take a single shot.

270
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,150
Standing in the hallway like this
won't cure you, will it?

271
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,613
Your career as a player has ended.

272
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,157
You weren't that valuable
as a player anyway.

273
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,742
If you want to shoot…

274
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,830
Do you know the theme park
where you shoot the balloons and dolls?

275
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,206
Go and do that.

276
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,669
Stay at least 10 meters away
from the shooting range.

277
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,839
Stop distracting the players, will you?

278
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,592
Hey, get back to what you were doing.
Stop watching and go back in.

279
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,887
Geez.

280
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,659
Did you see that?

281
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,288
How embarrassing.

282
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,166
I came up with a brilliant idea
to cure it.

283
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,255
-Out of the way!
-Hey.

284
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,382
Ga-ram!

285
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,513
Coach?

286
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,806
What?

287
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,141
Ung!

288
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,688
Ga-ram!

289
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,273
-What is it?
-Run.

290
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,774
Don't let Coach Bae find it.

291
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,776
Hide it. Go!

292
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,655
Hey!

293
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,782
-Come on, what is this?
-I'm sorry.

294
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,951
He runs 100 m in 11 seconds.
You can't catch him.

295
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,871
Gosh, dang it!

296
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,667
Are you nuts?

297
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,502
-Don't shoot.
-What?

298
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,087
Stop shooting!

299
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,467
TO STABILIZE YOUR MIND AND BODY
PUT THE GUN DOWN

300
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,430
Geez.

301
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,850
Geez.

302
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,314
Do you really think
reading some books will fix it?

303
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:29,194
When it comes to shooting and slumps,
I know much more than you.

304
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:33,406
You're right. You tried everything
in the books and papers.

305
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,741
Except for one thing.

306
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,493
Putting down the gun.

307
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,661
You didn't try that.

308
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
How can a shooter put down her gun?

309
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,500
I don't mean forever,
just taking a break for a while.

310
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,668
Then what?

311
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,002
Will it get better?

312
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,420
What do you know?

313
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,505
You become desperate.

314
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,509
When I couldn't play rugby,

315
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,094
I became very desperate.

316
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,431
I am desperate right now.

317
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,474
No.

318
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,103
You're only desperate
for results and medals.

319
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,607
While the Rugby Team trains, run 300 laps.

320
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,777
-Then I'll give your gun back.
-Was that in the papers too?

321
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,530
Geez. Look.

322
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,739
Here.

323
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,283
CARDIO HELPS REDUCE ANXIETY

324
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,660
See? Right here.

325
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,582
Do you think that'll get me to run?

326
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,380
Why aren't you pushing?

327
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,465
Seon-ho, what are you doing?

328
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,468
It's because Coach Bae is here.

329
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,806
Hey, Coach Bae.

330
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,479
Did she come to yell at us
for stealing her gun?

331
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,522
Coach Bae.

332
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,072
You got this!

333
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,284
Why do we keep running 30 laps?

334
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,953
Help me, Yeong-gwang.

335
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,080
-Geez.
-Hold on.

336
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,082
Why?

337
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,250
-What?
-What now?

338
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,842
The Shooting Team's room
is in the main building.

339
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,260
They kicked her out.

340
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,763
Thanks for the explanation.

341
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,266
She dropped by to keep a record. Here.

344
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,488
Look who's talking.

345
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,617
Good luck.

346
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,786
-You got this.
-Good luck.

347
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,162
Goodbye. Let's go!

348
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,330
Let's go!

Are you feeling unwell?

358
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,814
Or is it that you can't focus
because your coach isn't here?

359
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,525
When is Coach Bae coming back?

360

It's not like she was of much help.
Why now, after ignoring her all this time?

I've never ignored her.

362
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,952
She can't help you anyway.

Okay. Over there.

00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,513
Hey, sit behind me.

417
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,897
Why am I tired already?

418
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,488
This seat's taken.

419
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,616
What?

420
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,161
What is he doing?

421
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,372
He's falling apart again.

422
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,706
Why is he so awkward?

423
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,458
Seong-jun, this seat is open.

424
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,463
You should have told me you were there.

425
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,758
-Geez.
-Are you all right?

426
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,218
Nice try, though.

427
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,805
-Why are you so awkward?
-Shut up. Darn it.

428
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,014
Do you need some tips?

429
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,808
Help him.

430
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,185
-You're being so obvious.
-Let's teach him.

431
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,154
Do you want my help?

432
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,280
Stop.

433
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,407
Don't do it.

434
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,741
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

435
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,951
There are no seats.

436
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,122
There's one over there.

437
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,793
That's only half a seat.

438
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,836
I can't sit there.

439
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,638
Look at him, he just took the bag and sat.

440
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,228
Nice.

441
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,563
Sit somewhere else.

442
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,652
Don't even.

443
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,867
-Seok-bong.
-Here, honey.

444
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,327
-I saved you a seat.
-Geez.

445
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,790
Seriously. Did you have to tag along?

446
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,462
No, it's not that I wanted to.
The coach has to come.

447
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,923
See here?
The Union registered me as a coach too.

448
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,847
Can you sit somewhere else?

449
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,017
I would, but Coach Bae can shoot a gun.

450
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,705
What? What was that?

451
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,290
You took it off. What a waste.

452
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,627
You get carsick in the bus, Coach Bang.

453
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,046
When we went off-season training,
you puked

454
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,423
-on my pants--
-Quiet.

455
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,927
Why would you bring up the past
when the students are sleeping?

456
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,849
Do you really hate that I'm back?

457
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,063
I just have a feeling
the vice principal isn't the sole reason.

458
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,733
You're right.
I hate it, and it's annoying.

459
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,902
Why?

460
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,239
Because you still act like you're 17.

461
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,910
You do whatever you want to do in life.

462
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,622
You doped and retired
because you wanted to.

463
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,083
You came back
when you wanted to play rugby again.

464
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,295
Everything comes so easily for you

465
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,423
when it's so hard for people
like I-ji and me.

466
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,342
That's why I hate you. Happy?

467
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,266
I see, that's why.

468
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,643
Now that you know, don't talk to me.

469
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,936
But what can I do?

470
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,523
I like sitting next to you.

471
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,047
That was a long trip.

472
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,465
Yes, sir.

473
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,885
-Stretch before you go to bed.
-Yes, sir.

474
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,845
Rugby Team, let's go.

475
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,054
Hey, it's Daesang.

476
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,776
Gosh. It's been a while, Coach Ju.

477
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,403
Nice to see you.

478
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,448
You're right. It has been a while.

479
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,702
-You look confident about winning.
-There you go again.

480
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,412
Why wouldn't I be?

481
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,459
You might as well be brazen
since you have nothing to lose.

482
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,795
Don't unpack too much.
You'll be going home right away.

483
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:59,217
Guys, you should go easy.
No one's going to watch your match anyway.

484
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,969
-What?
-Who's going to watch the bottom team?

485
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,930
Especially when the coach is Ju Ga-ram?

486
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,182
Don't worry, they'll be here.

487
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,684
Don't give them false hope.

488
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,270
I wouldn't have run away
if they had any hope.

489
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,815
Geez! The dogs bark loudly
in this neighborhood too.

490
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,943
-Hanyang!
-Yes!

491
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,320
Wash your ears before it jinxes you.

492
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,363
-Okay.
-Yes.

493
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,989
We'll wash them thoroughly.

494
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,450
Should I leave these in the bus, Coach?

495
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,911
-Yes. That's for the field.
-Okay.

496
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:27,954
That's a new face.

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,331
Is he the famous new player?

498
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,625
Hello.

499
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,337
Why? Are you going to steal one again?

500
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,505
Why would I?

501
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,840
You can have him for good. He's all yours.

502
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,011
Daesang, we'll practice
right after dinner.

503
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,972
-Let's go.
-Okay.

504
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,766
We'll see just how good they are.

505
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,144
I can't even look at him.

506
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:11,080
DAESANG HIGH SCHOOL
PLAYER RECORDS

507
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,357
Mom.

508
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,360
What's going on?

509
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,696
I thought you were coming directly
to the match.

510
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,281
Are you staying nearby tonight?

511
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,824
Where's Dad?

512
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,494
I came alone. Dad is with Seok-jun.

513
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,790
Eat these with your friends.

514
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,461
I'm glad you're here at least.

515
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,296
Tomorrow's match will be really fun.

516
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,757
Our opponent, Daesang,
is last year's champion.

517
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,343
-Our former coach--
-Seong-jun.

518
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,636
I can't see the match either.

519
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,764
My flight leaves tomorrow.

520
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,724
Come on.

521
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,018
Seok-jun isn't a kid.

522
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:18,689
Living alone abroad is hard,
especially when competing with the best.

523
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,069
He should at least have home-cooked meals
and someone to talk to.

524
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,236
So…

525
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,115
you came to tell me
you can't come tomorrow?

526
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,118
That too.

527
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,621
Seong-jun.

528
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,792
What do you think about moving to Spain
after graduation?

529
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,005
Why would I do that?

530
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,508
You can learn the language.

531
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,345
I thought you could study
to become an agent

532
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,014
who takes care of athletes
and reviews their contracts.

533
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:57,144
It's hard for your dad and me
to fly back and forth like this.

534
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,148
It's time for you
to seriously consider your future.

535
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
You don't know how much longer
you can play rugby.

536
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,153
What you're telling me

537
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,490
is to be someone Seok-jun can talk to…

538
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,121
and be his sidekick?

539
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,916
I'm asking you
to help your brother succeed.

540
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,836
-In the end, that's for the family--
-Mom.

541
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,089
I'm not going.

542
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm going to keep playing rugby.

543
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,637
I'll go to college with it.

544
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,100
Enjoy your time in Spain.

545
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,437
Give it a thought.

546
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,398
Good luck with your match tomorrow.

547
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,289
Okay.

548
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,750
Yes.

549
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,005
I'll call you tomorrow.

550
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,966
Okay.

551
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,888
You're not crying. You cried all the time
when you were a kid.

552
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,805
Hey, when did I?

553
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,433
At the training
before the Nationals in middle school.

554
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,351
-Hey, that was--
-That was?

555
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,609
I don't remember.

556
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,950
Did you hear it?

557
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,702
I just overheard it.

558
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
From where?

559
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,959
From being Seok-jun's sidekick.

560
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:51,008
-I'll get some tissues if you want to cry.
-I'm not going to cry.

561
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,474
BED TIME

562
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,602
Go to bed.

563
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,648
You have to sleep on time
to be in your best condition.

564
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,781
I'll get going.

565
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,534
U-jin.

566
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,788
Good luck tomorrow.

567
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,793
You too.

568
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,296
Good luck with your match.

569
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,972
Do you want some pastries?

570
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,267
Sausage rolls?

571
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,563
They're yummy.

572
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,325
U-jin.

573
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,288
Coach.

574
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,956
What brings you here?

575
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,795
You haven't been scoring as well recently,
so I was wondering what's going on.

576
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,381
Have you been looking at my scores?

577
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,801
I thought Coach Jeon wouldn't let you.

578
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,262
I saw it at night without him knowing.
It's a secret.

579
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,184
Actually, I don't know the reason.

580
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,312
I'm shooting like always.

581
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,774
Since the gap wasn't big,
I thought it was because of my condition.

582
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,485
Didn't you change your shoes?

583
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,070
I did.

584
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,282
But they're the same shoes
in the same size.

585
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,577
New shoes may feel different
even if they're the same brand and size.

586
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,706
Did your score start to drop
after changing the shoes?

587
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,543
I think so.

588
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,296
-You wear size 7, right?
-Yes.

589
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,718
I've brought all the shoes I could get
in that size.

590
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,470
Try them on and try your shooting stance.

591
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,972
Here. I hope they fit.

592
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,850
They should fit.

593
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,521
I'll do it for you.

594
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,025
Hello.

595
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,656
Are you heading
to watch the Presidents Cup?

596
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,327
Hello.

597
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,789
I'm Seo Hui-tae from Today Sports.

598
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,504
-You're the vice principal, aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

599
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,172
TODAY SPORTS
SEO HUI-TAE

600
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,883
-Why are you here?
-You're a bit late.

601
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,303
I thought Hanyang High's
Rugby Team was playing today.

602
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,932
I'm not that interested in the Rugby Team.

603
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,352
I'm interested in the Rugby Team,

604
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,898
especially in Coach Ju Ga-ram.

605
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,783
-Daesang!
-Daesang!

606
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,161
WELCOME HANYANG
WELCOME DAESANG

607
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,997
THE 36TH PRESIDENTS CUP RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP

608
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,249
-Daesang!
-Daesang!

609
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,919
Daesang for the win!

610
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:16,964
SCOUTS' SEATS

611
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,800
Hanyang High Rugby Team!

612
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,970
-Let's go!
-Hanyang High Yoon Seong-jun!

613
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,973
-Hanyang High Rugby Team!
-Good luck!

614
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,934
THE 36TH PRESIDENTS CUP RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP

615
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,730
Ms. Kang.

616
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,190
Ga-ram.

617
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,110
No one is here.

618
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,821
The match hasn't started yet.

619
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,285
Myeongseong and Gangsan
went to see Mujin High's match.

620
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,164
The pro team scouts
are at Taesan High's match.

621
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,170
You should go to the stand too.

622
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,839
We don't have many people on our stand.

623
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,175
Can you cheer like a one-man army?

624
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,968
Don't you worry.

625
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,263
Hanyang!

626
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,640
Go get them!

627
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,397
-Cheol-hui.
-Yes.

628
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,398
-U-jae.
-Yes.

629
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,483
-Hyeong-hun.
-Yes.

630
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,151
And Tae-pung is the center.

631
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,238
Hanyang High's Number 6 is a newbie.
Target that side.

632
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,741
-Let's show them what rugby is.
-Okay, sir.

633
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,451
-Coach.
-What?

634
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,662
My knee hasn't recovered yet.
I was told to give it another two weeks--

635
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,039
Hey, Tae-pung.

636
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,208
Players like you
need to start in the preliminaries,

637
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,710
so the key players can save energy
for the finals.

638
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,588
Play like we trained.
Push them hard from the start.

639
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,423
-Ready?
-Yes, sir!

640
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,178
There you go.

641
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:51,183
Look at you, all dressed up in a suit.

642
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,812
What can you do with no subs?

643
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,232
The seven of them have good teamwork.

644
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,942
Well, we'll see about that.

645
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,445
You're here, Coach Song.

646
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,201
-I thought you'd come for Round 2.
-I wanted to see someone.

647
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:13,080
Really? Let me know who he is,
and I'll introduce him after the match.

648
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,749
He's not from Daesang.

649
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,300
Do you have a minute, Coach Ju?

650
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,558
Thank you for coming, Coach Song.

651
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,685
You watched the videos, right?

652
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:40,148
My players are really good.
They love rugby and are determined.

653
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:44,027
With systematic university training,
they'll get better more quickly.

654
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,863
-Ga-ram.
-Yes.

655
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,618
I watched the videos.

656
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,122
I saw the potential
of Hanyang's Rugby Team.

657
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:01,587
But I'm here today for a different reason.

658
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:07,092
Whatever the reason is,
you're here, so it's all good.

659
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,557
Why did you say you couldn't play…

660
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,273
the day before the final?

661
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,565
What about rugby?
I can still play though, right?

662
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,567
I'm sorry,

663
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:10,072
but it'll be hard for you to keep playing.

664
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,536
Coach,

665
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,499
I don't think I can play in the finals.

666
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,252
What kind of nonsense is that?

667
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,591
I'm sorry, but I don't feel well.

668
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,135
It's the Olympics
we're talking about here.

669
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,722
If we win this, we go to the Olympics.

670
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,519
All of us have been through
so much the past four years.

671
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,188
We didn't get a day to rest.

672
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:47,526
Sang-gi came back after two knee surgeries
to go to the Olympics.

673
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,987
Tae-ho gave up his elbow surgery for this.

674
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,782
I know you're probably feeling worn out
by now.

675
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,285
But just one match.

676
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,413
Let's play one more match.

677
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,997
Coach, actually--

678
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,958
You're the captain!

679
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,213
We're about to qualify for the Olympics
for the first time in 96 years.

680
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,425
Everyone is watching us.

681
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,395
Ga-ram.

682
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,774
Do us a favor.

683
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,830
THE PRIDE OF KOREAN RUGBY, JU GA-RAM!

684
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:46,084
Ju Ga-ram!

685
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,795
-Let's get ready for the second half.
-It's 12 to 26 right now.

686
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,713
Where's Ga-ram?

687
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,924
Team Korea is 14 points behind Japan.

688
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,719
They're down by a lot.

689
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
In the second half,

690
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,850
Ace Ga-ram needs to deliver
more than ever.

691
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,773
ANADROL

692
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,640
I've been constantly asking myself

693
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,728
if I ruined your career
because I didn't listen to you back then.

694
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,525
What you wanted to tell me…

695
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,071
It had to do with doping, didn't it?

696
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,165
I know it's late, but I'm sorry.

697
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,086
I put too much on your shoulders.

698
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,133
I didn't act in a way a coach should.

699
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,224
Give me your hand, Coach.

700
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,862
Leave the past behind.

701
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,615
Just focus on my boys.

702
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,121
I'm trying to train them
not to be like me.

703
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,752
-The first round
-The match is about to begin.

704
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,255
between Hanyang and Daesang
will begin soon.

705
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,965
I'll get going, Coach.

706
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,967
Enjoy the match.

707
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,753
Daesang is known for its strong forwards.

708
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,590
So we'll focus on speed to win.

709
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,050
-Yoon Seong-jun.
-Yes.

710
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:40,967
-Mun Ung.
-Yes.

711
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,887
With your speed,
we'll break through from the side.

712
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,806
They don't know much about Ung.

713
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,143
So Seong-jun will be marked heavily.

714
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,562
When their defense focuses on Seong-jun,

715
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,190
Ung will be able to find openings
to break through.

716
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,359
-Okay?
-Yes!

717
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,652
Gather around.

718
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,829
What's our goal?

719
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,332
Winning the Nationals!

720
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:16,211
If you put in effort for a goal,
you can't fail.

721
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,675
Even if they score first,
we'll just fight harder to catch up.

722
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:27,263
If you can't score,
keep creating chances nonstop.

723
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,018
With every effort you make,

724
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,355
we are bound to win.

725
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:41,987
Let's go.

726
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,409
Hanyang!

727
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,660
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

728
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,495
THE PRESIDENTS CUP RUGBY
HANYANG : DAESANG

729
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,249
BEAT THEM! DOMINATE THEM!

730
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,466
Rugby Team.

731
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,136
Hanyang High School Yoon Seong-jun!

732
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,438
Ung, this is how you play real rugby.

733
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,826
Are you ready?

734
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,054
SEONG-JUN IS A DEER
MY LOVELY DEAR

735
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,436
Go back.

736
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,691
-Hey.
-Let's go!

737
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,785
-Hey.
-Release the ball.

738
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,869
There you go.

739
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,788
Seon-ho, block.

740
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,001
Good.

741
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,711
Keep moving around.

742
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,513
Let's go!

743
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,812
-Get him.
-Block him.

744
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,190
Look at the ball.

745
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,400
Chase him.

746
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,124
Release the ball.

747
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,377
Hey, Tae-pung!

748
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,754
Stop being weak and move faster.

749
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,881
-Did you forget your training?
-No, sir.

750
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,097
HANYANG : DAESANG

751
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,522
What are you doing, Tae-pung?
Who are you passing to, idiot?

752
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,400
Ung.

753
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,117
Here, Captain.

754
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,667
Hey, Number 6.

755
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,585
Block Number 6.

756
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,019
-Yes!
-Ung!

757
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,067
That was amazing!

758
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,444
Darn it.

759
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,571
Come on!

760
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,204
HANYANG 7 : 0 DAESANG

761
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,164
You'd better get your heads in the game!

762
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,125
Are you going to let them beat you
and send you packing?

763
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,753
Yonhee University's coach is here.

764
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,421
If you lose this match,

765
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,798
don't even think
about going to university.

766
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,258
Find a job as a tout.

767
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,429
Get it together
unless you want to be losers.

768
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,597
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

769
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,224
Let's do it, Daesang.

770
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,601
-Did you see that, Coach?
-It hurts.

771
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,144
We scored first.

772
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,021
We crushed it.

773
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,357
Our strategy worked, Coach.

774
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,733
Good job.

775
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,486
You're doing great,
but we still have lots of time left.

776
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,363
Don't let your guard down, and keep it up.

777
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,199
Try to make them slip up. Okay?

778
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,909
-Okay!
-Let's do it!

779
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,160
Okay, let's go.

780
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,371
-One, two.
-Run.

781
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,790
Let's go.

782
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,458
-Look forward.
-Go forward.

783
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,504
Darn it.

784
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,300
-Are you okay?
-Damn it!

785
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,513
Is it you again, shortie?
Still the same as before, huh?

786
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,806
Both skills and height.

787
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,226
Hey, Hyeong-sik.

788
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,440
Focus on rugby, you jerk.

789
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,611
Good job, Hyeong-sik. Let's go!

790
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,747
We'll start now.

791
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,419
Don't collapse!

792
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,552
No.

793
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,179
Follow them.

794
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,265
Run.

795
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,183
You have to stop him!

796
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:09,230
-Run!
-Run!

797
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,898
Run!

798
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,660
-It's okay.
-Nice.

799
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,662
It's okay.

800
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,205
You got this!

801
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,719
Daesang.

802
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,264
Daesang for the win!

803
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,145
Pass.

804
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,566
Okay. Good.

805
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,445
-Nice.
-Are you all right?

806
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,613
-We did it.
-Captain!

807
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,575
You're doing great!

808
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,709
DAESANG 7 : 12 HANYANG

809
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,547
-Tae-pung.
-Tae-pung.

810
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,758
-Pass.
-To the side.

811
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,219
-Run forward.
-Go for it.

812
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,975
Yes. Nice.

813
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,477
Run.

814
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,062
Get him, Ung. Don't let him pass.

815
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,314
-Tackle him, Ung.
-Number 6 is coming for a tackle.

816
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,191
Break through, Tae-pung. Run!

817
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,734
Tackle him, Ung.

818
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,085
You have to stop him. Hurry.

819
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,404
Coach, tackling is important
in rugby, right?

820
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,447
Coach.

821
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,045
I'm sorry.

822
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,381
I can't tackle.

823
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:08,242
THE WINNING TRY

824
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,436
THE WINNING TRY

825
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,605
Every player has their own issue.

826
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:38,856
Launch a counterattack.

827
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,316
They look frustrated.

828
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,318
They want to swap the gold and silver.

829
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,154
-Admission fraud is unacceptable.
-How dare you say that?

830
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,405
Congrats, Coach Ju.

831
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,491
Why would we disband a team
with potential?

832
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,201
What happened to you?

833
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,702
What do we do now?

834
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,996
What matters is how well
we can back him up.

835
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,249
We have to do that
to become a strong team.

836
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,376
Will you believe me
if I say it's not true?

837
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,169
-Is that him?
-We're at the right place.

838
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,340
If you can't do it today,
your rugby ends here.
