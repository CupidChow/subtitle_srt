THE WINNING TRY

2
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,673
Excuse me.

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,183
What are you trying to pull?

4
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,559
ANADROL

5
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,187
That's my medicine.

6
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,355
-Coach Ju.
-Ga-ram.

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,900
Hey.

8
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,026
Coach.

9
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,362
It's okay.

10
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,828
It really is mine.

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,371
I have…

12
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,419
I have been diagnosed
with Myasthenia Gravis.

13
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,939
Search everywhere.

14
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,195
-Search thoroughly.
-Yes.

15
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,078
What is this?

16
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,586
GET THROUGH THE NATIONALS

17
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,848
Geez, isn't that enough?

18
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,394
Why would you look…

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,025
THE WINNING TRY

20
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,195
MEDICAL REPORT

21
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,490

00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,575
EPISODE 11

23
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,078
…decline all interview requests.

24
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:42,996
Okay.

25
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,291
-Make sure the students don't talk.
-Okay.

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,962
Were you aware of this
when you hired Ga-ram?

27
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,172
-Yes, I was.
-No.

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,844
Who else knows about it?

29
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,138
Did you know, Coach Bae?

30
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,264
-I--
-She didn't.

31
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,435
Did the team have no idea?

32
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,187
It was all me.

33
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,772
Leave the boys alone.

34
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,067
Geez. So they did take illegal substances.

35
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,029
-That's why they got better.
-That's the Rugby Team for you.

36
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,618
So the Rugby Team didn't know.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,912
Test all of them for doping.

38
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,205
-Okay.
-And Ms. Kang,

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,375
you will be held accountable
for hiring him.

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,669
As for you, Coach Ju,

41
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,340
our school doesn't hire coaches
with health issues

42
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,092
who can't play their role as a coach.

43
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,095
Whether you resign
or we nullify your employment,

44
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,555
we'll find a way.

45
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,768
Before anything,
check if this medical report is even real.

46
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,685
Okay.

47
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,897
What are you doing?

48
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,734
This is Hanyang Physical Education
High School.

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,862
I have Myasthenia Gravis,

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,782
and I'm having trouble breathing.

51
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,533
-Please hurry--
-Ga-ram!

52
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,036
-Ju Ga-ram!
-Hey, Ga-ram!

53
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,537
-Ga-ram!
-Ga-ram!

54
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,997
-Wake up, Ga-ram.
-Ga-ram!

55
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,627
-Wait, guys.
-What's going on?

56
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,254
-I'll go with him.
-Yoon Seong-jun!

57
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,298
Coach Bae is going with him,
so let's wait here.

58
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,467
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,010
Please step back.

60
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,865
Yoon Seong-jun, what happened?

61
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,784
What's with the steroids?

62
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,162
Answer me!

63
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,126
-They're mine.
-Why did you have them in the first place?

64
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,877
To play at the Nationals.

65
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,754
-So what?
-Have you gone nuts?

66
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,548
Don't you know the consequences of doping?

67
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,341
-I do.
-Do you?

68
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,553
How could you say that as the captain?

69
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,847
Is everything about you?

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,725
-Are you trying to ruin the team?
-Stop.

71
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,352
Move! Darn it.

72
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,687
-Stop.
-Please.

73
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,900
Let me ask you one more thing.

74
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,238
Did you know about Coach's illness?

75
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,368
No, I didn't know either.

76
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,830
Damn it.

77
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,692
I-ji.

78
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,822
EMERGENCY BELL

79
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,661
How did you manage
until things got this bad?

80
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,165
Let's do the surgery.
We can't postpone any longer.

81
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,293
Can't I delay it by just one more month?

82
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,462
-Ju Ga-ram.
-You can't.

83
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,590
I'll talk to the CS Department
to set the date.

84
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,717
Please begin his check-in process.

85
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,637
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

86
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,770
I-ji.

87
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,067
I'll be back.

88
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,208
SEOUL OFFICE OF EDUCATION

89
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,502
PRE-EMPLOYMENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

90
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,379
MEDICAL REPORT

91
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,593
It's a clear cause for dismissal.

92
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,180
Yes. Ms. Kang even admitted
that she knew about it.

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,934
Shouldn't we get her resignation letter?

94
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,019
That would be a dishonorable dismissal.

95
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,855
She would never write one.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,316
Her retirement is in three months,
and her pension is at stake.

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,403
The official disciplinary committee
will make a big deal out of it.

98
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,531
The whole school might be subject
to criticism.

99
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:33,453
Let's just come up with a reason
to put her on probation or reduce her pay.

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,788
We just need to kick out Ju Ga-ram.

101
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,260
Geez. This is so frustrating.

102
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,681
Should I try calling him?

103
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,892
We don't even know how he's doing.

104
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,936
-If he's in bad--
-Hey!

105
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,777
I can't take it anymore.

106
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,655
I'll go to the hospital and check on him.

107
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:11,991
Me too.

108
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,035
Let's all go together.

109
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,503
Aren't you coming?

110
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,759
DAEYOUNG MEDICAL FOUNDATION
SEONGLIM HOSPITAL

111
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,597
I'll lower your bed.

112
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,397
There's no need.

113
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,035
Come closer.

114
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,748
Geez, Coach.

115
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,625
Coach.

116
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,837
Did I scare you guys?

117
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,476
Don't cry

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,437
You'll lose muscle mass

119
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,607
You can't lose muscles now

120
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,444
-How can you be joking right now?
-I just want you to laugh.

121
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,573
-It's not funny at all.
-I'm sorry.

122
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,200
I really wanted

123
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,745
to fight through it
and go to the Nationals together.

124
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,249
Are we not going together?

125
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,795
Don't tell us we have to play
at the Nationals without you.

126
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,717
We can't do it without you.
You know it too.

127
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,552
If you're not with us…

128
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,139
it'll be scary.

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,146
Guys,

130
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,648
do you remember?

131
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,153
On my first day,

132
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,116
you gave up the match
because you didn't want me as the coach.

133
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,743
Was it against Mujin High?

134
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,329
Coach, back then, I was…

135
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,293
We have changed a lot since then,
haven't we?

136
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,591
We've all changed, thanks to you.

137
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,845
That's not true.

138
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,555
-It is.
-It is.

139
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,810
A coach

140
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,772
can't play on the same field as you guys.

141
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,816
He can only teach you how to play.

142
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,779
In the end, the coach can only watch.

143
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,532
It's the players who make it happen.

144
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,206
So you guys will do great

145
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,958
at the Nationals.

146
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,294
I might not be there,

147
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,297
but what I taught you will be with you,
won't it?

148
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,342
Just remember that.

149
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,677
Okay.

150
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,847
-From now on,
-Yes.

151
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,394
…unite the hearts of all seven,

152
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,562
and play as one.

153
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,691
You know the phrase,
"No player is greater than the team."

154
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,318
Yes.

155
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,821
No coach is greater than the team either.

156
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,532
Don't let my being here

157
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,534
get to you.

158
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,327
Okay?

159
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:45,955
-Okay.
-Okay.

160
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,040
Go back to school.

161
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,253
Continue with the training routine
starting tomorrow morning. Okay?

162
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,379
-Yes.
-Yes.

163
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,013
Hang in there.

164
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,432
You can do it.

165
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,497
Guys.

166
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,626
You can go ahead.

167
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,503
What are you trying to do now?

168
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,046
It's not like that.

169
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,965
I'll be right there.

170
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,719
What's with him?

171
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,274
-Did the rest go back?
-Yes.

172
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,070
Coach, here.

173
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,156
What is that? Is that for me?

174
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,449
When I was hospitalized,

175
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,620
it was really uncomfortable
without slippers, so…

176
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,467
They're pretty fancy
for hospital slippers.

177
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,888
-It's a bed of roses.
-A bed of roses?

178
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,932
I got you shoes with flowers in hopes

179
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,768
that they'll lead you to a path
paved with roses.

180
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,228
Right.

181
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,605
You want me to walk on a bed of roses
in floral shoes.

182
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,112
Floral shoes.

183
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,907
They fit perfectly.
How did you know my size?

184
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,078
You lent me your shoes
when you came to get me before, remember?

185
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,999
My floral shoes.

186
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,509
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,845
What I did was wrong, Coach.

188
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,390
Geez.

189
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,059
You're much better than me.

190
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:17,189
I realized that after making the mistake
three years ago.

191
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,777
Back then,

192
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,948
all I could think of
was that one match ahead of me.

193
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,452
I felt I had to do anything

194
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,955
to play that match.

195
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,918
Even if it meant doping.

196
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,427
The funny thing is,

197
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,471
I didn't feel happy

198
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,974
when the match was over.

199
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,729
My teammates were jumping with joy,

200
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,023
but I knew

201
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,944
that I made a terrible mistake.

202
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,409
Do you regret it?

203
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,498
Of course.

204
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,172
I ruined everything I had built
as a player

205
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,008
with that one choice.

206
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,180
I'll probably reflect on it and regret it

207
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,183
for the rest of my life.

208
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,688
Now, you tell me

209
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,815
why you did it.

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,784
I was anxious.

211
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,330
I felt impatient too.

212
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,000
And?

213
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,130
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Why not?

214
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,967
Is it because it hurts your pride? Hey.

215
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,346
Am I without pride for telling you
about what happened three years ago?

216
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,020
I just felt so pathetic.

217
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,984
I got injured before the big game
when I'm the captain.

218
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,865
"What if I don't get into any colleges
or pro teams?"

219
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,118
That's what crossed my mind.

220
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,373
Seong-jun.

221
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,544
Do you know why I came back to this school

222
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,714
when I knew I'd get treated like this?

223
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,091
Why did you?

224
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:58,642
When the principal asked me
to coach your team,

225
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,021
I went to watch you guys train
without telling anyone.

226
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,315
Let's go!

227
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,776
How long are we going to do
basic training?

228
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,531
You guys didn't have a coach,
but still needed to train.

229
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,366
You just didn't know how.

230
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,622
It felt like all you could do
was plow through all the training.

231
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,251
Did you pity us?

232
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
No.

233
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,380
I wanted to be there for you.

234
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,593
I felt bad seeing you struggle
by yourself.

235
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,850
Seong-jun.

236
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,521
All the training you've done
over the past three years

237
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,317
won't disappear just because
you take a three-week break.

238
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,700
The efforts you've accumulated
will still be there.

239
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,165
Trust the time and effort you've put in.

240
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,417
If you can't do that,

241
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,878
then trust your team.

242
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,882
But I…

243
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,802
I trust you, Seong-jun.

244
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,953
Were you with Ju Ga-ram?

245
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,748
Let's talk.

246
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,345
How's your shoulder?

247
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,765
It's all right. It's recovering.

248
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,809
Don't you need the pills?

249
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,773
Did you really think I didn't know
whose pills they are?

250
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,864
Take your pick.

251
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,366
They'll be Ju Ga-ram's replacement.

252
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,665
RUGBY COACH CANDIDATES

253
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,543
Are you planning to hire a new coach
for the Rugby Team?

254
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,755
When Ju Ga-ram took the blame
for the pills, you stayed silent.

255
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,968
Didn't that mean
you agreed to kick him out?

256
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,890
Think carefully
while I'm turning a blind eye.

257
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
Hey, Seong-jun.

258
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,653
-Captain.
-You're back.

259
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,332
-How's Coach?
-Did he give us any instructions?

260
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,379
You guys want to play rugby, right?

261
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,010
What kind of question is that?

262
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,346
The school will change the coach.

263
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,181
What?

264
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,479
Do you even want to play with a new coach?

265
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
I don't.

266
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,698
One day,

267
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,035
we'll have to play
under a different coach.

268
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,790
But not now.

269
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,628
It was Coach Ju who got us this far.

270
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,922
We're not a team of seven

271
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,092
but of eight, including Coach, aren't we?

272
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,178
I would have to agree.

273
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,263
Me too.

274
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
But what can we do?

275
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,101
What if we protest
against having a new coach?

276
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,189
That won't be enough.

277
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
What, then?

278
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,571
Let's boycott the Nationals.

279
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,823
-What?
-What?

280
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,534
Are you serious?

281
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,369
Yes, I'm serious.

282
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,455
This might be your last rugby match.

283
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,375
I thought of what I'd regret more.

284
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,587
If it's going to be my last match anyway,

285
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,339
I want to do it with Coach Ju.

286
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,677
-I'm in.
-Me too.

287
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,265
Okay. The second-years are in too.

288
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,474
Me too.

289
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,481
Get your uniforms.

290
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,958
This won't do you any good.

291
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,378
You shouldn't do this
for the sake of Coach Ju.

292
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,261
What on earth is this?

293
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,849
We don't want any coach besides Coach Ju.

294
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,100
What?

295
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,560
Grant him sick leave.

296
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,395
Otherwise…

297
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,779
we won't play at the Nationals.

298
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,864
Rugby Team!

299
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,117
You won't play at the Nationals?

300
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,578
Yoon Seong-jun.

301
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,164
So Myeong-u.

302
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,832
Oh Yeong-gwang!

303
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,085
You are in your third year!

304
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,046
-Your college admission depends on it!
-I am aware.

305
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,006
I am too.

306
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,469
Stop threatening us with that.
That won't work on us anymore.

307
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,807
Fine.

308
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,184
Do as you please.

309
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,186
The school will sign up for it anyway.

310
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,314
Then we won't move an inch in the stadium.

311
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,654
If that's what you want, go ahead.

312
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,867
Rugby Team, we understand how you feel.

313
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,079
-But--
-"But there's nothing we can do."

314
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,374
We don't want to hear it anymore.

315
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,377
It's all an excuse.

316
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,551
Are all seven of you

317
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,928
on the same page?

318
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,054
-Yes!
-Yes!

319
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,322
Geez.

320
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,707
What's becoming of this school?

321
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,795
The principal commits hiring fraud,
and the students go along with it.

322
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,257
Thanks to that,
the Rugby Team has finally become one.

323
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:32,721
As long as I'm here,
Ju Ga-ram will never return to the school.

324
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,472
Try as you may.

325
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,979
You must think I did nothing
because I didn't know what you were up to.

326
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,608
I was just in a position
where I had to keep quiet.

327
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,528
Are you threatening me?

328
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,030
Yes, I'm threatening you.

329
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,327
Don't mess with Coach Ju and his team.

330
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,745
I'll take…

331
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,954
RESIGNATION LETTER

332
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,706
…full responsibility.

333
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,960
Are you going to resign in disgrace
voluntarily?

334
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,545
Why not?

335
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,089
An honorable retirement isn't a big deal.

336
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,177
If my retirement
gives the students a chance,

337
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,471
I'm happy with that.

338
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,224
Geez.

339
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,516
Mr. Seong.

340
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,229
Why do you want to be the principal?

341
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,399
The pay is about the same,
but you'll be responsible for everything.

342
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,778
-Such responsibilities mean power.
-And what will you do with that?

343
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,208
For me,

344
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,878
I felt sorry for the students
who were judged only by their ranks

345
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,463
and medal colors,

346
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:54,970
so I wanted to create a school focused
on growth rather than just results.

347
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,390
I wanted to create a true school

348
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,894
where more students
are given opportunities and cared for.

349
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:05,939
And,

350
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,233
that's precisely why

351
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,778
I'm gladly taking responsibility now.

352
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,871
Congratulations on your promotion,
Principal Seong.

353
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,129
RESIGNATION LETTER

354
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,590
Please take care of the students.

355
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,195
Ms. Kang.

356
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,531
Ms. Kang.

357
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,534
My years of teaching weren't for nothing.

358
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,245
I have people sending me off.

359
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,789
What about a retirement ceremony?

360
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,792
Come on.
That would make me so uncomfortable.

361
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,510
Raise your heads,
I want to see your faces.

362
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,026
I'm off.

363
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,905
Right.

364
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,908
Don't tell Ga-ram about this.

365
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,535
We can't keep it a secret from him.

366
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,162
I'll tell him.

367
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,373
Let me say goodbye myself.

368
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,754
-Should I put this in the back?
-Yes, thank you.

369
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,308
From tomorrow,
Mr. Seong will be acting principal.

370
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,018
That already sounds terrible.

371
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,313
If he becomes the real principal,
the school will become a mess.

372
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,860
Do you know anything, I-ji?

373
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,571
If we can pick holes in Nak-gyun,

374
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,074
we might be able to send him downhill
with Mr. Seong.

375
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,035
He would know more
than I would, wouldn't he?

376
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,955
Well, I…

377
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,165
do know some stuff.

378
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,167
That's our ex-rat.

379
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,170
We can't let Ms. Kang
resign in disgrace like this.

380
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,755
-We can't.
-Of course not.

381
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,424
I'll be one heck of a rat.

382
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,342
All right!

383
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,678
Go, Bang-gu!

384
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,222
CONGRATULATIONS
SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION

385
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,268
CONGRATULATIONS, PRINCIPAL
HANYANG HIGH TEACHERS

386
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,983
PRINCIPAL SEONG JONG-MAN

387
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,243
Come in.

388
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,629
Here's our entry form.

389
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,298
2025 NATIONALS RUGBY ENTRY FORM

390
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,387
Seven players, no substitutes.

391
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,139
The coach is on sick leave.

392
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,808
And the captain has a shoulder injury.

393
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,895
-Will your team do well?
-My shoulder is getting better.

394
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,606
We don't have substitutes,
but our teamwork is great.

395
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,401
Also, Coach is only absent
from the stadium.

396
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,656
Without a good result,
there won't be a Rugby Team next year.

397
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,657
PRINCIPAL

398
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:56,544
HANYANG HIGH IN-SCHOOL SHOOTING TRYOUT

399
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,884
Didn't U-jin miss all
of the shooting training?

400
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,969
She was in rehab.

401
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,056
How can she participate in the tryout
in the middle of rehab?

402
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,440
Seol-hyeon.

403
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,404
-You're here.
-You're not nervous, are you?

404
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,489
Of course not.

405
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,158
You'll advance no matter what,
so don't worry about a thing.

406
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,786
What do you mean? I have to do well.

407
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,705
You don't need to know.

408
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,625
You've been doing well,
so just shoot like you did in practice.

409
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,043
-Okay.
-Good luck.

410
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,003
Take a seat.

411
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,588
-Let's sit.
-Now,

412
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,134
we'll begin the in-school shooting tryout.

413
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,512
Shooters…

414
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,641
start shooting.

415
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,989
KIM JI-U 9.0
NA SEOL-HYEON 9.7

416
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:41,858
SEO U-JIN 10.2

417
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,194
NA SEOL-HYEON 573.6
SEO U-JIN 573.4

418
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,289
1. NA SEOL-HYEON 2. SEO U-JIN
DIFFERENCE 9.9

419
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,709
That's a sizable gap.
Seol-hyeon will win without a problem.

420
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,422
1. SEO U-JIN : FINAL SELECTION
2. NA SEOL-HYEON

421
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,489
Good job, U-jin.

422
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,450
Well done.

423
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,162
Hey.

424
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,913
What's going on?

425
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,666
-You said all she did was rehab.
-Yes.

426
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,710
She put a lot of effort into the rehab.

427
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,348
Take a deep breath.

428
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,559
Keep your eyes on it.

429
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,780
The in-school tryout is soon.
What do I do?

430
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,699
-If I get eliminated in the tryout--
-U-jin.

431
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,874
-Yes.
-Look.

432
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,710
This was a week ago.

433
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,004
This was six days ago.

434
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:51,923
This is today.

435
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,844
I know you're scared
you won't ever hit the middle again.

436
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,641
When I had the yips,

437
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,560
someone told me

438
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,439
a moment would come
when I'd make it happen

439
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,109
despite the circumstances and pressure.

440
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,738
Was that the moment I got hurt?

441
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,494
I think I became a bit stronger
at that moment.

442
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,250
So let's try it again.

443
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,504
You'll have that moment, too.

444
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,426
I thought you gave up on the tryout.

445
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,011
We've never given up.

446
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,180
Both U-jin and I.

447
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,475
I was taught that a player
never gives up her game,

448
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,896
and a coach never gives up on her player.

449
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,861
We'll talk about this later.

450
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:58,948
Good job.

451
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,535
Come on out.

452
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,837
You're unwell, aren't you?

453
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,673
Where is it? Your ears?

454
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,216
I came first in the tryout.

455
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,470
-Isn't that enough?
-Taking care of your body is also a skill.

456
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,639
The tryout isn't the problem here.

457
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:28,769
The Nationals are just around the corner,
but you're not at 100%.

458
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,319
Why didn't you tell me?

459
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,737
Because you don't care.

460
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,780
-Seo U-jin.
-I'll handle it myself.

461
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,407
What?

462
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,619
I'll manage my condition and matches
on my own from now on.

463
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,747
From now on, the gold medals are mine.

464
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,375
They aren't the dreams
you couldn't fulfill.

465
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,753
They are Shooter Seo U-jin's gold medals.

466
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,223
Passing the Nationals tryout
and college admissions!

467
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,933
I thought they were done deals.

468
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,768
We can change the tryout result.

469
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,355
How can I trust you now?
And what about the recommendation letter?

470
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,106
No need to worry about that.

471
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,444
It's ready to be submitted
under Seol-hyeon's name.

472
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,156
It's the principal's recommendation,
so when I sign it,

473
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,699
it's over.

474
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,911
-Coach Jeon, what--
-What is this all about?

475
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,623
No, Seol-hyeon. It's--

476
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,876
Didn't I make myself clear
that I liked shooting

477
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,756
because it was fairer
than any other sport?

478
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,386
But my own dad was making the game unfair.

479
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,637
Well…

480
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,805
How embarrassing.

481
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,141
Seol-hyeon.

482
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
Congratulations.

483
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,589
This was the last time I lost.
Next time, I'll beat you.

484
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,217
Fair and square.

485
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,927
Okay.

486
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,013
I'll look forward to it.

487
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,393
Aren't you hungry?

488
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,604
Do you want a late-night snack later?

489
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,440
Okay.

490
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,443
Wrap it up. I'll get going.

491
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,493
Let's go.

492
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,219
Nice one, Hyeong-sik.

493
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,639
I'm good. I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

494
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,034
Have some water.

495
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,620
-Well done.
-Thank you!

496
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,706
Good job.

497
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,335
Was rugby training always this tough?

498
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,045
Geez, I think I hurt my knees.

499
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,672
How on earth did Ga-ram endure this?

500
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,383
-I know.
-I told you to go lower.

501
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,676
I did. I look at the knees
and go for them.

502
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,220
-Go low.
-Geez, my back.

503
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,638
-Are you okay?
-Of course.

504
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,186
Geez. Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

505
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,106
Compared to my old days, this is nothing.

506
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,774
COACH JU

507
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,236
-Yes, Coach.
-Come visit me.

508
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,197
Now? We're training right now.

509
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,991
I have a special training for you.

510
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,162
What are all these?

511
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,457
We don't know what will happen,
so I put together all possible cases.

512
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,878
From now on, you'll memorize
all these tactics on my behalf.

513
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:28,134
If I can't go to the stadium,
the captain plays the coach's role.

514
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,301
Can you do it?

515
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,762
Yes, I can.

516
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,972
Good.

517
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,599
But…

518
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,562
I don't see Daesang High's.

519
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,566
That can wait until you get to the final.

520
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,277
Okay.

521
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,070
First, Mujin High.

522
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,452
They're not physically strong,

523
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,789
but they're fast. To block them,

524
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,041
Ju-yang has to…

525
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,879
Myeong-u and Hyeong-sik
will secure the middle.

526
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,895
-Heung-nam.
-Geez.

527
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
-Are you all right?
-You scared me.

528
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,607
False alarm. Hey.

529
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,276
-Get off him.
-You scared me!

530
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,612
You should have locked the door, then.

531
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,238
-What's that?
-They're for you guys.

532
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:37,661
What? You know what's up.

533
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,581
I thought you'd hurt your joints
while substituting for the Rugby Team.

534
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,459
It's good for your joints.
It's filled with vitamins too.

535
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,127
My knees are hurting right now.

536
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,963
-How can you be so sweet and sensible?
-Geez.

537
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,842
I think my knees are better already.
They're fine now.

538
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,514
Hey, we're putting the puzzles together.
Nak-gyun is unbelievable.

539
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,102
-So will this do?
-This is more than enough.

540
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,231
The real question is how we put it to use.

541
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,444
Right!

542
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,156
There they go!

543
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,496
-Wow. That's crazy.
-Damn.

544
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,582
-That was awesome.
-Who else saw that play?

545
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,668
Team Korea is on fire, indeed.

546
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,753
It'd be awesome to play for Team Korea.

547
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,547
I'd die to know what that feels like.

548
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,465
-Feel it, then.
-Sure.

549
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,552
Coach Ju would have been there
if he hadn't retired, wouldn't he?

550
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,345
Geez.

551
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,974
-What?
-Come on.

552
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,435
We can play better for Coach
and make his comeback stronger.

553
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,854
Sure. Why not? Let's give it a try!

554
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,317
Hey. Coach's surgery is tomorrow,
isn't it?

555
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,616
Is it a good time to call him?

556
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,661
Hey.

557
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,539
Follow me.

558
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,832
Why?

559
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,417
-He smiled.
-Hurry.

560
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,294
-I'm right behind you.
-What is it?

561
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,266
What are you looking at?

562
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,768
Oh, you know…

563
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,646
My little miracles?

564
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,282
What is that?

565
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,326
The surgery guideline.

566
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,662
You have to start fasting from midnight
for the general anesthesia tomorrow.

567
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,957
You don't smoke, so that's good.
You don't have cold symptoms.

568
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,501
You have to turn off the humidifier
from tonight.

569
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:50,878
And…

570
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,215
What?

571
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,635
Tomorrow is the send-off ceremony
for the Nationals.

572
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,928
Are you all set?

573
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,388
I can take care of myself.

574
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,016
Don't say that.
You always forget something.

575
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,017
When did I ever?

576
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,563
Did you pack your earplugs
and shoulder tapes?

577
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,482
-How many shoes did you pack?
-Geez.

578
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,571
Bae I-ji's routine includes Ju Ga-ram,
but you can't take that this time.

579
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,451
Call me if you get nervous.

580
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,162
I'll answer it even in the operating bed.

581
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,334
Okay.

582
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,629
You forgot one other thing.

583
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,630
What?

584
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,048
Take a seat.

585
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,553
You have to take an oath.

586
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,026
I, Shooter Bae I-ji,

587
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,821
will do my best

588
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,865
at my last Nationals.

589
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,786
As for Patient Ju Ga-ram…

590
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,584
he has done his best,
so don't worry about the players.

591
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,212
Just get through

592
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,297
the surgery well.

593
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,679
Hanyang.

594
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,682
Hanyang.

595
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,021
-Are you crying, Ga-ram?
-No, I'm not.

596
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,109
What? You can't cry yet.

597
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,654
-Why not?
-Ta-da.

598
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,656
What are those?

599
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,076
Do I need makeup? Do I look that bad?

600
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,955
What are you talking about?
You're nothing without your looks.

601
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,042
There is something

602
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,837
Player Ju Ga-ram has to do.

603
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,092
-Wait. What?
-Here.

604
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,845
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

605
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,682

Okay. You may be seated.

The principal will say
a few words of encouragement.

619

The result of this year's Nationals
will decide your future.

620
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,993
Stay focused.

621

Try to be the best.

622
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,540
And come back with a medal
around your neck.

623

Our goal is to win a gold medal
in every event.

The 15 teams, excluding us,

658
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:14,326
might consider our team
as the weakest team.

659
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:20,082
But I can guarantee you this.

660
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,627
Of the 16 teams,

661
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,172
we've put in the biggest effort.

662
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,258
You all know the saying.

663
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,762
"We learn from falling

664
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,683
because we learn to get back up."

665
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:42,979
You guys know…

666
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,358
how to get back up already.

667
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:51,947

"Meet at the final?"

672
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,718
Will he be there if we get to the final?

673
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:21,226
That must be why he didn't give me
the tactics against Daesang.

674
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,478
Let's…

675
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,357
go to the final.

676
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,444

We can do it!

00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,674
HANYANG RUGBY

711
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,510
OUR TEAM, OUR PRIDE

712
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,928
Long time no see.

713
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,346
Hope you'll win this time.

714
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,765
Hanyang High!

715
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,518
Hanyang High!

716
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,353
Hanyang High!

717
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,439
Hanyang High!

718
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,958
COACH

719
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,751
Coach will come, won't he?

720
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,298
There's a reason he didn't give us
the tactics against Daesang.

721
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,301
-You just wait.
-Yes. He said he'd come.

722
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,678
-He'll come.
-Yes.

723
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,223
COACH

724
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,434
HANYANG

725
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,444
Hanyang High Rugby Team.

726
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:23,945
Yes.

727
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,616
-A delivery for you.
-Thank you.

728
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,456
TO: HANYANG HIGH RUGBY TEAM
FROM: JU GA-RAM

729
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,373
YOON SEONG-JUN

730
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,624
What is it?

731
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,253
-What is it?
-What?

732
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,422
What is it?

733
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,929
TACTICS AGAINST DAESANG HIGH

734
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,558
I guess he can't make it.

735
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,143
Are we playing the final

736
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,937
without Coach Ju?

737
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:16,039
Hanyang High!

738
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:20,335
For the high school rugby division
of the 106th Nationals,

739
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,378
we only have the final match left.

740
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,424
Daesang High aims for two consecutive wins

741
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,928
while Hanyang High
has advanced to the final after 15 years.

742
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,724
Hanyang has come to the final
without their coach.

743
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,851
They're writing a miracle.

744
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,944
The players for both teams are coming in.

745
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,825
UNBEATABLE HANYANG RUGBY

746
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,833
-Go!
-Let's go!

747
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,632
2025 NATIONALS HIGH SCHOOL RUGBY FINAL
HANYANG 0 : 0 DAESANG

748
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,595
I guess Ga-ram is missing the final, too.

749
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,058
You should have played like this before.
I wouldn't have left then.

750
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,021
Thanks to you leaving us,
we've made it to the final.

751
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,315
-What?
-We'll toss the coin.

752
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,192
I'll pick the tiger.

753
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,695
Okay.

754
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,742
I'll run to bring the defense forward.

755
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,536
-Ung, you'll run around from behind.
-Okay.

756
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,580
-I'll run when I get the ball.
-Okay.

757
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,706
-Hey, forwards.
-Yes.

758
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,542
-We'll set up a line once Ung runs.
-Okay.

759
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,085
-Okay.
-Gather around.

760
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,006
-Pay attention to the play calls.
-Okay.

761
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,716
Keep doing what we've been doing. Okay?

762
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,217
-Okay.
-If Coach can't come,

763
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,760
we'll bring the trophy to him. Okay?

764
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,846
-Okay.
-Okay.

765
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,805
Okay, let's chant.

766
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,475
-Let's do this!
-Wait.

767
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,601
What?

768
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,437
-What for?
-Coach?

769
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,321
Wait a minute.

770
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,573
It's Coach Ju Ga-ram.

771
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,701
-It's Hanyang's coach, Ju Ga-ram.
-It's Coach.

772
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,370
Where is that?

773
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,831
-Coach.
-Coach?

774
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:29,172
Ju Ga-ram!

775
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:40,475
Ju Ga-ram!

776
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:01,871
Ju Ga-ram!

777
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,567
Coach Ju of Hanyang High!

778
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,903
He finally makes his appearance
at the final.

779
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:42,495
Ju Ga-ram!

780
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:22,827
I said

781
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,705
I'd meet you at the final.

782
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,732
EPILOGUE

783
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:06,537
KIM JU-YANG, SO MYEONG-U, OH YEONG-GWANG,
MUN UNG, YOON SEONG-JUN

784
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,128
WE'LL BECOME A MIRACLE

785
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,674
WE'LL BECOME A MIRACLE

786
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,387
HANYANG HIGH'S TACTICS

787
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,511
THE WINNING TRY

788
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,763
Why would a coach and his player
have a feud?

789
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,724
Do you think you can escape my shadow?

790
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,518
With one shot,
you can get at least a silver medal.

791
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,395
An inspection by the Office of Education.

792
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,647
-Who ordered it?
-That would be me.

793
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,191
-Take care of my boy.
-He's my boy now.

794
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,944
I have something to say.
But I need your permission.

795
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,988
It's big.
It needs stitches under anesthesia.

796
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,407
-Six players will play the second half.
-Coach!

797
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,286
Your legs will be shaky.
Every part of your body will hurt.

798
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:32,874
But if you get through this,
this moment will become our highlight.

799
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:33,916
Have we got this?

800
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,917
Hanyang!

801
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,919
-Hanyang! Let's go!
-Let's go!

802
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,678
