DAESANG 7 : 12 HANYANG

3
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,967
Hanyang High Rugby Team!

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,762
Back off!

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,597
Yes, nice.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,682
Run.

7
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,351
-Tackle him, Ung.
-Number 6 is coming for a tackle.

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,770
Break through, Tae-pung. Run!

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,979
Tackle him, Ung.

10
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,756
FIRST HALF
DAESANG 14 : 12 HANYANG

11
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,008
EPISODE 8

12
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,967
Good effort.

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,010
What happened?

14
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,054
Did you get a cramp?

15
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,098
Ms. Yang, could you please check on him?

16
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,351
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,354
Come here.

18
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,817
-Sit.
-That's not it.

19
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,032
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,284
I can't tackle.

21
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,543
Tell me, what exactly is it
that you can't do?

22
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,425
When they approach me,
I can quickly dodge,

23
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,718
and make a pass.

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,721
But I can't smash into them.

25
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,436
Ung, what are you talking about?

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,691
-How can you play when you can't tackle?
-You tackled me just fine, didn't you?

27
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,485
-He's just embarrassed.
-He's being shy.

28
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,362
-He's just nervous.
-Enough.

29
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,159
Every player has their own issue.

30
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,829
What matters is how well
the team can back him up.

31
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,416
We have to do that
to become a strong team.

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,003
What do we do now?

33
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,215
-Seok-bong, bring me the tactic board.
-Here.

34
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,304
We'll move Ung to the back on defense.
And use Seong-jun's speedâ€¦

35
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:04,601
THE WINNING TRY

36
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,935
HANYANG 12 : 14 DAESANG

37
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,730
-Number 3, Number 2, Number 1.
-Ung.

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,775
-As Coach Ju said, I'll be at the center.
-And Number 7.

39
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,235
Hey, Tae-pung.

40
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,195
-Hyeong-sik, you support.
-Yes, I got it.

41
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,788
Daesang.

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,709
Daesang for the win.

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,886
Go, Ung!

44
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,930
Run.

45
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,015
Keep running, Ung.

46
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,142
Keep going, Ung!

47
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,854
When they go after Ung,
the rest will back him up from behind.

48
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,066
Ung will play wide
and launch a counterattack.

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,361
Let's make the most of Ung's speed.

50
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,168
Let's go!

51
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,757
SECOND HALF
DAESANG 0 : 5 HANYANG

52
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,759
What a strong start.

53
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,888
-Ju-yang!
-Bring it home!

54
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,057
Yes, go in. Okay!

55
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,601
-Ung, go for it.
-Okay!

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,229
Yeong-gwang.

57
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,692
HANYANG 24 : 21 DAESANG

SECOND HALF
12 : 7

59
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,152
Drink some water first.

60
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,655
Are you all right?

61
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
Are you okay?

62
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,245
Is your knee all right?

63
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,248
Ju-yang.

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,749
-Yes.
-Hyeong-sik, you got this.

65
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,543
I can do this.

66
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,627
Hey, Daesang.

67
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,796
You idiots need to get it together!

68
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,673
We don't have much time left.

69
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,466
-Tae-pung.
-Yes, Coach.

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,509
You're out now.

71
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,052
No, I can play until the end.

72
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,597
Those Hanyang jerks gave it their all.
That's really all I expected from you.

73
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,017
They're beat and can barely stand.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,437
Let's score two more tries
and finish strong. Got it?

75
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,896
-Yes.
-Crush them.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,773
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

77
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,653
Look forward.

78
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,658
Go!

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,621
Daesang's foul. Hanyang's ball.

80
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,998
Hang in there, guys!

81
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,179
Guys, we're so close. Keep your head up.

82
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,056
-Myeong-u.
-Got it.

83
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,974
Okay?

84
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,476
Let's go!

85
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,728
Hyeong-sik.

86
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,647
You got this!

87
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,860
You can do it!

88
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,072
Hanyang High Rugby Team.

89
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,867
To the side!

90
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,914
-Damn it.
-Get him.

91
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,587
-Ung.
-Block him, Ung!

92
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,006
Ung!

93
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,592
Hurry up and stick it!

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,024
Block him! Run!

95
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,776
Get him quickly.

96
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,332

98
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,711

Those idiots.

99
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,308
Good job.

100
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,978
Well done.

101
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,022
-It's all right.
-Good job.

102
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,899

FIRST HALF 14 : 12
SECOND HALF 12 : 12

107
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,428
Seong-jun.

108
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,563
Are you upset?

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,566
Yes.

110
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,908
I'm upset too.

111
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,382
We still played well today.

112
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,802
We did really well.

113
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,392
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,896
We could have won.

115
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,274
It's all my fault.

116
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,777
Darn it.

117
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,113
Hey.

118
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,534
Daesang was the Nationals champion
last year.

119
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,371
We may not be the champions,
but we're just about in second place.

120
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,123
If you put it like that, we did well.

121
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,251
Even though we lost,

122
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,044
it feels like we won!

123
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,587
We used to be at the bottom.

124
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,298
We almost beat the top team,
which puts us in second!

125
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,842
Are those happy tears, Ju-yang?

126
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,052
Yes, they are!

127
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,430
You all did really well!

128
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,932
Well done, guys.

00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,309

No, I'm not.

-Only those two have someone to cheer for.
-Coach!

141
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,644

You said U-jin was in a slump.

You told me not to worry
because my girl will get first place.

00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,953
U-jin was struggling just a few days ago.

179
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,417
Even so, winning silver
is a big accomplishment, Mr. Na.

180
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,671
Daehan Sport University has only
one spot open for early admission.

181
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,342
Doesn't that mean
U-jin will take the spot?

182
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,053
There are shooting teams
at other schools too.

183
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,347
I'll find the perfect school
for Seol-hyeon--

184
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,806
Coach Jeon!

185
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,434
Are you trying to mess with me?

186
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,103
No, sir.

187
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,191
I'll find a way to secure the spot.

188
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,401
Geez.

189
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,445
Bye.

190
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,075
Darn it.

191
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,662
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

192
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,789
2025 PRESIDENTS CUP OVERALL RANKINGS
1. HANYANG HIGH

193
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,959
The results of the Presidents Cup
surpassed our expectations.

194
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,210
Good job, everyone.

195
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,420
-Well done.
-Well done.

196
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,341
Everyone did great,

197
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,718
but the Rugby Team got eliminated
in the first round.

198
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,721
You were an empty vessel
that made the most noise.

199
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,682
We still have the Nationals left.

200
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,225
Seriously.

201
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,727
What can we expect
after you flunked this one?

202
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,022
I'm dumbfounded by your shamelessness.

203
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,651
Shouldn't you say
you'll take responsibility and resign?

204
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,153
Do you plan to disband the team
after kicking me out?

205
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,324
With this result, the team
will be short on players next year anyway.

206
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,827
-The faster the better--
-Mark my words.

207
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:34,498
I promise we'll bring the champion trophy
from the National Sports Festival.

208
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,043
Good grief.

209
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,546
He's unbelievable.

210
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,301
Hello, this is Hanyang High.

211
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,220
Pardon?

212
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,557
-What is it?
-Okay. Please hold.

213
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,809
It's Myeongseong University's Rugby Team.

214
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,147
Their scout wants to watch
our Rugby Team's training.

215
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,107
-They're asking if it's okay.
-Pardon?

216
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,152
Why would they want to do that
all of a sudden?

217
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,865
Song Hyeon-jong, Yonhee's coach
and former Team Korea's coach,

218
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,784
watched our school's match.

219
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,539
The scouting report on our players
written by Coach Song

220
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,791
has become the talk of the town.

221
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,544
I'll read a bit of it.

222
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:25,382
"It's reckless to compete
in a seven-player game

223
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,759
with only seven players.

224
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,678
But in just 14 minutes
during the first and second halves,

225
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,598
that recklessness turned into excitement.

226
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:38,896
Number 7, Yoon Seong-jun, shines in both
game management and tactical execution.

227
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,400
He has proven his ability
to play various positions.

228
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,486
Number 6, Mun Ung.

229
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,280
His techniques still require finessing.

230
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,575
But his intrinsic speed and movements

231
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,455
remind me of the former ace of Team Korea,
Ju Ga-ram.

232
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,042
Once the current lineup
gains more experience,

233
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,921
we should keep an eye out for them
during the National Sports Festival."

234
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,694
That's great news.

235
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,737
-Congrats, Coach Ju.
-Really?

236
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,782
You were just talking about
disbanding their team.

237
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,701
Things are different now.

238
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,453
Why would we disband a team
with potential?

239
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,622
Let me see.

240
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,835
You need systematic training
to achieve good results.

241
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,214
Let's modify the timeslots
for the shared space.

242
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,012
AEROBICS: 0 POINTS
6TH PLACE AT MIXED EVENT

243
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,848
-Coach Bang.
-Me?

244
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,351
The Aerobics Team
didn't win any medals this time.

245
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,686
Vice Principal.

246
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,526
That's because we're still working
on perfecting our routine.

247
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,610
You know it too.

248
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,614
We should allocate your gym time
to the Rugby Team.

249
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,700
Pardon?

250
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,830
Let's begin the meeting.

251
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,916
Let's review our achievements.
The Shooting Team can start.

252
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
Vice Principal.

253
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:30,883
Our team is giving the gym time
to the Rugby Team just for today, right?

254
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,635
My players need to build muscle now.

255
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,554
We only have three days a week.

256
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,183
Without that, it'll be hard to prepare
for the competitions.

257
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,602
Your team hasn't achieved much this year.

258
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,022
So you got less funding
for the second semester.

259
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,816
I promise we'll fully recover
at the Nationals.

260
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,903
Aerobics has no professional teams.

261
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,073
Compared to rugby,
aerobics has fewer openings in colleges.

262
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,243
-Vice Principal.
-He must have a plan.

263
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,329
Okay? Stop complaining.

264
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,503
GYM

265
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,758
Hey.

266
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,762
How will you manage your training?

267
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,141
-What, are you trying to steal that too?
-Come on. Don't be like that.

268
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,853
-Hello.
-Hello.

269
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,314
-Hello.
-Hello.

270
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,610
Hey.

271
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,278
Practice your routine at the studio.

272
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,988
Okay. Let's go.

273
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,084
Coach Bang.

274
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,753
-Thank you.
-Seriously?

275
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,506
What?

276
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,592
Go ahead and start training.

277
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,594
Coach Bang!

278
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,179
Coach Bang.

279
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,100
Let's talk.

280
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,310
Heung-nam.

281
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,818
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,028
You are? Why?

283
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:20,659
Because of us, your team's training
isn't going according to plan.

284
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,369
That's what PE schools are like.

285
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,290
The winners get treated well and survive,
while the losers get pushed around.

286
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,500
But I'm sure that's news for you.

287
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,590
How come you never seem to fail?

288
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,884
How come life seems so easy for you?

289
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,429
I clench my teeth,
endure all the unfairness,

290
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,557
and force a smile. And for what?

291
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,393
Someone like you comes along
and takes the spot and all the credit.

292
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,938
Do you really think I have everything?

293
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,773
-Yes.
-You can't be serious.

294
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,610
-What seemed to be so easy for me?
-Rugby.

295
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,995
It wasn't easy.

296
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,582
Especially with rugby.

297
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,695
Did you really mean what you said
about the Rugby Team?

298
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,158
Your attitude changed so suddenly
that I couldn't understand your intention.

299
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,911
-Coach Jeon.
-Yes.

300
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,123
The evaluation for my promotion
is just around the corner.

301
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,001
That's why I need good results,

302
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,255
be it medals or college admissions.

303
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,925
The universities are interested
in our rugby players, aren't they?

304
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,969
So I'm supporting them.

305
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,138
-Is something wrong with that?
-Not at all.

306
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,685
Mr. Na gave me a call

307
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,230
regarding the early admission
for Daehan Sport University.

308
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,066
I see. He called you.

309
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,069
Are the chances low for Seol-hyeon?

310
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,030
The medal points matter the most
during the evaluation.

311
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,826
I've given it some thought.
First, the medal point.

312
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,911
U-jin has good academic records.

313
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,665
"He is a kick specialist.
A rare find in Korean rugby."

314
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,877
I didn't even kick that much.
How did he see my ability?

315
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,299
"He may be small for a forward,

316
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,843
but his sensible plays
are anything but small."

317
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,138
-Okay?
-So you're small.

318
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,807
He also praised Ung highly.

319
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,018
He said Ung reminded him
of rookie Ju Ga-ram.

320
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,644
Nice. He's a star rookie.

321
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,106
It also means we did a good job
backing someone who wasn't able to tackle.

322
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,608
-That's true.
-We spoon-fed him.

323
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,404
By the way, where is our superstar rookie?

324
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,155
What happened to you?

325
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,077
-Ung.
-Let's go, Ung.

326
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,579
-You can do it like this, right?
-Go!

327
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,289
You can do it, Ung. Good luck!

328
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,290
You can do it.

329
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,792
Yes. Go get it.

330
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,709
He's got it.

331
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,381
Again. Okay.

332
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,175
Come.

333
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,551
Go. Yes. That's it.

334
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,807
That's right. Go in.

335
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,643
Again.

336
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,061
-Yes.
-Geez.

337
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,773
-Don't give up.
-What are you doing?

338
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,233
Let's go.

339
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,866
Here.

340
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,912
I'm sorry.

341
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,664
You can be scared.

342
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,543
-I was also scared at first.
-Yes. I still am a bit.

343
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,171
You just need more training. Right, Coach?

344
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,757
Of course. Let's try it again.

345
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,176
-You can do it.
-Okay.

346
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,719
-Let's go.
-Once more.

347
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,720
You can do it.

348
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,098
-Keep going until you succeed.
-One more time.

349
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,558
Let's see this through!

350
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,935
Hello, Mr. Jeon.

351
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,895
-Did you eat lunch?
-Yes.

352
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,611
I told you to keep a 10-meter distance.

353
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,240
It's over 10 meters from here
to the end of the firing lane.

354
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,119
What kind of nonsense is that?
I won't let you in even if you do this.

355
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,954
Are the yips gone? I doubt it.

356
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,414
I'm trying.

357
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,292
Trying? Everybody is trying.
I'm trying too.

358
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,961
Everyone at this school is trying hard.

359
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,505
Bring me results.

360
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,439
You have a great record of medals.

361
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,691
Your academic records
are on the safe side too.

362
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,361
You only need recommendation letters
from the school and your coach.

363
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,571
Yes.

364
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,531
But do you reallyâ€¦

365
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,242
have to go to college?

366
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,620
-Pardon?
-No, nothing.

367
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,163
Get going.

368
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,590
2026 DAEHAN SPORT UNIVERSITY
EARLY APPLICATION, SEO U-JIN

369
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,308
2026 DAEHAN SPORT UNIVERSITY
EARLY APPLICATION, SEO U-JIN

370
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,943
You're still here, as expected.

371
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,612
The training hasn't ended yet.

372
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,281
You're a go-getter.
You're ridiculously diligent.

373
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,449
I've decided.

374
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:39,621
Since you have the yips,
I can't include you in shooting training.

375
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,792
I'm thinking about assigning you
a different task.

376
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,961
What would that be?

377
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,340
Write a letter of recommendation.
You were in charge of U-jin.

378
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,803
Since you coached her yourself,
you know her strengths best.

379
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,430
Is she applying
to Daehan Sport University?

380
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:02,143
-Well, are you going to do it?
-Yes, I'll do it right away.

381
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,283
-I need to write the medicine log.
-Do it all tomorrow.

382
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,371
You really are pouring your heart into it.

383
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,207
You're such a good coach.

384
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,752
Except for the fact that you can't shoot.

385
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,838
What?

386
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,592
Don't worry about the details,
just focus on your rehab.

387
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,261
Did you put down your gun for good?

388
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,347
I didn't put it down. It got taken away.

389
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,598
What do you mean?

390
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,933
Geez. You're distracting.

391
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,518
Go away. Quickly.

392
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,354
Do something else.
You've got a ton of work. Geez.

393
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,398
You're in my seat.

394
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,442
Let me finish this first.

395
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,662
Calm down, Rang-i.

396
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,830
As for Ung,

397
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,041
don't we need to fix his problem
with tackling first?

398
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,294
A scout's review is one thing.
In the end, we still lost.

399
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,504
Moreover, our weakness was exposed.

400
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,424
Next time, the opponents
will go after Ung relentlessly.

401
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,095
I do have an idea.

402
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,263
What is it?

403
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:25,810
Ung can't tackle
because he's afraid to hurt someone.

404
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,728
-Right.
-Exactly.

405
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:31,024
If he faced an opponent

406
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,779
stronger than an average person,
wouldn't that help him overcome his fear?

407
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,283
Is that the much stronger opponent
you mentioned?

408
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,994
My father's pride, Beom-i,

409
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,374
is a three-time winner
of the Cheongdo Bull Fight!

410
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,877
And this is Beom-i's grandson, Rang-i.

411
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,464
My father said he could never send Beom-i.

412
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,092
He's still a calf, but when he growsâ€¦

413
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,222
Why are you crying?

414
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,268
He's crying, calling for his mom.

415
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,979
He must be missing his mom.

416
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,690
-You're so inhumane.
-What?

417
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,401
How could we tackle such a cutie?

418
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,277
Look at his eyes.

419
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,988
He's a living being like you.
Can you tackle him?

420
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,118
Can you tackle that baby cow?
You're a terrible person.

421
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,203
-I didn't do anything.
-I thinkâ€¦

422
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,289
it's time for me to step up.

423
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,043
Ju-yang.

424
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,753
-Why did you bring--
-Private Mun.

425
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,755
From now on,

426
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,341
respond only with yes or no. Understood?

427
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,301
I mean, you have to tell me
what training--

428
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,344
Lie face down!

429
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,475
-Repeat after me. Lie on your back.
-On my back, sir.

430
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,311
Get ready for PT 8, Windshield Wipers.

431
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,273
What's PT 8?

432
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,401
On the left is "I can,"
and on the right is "do it." Understood?

433
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,403
-Yes!
-Begin.

434
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,531
I can do it.

435
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,158
-What's with him?
-Believe in yourself!

436
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,117
Where did he learn--

437
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,243
Good gracious.

438
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,663
Ju-yang's father, older brother,
and older sister all serve the country.

439
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,999
That's why he always wearsâ€¦

440
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,959
-I can do it.
-Rise!

441
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,588
Private Mun, enter the trench water now.

442
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,714
Move.

443
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,761
-Move.
-Move!

444
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,554
Step forward.

445
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,722
-Forward.
-Forward.

446
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,639
-Me?
-Yes.

447
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,187
Starting now, you need to break through
to get out of the trench.

448
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,272
Start escaping the trench!

449
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,789
What are you doing, Ung? Ram into us!

450
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,040
I can't do it.

451
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,667
Darn it.

452
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,087
Why can't you? Just do it like this!

453
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,423
We're ending this today.

454
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,467
Like this.

455
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,010
-Do it like this.
-Hey.

456
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,429
-Let's get in.
-Good grief.

457
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,556
-Let's go!
-Quit dodging and tackle.

458
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,058
Come on.

459
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,825
-How brazen.
-They're all troublemakers.

460
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,996
What is it?

461
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,003
Is it just me,
or is everyone staring at us?

462
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,297
What's going on?

463
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,800
-What are you looking at?
-I see it too.

464
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,926
Anyone have a phone?

465
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,010
I don't have mine.

466
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,388
To the rugby room.

467
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,223
Hey.

468
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,391
Come on, Ung.

469
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,647
HANYANG HIGH'S FIRST-YEAR MUN UNG
IS A BULLY

470
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,879
Isâ€¦

471
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,757
this true?

472
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,470
Were you not aware of this, Coach Ju?

473
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,223
I knew about it.

474
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,935
You should have taken action
to prevent this.

475
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,147
Take a look at this.

476
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,610
This is Ung's school report
and medical report.

477
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,405
MEDICAL REPORT

478
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,699
NEEDS 8 WEEKS TO HEAL

479
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,951
Ung had an injury
that took eight weeks to heal?

480
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,370
Will you believe me
if I say it's not true?

481
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,928
Yes.

482
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,388
I'll believe you.

483
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,231
I wasn't a bully.

484
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,864
Aren't you sick of getting beaten up, Ung?

485
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,825
We can have fun together.
Let's be friends.

486
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,746
You want me to mug
and bully others with you?

487
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,083
I don't do such things.

488
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,628
You must be crazy, you jerk.

489
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,214
Crush him.

490
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,635
Quit your gibberish.

491
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,886
Stop.

492
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,807
I was going to let you join us
because you can take a punch.

493
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,184
But enough is enough.

494
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,526
Should I ask your father to play with me
instead of you?

495
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,989
He can take punches as much as you can.
He's a former rugby player, right?

496
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,116
Is he not like his old self
now that he can't walk?

497
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,828
I'll go check that out for myself.

498
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,663
Stop!

499
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,540
-Let go. Go away.
-Hey.

500
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,461
-Get him.
-What the heck?

501
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,604
Hey.

502
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,150
Hey, Geon-chang. Dude, he's bleeding.

503
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,484
Is Geon-chang all right?

504
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,596
-Ms. Kang.
-Yes.

505
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,020
Geez.

506
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,692
A rumor like this
is critical for an athlete.

507
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,154
If word spreads that a person
who uses his body hurt someone,

508
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,490
no one will stand by him.

509
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,533
You have to solve this.

510
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,744
I know.

511
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,207
Should we make an official statement
from the school?

512
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,252
No, it'll only make things worse.

513
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,922
There's no proof for either side.

514
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,924
Butâ€¦

515
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,885
there's a bigger problem.

516
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,137
Ung's trauma?

517
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,515
Yes.

518
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,351
If he can't tackle,

519
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,521
he'll have no potential as a rugby player.

520
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:12,860
He has a severe fear of hurting someone
when tackling.

521
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,742
-I'm done with the letter.
-Good.

522
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,372
I wrote as much as I could
as you'll modify it.

523
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,501
The second and sixth paragraphs
are U-jin's crucial strengths,

524
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,628
so I really think you should include them.

525
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,213
Okay. Good job.

526
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,383
-May I go back to the shooting range now?
-No.

527
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,222
SHOOTING TEAM

528
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,613
-Hello.
-Hi.

529
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,159
Where are the others?
I don't see your coach, either.

530
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,703
They all asked to leave the school.

531
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,371
-Without me.
-All of them?

532
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,081
-Yes.
-That's perfect.

533
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,292
Do you know where my gun is?

534
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:13,045
I was told to give it back after 300 laps.
You still have 73 laps left.

535
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,757
I'll do the laps. Who says I won't?

536
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,261
-Geez.
-Want to go running together?

537
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,597
I need to warm up too.

538
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,645
Why are you so late?

539
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,606
I'm on time, dude.

540
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,608
You came early.

541
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,651
-The others are waiting.
-Who cares?

542
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,864
Is that him? Cho Geon-chang, the jerk?

543
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,327
Yes. We're at the right place.

544
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,413
-Let's go.
-Let's go and see who's the best.

545
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,166
Geez.

546
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,835
What's your plan, Captain?

547
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,091
My plan?

548
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,596
Don't tell me we came all the way here
without a plan.

549
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,805
Right?

550
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,226
What now?

551
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,395
Firstâ€¦

552
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,398
let's get rid of that.

553
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,317
What?

554
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,985
-What?
-Get rid of what?

555
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,862
-Which one?
-The red one.

556
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,157
I had no choice. Sorry, Mom.

557
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,792
Drift to the left. Turn right.

558
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,085
Raise the front wheel.

559
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,920
-Let's go.
-Get off.

560
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,713
-Okay.
-Seriously.

561
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,966
-Sorry.
-Let's go.

562
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,885
-I'm here.
-Let's go.

563
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,886
This is really heavy.

564
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,681
-Did you leave it?
-Of course.

565
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,015
IF YOU WANT YOUR BIKEâ€¦

566
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,225
It's so heavy.

567
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,601
Is this the latest model?

568
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,272
NO REVERSE PARKING
UISAN BUILDING

569
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,565
-Calm down.
-Hey, they're here.

570
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,860
Just four? Strength in numbersâ€¦

571
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,113
There's more.

572
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,246
Did you do this?

573
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,290
IT'S AT UISAN BUILDING'S BACK ALLEY

574
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,750
If there's even a scratch, I'll crush you.

575
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,628
Are you Cho Geon-chang of Yongcheon High?

576
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,547
Who are you?

577
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
We areâ€¦

578
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,844
Hanyang High's Rugby Team. Why?

579
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,098
I see.
Did Ung, that scaredy-cat, send you?

580
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,851
Did he ask you to beg me
to delete the post?

581
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,561
What would it take to delete it?

582
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,063
We need Ung.

583
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,524
We can't lose a player
because of your lie.

584
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,608
My lie?

585
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,029
Did he say he got beaten up
without hitting back?

586
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,448
That's not true.

587
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,491
You guys were the ones bullying him.

588
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,036
That was an accident in self-defense.

589
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,079
Do you have any evidence?

590
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,706
-No, that's--
-Yeong-gwang.

591
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,671
Just delete it. I'll do anything.

592
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,881
Anything?

593
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,175
Isn't he Yoon Seok-jun?

594
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,052
Doesn't he have a twin?

595
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,847
In that case, kneel down.

596
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,890
What?

597
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,226
You're Seok-jun's twin brother,
aren't you?

598
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,521
Ung, that jerk, ran off behind my back.

599
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,650
I only did it to get him back.
If you kneel down and beg, I'll let it go.

600
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,861
It's better than nothing.

601
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,741
Enough with the nonsense.
Let's see some blood.

602
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,618
Hey, bring it on.

603
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,411
Darn it.

604
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,042
-Captain.
-Hey.

605
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,293
-Captain.
-Seong-jun.

606
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,711
Seong-jun.

607
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,260
Please, take down the post.

608
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,640
A superstar is on his knees before me.

609
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,267
Let's take a photo to celebrate it.

610
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,521
-Are you out of your mind?
-Don't touch me.

611
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,980
-Hey!
-Hands off.

612
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,857
-Do you want to die?
-Myeong-u!

613
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,446
Step back.

614
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,073
Move away, dudes.

615
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,449
What is this pink sausage?

616
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,088
Did you get it?

617
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,591
If I say I took it with Seok-jun,
it'll work wonders with the girls.

618
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,885
-That's awesome.
-It'll definitely work.

619
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,886
Delete the post.

620
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,931
Okay. Don't you trust me?
I'll delete it back home.

621
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,318
Do it here.

622
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,501
Can I get my pistol back now?

623
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,380
I can't stand up
because my legs are shaking.

624
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,756
Liar!

625
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,134
Did you learn that from Ga-ram too?

626
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,140
How is your tackling practice going?

627
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,602
How did you know?

628
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,608
I've watched Ga-ram play rugby
for 15 years.

629
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,862
It's not going well.

630
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,448
Could I have the yips too?

631
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,159
Do you think the yips happen to everyone?

632
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,704
The yips are when a talented person
suddenly can't play.

633
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,165
You're not even at the level
to have the yips.

634
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,958
Don't even worry about it.

635
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,756
That's strangely comforting.

636
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,800
Enough to give my gun back?

637
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,930
Good luck!

638
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,682
I'll get going.

639
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,233
Seriously.

640
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,819
LEAP TOWARD YOUR DREAMS

641
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,710
Rugby Team.

642
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,421
Keep to one side.

643
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,257
We can't do that now

644
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,842
-because we just came back from a victory.
-Excuse us.

645
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,556
TEACHERS' ROOM

646
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,227
HANYANG HIGH

647
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,771
The alleged victim
deleted the post himself.

648
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,772
POST NOT FOUND

649
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,316
And something like this
won't ever happen again.

650
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,110
-No, it won't.
-That's good to hear.

651
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,321
Aren't you supposed to be working out
at the gym right now?

652
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,744
-Coach Bang.
-Yes.

653
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,788
Didn't I say to give the gym to them?

654
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,711
Go and train.
You'll get stiff after a day off.

655
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,628
-Okay.
-Okay.

656
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,755
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

657
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,007
Let's go.

658
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,561
Don't you think this is unfair,
Vice Principal?

659
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,687
What is?

660
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,358
I've stayed loyal to you all this time,
but now you're turning your back on me.

661
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,402
"Stayed loyal?"

662
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,695
That's not it.

663
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,531
I gave you a contract.

664
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,867
On what condition?

665
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,286
A definitive outcome, right?

666
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,788
That's why my team is doing our best.

667
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,374
Doing your best doesn't matter.
I want results.

668
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,170
Has your team won any medals?

669
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,216
Your contract ends next February,
doesn't it?

670
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,510
We haven't talked about renewing it yet.

671
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:04,141
I really hope we can work together
next year as well.

672
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,829
One million and twenty-seven.
Feel the burn.

673
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,499
One million and twenty-nine.

674
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,917
One million and twentyâ€¦

675
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,961
Hello, Coach.

676
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,089
-Hello.
-Hello.

677
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,757
Hello.

678
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,134
Gather around.

679
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,678
-Okay.
-Okay.

680
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,481
Is it true that you met with the person
who bullied Ung?

681
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,694
We went there and fixed the problem
once and for all.

682
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,072
Who told you to do something so dangerousâ€¦

683
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,075
without even telling me?

684
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,996
Coach.

685
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:12,251
-We just wanted to help--
-Everyone,

686
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,836
stop what you're doing,

687
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,213
and meet me at the field.

688
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,264
Did you think I couldn't solve it?

689
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,225
Is that why you stepped in?

690
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,518
No, sir.

691
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:34,022
Then why did you do that
after saying you were going home?

692
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,401
We were just worried
that we couldn't play rugby as a team.

693
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,738
Did you think you'd be forgiven
if you said it was for rugby?

694
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,783
-Sorry.
-All right.

695
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,869
I forgive you.

696
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:51,290
You all tried to solve the issue
yourselves, risking danger.

697
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:55,043
I didn't do anything as a coach,
so I deserve to be punished.

698
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,256
Starting now, we'll practice tackles.

699
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,843
You'll tackle me one at a time,
and I'll take the hits.

700
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,720
-Coach.
-Coach.

701
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,681
What are you doing? Get in line.

702
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,058
-We should listen to him.
-Okay.

703
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,608
Aren't you part of the team, Mun Ung?

704
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,491
Start with Seong-jun.

705
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,826
Go.

706
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,373
What are you doing?

707
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,000
Are you mocking me?

708
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,045
Listen up! Do it properly.

709
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,296
Yes, sir.

710
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,964
Myeong-u.

711
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,763
That was a tackle? Next.

712
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,681
Next.

713
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,517
Keep your eyes open.

714
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,482
And you call yourself a prop?

715
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,109
Mun Ung.

716
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,373
What are you doing?

717
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,543
Aren't you going to get it together?

718
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:22,422
Your teammates took risks for you,
yet you can't even tackle properly?

719
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,390
Look. Look at your teammates!

720
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,687
If you avoid tackling out of fear,
your teammates end up getting hurt.

721
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,231
Is that okay? Is that not scary?

722
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,775
It's scary.

723
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,151
Next.

724
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,357
Are youâ€¦

725
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,652
Ung's father?

726
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,988
Yes, and you are?

727
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,283
I'm the principal
of Hanyang Physical Education High School.

728
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,701
Goodness. Hello.

729
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,370
I know it's a little late,
but please look after Ung.

730
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,955
What brings you here?

731
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,542
I came because I was worried
after getting Coach Ju's call.

732
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,129
It looks like everyone
is having a hard time because of Ung.

733
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,964
Next.

734
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,883
You can do it. Let's go.

735
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:48,925
-Ung.
-Ung.

736
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,843
Go!

737
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,571
If you can't do it today,

738
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,949
your rugby ends here.

739
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,826
You hear me?

740
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,746
-Do you hear me?
-I'm scared!

741
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,630
I honestly thought he was going to die.

742
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,719
If I hurt someone againâ€¦

743
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,892
How dare you think that you can hurt me?

744
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:42,688
Are you mocking me
because I doped and got expelled?

745
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,528
-No, that's not it.
-Quit it!

746
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:56,827
Father.

747
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,163
If you can't do it after all this,
this isn't for you.

748
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,957
Let's go.

749
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,084
You should stop too.

750
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,340
-I'm not going.
-Mun Ung!

751
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,967
-I said I'm not going!
-Mun Ung.

752
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:16,054
We can't have a player
who can't tackle on our Rugby Team.

753
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,896
Go back home.

754
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,274
Coach.

755
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,984
Next.

756
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,614
Next!

757
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,033
Coach.

758
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,453
-I can do it.
-Next!

759
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,579
-Coach!
-Ung.

760
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,375
I can do it, Coach!

761
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,378
-Coach!
-Next!

762
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,547
I can do it!

763
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,145
-Ung.
-Coach.

764
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,396
-Coach.
-Coach.

765
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,942
I'm still alive, guys.

766
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,781
Ung.

767
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,665
Congratulations.

768
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,959
At last,

769
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,546
you've become a rugby player.

770
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,059
Well done.

771
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,086
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
FOR NA SEOL-HYEON

772
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,136
2026 DAEHAN SPORT UNIVERSITY
EARLY APPLICATION

773
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,265
Seol-hyeon, wake up.

774
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,393
What? Why?

775
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,396
Are you applying
for Daehan's early admission?

776
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,397
I don't know.

777
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,482
Coach Jeon told me to.

778
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,278
Geez. I was just dreaming about Seong-jun.

779
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:39,114
But do you really have to go to college?

780
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,039
Good job today.

781
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,750
Okay. You're dismissed.

782
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,378
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

783
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,588
Water for you, Coach.

784
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,785
JU GA-RAM

785
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,013
-You're here.
-Bang Heung-nam.

786
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,022
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

787
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,273
What's the meaning of this?

788
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,233
Where did you get that?

789
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,153
Why is it for Seol-hyeon, not me?

790
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,074
I have better competition results
and academic records.

791
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,328
A coach has the authority
to recommend a player.

792
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:15,543
I took several aspects into consideration,
including diligence and attitudeâ€¦

793
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,131
and decided to recommend Na Seol-hyeon.

794
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,929
I've always shown up for training
and have never argued with my teammates.

795
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,847
You don't listen to your coach.

796
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,642
Are you a good player
just because you've won some medals?

797
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,435
No, attitude counts.

798
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,896
That attitude of yours is the issue.

799
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,232
You can't shoot for long
with that attitude.

800
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,484
Stop making excuses.

801
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:41,987
Excuses?

802
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,073
I don't care about the politics you play.

803
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,078
You can brownnose to Seol-hyeon's dad
as much as you like, butâ€¦

804
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,083
-admission fraud is unacceptable.
-How dare you say that?

805
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,671
Don't test me, you stuck-up brat.

806
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,843
-Just prepare for the regular admission.
-I don't want to.

807
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,138
I'll report your admission fraud

808
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:13,268
to the Association
and the Office of Education.

809
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,230
You little prick.

810
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,650
What are you doing right now?

811
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,943
Let go.

812
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,321
Let go, or you'll get hurt.

813
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,990
Let go of it.

814
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,324
Let go!

815
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,090
Didn't I say you'd get hurt?

816
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,386
What are you doing?

817
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,559
She's driving me nuts.

818
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,936
You're going to report me?

819
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:01,024
I'm curious whose side
the Association will be on. Do it.

820
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,068
-Stop being a crybaby. Get up.
-Back off.

821
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,737
It's not like that. She fell on her own.
Let go.

822
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,323
That drama queen. Let go of me.
She's exaggerating.

823
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,116
Damn it. Why are you being so dramatic?

824
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,452
Damn it.

825
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:16,372
U-jin, you better be careful
with your words.

826
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,708
You're really going to get hurt.

827
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,878
-Do you think your mom's got your back?
-I told you to stay away!

828
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,888
Have you gone crazy?

829
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,104
You have to be kidding me.
You have the yips. You can't shoot.

830
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,648
Seo U-jin.

831
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,568
What are you planning to do?

832
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,827
Do you want to be a shooter or not?

833
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,761
If you do, keep it under the covers.
Now get up.

834
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,941
Stay away from U-jin.

835
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,004
THE WINNING TRY

836
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,297
EPILOGUE

837
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,631
Guys.

838
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,092
Go ahead and wrap it up.

839
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,510
Seong-jun, you're in charge.

840
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,846
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job, everyone.

841
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,483
NURSE'S OFFICE

842
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,329
Are you all right?

843
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,998
Look at you go.

844
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,963
Thanks for the compliment.

845
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,674
So are you all right?

846
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,760
Well, I took my medicine.

847
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,429
And you're here worrying about me.

848
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,641
It can't get any better than this.

849
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,979
When are you going to give my pistol back?

850
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,411
When you have to shoot.

851
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,040
When, despite the dangerâ€¦

852
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,086
and pressure, you have to take the shot.

853
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,172
That's whenâ€¦

854
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,218
I'll give it back to you.

855
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,109
SPECIAL THANKS TO KANG SHIN-IL

856
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,136
THE WINNING TRY

857
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,679
Word is you guys had a fist fight.

858
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,265
We'll be switching coaches
between the teams.

859
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,269
We can't keep training like this.
Let's find a solution.

860
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,521
What kind of a lousy job is this?

861
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,899
If it affects my promotion
even in the slightest, you'll be sorry.

862
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:15,194
If he likes you, you could skip college
and go straight to the pros.

863
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,530
There's no place for me here.

864
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,115
You have what they don't have.

865
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,491
-What?
-Me.

866
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,745
-Get on my back.
-What?

867
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,288
-Hurry.
-What are you two doing?

868
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,832
Am I a joke to you?
What are you and U-jin hiding?

869
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,543
U-jin is missing. She even left her phone.
