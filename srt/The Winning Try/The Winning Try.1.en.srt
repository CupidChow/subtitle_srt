00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,971
<i>We're here at Asiad Stadium,</i>
<i>where the final match</i>

5
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>of the Asian Rugby Cup is taking place.</i>

6
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>For the first time in 12 years,</i>
<i>Team Korea has made it to the finals</i>

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,312
<i>and is now hoping to win</i>
<i>the championship against Japan.</i>

8
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,024
<i>Although we are against Japan,</i>
<i>the best team in Asia,</i>

9
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>Team Korea still has a strong chance.</i>
<i>Right?</i>

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,905
<i>Of course. Team Korea has</i>
<i>their star athlete, Ju Ga-ram.</i>

11
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>He has scored more than half</i>
<i>of the team's points in this competition</i>

12
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>and has shown peak performance.</i>

13
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,454

00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,026
<i>And now, Team Korea</i>
<i>is making their entrance.</i>

21
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>Leading the way is Ju Ga-ram, Korea's ace.</i>

22
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,299
<i>This match decides</i>
<i>the team's Olympic qualification,</i>

23
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,051
so it is a very important game.

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,721
Mr. Park, will you explain rugby
for those who are new to it?

25
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,891
You can see a rugby post
and a goal line at each end.

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,601
In rugby, you run with the ball,

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,437
pass the goal line, and ground the ball
to score a try.

28
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,357
Remember this,
and you'll enjoy rugby even more.

29
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>It's a tense moment.</i>

30
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,698
<i>Team Korea prepares for a kick-off.</i>

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,874
<i>And the game kicks off.</i>

32
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,751
<i>It's Korea versus Japan.</i>
<i>Japan versus Korea.</i>

33
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,837

00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>Only 57 seconds left.</i>

36
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,763
<i>Team Korea has enough time</i>
<i>for one last play.</i>

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,390
<i>They need to make it count.</i>

38
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,605
<i>Ju Ga-ram has the ball.</i>

39
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,607
<i>He rushes forward. Run!</i>
<i>Here he goes.</i>

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,735
<i>Ju Ga-ram!</i>

41
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,236
<i>Outstanding!</i>

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,362
<i>He's going for it.</i>

43
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,406
<i>Ju Ga-ram! He's fast. He outruns them.</i>

44
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>Ju Ga-ram's still going.</i>

45
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>He's about to score.</i>

46
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,660
<i>Finally, Ju Ga-ram…</i>

47
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,622
<i>Ju Ga-ram did it!</i>

48
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,416
<i>Team Korea wins!</i>

49
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,834
<i>We won!</i>

50
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,295
<i>Ju Ga-ram has done it!</i>

51
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,131
<i>Hurray for Korea!</i>

52
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,132
<i>They crushed Japan.</i>

53
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,969

<i>has forfeited his gold medal…</i>

57
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,991
<i>The national rugby player, Ju Ga-ram,</i>
<i>is causing a stir with news</i>

58
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,453
<i>that he used an illegal substance</i>

…is over 40 million won.

66
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,822
And the result of that investment
was 25 losses, no wins, and one draw.

67
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:45,076
In the end, none of this year's graduates
were accepted into a works team,

68
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,619
let alone a pro team.

69
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,663

00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,131
I was just passing by.

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,717
I didn't see you down there.

88
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,054
Tiny bastard.

89
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,600
Say that again, motherfucker.

90
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,727
What did you say, you piece of shit?

91
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,480
- Calm down.
- Come here, you fucking bitch.

00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,857
- He's full of bullshit.
<i>- He has anger issues.</i>

00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,618
- This is an expensive camera.
- So?

105
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,287
What if it broke?

106
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,665
- That was crazy.
<i>- He seems</i>

<i>But what can he do all by himself?</i>

120
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,893
Sir, rugby is a seven-player sport.

121
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,687
You've only mentioned six.
You have one left.

122
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,105
Who did I miss?

123
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,565
Pyo Seon-ho, a second-year.

00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,319

PYO SEON-HO, SECOND-YEAR

00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,206
Wait for me.

128
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
He doesn't ring a bell.

129
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,713
They don't even have a coach now.

130
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,509
The second semester is around the corner,
yet we're still missing a coach.

131
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,386
Are you suggesting
getting rid of the Rugby Team?

132
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,680
That would be more rational.

133
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,683
For you, it might be.

134
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,435
Did the players consent to it?

135
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,230
Why do we need their consent
at this point?

136
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,733
We can offer a different path to everyone.

137
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,278
Are there any teams that need an athlete?

138
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,323
Well…

139
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,699
I don't think so.

00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,661
JEON NAK-GYUN
HEAD SHOOTING COACH

141
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,289
They can't shoot or draw bows now,
can they?

142
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,959
The basic sports teams
will have to take them.

143
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,044
Maybe swimming and weightlifting?

144
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,339
The Track and Field Team should take them.

145
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,468
What? Do you think
we're a recycling center for trash?

146
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,719
No thank you.

147
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,348
Even if someone were to take them,
they'd only cause trouble and headaches.

BANG HEUNG-NAM,
AEROBICS COACH

149
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,270
We can just give basic job training
to the third-years.

150
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,064
Why don't we transfer the rest
to another school?

151
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,190
That could work.

152
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,987
What's there to think about?
They don't even have a coach.

153
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,990
Where is your coach?

154
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,659
<i>He's on sick leave.</i>

KIM MIN-JUNG, FORMER RUGBY COACH

156
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,789
This is a practice game,
so we can manage without our coach.

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,042
How can you play without a coach?

158
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,838
Who will be responsible
if there's an accident? I can't do this.

159
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,172
- Everyone, go back.
- Sir.

160
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,384
We got our school's permission.

161
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,969
I don't care. Get your coach.

162
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,805
Where is Coach Kim Min-jung?

163
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
Probably in the hospital.

164
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,726
You should have brought a substitute!

165
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,149
How are you going to train them
without a coach next semester?

166
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,152
Are you going to do it yourself?

167
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,117
We do…

168
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,203
have a coach.

00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,275
No outsiders.

173
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,862
I've come here today
as a coach for the rugby…

174
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,907
It's you! The judo player!

175
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,659
What was your name again?

176
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,535
Right! Lee Chang-yong.

177
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,037
Hey, don't you remember me?

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,455
I'm Ju Ga-ram, the rugby player.

179
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,790
It's nice to see you again.

180
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,543
If you're a visitor,
tell me who you're here to see.

181
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,171
I need to confirm with them
before I let you through.

182
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,090
Come on. We're friends.

183
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,052
I'll call the police if you keep this up.

184
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,970
Call the police, then.

185
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,890
Call them.

186
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,783
Chang-yong!

187
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,623
Excuse me!

188
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,959
Coming through.

189
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,307
Hey! Stop!

190
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,351
Stop right there, you!

191
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,480
Excuse me!

192
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,465
Darn it. Where'd he go?

193
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,509
- Ju Ga-ram!
- Hey!

194
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,678
You do know my name.

195
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,930
Man, I'll get you for this.

196
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,766
It's good to see you again, my friend!

197
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,185
<i>What do you mean?</i>

198
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,854
There wasn't a single applicant
by yesterday's deadline.

199
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,771
Who is it?

200
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,983
I'm here.

201
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,491
Say hello to Coach Ju Ga-ram.

202
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,451
- You're…
- Hello.

203
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,994
- Hey, Heung-nam.
- Ju Ga-ram?

204
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,332
Choking was my specialty, jerk.

205
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,292
Chang-yong, hey. Ma'am, help.

206
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,211
Anyone?

207
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,005
Come here, you jerk.

208
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,968
Is that who I think it is?

209
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,720
Yes, you're right.

210
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,557
The proud alumnus of this school
and the idol of Korean rugby…

211
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,392
How ridiculous.

212
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,479
Come on.

213
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,983
How can we hire someone
with a doping scandal? He's a disgrace!

214
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,528
Exactly. He was even expelled
from the union.

215
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,905
He was expelled as an athlete.

216
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,366
He's still qualified to be a coach.

217
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,952
He is certified.
There are no legal issues.

218
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,121
Being legal doesn't mean it's okay.

219
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,083
Anyway, I can't agree to this.

220
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,087
You know,

221
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,716
I don't need your agreement.

222
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,358
Right, I should get that.

223
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,737
This is the teachers' room.

224
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,699
Pardon?

225
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,534
What is it?!

226
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,120
It's the rugby stadium.

227
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,085
Let's hurry up and go.

228
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,673
Sir.

229
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,341
The coach is… I mean

230
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,385
an instructor is on their way.

231
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,721
Can you wait a little longer?

232
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,767
It's been over an hour since we warmed up.
How much more do we have to wait?

233
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,895
Go.

234
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,062
Why don't we start first--

235
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,607
No coach, no match. Go away.

236
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,233
Let's start the match!

237
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,958
Hanyang.

238
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,755
Look who's here.

239
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,007
He looks familiar.

240
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,426
- Who's that?
- What about Coach Kim?

241
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,594
I don't know.

242
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,221
Ju Ga-ram…

243
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,950
Nice to meet you.

244
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,081
A new coach?

245
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,958
What about Coach Kim?

246
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,795
Mr. Kim went to coach
Daesang High School's rugby team.

247
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,254
Say hello.

248
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,924
Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Ju Ga-ram.

249
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,762
Hey, Captain.

250
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,556
Nice to meet you.

251
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,606
Are you <i>that</i> Ju Ga-ram?

252
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,403
Yes, that's me.

253
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,364
The six-time Player of the Year.

254
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,658
The MVP of the Asian Rugby Cup.

255
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,284
The Asian Games medalist.

256
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,036
I'm a man of many titles.

257
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,330
What about "a juicer who got expelled"?

258
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,921
That's a famous one too.

259
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,640
No back-up players?
You all have to play full-time.

260
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,683
Anyone sick today?

261
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,395
Okay. And no one is injured.

262
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,689
Let's see how we work as a team.

263
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,815
What are you doing?

264
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,945
You said you wanted to play.

265
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,282
You called,
saying you need a coach to play.

266
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,659
So here I am.

267
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,292
The coach is here. How much longer
do we have to wait for you guys?

268
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,835
Right. We're ready.

269
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,216
Okay. Is the chant still the same?
Shall we, then?

270
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,843
Get ready.

271
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,720
Go!

272
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,431
- Hanyang!
- Hanyang!

273
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,938
We'll accept the disqualification
for not having a coach. I'm sorry.

274
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,531
Thank you.

275
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,806
HANYANG RUGBY

276
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,538
HANYANG'S ACE
JU GA-RAM

277
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,935
TEAMMATES ALWAYS STAND BY YOU

278
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,524
HANYANG RUGBY TEAM

279
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,830
Gosh, I should throw this away.

280
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,333
That won't solve the problem.

281
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,836
The kids hate me so much.

282
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,546
You deserve it, though.

283
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,300
Then why did you ask me to come?

284
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,094
Did you see how they treated me?

285
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
Back in the day,

286
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:45,017
the coach's words were the law,
religion, and revelation.

287
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,983
Ga-ram, what's going on?

288
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,485
Doctor, what happened?

289
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,488
He has severe Myasthenia Gravis.

290
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:03,368
The last check-up showed
reduced mobility in his arms and legs.

291
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,454
This time, his respiratory system
is paralyzed.

292
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,877
That only applies to a normal coach.

293
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,378
To them,

294
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,631
you're just a juicer and a retired player.

295
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,882
You're so harsh.

296
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,553
Accept the truth.

297
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,556
But don't get discouraged yet.

298
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,226
You still have miles to go.

299
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,019
What if I get shot?

300
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,993
BAE I-JI
SHOOTING PLAYER-COACH

301
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,329
POINT: 9.8

302
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,376
Nice shot, Coach Bae.

303
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,170
Go easy or you'll hurt your shoulder.

304
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,880
I'm done.

305
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,968
Isn't it restocking day
for the nurse's office?

306
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,470
I've organized them already.

307
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,890
Do you want some?

308
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,350
YANG SEUNG-HUI
SCHOOL NURSE

309
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,019
The tryouts are less than a month away,
so I'm on a diet.

310
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,729
- I-ji.
- I know.

311
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,941
Being an athlete at my age
is selfish of me.

312
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,278
But what can I do?
I just can't seem to let go.

313
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,281
Do you also have a hard time
getting over people?

314
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,659
You know, like from your past,
like an ex-boyfriend?

315
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,995
What was his name again?

316
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,999
You broke up with Ga-ram long ago.

317
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,919
If you beat the odds and run into him--

318
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,045
I'll kill him.

319
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,797
I see.

320
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,925
I mean it.

321
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,553
I will kill him.

322
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,358
Outsiders aren't allowed
in the Shooting Team's room.

323
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,792
Ju Ga-ram?

324
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,212
I guess I'm an outsider.

325
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,505
I saw that the lights were on.

326
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,382
Just as I expected, you were here.

327
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,927
You're the only player
who'd practice this late.

328
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,471
So how's the training going?

329
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,850
Did you shoot a lot?

330
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,144
Oh, Lord. I said I wanted to run into him

331
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,855
when I had a gun in my hand.

332
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,732
Is this the best you could do?

333
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,074
If you pray like that,
even God would get scared.

334
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,996
Crap.

335
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,459
The Shooting Team has become much fancier.

336
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,087
Our Rugby Team looks
just like it did 20 years ago.

337
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,091
You even have electronic targets.

338
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,550
More firing points too.

339
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,551
ARMORY

340
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,552
How cool.

341
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,597
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

342
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,565
The national tryouts are in 30 days.

343
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,361
So you're a player-coach now
who trains alone at night.

344
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,031
Right. It'd be awkward to train
with your students.

345
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,828
You're still an active player,
and now you're even coaching.

346
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,852
You bastard.

347
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,729
Aren't shooters forbidden
from pointing a gun at people?

348
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,148
You're no human, you asshole.

349
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,358
Come on. Don't curse at me.

350
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,530
That's your fake gun
for practicing your posture.

351
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,491
Right? I've been the boyfriend
of a shooter for years.

352
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,287
I can tell a real one from a fake one.

353
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,081
You're not my boyfriend,
you're my ex, jerk!

354
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,834
You ghosted me for three years
without a single word.

355
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,086
What? "How have you been?" Really?

356
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,510
Technically, since I didn't ask
to break up,

357
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,262
aren't I still your boyfriend?

358
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,934
Even if it gets me expelled
from the association,

359
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,728
I will kill you.

360
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,567
I-ji.

361
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,778
It's been a while.

362
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,453
I'm not running away.

363
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,872
With the tryouts coming up soon,

364
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,082
I'm helping you avoid getting expelled.

365
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,298
TEACHER
SHOOTING COACH, BAE I-JI

366
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,843
That asshole, that crazy bastard!

367
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,263
Who? Are you talking to me?

368
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,185
Sir.

369
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,356
What's with all the BBs?

370
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,776
I allowed you to train alone.
Can you keep it low-key?

371
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,653
Sorry.

372
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,030
Geez, I-ji.

373
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,281
Gosh.

374
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,534
I'm telling you, you should retire
before you humiliate yourself even more.

375
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,246
Frankly, you can't even shoot
as well as U-jin.

376
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,706
Would holding onto it longer

377
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,791
make any…

378
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,292
No, never mind.

379
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,587
Since the armory's open,
go clean U-jin's and Seol-hyeon's guns.

380
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,130
The rule is that everyone

381
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,883
cleans their own gun.

382
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,969
They don't have time for that.

383
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,472
If you lack coaching skills,
this is the least you can do.

384
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,683
That's what being a coach means.

385
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,436
Anyway, a professor
from Daehan Sport University is coming by.

386
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,398
I'm off to have a drink.
Come and drive me home later.

387
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,275
I'll call you.

388
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,236
Geez.

389
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,096
A man should endure it.

390
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,515
Geez, that hurts.

391
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,695
ROOM 304

392
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,281
- What is it?
- Hyeong-sik.

393
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,788
Seong-jun.

394
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,457
Can you try calling Coach Kim?

395
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,001
I already did.

396
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,005
- What did he say?
- He didn't pick up.

397
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:12,922
Darn it.

398
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,550
I had planned so much content
to shoot with him.

399
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,427
I have to replan…

400
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,805
Wait. "Ju Ga-ram returns as a coach."

401
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,599
That's bitching clickbait.

402
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,435
- Two million views? Ten million?
- Seriously?

403
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,065
Why do you always yell at me?

404
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,692
He's just lashing out at you
because his life is falling apart.

405
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,362
Hey, watch your mouth. Seriously.

406
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,531
- What, are you going to hit me?
- Here they go again.

407
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,078
Just because we don't have Coach Kim
doesn't mean our lives are over.

408
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,164
- Right?
- Because Ju Ga-ram was expelled,

409
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,918
he can't write recommendation letters
or promote us to the pro teams.

410
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,919
Really?

411
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,045
Then what happens to us?

412
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,506
What do you think?
It's every man for himself.

413
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,592
Captain, what do we do now?

414
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,889
Go and gather the others.

415
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,725
Hurry.

416
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,607
Yeah, go lead the way.

417
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,775
Hurry up.

418
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,652
Hello. Good morning.

419
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,653
Hello.

420
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,863
Hello.

421
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,948
Is everyone here?

422
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,032
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

423
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,951
Stand in a straight line.

424
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,120
RUGBY

425
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,665
Hey, U-jin is here too.

426
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,624
You should say hello.

427
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,626
Shut up, will you?

428
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,128
Did you have <i>ramyeon?</i>

429
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,798
You should cut back. You look bloated.

430
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,095
SEO U-JIN
SHOOTING TEAM'S CAPTAIN

NA SEOL-HYEON

432
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,520
Good morning.

433
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,730
DREAM BIG AT HANYANG HIGH

434
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,107
- Good morning, sir.
- Hello.

435
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,194
That was boiling hot.

436
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,197
The alcohol is finally wearing off.

437
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,826
I heard you met with someone
from Daehan Sport University.

438
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,745
Did you ask him to look over our…

439
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,621
Hey, Heung-nam.

440
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,582
I'm not the one asking favors.

441
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,001
"Please send us some good players."

442
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,086
- That's what he said.
- I knew it.

443
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,589
Can you put in a good word
for our Aerobics Team…

444
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,217
Got more? Get me another.

445
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,053
Another one? Okay.

446
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,805
Hello.

447
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,141
Hi.

448
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,893
- Hello.
- Never mind.

449
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,269
- I'll have that.
- Hello.

450
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,441
This is mine.

451
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,234
I'll have it.

452
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,946
Hey, Ga-ram.

453
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,573
Sir, what's going on?

454
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,532
Hold on.

455
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,923
Have it, then.

456
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,467
- Goodness.
- That's hot.

457
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,684
Shooting Team, call in.

458
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,603
Everyone is here.

459
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,146
Shooting Team, go.

460
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,856
Shooting always gets to go first

461
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,399
because they're performing well.

462
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,068
When will we ever go first?

463
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,111
Archery Team, get going.

464
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,363
Wrestling Team, go.

465
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,407
- Fencers, what are you doing?
- Gymnastics Team, go.

466
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,742
Rowing Team, get going.

467
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,036
- Weightlifting Team, go.
- Boxing Team, move.

468
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,663
Taekwondo Team, go.

469
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,665
Okay, our Rugby Team…

470
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,417
Geez.

471
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,838
Gosh. That was hilarious.

472
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,924
I've never seen that happen before.

473
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,386
They completely ignored him.

474
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,016
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

475
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,810
- Let's go.
- Go.

476
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,020
- Let's do it.
- Go.

477
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,858
Let's go.

478
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,900
We're almost there.

479
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,781
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

480
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,324
- Hello, sir.
- It's hot, isn't it?

481
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,325
Have this.

482
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,119
Really? May I? Thank you.

483
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,036
RUGBY TEAM

484
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,371
Where's the Rugby Team?

485
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,003
What did you do
to make them disappear on the first day?

486
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,547
If they cause trouble,
who's going to take responsibility?

487
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,052
Have you tried calling the captain?

488
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,762
I don't have…

489
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,598
his number.

490
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,766
For goodness' sake.

491
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,312
I think I know where they are.

492
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,356
What are you waiting for? Go and get them.

493
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,695
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

494
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,031
Why are Hanyang students here at Daesang?

495
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,867
Are you thugs? Are you here to fight?

496
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,493
No, actually…

497
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,245
We're here to see the coach.

498
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,496
Why do you want to see him?

499
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,165
- Because…
- A car's coming.

500
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,875
Come here. Come on.

501
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,380
- Coach.
- Coach.

502
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,300
- What are you doing here?
- What happened?

503
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,135
Why are you at Daesang?

504
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,805
It is what it is.

505
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,557
Did the school…

506
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,060
put pressure on you to quit?

507
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,896
Hey, Seong-jun.

508
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,273
You guys couldn't even win once last year.

509
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,026
I left because I didn't want you
to drag me down.

510
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,696
I escaped before you could
ruin my coaching career.

511
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,658
No.

512
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,286
You said Tae-pung would get better
in the second half.

513
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,414
You said we're bound to improve
with a team like this.

514
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,917
Right. Tae-pung is all right.

515
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,337
And you, too. But just two players,
with no bench members?

516
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,382
Aren't you the coach?
You should have raised us to--

517
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,093
Raise you? Do you think I'm your parent?

518
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,471
A coach uses his players to get results.

519
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,724
I get incentives for that.
That's what I get paid to do.

520
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,311
What do you think a coach is?

521
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,270
Huh?

522
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,315
Tell me.

523
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,069
Woof!

524
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,404
Woof, woof.

525
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,280
Woof.

526
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,323
Woof, woof.

527
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,324
Woof.

528
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,243
Woof, woof.

529
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,286
Woof, woof!

530
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,038
- It was you.
- What are you doing?

531
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,959
How could you speak so cruelly
to a bunch of 18-year-olds?

532
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:25,920
Look who it is.

533
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,423
Are you the new coach?

534
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,051
I was wondering who'd clean up this mess.

535
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,178
You're the perfect fit.

536
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,183
The dogs in this neighborhood
bark so loud, they almost sound human.

537
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,854
- Are you talking about me?
- Enough is enough.

538
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,316
I don't have time for your gibberish.

539
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,242
Let's go.

540
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,664
Geez.

541
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,418
For goodness' sake.

542
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,311
Geez.

543
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,569
What are you doing?

544
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,862
Wash your ears.

545
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,530
Get that crap out of your ears.

546
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,657
Why are you crying?

547
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,201
Thank you.

548
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,161
I will wash them myself.

549
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,704
I can do it myself.

550
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,627
- Did you know all along?
- I did.

551
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,545
Did you come here
to watch us get humiliated?

552
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,091
Hey, what's with you? He helped us.

553
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,469
No, I didn't come to help you.

554
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:57,887
Geez.

555
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,765
The whole Rugby Team is getting punished.

556
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,726
I came to get you
because I was scared to go alone.

557
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,269
Punished?

558
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,689
Gosh.

559
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,237
Hey, stop moving.

560
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,239
You'll spill it.

561
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,950
Your underpants will get wet.

562
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,411
If you spill it, you'll drop
into the thinking man position.

563
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,248
Seriously.

564
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,961
Why did you have to go out
and cause trouble?

565
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,713
Did you think Min-jung would welcome you?

566
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,424
Geez, look at you. Do you have a problem?

567
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,053
- No, I don't.
- I can't hear you.

568
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,056
Everyone, take one hand off.

569
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,474
- What…
- Do it!

570
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,017
Come on.

571
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,945
Geez.

572
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,113
Hey.

573
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,406
You can't take this?

574
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,701
That's why your coach quit.

575
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,580
You don't even train yourself
when you're the captain.

576
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,500
You're rugby players.

577
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,087
To pass the ball
and handle physical contact,

578
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,755
you need strong shoulders.

579
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,841
That's so distracting.

580
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,054
I'm glad you have him as a coach.

581
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,724
You guys are like peas in a pod.

582
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,143
You all are truly something else.

583
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,363
CR

584
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,489
AP

585
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:01,969
Sorry, I'm late.

586
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,264
CRAP

587
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,557
What are you doing?

588
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,558
Sorry.

589
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,726
It's a typo.

590
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,269
It's supposed to be "apology."

591
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,897
CRAPOLOGY

592
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,289
COMMUNITY SERVICE

593
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,886
I heard you were found at Daesang.

594
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,225
Yes.

595
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,061
You must have met with Coach Kim.

596
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:01,237
It's not a bad thing
to see things through to the end.

597
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,282
Good job.

598
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,124
COUNSELING OFFICE

599
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,542
Ju Ga-ram, that dude.

600
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,544
He caused trouble on his first day.

601
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,964
Don't we have to come up with a plan?

602
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,091
We need to disband the Rugby Team soon.

603
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,136
We need their budget
in the second half of the year

604
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,139
to replace all the targets
to electronic ones.

605
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:33,477
The second semester must be fruitful
for you to get promoted to Principal

606
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,604
- without a problem.
- That's true.

607
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,817
Did you try talking
to the principal again?

608
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,195
She's not someone
you can talk some sense into.

609
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,281
What are you going to do, then?

610
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,951
If talking doesn't work,
I might have to threaten her.

611
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,338
<i>Go ahead, Mr. Na.</i>

612
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,549
I heard the guy who brought shame
to our country

613
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,551
because of doping is our rugby coach.

614
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,469
Is that true?

615
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,472
NA GYU-WON, DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT
OF EDUCATION, HEAD OF PTA

616
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,515
It was for the Rugby Team's sake.

617
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,892
Exactly.

618
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,478
Do we really need the Rugby Team?

619
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,813
As long as we have students on the team.

620
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,273
No.

621
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,735
They are athletes training
with funds provided by the school.

622
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,571
If they received the funds,
they should deliver results.

623
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,407
This is an elite
physical education high school.

624
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,451
Nevertheless, a school is still a school.

625
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,704
A school doesn't expel students
for not getting good grades.

626
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,297
You're very idealistic.

627
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,926
I heard the new coach was your student.

628
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,220
- So?
- I hear it could be illegal recruitment.

629
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,971
That's nonsense.

630
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,848
He went through the proper process.

631
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,809
Will others believe that?

632
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,938
This is what the parents want.

633
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,566
PETITION FOR COACH DISMISSAL

634
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,114
REASON FOR DISMISSAL
HISTORY OF DOPING…

635
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,324
You have six months left until retirement.

636
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,328
You should retire…

637
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,289
without any complications

638
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,500
to get your pension.

639
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,435
PETITION FOR COACH DISMISSAL

640
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,645
Hello.

641
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,483
Deputy Superintendent of Education, sir.

642
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,863
- I'm here as Seol-hyeon's dad today.
- I see.

643
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,947
Seol-hyeon.

644
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,240
Dad!

645
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,661
- Are you doing okay?
- Of course.

646
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,330
I still have some training to do,

647
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,708
but everyone left.

648
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,669
Having someone by my side
would make it feel more real.

649
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,675
Can't U-jin do extra training?

650
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,470
She completed her training for today.

651
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,055
So she can't?

652
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,020
Hey, U-jin.

653
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,898
- Shoot 100 more today.
- I've already shot 200 times.

654
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,149
I know.

655
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,735
But shoot 100 more times. Okay?

656
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,737
As your coach, I think it'll benefit you.

657
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,747
Okay.

658
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,709
Tell me if you need anything, my girl.

659
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,877
I'll make it happen.

660
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920
Thank you, Dad.

661
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,048
Have a seat here.

662
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,260
No, thank you.

663
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,806
Is the training schedule
for the second half of the year out yet?

664
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:03,020
We are preparing a training schedule
tailored just for Na-hyeon.

665
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,648
- Right, Coach Jeon?
- Yes, of course.

666
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,068
I trust you, Vice Principal Seong.

667
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,737
Wait, no. Now,

668
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,491
should I call you Principal Seong?

669
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,040
<i>A meeting will be held to discuss</i>
<i>the schedule for the common space.</i>

670
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:27,461
<i>Captains and coaches of each team,</i>
<i>please gather in the teachers' room.</i>

671
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,886
Hello.

672
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,056
Is this how it works?

673
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,855
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

674
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,150
- We're all here, so let's get started.
- Okay.

675
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,903
As all of you know,

676
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,406
we have many teams, but limited space.

677
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,868
Let's be considerate
to ensure that promising medalists

678
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,745
- can train without any issues.
- Yes.

679
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,705
Yes.

680
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,291
Let's take turns sharing
your preferred time slot.

681
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,169
The Track and Field Team will use
the field all day.

682
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,463
What?

683
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
FIELD
TRACK AND FIELD

684
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,260
Do we have a separate training field?

685
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,971
If they use the field all day,
where can we train?

686
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,142
Excuse me.

687
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,603
The Rugby Team needs the field too.

688
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,813
Please wait for your turn.

689
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,274
Next team?

690
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,069
The Wrestling Team will use the gym
four times a week in the afternoon.

691
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,615
The Fencing Team will use
the multi-purpose stadium at dawn.

692
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,701
The Aerobics Team will use the auditorium
three times a week.

693
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,203
Right. How about the Shooting Team?

694
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,166
We want to use the gym
from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on weekdays.

695
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,501
The gym and…

696
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,419
NIGHT, SHOOTING TEAM

697
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,005
Sir.

698
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,133
Our team needs to use the gym
at least twice a week.

699
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,970
It's unfair for the Shooting Team
to use it five times a week.

700
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,558
We have many national tournaments
starting this September.

701
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,311
- We need a lot of balance training.
- Yes.

702
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,438
The Shooting Team has many tournaments
coming up…

703
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,857
- Yes.
- …with a great chance of winning medals.

704
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,234
Most importantly, the gym was built
with a lot of help

705
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,278
from Mr. Na, Seol-hyeon's father.

706
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,032
He is also the
Deputy Superintendent of Education.

707
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,203
The Rugby Team
doesn't have any tournaments coming up

708
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,205
and hasn't contributed much to the school.

709
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,332
So, let's give it to the Shooting Team.

710
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,125
- Next team?
- Vice Principal!

711
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,128
You should get a pair of glasses.

712
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,255
Wait, is it because you're getting old?

713
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,007
I'm a big guy,

714
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,968
but somehow you missed me
when I was waving my hand.

715
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,304
What is it?

716
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,349
Sit. I'll do the talking.

717
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,061
Isn't this a
physical education high school?

718
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,855
In that case,
training is considered part of the class.

719
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,359
If we give up training,
doesn't that mean no class?

720
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,989
We want to help our elite athletes
improve,

721
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,826
not just do charity
for those who are falling behind.

722
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,202
Also,

723
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,453
you don't have a say

724
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,288
- right now.
- Why not?

725
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,835
The PTA requested
a petition to dismiss you.

726
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,962
Until the voting happens,

727
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:19,174
you are suspended
according to the school regulations.

728
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,760
Let's move on.

729
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,679
Is it the Archery Team's turn?

730
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,848
<i>Petition for Dismissal?</i>

731
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,891
Is Coach getting fired, then?

732
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,976
What happens to us?

733
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,311
Wouldn't the school get us a new coach?

734
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,312
Yeah, right.

735
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,273
Who would come and ruin their career?

736
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,525
Hey, stop speaking like a jerk.

737
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,068
Stop being so optimistic.

738
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,572
Hey. Mr. Sensitive and Mr. Rude,
stop fighting.

739
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,283
Stop fighting.
Why do you two fight at every chance?

740
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,284
Stop fighting.

741
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,372
They weren't really fighting…

742
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,126
Geez. It's still the same.

743
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,547
Gosh. It hasn't changed one bit.

744
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,467
This looks like a good spot.

745
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,558
What are you doing?

746
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,518
Because I'm suspended,

747
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,313
- they kicked me out of my dorm.
- So?

748
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,565
I had nowhere to go.

749
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,109
Outsiders aren't allowed in the dorms.

750
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,068
Please leave.

751
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,365
Lights out. All rolls have been called.

752
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,533
Lights out now!

753
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,743
Hey, turn it off.

754
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,828
If I get caught, you'll be accomplices.

755
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:30,913
Hurry.

756
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,603
TRAINING LOG

757
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,773
Does it hurt a lot?

758
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,952
It's me.

759
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,051
Come on out.

760
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,977
It was stupid of you
to carry the weight of a grown man.

761
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,562
No wonder your shoulder hurts.

762
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,940
Don't use it for a while.

763
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,360
You won't be needing it anytime soon.

764
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,781
If we had a proper coach,
I would be using it.

765
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,575
Come on.

766
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,494
Why would a proper coach
want to take charge of a team like this?

767
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,124
You should be grateful that I'm here.

768
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,754
Be grateful for what?

769
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,008
What can you do for us as a coach?

770
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,307
Can an expelled person
write recommendation letters?

771
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,269
Can you meet with pro teams
like other coaches?

772
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,607
What can you teach us
after ruining your own career?

773
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,570
Hey, it's Ju Ga-ram you're talking to.

774
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,865
No one plays rugby better than me
in this country.

775
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,624
You're a traitor.

776
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,675
So what if you did well and worked hard?

777
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:35,138
In the end, you betrayed your teammates
and the time and effort you put in.

778
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,687
You destroyed rugby.

779
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,952
No. Never.

780
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,957
I'll never accept you as the coach.

793
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,816
How can we hire someone
with a doping scandal? He's a disgrace!

794
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,904
What about "a juicer who got expelled"?

795
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,448
You destroyed rugby.

796
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,991
I'll never accept you as the coach.

797
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,088
<i>I don't think I can play at the finals.</i>

HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL
RITE OF VICTORIES 2025

802
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,334
Let's have the athletes skip
afternoon training today

803
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,252
so they can participate in the rite.

804
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,004
Yes, sir.

805
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,800
The principal will be out on business.
Is it alright for us to begin?

806
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,177
We can't change the date for the rite.

807
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,222
I'll try to come back
as quickly as possible.

808
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:31,685
By the way, our team's sponsor
would like to donate some money.

809
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,437
Can I stick that into the pig's head?

810
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,732
I don't want other teams to feel deprived.

811
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,401
Yes, it's all right.

812
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,780
If the Shooting Team performs well,
other teams will watch and learn.

813
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,281
Yes, sir.

814
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:49,619
It's more transparent to get donations
through the administrative office.

815
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,246
Go through them.

816
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,457
Also, don't put money on the table
during the rite.

817
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,004
Safe travels.

818
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,184
On your marks.

819
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,980
Get set.

820
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,368
I'm jealous.

821
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,248
How can one team hog the field like that?

822
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,500
The Shooting Team took the gym.

823
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,960
Where do we train, then?

824
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,212
What about our coach? Did he say anything?

825
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,221
We don't have a coach.

826
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,101
Anyway,

827
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,312
let's begin.

828
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,396
Geez.

829
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,109
- Nice pass.
- I'll pass first.

830
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,612
- One, two.
- Okay, go.

831
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,530
- Nice.
- Good.

832
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,957
He's so full of himself.

833
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,168
- I hope he fails all his tests.
- Focus.

834
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:23,088
How can I? This situation really sucks.

835
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,757
- Throw harder.
- Darn it.

836
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,551
Hey, Rugby!

837
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,221
Hey!

838
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,515
He didn't cross the line.

839
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,351
Hyeong-sik.

840
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,323
Seong-jun!

841
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,991
- Captain.
- Captain.

842
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:52,951
- Captain.
- Seong-jun.

843
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,452
- Captain.
- Are you okay?

844
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,538
- Hey!
- Are you all right?

845
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,332
Are you crazy? If he gets injured,
are you going to play for him?

846
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,459
You guys don't have any matches anyway.

847
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,336
You know what?

848
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:06,172
I might be better
than that shortie or you.

849
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,841
<i>I might be better</i>

850
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,217
<i>than that shortie.</i>

851
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,761
No. Don't listen to that.

852
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,846
No.

853
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,305
I heard it wrong, right?

854
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,265
Yes, you did.

855
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,976
- Stop. You heard it wrong.
- No, I heard it.

856
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,727
- Hey!
- You son of a bitch!

857
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,770
Hyeong-sik.

858
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,896
- Hyeong-sik.
- Hyeong-sik.

859
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,898
Hey, we'll get punished.

860
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,025
Why?

861
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,402
- Hey!
- What's wrong?

862
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,778
- Geez.
- Crazy bastard.

863
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,156
Hey, you son of a bitch!

864
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,032
How dare he. Hey!

865
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,287
Blood. My face!

866
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,539
Fuck!

867
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,710
Hey, come here.

868
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,589
Come here.

869
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,475
Everyone stop!

870
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,435
Please!

871
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,526
You're dead meat.

872
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,587
Move.

00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,130
TEACHERS' ROOM

874
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,513
I suppose you're a coach too, after all.

875
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,140
What happened?

876
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,683
What do you think?

877
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,770
The Rugby Team caused a ruckus
and hurt my players.

878
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,812
What are they? Dogs?

879
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,273
They go crazy when they see a ball.

880
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,901
A rugby player ought to chase the ball.

881
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,445
- Seong-jun.
- Is that so?

882
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,198
It was the ball's fault, then.

883
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,200
It should be punished. Give it to me.

884
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,536
Hand it over. It should be punished.

885
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,204
What should I use?

886
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,967
The Rugby Team is banned from training
until further notice.

887
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,054
We don't want any more trouble
caused by them training without a coach.

888
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,349
- We do have a coach.
- Didn't your captain tell you?

889
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,271
The rugby captain has agreed
to dismiss your coach.

890
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,110
GYM: SHOOTING TEAM

891
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,736
FIELD: TRACK AND FIELD TEAM

892
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,905
SECOND HALF OF 2025
COMMON SPACE TIMETABLE

893
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,538
As the captain, you must be worried.

894
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,290
Well…

895
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,750
About the dismissal petition.

896
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,546
If it passes, what will happen to my team?

897
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,928
With Ga-ram gone,
I assume things will get better.

898
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,265
I can find you a new coach.

899
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,273
You have no reason to be here.

900
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,527
You have no reason
to participate in the rite either.

901
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,571
I would like the outsider to leave.

902
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,794
The other teams are busy training.

903
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,256
Let's have the Rugby Team,
who don't have training or a coach,

904
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,716
prepare for the rite.

905
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,558
Watch your back.

906
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,101
Set it up there.

907
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,520
- Okay.
- I will go first.

908
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,606
One, two, three.

909
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,155
Are you all right?

910
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,073
Geez.

911
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,284
Don't hurt yourselves.

912
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,750
Come to think of it, it's pissing me off.

913
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,669
Why did you agree to fire him?

914
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,923
He needs to be fired
for a proper coach to come in,

915
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,716
so things like this won't happen again.

916
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,095
Isn't this also Coach Ju's fault?

917
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,598
Hey. We ended up like this
because we don't have a coach.

918
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,058
It's not because of Coach Ju.

919
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:31,646
Do you think things will change
drastically if Ju Ga-ram is our coach?

920
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,565
I'm not sure about that.

921
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:38,486
But I do know you're ignoring
our opinions because you're the captain.

922
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,036
Let's stop. We've already hit rock bottom.

923
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,287
Sounds good to me.

924
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,423
WEIGHTLIFTING, TENNIS, FENCING

925
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,843
WRESTLING, SWIMMING

926
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,513
Rugby is…

927
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,306
"Tennis."

928
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,812
Hold on.

929
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:14,897
Did I write rugby on it?

930
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,733
No, I think you missed it.

931
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,026
No. I didn't write it. Take the ball away.

932
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,783
Why can't the Rugby Team
be a part of the rite?

933
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,452
Did your team win…

934
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,370
even once last year?

935
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,248
Before it brings bad luck to other teams,

936
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,125
take it out.

937
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,632
Stop wasting time.
Just take it out when you're told.

938
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,718
Let's go.

939
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,888
Okay. Let's do this.

940
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,396
I'm glad I made it on time.

941
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,023
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

942
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,233
We'll begin the rite.

943
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,071
In the second half of 2025,

944
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,073
we wish to achieve good results

945
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,368
without any accidents or injuries.

946
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:14,040
Next, we will have our vice principal
and sports team manager.

947
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,666
- A rugby ball?
<i>- Three.</i>

948
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,834
<i>- Two.</i>
- Hold on.

949
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:58,876
<i>- One.</i>
- What's with him?

950
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,794
Move.

951
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,636
What?

952
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,628
He stuck it into the pig's head.

953
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,005
- It's stuck.
- In the pig's head?

954
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,173
It pierced the pig's head.

955
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,425
That's crazy.

956
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,691
Ju Ga-ram!

957
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,038
JU GA-RAM!

958
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:17,955
- CRAZY!
- AWESOME!

959
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,382
EPILOGUE

960
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,057
THE WINNING TRY

961
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,226
How dare he botch it up!

962
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,978
Let's vote on his dismissal first.

963
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,313
<i>As you know, I don't have much decency.</i>

964
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,648
- Say nay!
<i>- Stay out of my sight</i>

965
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,066
<i>and lay low until you leave.</i>

966
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,319
<i>Why are you letting those Rugby Team</i>
<i>beasts join the training?</i>

967
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,030
<i>Rugby Team!</i>

968
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,406
<i>We have a practice match!</i>

969
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,868
<i>- Will this be enough for us to win?</i>
<i>- You have to learn to lose well.</i>

970
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,287
I don't need a juicer
teaching me how to lose.

971
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,080
- The kids hate me.
- The whole country does.

972
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,835
<i>Soon you'll realize</i>
<i>that they're as hopeless as you.</i>

973
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,378
<i>Is there any way to win?</i>

974
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,714
From now on, let's play real rugby.

975
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,971
