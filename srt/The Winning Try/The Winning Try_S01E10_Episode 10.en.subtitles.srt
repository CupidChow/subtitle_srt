THE WINNING TRY

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
You scumbag!

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,430
-Come here.
-Ga-ram.

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,973
Come.

5
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,308
-Ga-ram.
-Come here.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,727
-Don't do this.
-Darn it!

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,979
-Don't.
-Let go.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,564
-Ga-ram.
-Darn it!

9
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,940
-Ga-ram!
-Move!

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,901
Ga-ram!

11
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,153
This is my decision. Don't get in the way.

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,988
Why would you make such a decision?

13
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,740
This is not helping me in any way.

14
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,241
Please go.

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,743
Just go!

16
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,661
How interesting.

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,622
Old sayings are always true.

18
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,086
"Spare the rod, spoil the child."

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,964
-I'm sorry.
-No, you don't have to be.

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:36,054
Me? This "scumbag"?
What do you intend to do? Let's see.

21
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,809
If I'm a scumbag, then what are you?
Are you a rotten scumbag?

22
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,604
-What are you doing?
-I can't take it anymore!

23
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,275
What kind of man throws a tantrum
just because he took a few punches?

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,820
And especially in front of your seniors?

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,280
You rude piece of shit.
What the heck are you doing?

26
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,615
Go!

27
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,950
Please leave.

28
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,037
Please, Ga-ram.

29
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,248
Please stop.

30
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,668
No, don't leave.
Do whatever you came here for. Go ahead.

31
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,878
He has a grudge against me. That's all.

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,681
Come on, vent it out on me.
Let's see this through to the end.

33
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,854
As for the broken glass,

34
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,648
we should cover the cost
with the Rugby Team's budget, right?

35
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,900
No, it should come out of Ga-ram's salary.

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,653
Interesting.

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,446
Very interesting.

38
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,870
-Sorry.
-Are you going to clean up?

39
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,037
Yes, I'll take care of it.

40
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,747
Okay. You passed.

41
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,292
See you at the shooting range tomorrow.

42
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,461
I'll bring your bags.

43
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,352
EPISODE 10

44
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,104
Why did you barge in?

45
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,315
What if it led to an accident?

46
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,444
You're lucky no glass hit Nak-gyun,
or you'd be done for.

47
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,155
Ju Ga-ram.

48
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,286
-Ga-ram.
-These stains might not come off.

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,833
Ga-ram.

50
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,297
-Ga-ram.
-What?

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,882
I was holding myself back.

52
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,467
What I really wanted to do

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,929
was break that jerk Nak-gyun
into pieces, not the glass.

54
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,313
You're so precious to me.

55
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,525
I'm so careful around you,
just in case I accidentally make you cry.

56
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,863
So why do you treat yourself like this?

57
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,165
Stop doing this to yourself.
To me, you're so…

58
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,002
So what?

59
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,881
-Why'd you stop mid-sentence?
-What?

60
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,523
If I'm not here,

61
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,527
the students will have to deal
with this unfair situation.

62
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,363
I'm going to endure it for them.

63
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,575
Just like you, Ga-ram.

64
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Why did you let Coach Bae come back?

65
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,942
She knows way too much.

66
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,236
It'll be a headache if she starts talking,

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,281
so it's better to keep her close
and watch her carefully.

68
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,492
Be sure to handle any liability concerns
in advance.

69
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,952
Of course.

70
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,832
So, what should we do about Ga-ram?

71
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,209
Make him write an apology letter
for breaking the glass?

72
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,464
-What's an apology going to do for us?
-Then what?

73
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,717
We have to find a way
to kick him out for good.

TODAY SPORTS

75
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,683
I'm interested in the Rugby Team,

76
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,729
especially in Coach Ju Ga-ram.

THE WINNING TRY

78
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:09,952
Let's talk about it
once the in-school tryout is over.

79
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,706
I'll see you at the Nationals.

80
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,378
-Where is she?
-Seo U-jin's training on her own.

81
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,339
She'd rather not be here?

82
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,802
No. I think she should focus
on her mental health rather than shooting,

83
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,470
so I told her to train alone.

84
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,723
-She'd get on your nerves too.
-Hey.

85
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,392
You've become more tactful.

86
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,062
That's good.

87
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,399
You should look after U-jin from now on.

88
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,486
If I do, there might be another accident.

89
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,779
Okay. I got it.

90
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,574

To regain your balance
before the Nationals,

93
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,651
you'll need special training.

94
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,195
I can't even keep my balance
on flat ground.

95
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,574
-Will this work?
-Let's try it.

96
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,325
I'll hold you.

97
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,855
All right.

98
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,749
Don't focus on holding your balance.
Just imagine you're on flat ground.

99
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,713
Once balanced, take the basic stance.

100
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,692
Are you all right? Let me see.

101
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,611
Did you hurt your wrist?

102
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,614
How does it feel?

103
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,205
Don't be sorry.
You don't need to apologize for an injury.

105
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:04,627
What if I don't get better,
even with all your help?

106
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,546
Then it would be my fault.

107
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,215
I didn't provide you
with the proper rehab.

108
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,928
A player just needs to do their best,
and the rest is on the coach.

109
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,641
I'll find more ways
to help with your recovery,

110
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,435
so don't blame yourself or worry.

THE NATIONALS' DRAW OFFICIAL

115
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,078
We must decide on the draw official
for the Nationals.

116
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,456
The draw official determines the opponents
for the tournaments

117
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,875
in fencing, table tennis, judo, and rugby,

118
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,421
and picks the lanes
for shooting and swimming.

119
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,965
This means he or she
holds great responsibility.

120
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,844
In sports, it's fair to say
the draw matters the most.

121
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,179
All the effort of the year
can vanish into thin air.

122
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,390
Please approach this seriously.

123
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,351
We'll begin now.

124
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,229
For starters,

125
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,275
if you've had a string
of bad luck recently, please leave.

126
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,991
If your age ends with nine, please leave.

127
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:23,706
If you've recently had nightmares
or ominous dreams, please leave as well.

128
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,087
All remaining coaches,
please gather around.

129
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,673
Please take out your phones.

130
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,884

-Goodness!

00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,642

00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,264
Coach Ju has never drawn
for these competitions before, right?

144
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,600
No experience is required.

145
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,770
The key is to pick the luckiest person.

146
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,438
It's a bit unnerving.

147
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,150
Let's also send
the second luckiest person this time.

148
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,527
Sure. Let's do that.

149
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,865
-It's 72.
-It's 79.

00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,418
-Why are you smiling?
-It feels like a really good dream.

178
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,630
-You had a good dream?
-Not literally.

179
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,384
It feels like a dream,
sitting here with you again.

180
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,680
Geez, that's greasy.

181
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,557
-Do you want a Coke?
-Hey.

182
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,184
-Right. We can't order Coke.
-Nope.

183
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
Look.

184
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,274
There's our history.

185
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,567
Wow, it's from 2004.

186
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,112
I'll write one for this year, too.

187
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,165
We used to come as players every year.

188
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,836
Now, we're sitting here as coaches.

189
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,589
When I was a player,

190
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,676
I didn't know coaches held
such a heavy burden.

191
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,180
I thought they just casually
watched us train

192
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,725
and yelled at us from time to time.

193
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,520
Had I known it was this tough,
I would have listened to them more.

194
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,773
I want to do well.

195
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,445
Just like my coach back then.

196
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,572
Let's do it.

197
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,201
Let's hope our students remember us

198
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,121
as "my coach" or "our coach."

199
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,256
Geez.

200
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,925
Come on.

201
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,260
ALL MY TRIES ARE FOR I-JI

202
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,303
Look here.

203
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,804
I wrote this.

204
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,980
-I wrote one too.
-Don't lie to me.

205
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,148
I'm serious.

206
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,525
-Really?
-Yes.

207
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,863
-Where?
-Just keep eating.

208
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,659
Are you really going to wear that?
Come back.

209
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,620
-Are you really going to?
-Keep quiet.

210
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,537
Are you?

211
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,830
GA-RAM'S MINE, I'll SHOOT
I-JI

212
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,500
It's too embarrassing.
Are we really going to wear that?

213
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,502
-I don't see it.
-You promised, okay?

214
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,004
-It's a bit tight.
-It's tight for me too.

215
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,506
JINX 4: BUILD A WINNING ATTITUDE

216
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,549
-I can't go like this.
-We have no choice.

217
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,522
THE 106TH NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL

218

2025 NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL
DRAW CEREMONY

219
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,410
Amazing!

220
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,703
How amazing!

221
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,872
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

222
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,624
Look at them!

223
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,043
Geez. This is embarrassing!

224
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,088
-How embarrassing.
-It was your idea.

225
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,339
Keep your head up.

226
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,427
We'll draw for the general division
for each city and province.

227
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,138
Coaches, please come up to the platform.

228
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,646
Team Seoul will draw first.

229
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,023
-Are you nervous?
-Please draw.

230
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,274
I'm not nervous.

231
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,694
A shooter can keep cool
even in situations like this.

232
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,447
He drew number four.

233
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,452
-I'm nervous.
-You all must be nervous.

234
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,703
-So what?
-We'll keep going.

235
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,080
-Coach of Gangwon-do.
-You…

236
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,415
calm my nerves.

237
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,509
Gangwon-do picked 16.

238
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,055
Next, we'll draw
for the high school division.

239
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,852
Just when I am disheartened

240
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,104
What? I can't even do this, seriously?

241
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,481
What are we going to do?

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,609
SHOOTING COACH BAE

246
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,619
Yes!

247
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,997
Quiet!

248
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,709
Track and Field!

249
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,462
I wasn't the unlucky one.

250
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,006
Oopsie daisy. Dropped it again.

251
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
Let's go. Please tell us.

252
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,098
-This is nerve-racking.
-Coach scored 100 points.

253
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,183
Hurry. My heart's about to explode.

254
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,393
NO PRESSURE, WE'RE THE BEST,
WE TRUST YOU

255
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,396
Okay. You can go back to your seat.

256
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,358
Next up, Daesang High will draw.

257
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,112
Which number will they draw?

258
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,075
Okay. It's 14.

259
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,993
He picked 14.

260
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,539
You can go back to your seat.

261
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,292
Next will be Hanyang Physical Education
High School.

262
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,336
Please step forward.

263
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,966
Which number will Hanyang High draw?

264
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,641
The fate of the school
is in the coach's hands.

265
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,477
RUGBY

266
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,982
He picked four.

267
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,027
NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL

268
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:18,532
MUJIN HIGH VS HANYANG HIGH

269
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,242
COACH JU
1ST ROUND HANYANG VS MUJIN

270
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,495
Mujin.

271
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,624
-Mujin is easy.
-It's a piece of cake.

272
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,169
They were eliminated in the preliminaries.
We've got this.

273
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,129
-It'll be easy.
-What about Daesang?

274
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,630
Hold on.

275
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
Daesang is here.

276
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,845
If they advance on and on…

277
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,098
-We'd meet them in the finals.
-You're right.

278
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,852
Let's go to the finals.
Wasn't it our goal to win the Nationals?

279
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,145
-Yes.
-Right, Captain?

280
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,527
Wait. What's with you?

281
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,910
Are you chickening out?

282
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,995
What? I'm not scared.

283
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,248
-Should we do special training?
-What? Did Yeong-gwang say that?

284
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,791
-Geez.
-I'm touched.

285
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,959
Come on.

286
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,213
-Let's do special training.
-All right!

287
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,215
Let's go.

288
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,217
-Let's squat 2 million times.
-Go!

289
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,274
Goodness.

290
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,903
I started eating first
because I was hungry.

291
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,280
Please sit.

292
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,662
Thank you for contacting me.

293
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,373
-You said you had something for me?
-Right.

294
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,293
I was going to wait for you to eat first.

295
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,797
Here it is.

296
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,476
Coach Ju is seeing a neurologist.

297
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,812
As you can see here.

298
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,771
PRESCRIPTION: ANADROL

299
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:17,401
How did the Rugby Team
suddenly get better?

300
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:21,488
Are you suggesting that Ga-ram
made the players take illegal substances?

301
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,533
That's what I want to find out.

302
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,080
Please give me permission
to gather news on campus.

303
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,126
If you help me this one time,

304
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:39,923
I can clear out the principal's office
in no time.

305
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,515
Here you go.

306
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,059
Yes!

307
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,520
Listen up!

308
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,106
This is our last feast
before the Nationals.

309
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,692
From tomorrow
until the Nationals are over,

310
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,861
you'll follow a strict diet, so be ready.

311
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,778
Okay!

312
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:06,408
Coach, we have to eat well to play well.
Diet isn't really--

313
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,326
-Hey.
-Just eat.

314
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,369
Just shut it and dig in!

315
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,089
As for Mujin High, let's…

316
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,011
Let's destroy them like this!

317
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,638
Just Mujin High?

318
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,225
We'll devour Daesang High too.

319
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,560
If you win the Nationals,

320
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,313
I'll give you free chicken for life!

321
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,109
-You promise?
-I'll have to ask Seung-hui first.

322
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,569
-Just eat up.
-Geez.

323
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,446
Ung, when you eat chicken,

324
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,366
you have to hold it tightly like this
to get the full experience.

325
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,619
-Why are you giving it to me?
-So that you can excel.

326
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,080
-Have it.
-Eat it.

327
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,999
Look at you go!

328
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,212
Why aren't you eating, Seong-jun?
Are you unwell?

329
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,798
No, it's…

330
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,884
I'm a little nervous
with the match coming up.

331
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,971
-Seriously?
-Hurry and eat up.

332
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,640
He's cute.

333
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,809
-He can be so adorable.
-I know, right?

334
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,933
Where's Seong-jun?

335
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,605
He's having a major issue
with his stomach,

336
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,109
so he said it will take some time
to get it under control.

337
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,736
That's what he said,

338
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,281
-but he fixed it.
-Sorry.

339
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,076
How about I feel your stomach
to see if everything's okay?

340
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,121
Let's begin. There's no time for jokes.

341
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,916
-You're the one who's late.
-Hey.

342
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,418
Why don't we chant?

343
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,378
-Okay.
-Let's go!

344
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,255
Let's go!

345
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,594
Hanyang!

346
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,933
Captain.

347
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey, you have to run faster.

348
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,238
Good job.

349
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,366
Captain.

350
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,454
Hey.

351
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,999
-Stop it.
-What?

352
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,584
Stop whatever you're doing.

353
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,087
-Ju-yang.
-Call it.

354
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,215
-You were offside.
-Okay.

355
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,342
Seon-ho.

356
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,095
-I know. Get closer.
-Captain.

357
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,190
-Move.
-Darn it!

358
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,400
Move.

359
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,652
-Hey.
-Captain.

360
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,362
-What's wrong?
-Hey, Seong-jun.

361
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,988
Why? What's going on?

362
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,407
-Hurry, Coach.
-Why?

363
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,993
What's wrong, Seong-jun?

364
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,539
-Did he dislocate his shoulder?
-Wait. Stay still.

365
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,875
Hey.

366
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,964
What is that?

367
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,092
It's highly likely
that it's a rotator cuff tear.

368
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,929
We'll need an MRI and a CT scan
to confirm the details.

369
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,308
He'll stay here in the hospital.
Please arrange his checkup.

370
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,228
-Okay.
-When prescribing his medicine,

371
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,481
please exclude steroid substances.
He's an athlete.

372
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,651
I don't need to be hospitalized, Coach.

373
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,030
Is there anything else we should know?

374
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,783
Watch out for sudden movements or impacts.

375
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,121
I'm really fine. I can train, Coach.

376
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,291
The exam results will tell us
whether you're okay or not.

377
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,084
Thank you.

378
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,463
I mean, it's a minor injury.

379
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,843
As a rugby player, this is nothing.
You know that, don't you?

380
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,303
Coach--

381
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,650
Seong-jun, forget about the Nationals.
Are you trying to end your career?

382
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,945
Stay in the hospital
until the results are in.

383
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,280
That's final.

384
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,542
WARD 73, ROOM 510

385
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,629
OS / YOON

386
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,246
SEONG-JUN'S MOTHER

387
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,253
The number you have dialed…

388
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,505
He's not picking up.

389
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,590
It's all my fault.

390
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,883
Stop crying.

391
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,097
Coach.

392
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,681
How's Seong-jun?

393
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,934
-He's in the hospital.
-Is it that bad?

394
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,648
We're waiting for an in-depth test.

395
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,444
It wasn't your fault, Ju-yang.

396
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,113
He had a bad shoulder before that.

397
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,492
We'll talk again
when we get the test results.

398
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,035
-Go to your rooms.
-Okay.

399
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,037
Good night.

400
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,415
He'll be fine.

401
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,088
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

402
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:40,218
The Shooting Team will hold
an in-school tryout for the Nationals.

403
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,720
Do you have the list of players for it?

404
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,390
It's almost finalized.

405
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,434
But we aren't sure about U-jin.

406
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,645
She's seeing a doctor
to check her condition.

407
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,026
Next, the Rugby Team.
Anything worth reporting?

408
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,571
Yes.

409
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,783
Seong-jun, a third-year student,
injured his shoulder.

410
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,079
Is it severe?

411
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,248
It was diagnosed as a rotator cuff tear.

412
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,294
He doesn't have to get surgery,
but he can't train either.

413
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,756
I'll keep you updated on his recovery.

414
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,219
Lastly, a reporter will be gathering
news materials on campus

415
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,390
for the Nationals,
so I ask for your cooperation.

416
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,644
News coverage is good.
I should ask them to cover fencing.

417
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,230
The archery lane welcomes them
with open arms.

418
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,982
I like that they're covering us.

419
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:40,278
But before any article is released,
make sure it goes through us first.

420
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,654
Okay. Thank you.

421
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,907
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

422
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,036
TEACHERS' ROOM

423
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,455
-Good luck.
-Okay.

424
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,594
SEONG-JUN'S MOTHER

425
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,389
I'd like to do the counseling
without Seong-jun tomorrow.

426
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,600
I have something to tell you.

427
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,747
U-JIN

428
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,460
Oh, man.

429
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,551
-Hello?
-Room number?

430
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,345
-What's your room number?
-Right.

431
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,223
It's…

432
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,643
It's Room 510.

433
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,188
What was that?

434
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,944
Darn it.

435
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,655
Why is she coming so suddenly?

436
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,240
Geez.

437
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,158
Ouch. My shoulder.

438
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,243
Where is it?

439
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,745
It's hot! Geez.

440
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,082
Socks. I was wearing my socks. Dang it!

441
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,377
This is driving me nuts.

442
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,802
-When did you get here?
-Bend over.

443
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,266
Give it to me.

444
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,736
It isn't dry yet.

445
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,618
Did you come to see me?

446
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,870
-I came to get my ear checked.
-Your ear?

447
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
Why? What's wrong with your ear?

448
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,458
I knew it. There's a scar.
Did you examine it properly?

449
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,209
-I did.
-Okay.

450
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,045
I have trouble with my balance.

451
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,592
-Let me see your ear.
-What for?

452
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm just worried about you.

453
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,181
-Stop worrying about others.
-You're not just anyone.

454
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,202
-Let's go outside.
-To where?

455
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,663
I haven't eaten yet
because of my appointment.

456
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,747
To eat.

457
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,335
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

458
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,596
-Are you all right?
-Yes. Sorry.

459
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,556
Sit over there. I'll order.

460
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,899
-For me…
-Steak sandwich, please.

461
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,860
Served on Parmesan oregano bread
with ranch.

462
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,739
-And no olives, please.
-Okay.

463
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,074
You remember my usual?

464
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,827
Please make two of them.

465
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,953
-Okay.
-Thank you.

466
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,629
Give it to me.

467
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,684
Does Ung know about your ear?

468
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,313
Did you tell him?

469
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,900
He found out.
He said he'd keep it a secret.

470
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,988
Right. A secret.

471
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,658
I have no other intention,

472
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,453
and I'm not asking
out of jealousy or suspicion.

473
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,580
But can I ask you something?

474
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,042
Is there…

475
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,754
something going on between you and Ung--

476
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,797
Look at you talking nonsense,
you must be fine.

477
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,053
Right? That's nonsense.

478
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,474
I…

479
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,768
I'm fine.

480
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,730
It'll be all right.

481
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,274
The rehab.

482
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,736
We get injured all the time.

483
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,284
U-jin.

484
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,247
Look at that scar on your neck. There.

485
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,958
-You need to get your ear treated quickly.
-Just eat.

486
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:49,921
Hey.

487
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,053
I wasn't done chewing yet.
You can't just feed me like that.

488
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,854
Darn it.

489
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,149
Who are you?

490
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,151
RUGBY TEAM'S ROOM

491
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,446
Mr. Ju, how do you feel?

492
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,949
Are you going to keep playing?

493
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,371
It's been a while, Mr. Ju.

494
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,374
Right. It's Coach Ju now, isn't it?

495
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,500
Hold on.

496
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,591
You remember me, don't you?

497
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,470
I wrote an exclusive article
on your doping scandal.

498
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,597
How could I forget?

499
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,477
How's it going these days?

500
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,313
I heard the rugby captain got injured.

501
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,610
Isn't he Yoon Seok-jun's twin brother?

502
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,488
How's his injury going?

503
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,951
I'm sorry. It shouldn't be disclosed.

504
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,912
Right? That's going to be a problem
when he applies to college.

505
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,913
Stop right there.

506
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,126
Don't mess with my boys.

507
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:16,132
If you write an article rashly
and affect Seong-jun in any way,

508
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,342
you'll regret it.

509
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,865
HANYANG RUGBY

510
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,658
Shouldn't you be resting?

511
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,827
No. It's fine.

512
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,747
Take the day off at least.
You just got discharged today.

513
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,123
Haven't you been injured?

514
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,418
-Captain, still.
-Stop it and get ready already.

515
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,754
-What if it gets worse?
-What are you doing?

516
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,466
-Hello.
-Coach.

517
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,810
It's gym day, isn't it?

518
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,229
-Yes.
-Yes.

519
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,355
-Get ready.
-Okay.

520
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,314
-Yes.
-Okay.

521
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,901
Coach, I feel fine.
I don't even need this anymore.

522
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,569
Seong-jun won't be training today.

523
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,530
As long as I don't move my right shoulder,
it'll be fine.

524
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,241
Move along if you're ready.

525
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,200
-Okay.
-Yes.

526
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,201
-Okay.
-Okay.

527
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,496
Go on.

528
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,206
-Yes.
-Let's go, Ung.

529
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,877
I'll warm up next to them, then.

530
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,046
Yoon Seong-jun!

531
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,217
Focus only on your recovery.

532
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,636
Think about nothing else.

533
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,931
You hear me?

534
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,726
Answer me!

535
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,855
Yes.

536
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,380
YOON SEOK-JUN

537
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,050
COUNSELING OFFICE

538
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,053
Hello, Coach.

539
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,098
-I'm Seong-jun's mom.
-Hello.

540
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,726
I'm Ju Ga-ram, the Rugby Team's coach.

541
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,187
Please come in.

542
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,234
RIGHT SHOULDER ROTATOR CUFF TEAR

543
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,403
He tore his rotator cuff.

544
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,324
We plan to undergo rehab
rather than have surgery.

545
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,701
The tear is less than an inch long.

546
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,248
I'll help him recover.

547
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,835
He's still young,
he'll be better in no time.

548
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,130
-It won't affect his career that much.
-Coach.

549
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,469
I'm here to talk about something else.

550
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,616
I want to take Seong-jun to Spain.

551
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,159
Spain.

552
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,161
This was in Spanish.

553
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,291
To study abroad?

554
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,630
I mean, there is a rugby league in Spain,

555
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:47,301
but he doesn't have to go overseas
to play rugby.

556
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,930
Please persuade him to quit rugby.

557
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,766
Pardon?

558
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,185
Listen, Coach.

559
00:39:56,268 --> 00:40:00,398
I want him to take a path
with a secure future.

560
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:07,071
Has he gotten any offers from colleges
or pro teams?

561
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,784
No, not yet.

562
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,787
Honestly, now that he's injured,

563
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,165
what future can he realistically expect?

564
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:25,548
Working with Seok-jun after studying
to be an agent will be better for--

565
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:27,925
Seong-jun.

566
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,595
I'm going to keep playing rugby.

567
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,140
We still have the Nationals.

568
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,768
If I win, I can get offers from colleges
or pro teams.

569
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:42,356
-How can you play with that shoulder?
-Stop making excuses.

570
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,317
Does my shoulder even matter to you?

571
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,945
You just need Seok-jun's sidekick.

572
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,615
I made it clear that I want to play rugby.

573
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,701
Did you even listen to me?

574
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,705
You've never even come to see me play.

575
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,879
You've never supported me
since I started playing.

576
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,882
How can you talk about my future now?

577
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,844
I'm fine on my own, so please,

578
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,182
go and take care of that wonder child,
Seok-jun.

579
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,644
I know you're upset, Seong-jun.

580
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,271
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:27,610
But leaving you here isn't easy for me.
I care about you.

582
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:33,199
I just want to provide you
with an easier and safer path.

583
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,993
That's an easier path for you.

584
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,919
I'm sorry,

585
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,172
but our afternoon training
is about to begin.

586
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,345
I know how you feel,

587
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,432
but please try
to think realistically. Okay?

588
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:14,698
I assume you understood
what I want, Coach.

589
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,575
I'll leave things to you now.

590
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,268
Seong-jun.

591
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,401
Let me practice.

592
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,528
I'll be careful.

593
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,739
I'll find a way somehow.

594
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,534
-No.
-Coach.

595
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,619
If you damage your shoulder any further,

596
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,706
you might never be able to play again.

597
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,457
I just need to play at the Nationals.

598
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,919
My whole life depends on it.
You saw how my mom was.

599
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,590
I'll do whatever it takes to play.

600
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,466
Please, Coach.

601
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,887
Seong-jun, think about the future.

602
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,557
Are you going to end your career
at the Nationals' first round?

603
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,476
If I can't play the first round,
there won't be a second.

604
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,565
This is my last chance.

605
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,359
It's just a minor injury.

606
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,069
I'll play at the Nationals,

607
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,114
-and then get surgery--
-Seong-jun.

608
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,617
What am I supposed to do?
This is my last chance.

609
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,541
That's exactly why I'm doing this.
So that this won't be your last chance.

610
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,170
Listen to me.

611
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,924
I won't let you train
until your shoulder recovers.

612
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,101
All I have to do is recover?

613
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,609
Yoon Seong-jun.

614
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,694
Seong-jun. Hey.

615
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,129
ROTATOR CUFF TEAR

616
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,220
We might not be able to play
at the Nationals.

617
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,889
It's not something that can heal
in three weeks.

618
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,226
We don't have any substitutes
for Seong-jun.

619
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,520
Does Coach have a plan?

620
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,689
I don't know.

621
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,982
I wanted to play one good final game.

622
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,236
What if we don't get any new players
next year?

623
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,031
Who's going to apply to a team
that couldn't even be in the Nationals?

624
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,744
I put everything at stake
for the Nationals.

625
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,373
Will ox knee soup help?

626
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,122
Hey! You might hurt your hand.

627
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,582
Don't vandalize school property.

628
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:01,967
Hey!

629
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,760
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

630
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,346
You're a shooter, hand it over.

631
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,399
Thinking about U-jin's rehab
made me feel impatient.

632
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,277
Is she getting better?

633
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,113
She's doing her best.

634
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,673
What's going on?

635
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:52,184
You almost quit shooting
during high school

636
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,602
because of your family.

637
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,437
I did.

638
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,105
How did you get through it?

639
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,235
The ones you wanted the most support from
were against it.

640
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,615
I got through it because of Ju Ga-ram.

641
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,158
What?

642
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,954
When no one, including Mom and Dad,
supported me,

643
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,208
you were on my side.
That was how I got through it.

644
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,420
That was it?

645
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:21,964
What do you mean?

646
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,716
The support of just one person…

647
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,803
means more than you'd think.

648
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,976
Thank you for having my back then.

649
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,063
I still have your back.

650
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,274
All done.

651
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,328
Yes. Focus.

652
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,329
That's it.

653
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,540
Geez.

654
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,504
Me too.

655
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:04,840
What do you mean?

656
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,801
I still have your back.

657
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,270
I'm rooting for you.

658
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,614
Thank you and sorry.

659
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,532
Not that.

660
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,493
-Should I kiss you?
-Geez.

661
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,041
Wrong. Try again.

662
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,212
I like you a lot.

663
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,010
There you go.

Is it something funny?

It's nothing.

Where did he hide it?

What are you doing right now?

692
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,491
You can't do this based on an article
that has no proof.

693
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,994
Shouldn't the school
protect its students first?

I don't know.

695
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,582

The real proof.

699
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,720
They're anabolic steroids.
They were in Seong-jun's drawers.

700
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,145
How did this happen?

701
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,608
Did he do this alone?
Or did you make him, Coach Ju?

702
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,985
No, that's not--

703

00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,283
-Let me talk to him.
-Talk about what?

706
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,618
Rugby Team, block them.

707
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,744
What do you need to talk--

708
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,704
-Ga-ram.
-What are you doing?

709
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,040
-What do you think you're doing?
-Let go of me.

710
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,000
You punks. Darn it.

711
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,251
Get out of the way.

712
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,503
-Ga-ram.
-Move.

713
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,338
-Ga-ram.
-Where are the keys? Open it.

714
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,924
What, are you using force against us?

715
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,515
Did you take them?

716
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,602
Did you?

717
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,771
No.

718
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,276
If you lie now, there's no turning back.

719
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,862
Did you really not take them?

720
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,033
I really didn't take them.

721
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,168
Okay.

722
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,255
It's all right.

723
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,553
Excuse me.

724
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,181
Excuse me.

725
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,023
What are you trying to pull?

726
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,399
ANADROL

727
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,027
That's my medicine.

728
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,195
-Coach Ju.
-Ga-ram.

729
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,447
Hey.

730
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,365
What is that?

731
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,203
Coach.

732
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,498
It's okay.

733
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,761
It really is mine.

734
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,645
I have…

735
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,528
I have been diagnosed
with Myasthenia Gravis.

736
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,699
EPILOGUE

737
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,583
Ma'am.

738
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,257
I'm sorry.
I don't understand what you want.

739
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,552
So I can't persuade Seong-jun.

740
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,720
This is a recoverable injury.

741
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,181
He still has a chance to get into college.

742
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,684
He wants to play rugby.

743
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,729
I have no intention
of standing in the way of his will.

744
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,942
You know better than anyone
that will alone isn't enough.

745
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,862
That might be true.

746
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,613
But…

747
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,784
Seong-jun gets to decide when to retire.

748
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,746
It can be when he gets injured
or when he wants to do something else.

749
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,540
It's not for others to decide,

750
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,877
even if they are his own parents.

751
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,381
He might not succeed
as a rugby player, ever.

752
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,469
But the experience of trying his best
for the things he loves

753
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,887
will last forever.

754
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,850
That experience will help Seong-jun
grow in the future.

755
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:05,106
I won't take away his chance
simply out of fear of failure.

756
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,196
I don't want him to experience failure.

757
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:15,366
I'll make sure that he doesn't fail.

758
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:22,540
Please come and watch him play,
even just once.

759
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,543
I bet he'll be thrilled.

760
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,372
THE WINNING TRY

761
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,873
Did the team have no idea?

762
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,292
They didn't. Leave the boys alone.

763
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,002
Shouldn't we get a resignation letter?

764
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,963
It's a clear cause
for Ms. Kang's dismissal.

765
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,215
Think carefully about whose pills they are

766
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,883
while I'm turning a blind eye.

767
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,176
Coach will come, won't he?

768
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,637
-The school will change the coach.
-Have you gone nuts?

769
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,389
-Are you trying to ruin the team?
-Stop!

770
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,307
How could you say that?

771
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,810
"No player is greater than the team."

772
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,312
No coach is greater than the team either.

773
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,483
I really wanted to fight through it
and go to the Nationals together.

774
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,526
I'm sorry.

775
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,492
