2025 NATIONALS DAY 7
RUGBY FINAL

3
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,475
- Coach.
- Coach.

4
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,229
Be careful.

5
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,192
- Are you all right?
- Hey, stop.

6
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,744
I said

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,872
I'd meet you at the final.

Winning a medal isn't the issue.

11
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,183
It's just a matter of which color.

12
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,100
LAST EPISODE

13
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,812
I heard you had a feud with Seo U-jin.

14
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,730
Why would a coach and his player
have a feud?

15
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,609
A player should follow
their coach's instructions.

16
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,278
Yes. Here, U-jin.

17
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,994
Why are you still here?
The adult division starts soon.

18
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,454
I'm going.

19
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,623
- I'll come back right after my match.
- Okay.

20
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,458
What for? Her head coach is here.

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,918
Here.

22
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,879
Aren't these your earplugs?

23
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,800
Use them if you start hearing nonsense.

24
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,679
Okay, U-jin. Say a few words.

25
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,733
I'll see you later.

26
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,695
<i>The practice shooting will start soon.</i>

27
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:38,491
<i>Please complete your practice</i>
<i>within the given time.</i>

28
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,036
Hey. So, what, you're not even
going to greet me now?

29
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,540
Do you think it's over once you graduate?

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,543
Do you think you can escape my shadow?

31
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:53,339
I have connections in all the colleges,
the pro teams, and with Team Korea.

32
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,717
As long as you shoot,

33
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,469
- you can never--
- Hello, Coach Jeon.

34
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,139
- Hey.
- It's been a while.

35
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,182
Congrats, Gyeongsang City Hall.

36
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,352
- Thank you. You're looking good.
- Everything's good these days.

37
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,605
- So I'm good.
- Who's your key player?

<i>Bae I-ji came close to third place</i>

40
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>However, she is shooting</i>
<i>really well today.</i>

41
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,865
<i>She is in second place.</i>

42
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,367
<i>I heard she was in a slump,</i>
<i>but she's gotten much better.</i>

43
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,493
- Go!
- Go!

44
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,245
<i>Her shots are very stable.</i>

45
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,237

47
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,950
She's in second place!

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,952
Good job, I-ji!

54

<i>Please complete your practice shooting.</i>

55
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,607
Where is our principal?

56
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,068
I haven't seen him.

57
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,404
Is he not here yet?

58
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,408
It's about to start. There he is.

59
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,118
Principal, over here.

60
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,954
You're here. We're just about to start.

61
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,165
You're here, too. Hello. Yes.

62
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,168
Who are they?

63
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,504
Mr. Jeon Nak-gyun.

64
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:01,175
Effective immediately, your position
as Hanyang High's shooting coach

65
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,719
is terminated.

66
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,974
Terminated?

67
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:14,147
This is evidence of all the acts
of admission fraud by Coach Jeon.

68
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,192
What I knew wouldn't have been enough.

69
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,738
But someone
who worked very closely with him

70
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,198
is on our side now.

71
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,785
You? You can't be…

72
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,745
Nak-gyun.

73
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,706
You won't be needing this anymore.

74
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,541
You prick, how dare…

75
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,210
How could you do this to me?

76
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,503
- Let go.
- Calm down.

77
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,422
Geez. Thank you.

78
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,883
Principal.

79
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,261
No, let's talk about this later.

80
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:49,974
What are we doing
in the middle of the competition?

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,519
See?

82
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,190
This is why you should've
taken better care of your people.

83
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,858
Are you cutting me loose?

84
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,610
Just me?

85
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,237
Do you really think you can cut me loose?

86
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,493
From now on,

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,286
keep your mouth shut.

88
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,498
And lie low until I contact you.

89
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,792
This is the only way.

90
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,711
No, Principal.

91
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,839
Principal, that's not it.
No, let go of me.

92
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,633
Let go! What are you doing?

93
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,926
Who are you?

94
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,552
EOM JI-MAN
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

95
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,971
Someone reported you
for assaulting Seo U-jin.

96
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,642
Come with us.

97
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,480
The investigative committee
has already concluded its investigation.

98
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,316
It was an accident, not an assault.
I settled it with her mom--

99
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,401
Her mother is the one who reported it.

100
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,072
It seems you are no longer needed here.

101
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,449
- Let's go.
- No. Let's hear it from her.

102
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,078
Seo U-jin, come here. You tell them.

103
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,997
- You can't come in here.
- It's fine.

104
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,750
I'll just talk to her. Just… Move!

105
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,133
Did I hit you? Did I?

106
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,759
Get him out.

107
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,053
- Darn it. Let go of me!
- You can't go in.

108
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,530
- Are you from Hanyang High?
- Yes.

109
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,158
A high school player can't compete
without a coach.

110
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,911
Is there a coach coming
in place of Coach Jeon?

111
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,248
- I'm a coach, too.
- Do you have a shooting coach license?

112
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
- I'm an aerobics coach.
- What?

113
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,712
You need a coaching license for shooting?

114
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,968
<i>The two-person final</i>
<i>of the 10 m air pistol adult division</i>

<i>will begin in ten minutes.</i>

116
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,600
- The high school division is a mess.
- Why?

117
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,101
Look.

118
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,729
How will this student compete now?

119
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,397
What do we do?

120
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,776
- Darn it. Seriously.
- What now?

121
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,945
What? What's going on?

122
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,322
- I don't know.
- No idea.

123
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,158
- You should go and focus.
- Yes. Focus on the match.

124
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,493
This is the final.

125
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,870
- Give me my bag.
- Your bag?

Hey, Seol-hyeon.

130
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,971
I-ji, don't mind it.

131
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,140
- Focus on your match.
- Focus on the final.

132
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,397
No way.

- Pardon?

137
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
I-ji. Bae I-ji!

138
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,470
What's wrong with you?

139
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
You can't withdraw now.

140
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,766
Mr. Seong fired Nak-gyun.

141
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,061
U-jin needs a coach
in order for her to compete.

142
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,521
I understand, I do.

143
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,523
Just don't withdraw from the match.

144
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,984
Wait ten minutes,
then go after taking one shot.

145
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,402
Yes, I-ji. Come on.

146
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,032
I have to go now.

147
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,909
Come on.

148
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,954
With one shot,
you can get at least a silver medal.

149
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,233
WAY OUT

150
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,454
Coach.

151
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:23,956
How's U-jin?

152
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,709
The match hasn't started yet,
but I think she's withdrawing.

153
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,960
Let's hurry.

154
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,340
Hey, U-jin.

155
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,468
Coach.

156
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,346
What about your match?

157
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,139
My match is over.

158
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,185
- It's because of me, isn't it?
- No.

159
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,980
To be honest,
my match ended a long time ago.

160
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,066
I just couldn't let it go.

161
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,445
With you as my excuse,
I can finally let it go.

162
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,158
You held up well.

163
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,787
U-jin.

164
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,123
Let's compete.

165
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,877
Even if you don't win a medal
or even get a terrible score,

166
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,128
let's still play the match.

167
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,672
Let's leave no regrets.

168
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,552

Are you out of your mind?

174
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,025
You want to get discharged now?
You just got out of surgery.

175
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,612
You need to relax your body and mind
right now.

176
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,698
Exactly. Relax my body and mind.

177
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,575
I can't relax my--

178
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,328
I can't relax my mind here.

179
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,916
As for relaxing my body,
can't you prescribe me some medicine?

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,168
I can't.

181
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,629
Then, let me take a short trip.

182
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,132
Why are you doing this? Why?

183
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,134
- What do you need to do?
- Doctor.

184
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,472
I have a really important promise to keep.

185
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,685
Seven people's lives depend on it!

186
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,242
Coach Ju.

187
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,496
Welcome back.

188
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,020
<i>Coach Ju of Hanyang High!</i>

189
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,898
<i>He finally makes his appearance</i>
<i>at the final.</i>

190
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,115
- Coach.
- Coach.

191
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,173
COACH

192
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,848
You've all done well.

193
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,310
Thank you for keeping our promise
to meet at the final.

194
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,895
You can thank us later.

195
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,399
We still have a job to do.

196
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,858
Hey, what's our goal?

197
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,778
- Winning the Nationals!
- Winning the Nationals!

198
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,238
Don't tell me you forgot.

199
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,698
No way.

200
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,284
He can't do that.
I gave up an exam for this.

201
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,494
I didn't do all this just to not win.

202
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,831
Hey, he's not saying anything
because it's a given.

203
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,624
We'll most definitely win.

204
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
Of course!

205
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,171
- Take it easy.
- Calm down.

206
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,344
Let's win no matter what,

207
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,097
and return with pride.

208
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,144
Gather around.

209
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,439
Push them hard.
Keep your tackle low, not high.

210
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,357
It's Daesang.

211
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,401
That darn Daesang.

212
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,445
They'll play dirty again.

213
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,780
With their strong forwards,
they'll push us for sure.

214
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,992
- Myeong-u, are you going to let them?
- What are you talking about?

215
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,702
- Forwards.
- Yes.

216
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,704
- Are we going to lose again?
- Never!

217
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,374
Hyeong-sik, are you going to fight again?

218
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,086
I'll kill them, all right,
but with my rugby skills!

219
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,216
I'll crush them all with my tackles.

220
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,844
Admiral Yi Sun-sin said,

221
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,848
- "To live is to die. To die is to live."
- We got this!

222
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,391
We just need one more win.

223
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,851
This is the last match.

224
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,353
Let's go all in.

225
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,270
Then today

226
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,564
will be our day.

227
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,484
Hanyang!

228
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,778
- Hanyang! Let's go!
- Let's go!

229
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,029
Go get them!

230
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,621
I-ji.

231
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,122
What happened?

232
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,250
- He is in no state to be discharged.
- He wrote a memorandum.

233
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,670
He has to go straight back to the hospital
after the match.

234
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,298
We got this.

235
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,153
<i>The match has begun.</i>

236
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,947
<i>It's the final</i>
<i>between Hanyang and Daesang,</i>

237
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,282
<i>Daesang and Hanyang.</i>

238
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,162
- Hanyang High!
- Hanyang High!

239
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,748
Hanyang High!

240
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,543
Hanyang High!

241
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,929
Keep the line!

242
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,819
Run!

243
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,906
- Block him.
- Catch him!

244
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,284
HANYANG 0 : 0 DAESANG

245
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,455
Come on.

246
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,332
Tackle him.

247
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,917
Darn it.

248
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,004
Move it!

249
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,923
- Run, Tae-pung.
- We can stop him!

250
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,634
- Go after him!
- Don't let him break through.

251
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,393
<i>Daesang High scores the first try</i>
<i>of the match!</i>

252
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,478
It's okay!

253
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,564
There you go!

254
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,899
FIRST HALF 0 : 7

255
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,402
- It's okay!
- It's okay. There's plenty of time.

256
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,820
We can do it.

257
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,157
It's all right. We'll get it back.
It's okay.

258
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,075
We got this!

259
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,336
- Good.
- Run for the line!

260
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,590
Number 7, stop Seong-jun. Tackle him!

261
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,634
- Run!
- Run!

262
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,764
- Yes!
- Yes.

263
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,266
- <i>Hanyang High's try!</i>
- Seong-jun.

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,228
- Go, Seong-jun!
<i>- That's how you score as a team.</i>

265
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,733
2025 NATIONALS RUGBY FINAL
HANYANG 7 : 7 DAESANG

266
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,570
No. Pass!

267
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,704
Get the ball out!

268
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,751
- Yes!
- Yes!

269
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,044
Hey, be careful.

270
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,883
Get your head in the game!

271
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,054
- Block him!
- Yeong-gwang!

272
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,812
HANYANG 12 : 14 DAESANG

273
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,771
Hanyang!

274
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,523
Let's turn it around before halftime.

275
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,611
I'll crush you.

276
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,204
- Get it out.
- Okay.

277
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,129
Foul! A high tackle!

278
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,255
That was high!

279
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,756
We're losing the ball!

280
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,717
Just mark one person each.

281
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,385
Get him!

282
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,472
Hyeong-sik.

283
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,268
- <i>The whistle blows for halftime.</i>
- Hyeong-sik.

284
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:51,273
Hanyang's Number 4, Do Hyeong-sik,
seemed to have been badly injured.

285
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,817
<i>Will he be able to play the second half?</i>

286
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>Hanyang High doesn't have a bench member.</i>

287
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,155
- We have to see.
- I'm really fine.

288
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,823
What? Wait.

289
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,034
- He's bleeding badly.
- Am I?

290
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,830
I'm really fine.

291
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,749
Don't worry about me.

292
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,500
I can play fine.

293
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,002
It needs stitches under anesthesia.

294
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,962
The wound is big,
and it won't stop bleeding.

295
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,424
He might not be able to open his right eye
after anesthesia.

296
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,967
- He can't go back in.
- I'm fine.

297
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,595
Just put a big bandage on it.

298
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,554
No, wait.

299
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,393
Seong-jun, six players will play
the second half.

300
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,937
I…

301
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
Coach, I can play.

302
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,025
- I'm all right. I'm really fine.
- Hyeong-sik.

303
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,403
It needs to be stitched up.

304
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,822
A bandage won't do.

305
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,075
Can I play if I stitch it up
without anesthesia?

306
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,826
- Hyeong-sik.
- Coach!

307
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,082
Would you give up if you were me?

308
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,294
This is our first final.

309
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,174
I can't give up now.

310
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,262
Please hurry.

311
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,108
- Daesang!
- Yes, sir!

312
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,901
We'll push them harder in the second half.

313
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,279
They have no one on the bench,

314
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,115
so run them over if you have to.

315
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,242
- Okay?
- Yes!

316
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,495
- Hyeong-sik is better and back!
- Hyeong-sik.

317
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,706
- Hey.
- Hyeong-sik.

318
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,541
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

319
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,128
If I were a crybaby, I'd say my right eye
is a bit out of focus.

320
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:41,425
But they need that much of an advantage
for the match to be even.

321
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,469
What's with the mood? I'm really fine.

322
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,221
Right, Coach?

323
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,068
Your legs will be shaky.

324
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,488
Every part of your body will hurt.

325
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,535
It'll be the longest
seven minutes of your life.

326
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,371
But,

327
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,124
if you get through this,

328
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,378
this moment will become our highlight.

329
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,218
Have we got this?

330
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,597
- Yes!
- Yes!

331
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,516
Let's chant.

332
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,187
Hanyang!

333
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,938
- Hanyang! Let's go!
- Let's go!

334
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,734
- We can do it.
- Hyeong-sik.

335
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,287
<i>Do Hyeong-sik comes back to the ground</i>
<i>after getting treated.</i>

336
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,040
- <i>Please give him a big round of applause.</i>
- Let's go!

337
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,918
HANYANG 12 : 14 DAESANG

338
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,212
- Hey, get back at them.
- Go get them!

339
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,465
Go!

340
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,221
Good, run. Don't get pushed back! Pass it.

341
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,889
- Yes. Run.
- Get him!

342
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,022
HANYANG 12 : 19 DAESANG

343
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,149
- Nice.
- Stop him.

344
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,154
- Ju-yang.
- Yes.

345
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,141
MAUL
PUSHING FORWARD WHILE HOLDING THE BALL

346
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,809
- Maul!
- Bind onto him!

347
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,230
Let go!

348
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,826
Go! Push!

349
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,746
<i>It's a maul.</i>

350
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,709
<i>They are engaging</i>
<i>in a head-on battle of strength.</i>

351
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,752
<i>Which team will push forward?</i>

352
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,379
<i>This maul will decide</i>

353
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,423
- <i>the winner of the gold medal.</i>
- Push!

354
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,466
A little more!

355
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,221
- Push!
- Push!

356
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,640
Kill them!

357
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,643
Push!

358
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,896
Faster!

359
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,357
Until the end!

360
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,361
Let's start the match.

361
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:08,423
Hey, who wears cleats on asphalt?
You'll mess up your ankles.

362
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,636
While naturally stretching your arms
forward like this.

363
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,721
<i>Our player is here.</i>

364
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,688
<i>Let's make a miracle happen.</i>

365
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,951
<i>Unite the hearts of all seven,</i>

366
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,827
<i>and play as one.</i>

367
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,538
<i>We're not a team of seven</i>

368
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,833
<i>but of eight, including Coach, aren't we?</i>

369
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,835
Hanyang!

370
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,964
Hanyang!

371
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,289
HANYANG 22 : 19 DAESANG

372
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,042
<i>Hanyang High won!</i>

373
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,545
<i>Hanyang High is the champion</i>
<i>of the Nationals.</i>

374
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,882
<i>Coach Ju brings a trophy</i>
<i>to his alma mater,</i>

375
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,093
<i>successfully starting his first chapter</i>
<i>as a coach.</i>

376
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,183
- Right. Thanks.
- Congrats.

377
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,559
Congratulations.

378
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,737
Didn't I say we were going to win?

379
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,127
Good job. Congratulations.

380
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,837
Thank you.

381
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,843
Well done.

382
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,057
Good job.

383
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,352
- I did a good job, didn't I, Father?
- You did.

384
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,405
- Coach.
- You guys were awesome.

385
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,490
- We really won.
- We won.

386
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,869
I'm so proud of you guys.

387
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:35,588
Coach. Thank you.

388
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,449
HANYANG'S ALL-TIME BEST RECORD

389
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,325
FENCING PARK IL-HWAN
SHOOTING SEO U-JIN, GOLD

390
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,577
HANYANG RUGBY TEAM CHAMPIONS

391
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,414
Hanyang earned its best record
at the Nationals.

392
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,374
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

393
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,502
I encountered many challenges
upon my appointment.

394
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,088
I had to control all the messy situations.

395
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:21,050
More than anything, I focused
on getting the players mentally prepared.

396
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,721
The Rugby Team's victory after 15 years
is the talk of the town.

397
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,474
What's the secret behind the team's win
at the Nationals

398
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,018
when they got nearly disbanded
for not doing well?

399
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,687
Excuse me.

400
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,855
COACH JEON NAK-GYUN

401
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,151
Right. The secret?

402
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,782
There were indeed some people
who insisted on disbanding the team.

403
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,160
But I saw their potential.

404
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,705
That's why
I've supported them proactively.

405
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,500
THE NATIONALS
1. HANYANG HIGH

406
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,794
Good job at the Nationals.

407
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,711
- Yes.
- Yes.

408
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,088
Now that it's over,

409
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:03,468
we should handle what we put aside.

410
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,430
The Office of Education
will appoint a new vice principal.

411
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,390
We're missing
the head of physical education.

412
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,394
- Would the track and field coach do it?
- Pardon?

413
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,191
Sure. Thank you. I'll do my best.

414
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,529
For the head coaches and coaches
whose contracts end this year,

415
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,323
your contract renewal will be based

416
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,742
on the interview
and the Nationals' result.

417
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,411
Right. Coach Bang and Coach Bae.

418
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,080
No, is it Acting Coach Bae?

419
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,416
You two don't need to do the interview.

420
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,501
Hold on.

421
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,004
The Aerobics Team won gold

422
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,674
in the mixed team
and silver in the women's individual.

423
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,551
What stops my contract renewal?

424
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,722
Do you really not know?

425
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,808
No, so please tell me.

426
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,024
We're having a meeting!

427
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,026
An inspection by the Office of Education.

428
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,612
An inspect…

429
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,990
- Who ordered it?
- Right.

430
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,493
That would be me.

431
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,706
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

432
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,425
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

433
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,385
You're making a mistake.

434
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,179
No, I'm correcting one.

435
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,473
You can search here,
but you'll find nothing.

436
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,226
I'm not that clumsy.

437
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,520
You're right.

438
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,023
You've probably mapped out a perfect plan.

439
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:45,069
But my daughter told me
that every game has a variable.

440
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,616
Usually, that variable is a person.

441
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,955
What brings you here?

442
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,250
You got a report
on Ex-Coach Jeon Nak-gyun, didn't you?

443
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,255
Are you here to threaten me?

444
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,675
Threatening is not my thing.

445
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,929
I'm here because
I want to tell you something.

446
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,013
What is it?

447
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,265
Most of the players,

448
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,103
they can't really remember
how many times they lost.

449
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,813
But

450
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,068
the games they didn't play fairly
stay with them as trauma.

451
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,031
Seol-hyeon wanted a victory
that she earned herself,

452
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:34,285
not a medal that was given to her
against her will.

453
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,121
I want Hanyang High

454
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,668
to encourage students to lose with dignity
rather than win dishonorably.

455
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,003
And teach them

456
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,839
how to bounce back from it.

457
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,258
That's the school I dream of.

458
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,929
It shows how Mr. Seong Jong-man,

459
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,765
while serving as the department head
and vice principal,

460
00:32:55,848 --> 00:33:00,019
used the funds from outside sponsors
for other teams and siphoned them off.

461
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,814
Former Coach Jeon had it.

462
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,860
He wanted me to tell you this,
"Didn't I say I wouldn't go down alone?"

463
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,116
Jeon Nak-gyun, that piece of…

464
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,877
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

465
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,214
How does it feel to be fired?

466
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,392
Do you know what the most common delusion
among coaches is?

467
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,520
- What is it?
- Thinking that they're different.

468
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:48,568
They delude themselves
thinking they can be good instructors,

469
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,570
not knowing their place.

470
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,616
Don't belittle what you couldn't achieve
as a delusion.

471
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,745
What we're doing isn't a delusion.

472
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,913
It's called trying our best.

473
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,000
We're trying our best to be good adults.

474
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,795
You'll see.

475
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,841
A time will come
when you'll make the same choice as I did.

476
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,512
You can't escape
from results and numbers…

477
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,058
in this world.

478
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,061
When the time comes,

479
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,148
I'll recall you at this moment.

480
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,735
Goodbye.

481
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,421
We don't have a principal
or a vice principal.

482
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,965
With my new position,
I need new sunglasses.

483
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,425
Should I go for it?

484
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,765
We don't have a principal
or a vice principal,

485
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,811
so I'll lead the meeting
for the time being.

486
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,728
Okay.

487
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,189
No, you're crossing the line.
This isn't aerobics.

488
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,652
I should lead the meeting
as I'm the head of physical education.

489
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,029
- He's just leading the meeting.
- Yes. The head…

490
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,156
- will lead.
- Why are you being so picky?

491
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,741
Don't be so sensitive.

492
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,327
- The head is…
- Principal!

493
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,788
Ms. Kang.

494
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,917
I'm not late for the meeting, am I?

495
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,549
I'm Principal Kang,
who will be retiring from Hanyang High.

496
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,802
Please help me out
for the last two months.

497
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,809
Are your glasses filled?

498
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,435
- Yes.
- Yes.

499
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,480
Okay. The glasses are filled, Principal.

500
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,737
You did an amazing job at the Nationals.

501
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,031
Let's make a toast.

502
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,783
For…

503
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,494
- Hanyang.
- Hanyang!

504
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,456
- Well done.
- Well done.

505
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,585
Are you that happy?

506
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,796
I'm so happy that you're back, Ms. Kang.

507
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,047
- Thank you.
- Me too.

508
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,466
- Geez.
- Me too, Ms. Kang.

509
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,509
I know.

510
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,345
- Principal!
- Jesus Christ.

511
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,264
Sorry.

512
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,642
It's all right.

513
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,604
Please take care of the Fencing Team.

514
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,605
- Okay.
- Cheers.

515
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,190
I knew you'd be back.

516
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,650
- I love you, Principal.
- Geez.

517
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,029
I prayed every day for you to come back.

518
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,115
- Come on.
- Cheers.

519
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,702
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

520
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,627
Don't cause any trouble
for the next two months,

521
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,882
- so we can hold your retirement ceremony.
- Oh, no. What do I do?

522
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,468
I have one more big news.

523
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,306
Okay. Everyone.

524
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,228
Everything is on me, so help yourselves!

525
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,485
- Principal Kang!
- Principal Kang!

526
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,029
- Principal Kang!
- Principal Kang!

527
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,825
Our Aerobics Team won gold this time
in the team event.

528
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,703
- We got 80 points.
- The Shooting Team won five medals.

529
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,749
- By the way…
- Yeah?

530
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,875
Aren't you upset?

531
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:38,422
- What? About retiring as a player?
- Yes. You prepared hard for the Nationals.

532
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,591
I didn't expect you to give up.

533
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,512
There is one thing I'm certain about.

534
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,266
I've done my best as a player.

535
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,227
And that includes

536
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,938
this year's Nationals.

537
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,109
I didn't give up.
I made a different choice.

538
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,740
I may not have been a great player,
but wasn't it a good start as a coach?

539
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,829
Yes. You were so cool.

540
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,709
I might be

541
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,752
jobless next year.

542
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,795
What?

543
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,965
I might not be able to renew my contract.

544
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,800
So I don't know

545
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,344
how it'll be like next year.

546
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,929
But?

547
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,807
I want to be by your side.

548
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,604
Can I do that?

549
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,028
- Are you angry?
- Yes.

550
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,654
- Why?
- Ju Ga-ram.

551
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,074
I thought we were seeing each other again.
You said you loved me.

552
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,494
- No, it's not like that.
- Why? Are you going to ghost me again?

553
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,040
I dare you. I'll bring a real gun.
I might shoot you for real.

554
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,460
- It's not that.
- Geez. Just stay by my side.

555
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,714
- Okay.
- You're so dense.

556
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,923
No, I'm not.

557
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,468
You're the dense one.

558
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,844
What?

559
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,387
What's this?

560
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,644
Do you not like it?

561
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,107
I like it more than a medal.

562
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,791
I love you.

563
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,678
I love you.

564
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,828
Dear gods,

565
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:19,250
- allow my family to fulfill their wishes.
- Please.

566
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,086
I beg of you.

567
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,963
I pray.

568
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,382
Okay, good. Let's go now.

569
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,425
Yes?

570
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,511
- Let's go.
- Hey.

571
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,555
Isn't it cringey to bring flowers?

572
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,390
You need flowers for a celebration.

573
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,850
- That's true.
- Yes.

574
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,019
What if he fails…

575
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,771
- Darn it.
- You come here.

576
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,940
Wait. The four-leaf clover.

577
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,650
The four-leaf clover.

578
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,152

- One, two, three, four.
- Dear gods.

589
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,426
- Please.
- Dear Buddha.

590
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,219
- We pray.
- What are you doing?

591
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,680
It's all about energy.
We're putting our energy together.

592
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,893
By the way, where's Coach?

593
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,728
I'm here.

594
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,356
I'm nervous.

595
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,317
- Go.
- You have to go for it.

596
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,902
- Go.
- Let's go.

597
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,698
What?

598
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,659
- I really can't do it. You do it.
- Me? You're the brave one.

599
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,829
- I'm way too nervous.
- I can't do it.

600
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,000
- Geez!
- Hey. Hold it.

601
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,627
Coach, you do it.

602
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,587
- Hurry.
- Darn it.

603
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,255
- I'll look with you.
- Do I really…

604
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,423
Don't click it yet.

605
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,634
- Wait.
- Why did you click it?

606
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,344
He clicked it.

607
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,303
You did it.

608
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,554
Hey! You got in!

609
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,349

612
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,367
You got in.

613
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,410

00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,457

I'll get every kind of soda.

And hashbrown…

620
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,270
What? The Nationals are over.

621
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,730
It was so hard being on a diet.

622
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,109
- I was so hungry that--
- It's okay. Have them all.

623
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,569
Really?

624
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,153
I'll get the steak sandwich.

625
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,573
We'll all have them, as you recommend.

626
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,492
And for him, just give him everything.

627
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,495
- Cookies.
- Cookies, too.

628
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,581

629
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,498
Okay. Let's eat.

00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,083
- Thank you for the food.
- Yes!

631
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,084
Let's eat.

632
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,002
GOT ACCEPTED

633
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,504
Thank you.

634
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,966
Look at my sandwich.

635
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,552
Nice. This is so fresh.

636
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,766
You've all done great.

637
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,685
I appreciate it.

638
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,563
- It's all thanks to me, you know, right?
- Thanks to us.

639
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,690
Right. All thanks to us.

640
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,483
Don't you forget that.

641
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,568
Don't tell me

642
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,405
you're buying this and calling it even.

643
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,241
- No way.
- Okay.

644
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,076
- Even when I'm in college,
- Yes.

645
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,953
I'll come visit you with sandwiches.

646

652
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,009
Wow, I raised a national athlete.

653
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,137
Hey. What have you ever done for Ung?

654
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,180
I cared!

655
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,684
I gave him love and support.

656
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,732
Are you leaving?

657
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,317
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

658
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,777
Hold on.

659
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,073
Don't get hurt.

660
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,241
- Stay healthy.
- Okay.

661
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,951
Don't forget me.

662
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,496
Hey. He'll be back
after three weeks of training.

663
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,664
You're so dramatic.

664
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,207
Let's go.

665
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,501
I'll send him off.

666
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,378
- Okay. We'll see you.
- Okay.

667
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,462
Should I come, too?

668
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,422
- Hey.
- It's okay.

669
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,133
- Let's go.

670
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,516
Congratulations.

671
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,438
Thank you.

672
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:38,610
I heard the National Youth Team
plays with Yonhee University sometimes.

673
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,738
We might meet as opponents.

674
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,908
I won't go easy on you.

675
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,202
Me neither.

676
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,463
Good luck, and see you soon.

677
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,380

This is the National Youth Team's coach,
Mo Sang-gi.

682
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,545
This is Hanyang's rookie, Mun Ung.

683
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,130
Hello.

684
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,381
Nice to meet you.

685
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,802
You can go up that way.
Someone will help you.

686
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,554
Okay.

687
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,516
Get in.

688
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,601
See you.

689
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,117
You didn't change your number.

690
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,540
Right. And you didn't delete my number.

691
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,211
I heard you had surgery.

692
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:23,173
Seeing you walking around fine,
it must not have been serious.

693
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,468
That's because it's me.
If it were you, you'd be long dead, jerk.

694
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,137
That mouth of yours. Geez.

695
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,727
- Take care of my boy.
- He's my boy now.

696
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,729
Go now.

697
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,606
I'll call you.

00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,227
Hey, smile.

704
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,229
It's not like
we won't see each other forever.

705
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,234
Yeong-gwang and Myeong-u won't play rugby,
so we won't see each other as much.

706
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,944
Geez.

707
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,700
Don't go causing trouble
after we're gone. Okay?

708
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:36,455
- Especially you, Hyeong-sik.
- Do you see me as a troublemaker?

709
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,623
You're the captain now.

710
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,500
Set an example.

711
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:41,918
What?

712
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,005
The badge is heavier than you think.

713
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,966
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

714
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,801
- I'm the captain.
- Is it heavy?

715
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,637
- We're in our third year.
- It's heavy.

716
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,639
Thank you.

717
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,224
Are you ready?

718
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,225
- Yes.
- Yes.

719
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,286
All of you…

720
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,456
did a great job.

721
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,210
I was…

722
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,381
I was a rookie coach.

723
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,550
Especially when…

724
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,098
I was called a juicer at that…

725
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,685
you guys accepted me,

726
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,104
trusted me, and listened to me.

727
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,899
Thank you so much.

728
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,075
You have made me…

729
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,746
a real coach.

730
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,042
Myeong-u.

731
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,505
Yeong-gwang.

732
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,512
Seong-jun.

733
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,931
Yes.

734
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,602
Congratulations on your graduation.

735
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,789
Let's chant. Shall we?

736
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,543
Let's chant.

737
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,131
You all did great.

738
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,384
Thank you for following
along with us third-years.

739
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,722
Hanyang!

740
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:06,605
Hanyang!

741
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,365
Congrats.

742
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,659
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

743
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,995
THE 44TH HANYANG HIGH GRADUATION
CLASS OF 2026

744
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,590
HANYANG HIGH
CONGRATS ON YOUR GRADUATION

745
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,029
I have something to say.

746
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,241
It's not something weird or strange.

747
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,993
I really need to consult with you
about something.

748
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,205
Okay.

749
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,756
- Good luck, Seong-jun!
- Good luck!

750
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,144
What is it?

751
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,273
I…

752
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,319
I want to change my position.

753
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,280
Why are you telling me that?

754
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,365
I need your permission.

755
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,869
From now on,

756
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,038
I don't want to be your friend.

757
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,459
I want to be your boyfriend.

758
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,891
It's a sunflower.

759
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,476
It looks like a gold medal in a way.

760
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,729
And sunflowers

761
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,273
only look at the sun.

762
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,900
What I mean is,

763
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,903
I only look at you too.

764
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,116
Do you not like flowers?

765
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,203
Then, I got you this too.

766
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,080
It's a keychain.

767
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,795
I'm not kidding around.

768
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,547
I'm being serious.

769
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,175
Hand.

770
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,723
Consider them as a graduation gift, then.

771
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,933
Your hand.

772
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,613
Daehan Sport University is very far
from Yonhee University.

773
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,907
It'll take over an hour by subway.

774
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,786
We won't be able to see each other often
because of our training schedule.

775
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,329
Will that be okay?

776
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,747
Yeah.

777
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,250
- What?
- Are you okay

778
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,835
with a long-distance relationship?

779
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,797
Of course.

780
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,175
I'll go to you when I don't have training.
I'll take a cab.

781
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,511
I'll take the subway
when I don't have money.

782
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,513
If I miss the last subway,
I'll run to you.

783
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,015
That's good cardio.

784
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,725
Yes.

785
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,730
I really like you.

786
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,441
I know.

787
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,819
Let's go to the ceremony.

788
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,414
This is mine.
Yours is a rugby ball, and mine's a gun.

789
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,082
That's cute.

790
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,128
Now, the principal
will give a congratulatory speech.

791
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,006
THE 44TH HANYANG HIGH GRADUATION
CLASS OF 2026

792
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:06,177
I know that your time
at Hanyang Physical Education High School

793
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,554
was no easy task.

794
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,266
At times, you were exhausted
from hard training.

795
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,477
Sometimes, you break down from failure.

796
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,605
But those tough moments

797
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,025
will help you stay strong

798
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:25,196
as you move forward in life.

799
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,201
Don't hesitate or be afraid. Go forward.

800
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,705
I'll root for your future.

801
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,375
Congratulations on your graduation.

802
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:51,222
I'll introduce you
to the head coaches for this year.

803
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,185
First, the Aerobics Team.

804
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,856
Coach Bang Heung-nam! It's me again!

805
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,943
Let's work hard again this year!

806
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,196
Next, the Fencing Team's
Coach Gye Chun-sik.

807
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:09,324
Fencing! En garde.

808
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:13,119
Track and Field Team,
let's chase the medals once more!

809
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,662
Let's shoot our arrows,

810
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,083
not just for the Archery Team,
but for everyone's future!

811
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,879
The head coach
for the Shooting Team this year

812
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,547
is Coach Bae I-ji.

813
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,633
Yes!

814
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,680
Coach Bae!

815
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:37,268
- Bae I-ji!
- Bae I-ji!

816
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,527
I'll be a coach
who always puts my shooters first.

817
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,486
I'm Bae I-ji.

818
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,538
Lastly, the Rugby Team.

819
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,498
- It's us.
- The head coach of rugby…

820
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,964
The rugby coach is…

821
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,806
Please.

822
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,100
Ju Ga-ram.

823
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,311
- Come on!
- Stop dragging!

824
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,729
Coach Bang!

825
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,857
- It's so frustrating.
- Coach.

826
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,776
Coach Ju Ga-ram!

827
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,880
Rugby Team, calm down.

828
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,965
Hey, stop. Calm down.

829
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,343
Quiet.

830
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,722
Hello. I'm Coach Ju Ga-ram.

831
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,936
Ju Ga-ram!

832
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,856
I'll only say one thing.

833
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,901
Our goal this year is…

834
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:13,948
- Winning the Nationals!
- Winning the Nationals!

835
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:20,079
Yes, it's winning the Nationals!

836
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,582
Winning the Nationals!

837
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:33,676
- Ju Ga-ram!
- Ju Ga-ram!

838
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:05,166
EPILOGUE

839
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,101
- Sorry.
- Hey, Tae-pung.

840
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,060
- Sorry.
- Darn it.

841
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,228
Welcome back, punk.

842
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,938
What took you so long?

843
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,985
- Come here.
- Sorry.

844
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,697
Sorry. Geez.

845
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,578
SPECIAL THANKS TO
KWON YUL AND SEO JEONG-YEON
