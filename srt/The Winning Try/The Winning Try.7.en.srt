2022 ASIAN RUGBY CUP DOPING INVESTIGATION

00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,511
Mr. Ju, are the doping allegations true?

6
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,055
- Where did you get the substances?
- What's its name?

7
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,850
Did you do it alone?
Or are others involved too?

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,362
I'm going to retire.

00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,640
What are you doing?

12
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,395
Did you really dope?

13
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,524
You didn't, right?

14
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,537
Say something, for God's sake.

15
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,583
- Say what?
- Ga-ram!

16
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,670
Give me an excuse, at least!

17
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,214
Would it make any difference?

18
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,382
What?

19
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,016
How could you…

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,852
How could you do this to me?

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,520
- Sang-gi!
- You can't do this.

22
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,189
Let go!

23
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,528
You're nothing to me, jerk.

24
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,131
Be gone for good.

Excuse me. Are you all right?

35
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,773
- Are you okay?
- Did he faint?

36
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,900
- Please call 911.
- Are you okay?

37
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,277
- Goodness!
- Should we do CPR?

38
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,057
Myasthenia Gravis.

39
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,689
Is that why you disappeared
three years ago?

40
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,033
Is this the truth

EXAMINATION ROOM
JU **-RAM, NEUROLOGY

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,010
<i>It has relapsed.</i>

44
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,892
The acetylcholine receptor antibody levels
have visibly increased.

45
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,687
The respiratory system
is the biggest problem.

46
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,064
On this CT scan,

47
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,901
you can see a lump on the thymus
that could possibly be a tumor.

48
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,029
Given its size and location,
surgery will be necessary.

49
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,616
We'll schedule it
once we receive the detailed results.

50
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,327
Can it be operated on right away?

51
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,620
No, I-ji.

52
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,789
I can't undergo surgery.

53
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,834
The Presidents Cup is coming up soon,
and the Nationals are in two months.

54
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,337
They can't compete without a coach.

55
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,546
Doctor.

56
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,634
Please let me get through
just three more months.

57
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,809
Since I can't force you to have surgery,

58
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,353
I will prescribe medication instead.

59
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,064
Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.

60
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,722
I'm sorry you had to find out like this.

61
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,683
Were you even going to tell me?

62
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
I was.

63
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,061
When?

64
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,230
Three years ago…

65
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,070
before the national tryouts
when you shot all tens. That day.

66
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,781
- I-ji.
- Yes?

67
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,827
Apparently, I'm unwell.

68
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,665
Why didn't you tell me then?

69
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,503
It was a crucial moment in your career.

00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,311
Let's go back to school.

73
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,188
Go back to school?

74
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,314
I-ji.

75
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,357
How can I, after seeing you like that?

76
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,527
Why would you oppose surgery
when it's a viable treatment?

77
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,904
I told you.

78
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,282
For the third-years Seong-jun, Myeong-u,
and Yeong-gwang,

79
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,242
this is their last chance.

80
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,661
I can't let them miss it.

81
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,247
What if they find out
you're risking your life for them?

82
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,625
Do you really think
they'll be grateful then?

83
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,586
If you collapse, just like
how I broke down three years ago,

84
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,588
- the players will--
- Just three months.

85
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,842
Please turn a blind eye
for just three months.

86
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,727
So if I keep my mouth shut,
it all goes away?

87
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,316
You're such a jerk.

88
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,374
- Coach!
- Coach!

89
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,211
- What is it?
- Have you seen Coach Ju?

90
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,885
I don't know.

91
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,222
Did he run away after all that talk
about dominating the Nationals?

92
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,765
He's the one who got me into rugby.

93
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,893
- Let's go catch him.
- We need to find out where he is first.

94
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,562
- We should persuade--
- There he is!

95
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,813
Where?

96
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,982
- Coach!
- Coach!

97
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,734
- Coach!
- Coach!

98
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,405
- Coach!
- Coach!

99
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,198
What's going on?

100
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,994
How could you go missing
with the match coming up so soon?

101
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,413
The whole school flipped out.
We'll be punished again.

102
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,622
Seriously!

103
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,543
I really thought you ran away,
for God's sake!

104
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,794
Geez. Quiet down.

105
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,505
- Why would I run away?
- Everyone thought you bailed.

106
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
Come on, he's still our coach.

107
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,008
Don't ever go…

108
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,513
- I-ji.
- You're going nowhere.

109
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
- I-ji.
- Don't move.

110
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,641
Come on!

111
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,105
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

112
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,608
It just doesn't make any sense.

113
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,151
You fell asleep at the sauna?

114
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,195
All that hard training left me sore.

115
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,575
I was going to shake off my fatigue,
but ended up falling asleep.

116
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,789
Coach Ju, do you take an ambulance
to the sauna?

117
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,420
We confirmed that an ambulance
came last night.

118
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,467
Only Coach Ju and Coach Bae
were missing from the school.

119
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,436
Okay. Now that Coach Bae is here,
tell us what happened.

120
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,526
Even if they were taken by an ambulance,
it's a personal matter.

121
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,444
No, it isn't.

122
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,323
A coach's health isn't a personal matter.

123
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,495
The school needs to know
whether or not they can coach students.

124
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,292
If he needed an ambulance,
he's in no condition to train anyone.

125
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,880
Also, we ran into each other
at the hospital the other day.

126
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,890
You seem to go there often.
If it wasn't for Coach Ju, was it you?

127
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,518
Do you really have a problem, Coach Bae?

128
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,771
She has nothing to do with this.
Actually--

129
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,855
I have the yips.

130
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,695
What? You said you didn't have it.

131
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,073
Yes. I didn't want to admit it back then.

132
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,826
I couldn't pull the trigger
when I was training.

133
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,664
And I slammed my fist out of anger
and cut my hand.

134
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,749
I-ji. I mean, Coach Bae.

135
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,336
Be honest. Ga-ram went to the hospital.

136
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,966
He went with me
because I needed a guardian.

137
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:02,346
It just so happened that Coach Ju
was there at the time. By chance?

138
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,474
- Yes.
- You expect us to believe that?

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,519
Coach Bae.

140
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,522
Do you even know what that means?

141
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,193
It means you would have to stop coaching
from now on.

142
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,656
We can't entrust our players to a coach
who can't even shoot.

143
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,705
Do you still insist
that you have the yips?

144
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,011
Yes.

145
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,638
That's not true.

146
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,223
Coach Ju.

147
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,726
Thank you for yesterday.

148
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,146
I'll get a doctor's note
if you don't believe me.

149
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,689
You need proof, right?

150
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,237
I-ji.

151
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,865
This isn't right.

152
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,618
This is my problem.
Why did you take the bullet?

153
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,411
I told them the truth.

154
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,996
I do have the yips.

155
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,414
You knew about it too.

156
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,169
Let's take it back.

157
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,089
- Let's go back, and tell them honestly--
- And say what?

158
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,094
"I was hospitalized for Myasthenia Gravis.
It's so bad I need immediate surgery."

159
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,930
Are you going to confess like that?

160
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,723
What comes after that?

161
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,226
Didn't you say it was their last chance?

162
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:35,314
If the school finds out, you won't last
three days, let alone three months.

163
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,775
Go do your job.

164
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,610
I'll take care of myself.

165
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,487
I-ji.

166
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,000
I…

167
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,961
I'm sorry…

168
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,590
for putting so much on you.

169
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,724
I promise.

170
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,892
By any means,

171
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,603
we'll win the Nationals.

172
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,776
And I'll find a way
to help you get over your yips.

173
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,491
Just hang in there.

174
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,980
There's something suspicious

175
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,816
- about Ga-ram.
- It's definitely strange.

176
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,613
It's also fishy that I-ji said
he went to the hospital with her.

177
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,240
You said you saw him at the hospital.

178
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,825
Yes, I certainly did.

179
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,621
The real problem is
whether we can get concrete evidence.

180
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,290
There's the medical and privacy law.

181
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,627
We can use other channels to get them.

182
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,504
Right. Did you check the doctor's note?

183
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,674
It'll get here tomorrow,
so I'll check it then.

184
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,678
But seriously. I-ji, that idiot.

185
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:35,768
She must have hated me back then
to the point that it gave her the yips.

186
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,144
Why would she hate you?

187
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:42,232
To be honest, I told her
to make Seol-hyeon qualify.

188
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,818
And she listened to me.

189
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,030
- To her, it felt like rigging--
- Coach Jeon.

190
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,660
You're drunk. Watch what you're saying.

191
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,163
Yes, I'm drunk. Sorry.

192
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,668
Jong-man, you don't have to worry
about Heung-nam.

193
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,254
He's on our side. Aren't you?

194
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,756
Of course.

195
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,883
I've been on your side since day one.

196
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,010
- Let's drink.
- Yes.

197
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,304
Think of me as an older brother.

198
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,193
Hello.

199
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,081
Let's go, Hanyang.

200
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,048
You just got out of the hospital, idiot.

201
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,194
I'm sorry, I-ji.

202
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,572
You knew all along, didn't you?

203
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,367
Why Ga-ram disappeared.

204
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,453
Where he was.

205
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,249
You knew the whole time
I was looking for him like a madwoman.

206
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,626
He wanted to tell you himself.

207
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,339
That's probably one of the reasons
he came back to the school.

208
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,343
But how could he deceive me like that?

209
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,514
Because I had no idea,
I cursed him every day.

210
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,727
"You can't be happy."

211
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,106
Is that why he ended up like that?

212
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,234
That's a ridiculous thought.

213
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,613
Was I really that hard to trust?

214
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,157
It's not that he didn't trust you.

215
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,452
He didn't want to be a burden.

216
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,832
It's a miracle
that he's standing like that.

217
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,335
That was how bad he was.

218
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,133
He thought you would shoot better
if you were oblivious to the truth.

219
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,052
How would that be possible?

220
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,304
Ga-ram…

221
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,270
Ga-ram was part of my routine.

222
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,859
What if they find out
you're risking your life for them?

223
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,778
If you collapse, just like
how I broke down three years ago,

224
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,072
- the players will--
- Just three months.

225
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,660
Please turn a blind eye
for just three months.

226
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,123
You're such a jerk.

227
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,836
ANADROL

228
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,374
I see.

229
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,544
You had the yips.

230
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,259
I told you to tell the Association this,
didn't I?

231
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,471
People wouldn't have
misunderstood you then.

232
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
YIPS SYNDROME

233
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,269
Considering this,
I can't give you any coaching tasks.

234
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,069
I can manage the team just fine.
You don't do the paperwork anyway.

235
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,321
- I'll do it.
- No.

236
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,282
That's a job for a qualified coach.
You don't have a say in it.

237
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,994
It's bad for the players

238
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,914
to have a coach with the yips
in the shooting range.

239
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,877
Pack your stuff. You're banned
until you're fully recovered.

240
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,422
Good luck with that.

241
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,511
What? Why aren't you practicing?

242
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,543
SHOOTING RANGE
RESTRICTED AREA

243
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,420
MATCH ENTRY FORM - INDIVIDUAL

244
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,088
Fill it in carefully.

245
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,465
Write your correct blood type
and position.

246
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,634
Don't lie about your height and weight.

247
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,137
I won't.

248
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,223
WEIGHT: 99.8 KG

249
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,686
These forms will be handed to the hospital
in case of an accident.

250
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,651
WEIGHT: 115 KG

251
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,448
What is it?

252
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,076
Well…

253
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,037
It's the Shooting Team.

254
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,246
Go on.

255
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,625
Coach Bae was kicked out
from the shooting range.

256
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,008
Here are the player profiles
for the Presidents Cup.

257
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,097
I checked the doctor's note for Coach Bae.

258
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,516
Recovering from the yips isn't easy.

259
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,103
People usually retire
if they get the yips at that age.

260
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,191
Coach Bae is anything but usual.

261
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,665
SHOOTING TEAM

262
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,252
Goodness.

263
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,798
What are you doing?

264
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,176
You're not allowed here.
Are you ignoring me?

265
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,053
I'm outside the shooting range.

266
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,931
Why so rebellious?
Are you standing up to me?

267
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,476
I'm suspended as a coach.

268
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,978
But not as a player, am I?

269
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,189
You can't even take a single shot.

270
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,150
Standing in the hallway like this
won't cure you, will it?

271
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,613
Your career as a player has ended.

272
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,157
You weren't that valuable
as a player anyway.

273
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,742
If you want to shoot…

274
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,830
Do you know the theme park
where you shoot the balloons and dolls?

275
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,206
Go and do that.

276
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,669
Stay at least 10 meters away
from the shooting range.

277
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,839
Stop distracting the players, will you?

278
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,592
Hey, get back to what you were doing.
Stop watching and go back in.

279
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,887
Geez.

280
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,659
Did you see that?

281
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,288
How embarrassing.

282
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,166
I came up with a brilliant idea
to cure it.

283
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,255
- Out of the way!
- Hey.

284
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,382
Ga-ram!

285
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,513
Coach?

286
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,806
What?

287
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,141
Ung!

288
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,688
Ga-ram!

289
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,273
- What is it?
- Run.

290
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,774
Don't let Coach Bae find it.

291
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,776
Hide it. Go!

292
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,655
Hey!

293
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,782
- Come on, what is this?
- I'm sorry.

294
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,951
He runs 100 m in 11 seconds.
You can't catch him.

295
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,871
Gosh, dang it!

296
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,667
Are you nuts?

297
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,502
- Don't shoot.
- What?

298
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,087
Stop shooting!

299
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,467
TO STABILIZE YOUR MIND AND BODY
PUT THE GUN DOWN

300
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,430
Geez.

301
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,850
Geez.

302
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,314
Do you really think
reading some books will fix it?

303
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:29,194
When it comes to shooting and slumps,
I know much more than you.

304
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:33,406
You're right. You tried everything
in the books and papers.

305
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,741
Except for one thing.

306
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,493
Putting down the gun.

307
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,661
You didn't try that.

308
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
How can a shooter put down her gun?

309
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,500
I don't mean forever,
just taking a break for a while.

310
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,668
Then what?

311
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,002
Will it get better?

312
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,420
What do you know?

313
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,505
You become desperate.

314
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,509
When I couldn't play rugby,

315
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,094
I became very desperate.

316
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,431
I am desperate right now.

317
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,474
No.

318
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,103
You're only desperate
for results and medals.

319
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,607
While the Rugby Team trains, run 300 laps.

320
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,777
- Then I'll give your gun back.
- Was that in the papers too?

321
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,530
Geez. Look.

322
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,739
Here.

323
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,283
CARDIO HELPS REDUCE ANXIETY

324
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,660
See? Right here.

325
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,582
Do you think that'll get me to run?

326
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,380
Why aren't you pushing?

327
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,465
Seon-ho, what are you doing?

328
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,468
It's because Coach Bae is here.

329
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,806
Hey, Coach Bae.

330
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,479
Did she come to yell at us
for stealing her gun?

331
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,522
Coach Bae.

332
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,072
You got this!

333
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,284
Why do we keep running 30 laps?

334
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,953
Help me, Yeong-gwang.

335
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,080
- Geez.
- Hold on.

336
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,082
Why?

337
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,250
- What?
- What now?

338
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,842
The Shooting Team's room
is in the main building.

339
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,260
They kicked her out.

340
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,763
Thanks for the explanation.

341
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,266
She dropped by to keep a record. Here.

344
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,488
Look who's talking.

345
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,617
Good luck.

346
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,786
- You got this.
- Good luck.

347
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,162
Goodbye. Let's go!

348
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,330
Let's go!

Are you feeling unwell?

358
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,814
Or is it that you can't focus
because your coach isn't here?

359

When is Coach Bae coming back?

It's not like she was of much help.
Why now, after ignoring her all this time?

I've never ignored her.

362
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,952
She can't help you anyway.

- I called dibs.

Okay. Over there.

416
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,513
Hey, sit behind me.

417
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,897
Why am I tired already?

418
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,488
This seat's taken.

419
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,616
What?

420
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,161
What is he doing?

421
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,372
He's falling apart again.

422
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,706
Why is he so awkward?

423
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,458
Seong-jun, this seat is open.

424
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,463
You should have told me you were there.

425
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,758
- Geez.
- Are you all right?

426
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,218
Nice try, though.

427
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,805
- Why are you so awkward?
- Shut up. Darn it.

428
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,014
Do you need some tips?

429
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,808
Help him.

430
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,185
- You're being so obvious.
- Let's teach him.

431
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,154
Do you want my help?

432
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,280
Stop.

433
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,407
Don't do it.

434
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,741
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

435
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,951
There are no seats.

436
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,122
There's one over there.

437
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,793
That's only half a seat.

438
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,836
I can't sit there.

439
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,638
Look at him, he just took the bag and sat.

440
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,228
Nice.

441
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,563
Sit somewhere else.

442
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,652
Don't even.

443
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,867
- Seok-bong.
- Here, honey.

444
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,327
- I saved you a seat.
- Geez.

445
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,790
Seriously. Did you have to tag along?

446
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,462
No, it's not that I wanted to.
The coach has to come.

447
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,923
See here?
The Union registered me as a coach too.

448
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,847
Can you sit somewhere else?

449
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,017
I would, but Coach Bae can shoot a gun.

450
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,705
What? What was that?

451
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,290
You took it off. What a waste.

452
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,627
You get carsick in the bus, Coach Bang.

453
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,046
When we went off-season training,
you puked

454
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,423
- on my pants--
- Quiet.

455
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,927
Why would you bring up the past
when the students are sleeping?

456
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,849
Do you really hate that I'm back?

457
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,063
I just have a feeling
the vice principal isn't the sole reason.

458
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,733
You're right.
I hate it, and it's annoying.

459
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,902
Why?

460
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,239
Because you still act like you're 17.

461
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,910
You do whatever you want to do in life.

462
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,622
You doped and retired
because you wanted to.

463
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,083
You came back
when you wanted to play rugby again.

464
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,295
Everything comes so easily for you

465
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,423
when it's so hard for people
like I-ji and me.

466
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,342
That's why I hate you. Happy?

467
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,266
I see, that's why.

468
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,643
Now that you know, don't talk to me.

469
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,936
But what can I do?

470
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,523
I like sitting next to you.

471
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,047
That was a long trip.

472
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,465
Yes, sir.

473
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,885
- Stretch before you go to bed.
- Yes, sir.

474
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,845
Rugby Team, let's go.

475
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,054
Hey, it's Daesang.

476
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,776
Gosh. It's been a while, Coach Ju.

477
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,403
Nice to see you.

478
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,448
You're right. It has been a while.

479
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,702
- You look confident about winning.
- There you go again.

480
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,412
Why wouldn't I be?

481
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,459
You might as well be brazen
since you have nothing to lose.

482
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,795
Don't unpack too much.
You'll be going home right away.

483
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:59,217
Guys, you should go easy.
No one's going to watch your match anyway.

484
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,969
- What?
- Who's going to watch the bottom team?

485
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,930
Especially when the coach is Ju Ga-ram?

486
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,182
Don't worry, they'll be here.

487
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,684
Don't give them false hope.

488
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,270
I wouldn't have run away
if they had any hope.

489
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,815
Geez! The dogs bark loudly
in this neighborhood too.

490
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,943
- Hanyang!
- Yes!

491
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,320
Wash your ears before it jinxes you.

492
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,363
- Okay.
- Yes.

493
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,989
We'll wash them thoroughly.

494
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,450
Should I leave these in the bus, Coach?

495
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,911
- Yes. That's for the field.
- Okay.

496
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:27,954
That's a new face.

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,331
Is he the famous new player?

498
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,625
Hello.

499
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,337
Why? Are you going to steal one again?

500
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,505
Why would I?

501
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,840
You can have him for good. He's all yours.

502
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,011
Daesang, we'll practice
right after dinner.

503
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,972
- Let's go.
- Okay.

504
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,766
We'll see just how good they are.

505
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,144
I can't even look at him.

506
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:11,080
DAESANG HIGH SCHOOL
PLAYER RECORDS

507
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,357
Mom.

508
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,360
What's going on?

509
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,696
I thought you were coming directly
to the match.

510
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,281
Are you staying nearby tonight?

511
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,824
Where's Dad?

512
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,494
I came alone. Dad is with Seok-jun.

513
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,790
Eat these with your friends.

514
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,461
I'm glad you're here at least.

515
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,296
Tomorrow's match will be really fun.

516
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,757
Our opponent, Daesang,
is last year's champion.

517
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,343
- Our former coach--
- Seong-jun.

518
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,636
I can't see the match either.

519
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,764
My flight leaves tomorrow.

520
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,724
Come on.

521
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,018
Seok-jun isn't a kid.

522
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:18,689
Living alone abroad is hard,
especially when competing with the best.

523
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,069
He should at least have home-cooked meals
and someone to talk to.

524
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,236
So…

525
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,115
you came to tell me
you can't come tomorrow?

526
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,118
That too.

527
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,621
Seong-jun.

528
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,792
What do you think about moving to Spain
after graduation?

529
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,005
Why would I do that?

530
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,508
You can learn the language.

531
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,345
I thought you could study
to become an agent

532
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,014
who takes care of athletes
and reviews their contracts.

533
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:57,144
It's hard for your dad and me
to fly back and forth like this.

534
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,148
It's time for you
to seriously consider your future.

535
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
You don't know how much longer
you can play rugby.

536
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,153
What you're telling me

537
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,490
is to be someone Seok-jun can talk to…

538
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,121
and be his sidekick?

539
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,916
I'm asking you
to help your brother succeed.

540
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,836
- In the end, that's for the family--
- Mom.

541
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,089
I'm not going.

542
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm going to keep playing rugby.

543
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,637
I'll go to college with it.

544
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,100
Enjoy your time in Spain.

545
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,437
Give it a thought.

546
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,398
Good luck with your match tomorrow.

547
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,289
Okay.

548
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,750
Yes.

549
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,005
I'll call you tomorrow.

550
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,966
Okay.

551
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,888
You're not crying. You cried all the time
when you were a kid.

552
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,805
Hey, when did I?

553
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,433
At the training
before the Nationals in middle school.

554
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,351
- Hey, that was--
- That was?

555
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,609
I don't remember.

556
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,950
Did you hear it?

557
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,702
I just overheard it.

558
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
From where?

559
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,959
From being Seok-jun's sidekick.

560
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:51,008
- I'll get some tissues if you want to cry.
- I'm not going to cry.

561
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,474
BED TIME

562
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,602
Go to bed.

563
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,648
You have to sleep on time
to be in your best condition.

564
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,781
I'll get going.

565
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,534
U-jin.

566
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,788
Good luck tomorrow.

567
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,793
You too.

568
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,296
Good luck with your match.

569
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,972
Do you want some pastries?

570
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,267
Sausage rolls?

571
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,563
They're yummy.

572
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,325
U-jin.

573
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,288
Coach.

574
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,956
What brings you here?

575
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,795
You haven't been scoring as well recently,
so I was wondering what's going on.

576
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,381
Have you been looking at my scores?

577
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,801
I thought Coach Jeon wouldn't let you.

578
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,262
I saw it at night without him knowing.
It's a secret.

579
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,184
Actually, I don't know the reason.

580
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,312
I'm shooting like always.

581
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,774
Since the gap wasn't big,
I thought it was because of my condition.

582
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,485
Didn't you change your shoes?

583
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,070
I did.

584
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,282
But they're the same shoes
in the same size.

585
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,577
New shoes may feel different
even if they're the same brand and size.

586
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,706
Did your score start to drop
after changing the shoes?

587
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,543
I think so.

588
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,296
- You wear size 7, right?
- Yes.

589
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,718
I've brought all the shoes I could get
in that size.

590
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,470
Try them on and try your shooting stance.

591
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,972
Here. I hope they fit.

592
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,850
They should fit.

593
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,521
I'll do it for you.

594
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,025
Hello.

595
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,656
Are you heading
to watch the Presidents Cup?

596
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,327
Hello.

597
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,789
I'm Seo Hui-tae from <i>Today Sports.</i>

598
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,504
- You're the vice principal, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

599
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,172
TODAY SPORTS
SEO HUI-TAE

600
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,883
- Why are you here?
- You're a bit late.

601
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,303
I thought Hanyang High's
Rugby Team was playing today.

602
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,932
I'm not that interested in the Rugby Team.

603
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,352
I'm interested in the Rugby Team,

604
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,898
especially in Coach Ju Ga-ram.

605
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,783
- Daesang!
- Daesang!

606
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,161
WELCOME HANYANG
WELCOME DAESANG

607
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,997
THE 36TH PRESIDENTS CUP RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP

608
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,249
- Daesang!
- Daesang!

609
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,919
Daesang for the win!

610
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:16,964
SCOUTS' SEATS

611
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,800
Hanyang High Rugby Team!

612
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,970
- Let's go!
- Hanyang High Yoon Seong-jun!

613
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,973
- Hanyang High Rugby Team!
- Good luck!

614
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,934
THE 36TH PRESIDENTS CUP RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP

615
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,730
Ms. Kang.

616
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,190
Ga-ram.

617
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,110
No one is here.

618
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,821
The match hasn't started yet.

619
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,285
Myeongseong and Gangsan
went to see Mujin High's match.

620
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,164
The pro team scouts
are at Taesan High's match.

621
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,170
You should go to the stand too.

622
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,839
We don't have many people on our stand.

623
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,175
Can you cheer like a one-man army?

624
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,968
Don't you worry.

625
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,263
Hanyang!

626
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,640
Go get them!

627
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,397
- Cheol-hui.
- Yes.

628
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,398
- U-jae.
- Yes.

629
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,483
- Hyeong-hun.
- Yes.

630
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,151
And Tae-pung is the center.

631
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,238
Hanyang High's Number 6 is a newbie.
Target that side.

632
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,741
- Let's show them what rugby is.
- Okay, sir.

633
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,451
- Coach.
- What?

634
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,662
My knee hasn't recovered yet.
I was told to give it another two weeks--

635
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,039
Hey, Tae-pung.

636
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,208
Players like you
need to start in the preliminaries,

637
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,710
so the key players can save energy
for the finals.

638
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,588
Play like we trained.
Push them hard from the start.

639
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,423
- Ready?
- Yes, sir!

640
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,178
There you go.

641
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:51,183
Look at you, all dressed up in a suit.

642
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,812
What can you do with no subs?

643
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,232
The seven of them have good teamwork.

644
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,942
Well, we'll see about that.

645
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,445
You're here, Coach Song.

646
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,201
- I thought you'd come for Round 2.
- I wanted to see someone.

647
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:13,080
Really? Let me know who he is,
and I'll introduce him after the match.

648
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,749
He's not from Daesang.

649
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,300
Do you have a minute, Coach Ju?

650
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,558
Thank you for coming, Coach Song.

651
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,685
You watched the videos, right?

652
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:40,148
My players are really good.
They love rugby and are determined.

653
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:44,027
With systematic university training,
they'll get better more quickly.

654
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,863
- Ga-ram.
- Yes.

655
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,618
I watched the videos.

656
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,122
I saw the potential
of Hanyang's Rugby Team.

657
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:01,587
But I'm here today for a different reason.

658
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:07,092
Whatever the reason is,
you're here, so it's all good.

659
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,557
Why did you say you couldn't play…

660
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,273
the day before the final?

661
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,565
<i>What about rugby?</i>
<i>I can still play though, right?</i>

662
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,567
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

663
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:10,072
<i>but it'll be hard for you to keep playing.</i>

664
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,536
Coach,

665
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,499
I don't think I can play in the finals.

666
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,252
What kind of nonsense is that?

667
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,591
I'm sorry, but I don't feel well.

668
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,135
It's the Olympics
we're talking about here.

669
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,722
If we win this, we go to the Olympics.

670
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,519
All of us have been through
so much the past four years.

671
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,188
We didn't get a day to rest.

672
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:47,526
Sang-gi came back after two knee surgeries
to go to the Olympics.

673
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,987
Tae-ho gave up his elbow surgery for this.

674
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,782
I know you're probably feeling worn out
by now.

675
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,285
But just one match.

676
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,413
Let's play one more match.

677
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,997
Coach, actually--

678
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,958
You're the captain!

679
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,213
We're about to qualify for the Olympics
for the first time in 96 years.

680
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,425
Everyone is watching us.

681
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,395
Ga-ram.

682
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,774
Do us a favor.

683
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,830
THE PRIDE OF KOREAN RUGBY, JU GA-RAM!

684
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:46,084
Ju Ga-ram!

685
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,795
- Let's get ready for the second half.
<i>- It's 12 to 26 right now.</i>

686
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,713
Where's Ga-ram?

687
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,924
<i>Team Korea is 14 points behind Japan.</i>

688
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,719
<i>They're down by a lot.</i>

689
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
<i>In the second half,</i>

690
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,850
<i>Ace Ga-ram needs to deliver</i>
<i>more than ever.</i>

691
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,773
ANADROL

692
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,640
I've been constantly asking myself

693
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,728
if I ruined your career
because I didn't listen to you back then.

694
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,525
What you wanted to tell me…

695
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,071
It had to do with doping, didn't it?

696
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,165
I know it's late, but I'm sorry.

697
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,086
I put too much on your shoulders.

698
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,133
I didn't act in a way a coach should.

699
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,224
Give me your hand, Coach.

700
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,862
Leave the past behind.

701
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,615
Just focus on my boys.

702
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,121
I'm trying to train them
not to be like me.

703
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,752
<i>- The first round</i>
- The match is about to begin.

704
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,255
<i>between Hanyang and Daesang</i>
<i>will begin soon.</i>

705
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,965
I'll get going, Coach.

706
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,967
Enjoy the match.

707
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,753
<i>Daesang is known for its strong forwards.</i>

708
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,590
So we'll focus on speed to win.

709
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,050
- Yoon Seong-jun.
- Yes.

710
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:40,967
- Mun Ung.
- Yes.

711
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,887
With your speed,
we'll break through from the side.

712
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,806
They don't know much about Ung.

713
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,143
So Seong-jun will be marked heavily.

714
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,562
When their defense focuses on Seong-jun,

715
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,190
Ung will be able to find openings
to break through.

716
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,359
- Okay?
- Yes!

717
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,652
Gather around.

718
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,829
What's our goal?

719
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,332
Winning the Nationals!

720
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:16,211
If you put in effort for a goal,
you can't fail.

721
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,675
Even if they score first,
we'll just fight harder to catch up.

722
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:27,263
If you can't score,
keep creating chances nonstop.

723
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,018
With every effort you make,

724
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,355
we are bound to win.

725
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:41,987
Let's go.

726
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,409
Hanyang!

727
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,660
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

728
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,495
THE PRESIDENTS CUP RUGBY
HANYANG : DAESANG

729
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,249
BEAT THEM! DOMINATE THEM!

730
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,466
Rugby Team.

731
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,136
Hanyang High School Yoon Seong-jun!

732
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,438
Ung, this is how you play real rugby.

733
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,826
Are you ready?

734
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,054
SEONG-JUN IS A DEER
MY LOVELY DEAR

735
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,436
Go back.

736
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,691
- Hey.
- Let's go!

737
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,785
- Hey.
- Release the ball.

738
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,869
There you go.

739
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,788
Seon-ho, block.

740
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,001
Good.

741
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,711
Keep moving around.

742
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,513
Let's go!

743
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,812
- Get him.
- Block him.

744
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,190
Look at the ball.

745
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,400
Chase him.

746
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,124
Release the ball.

747
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,377
Hey, Tae-pung!

748
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,754
Stop being weak and move faster.

749
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,881
- Did you forget your training?
- No, sir.

750
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,097
HANYANG : DAESANG

751
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,522
What are you doing, Tae-pung?
Who are you passing to, idiot?

752
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,400
Ung.

753
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,117
Here, Captain.

754
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,667
Hey, Number 6.

755
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,585
Block Number 6.

756
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,019
- Yes!
- Ung!

757
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,067
That was amazing!

758
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,444
Darn it.

759
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,571
Come on!

760
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,204
HANYANG 7 : 0 DAESANG

761
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,164
You'd better get your heads in the game!

762
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,125
Are you going to let them beat you
and send you packing?

763
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,753
Yonhee University's coach is here.

764
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,421
If you lose this match,

765
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,798
don't even think
about going to university.

766
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,258
Find a job as a tout.

767
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,429
Get it together
unless you want to be losers.

768
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,597
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

769
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,224
Let's do it, Daesang.

770
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,601
- Did you see that, Coach?
- It hurts.

771
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,144
We scored first.

772
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,021
We crushed it.

773
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,357
Our strategy worked, Coach.

774
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,733
Good job.

775
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,486
You're doing great,
but we still have lots of time left.

776
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,363
Don't let your guard down, and keep it up.

777
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,199
Try to make them slip up. Okay?

778
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,909
- Okay!
- Let's do it!

779
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,160
Okay, let's go.

780
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,371
- One, two.
- Run.

781
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,790
Let's go.

782
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,458
- Look forward.
- Go forward.

783
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,504
Darn it.

784
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,300
- Are you okay?
- Damn it!

785
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,513
Is it you again, shortie?
Still the same as before, huh?

786
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,806
Both skills and height.

787
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,226
Hey, Hyeong-sik.

788
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,440
Focus on rugby, you jerk.

789
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,611
Good job, Hyeong-sik. Let's go!

790
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,747
We'll start now.

791
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,419
Don't collapse!

792
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,552
No.

793
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,179
Follow them.

794
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,265
Run.

795
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,183
You have to stop him!

796
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:09,230
- Run!
- Run!

797
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,898
Run!

798
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,660
- It's okay.
- Nice.

799
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,662
It's okay.

800
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,205
You got this!

801
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,719
Daesang.

802
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,264
Daesang for the win!

803
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,145
Pass.

804
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,566
Okay. Good.

805
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,445
- Nice.
- Are you all right?

806
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,613
- We did it.
- Captain!

807
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,575
You're doing great!

808
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,709
DAESANG 7 : 12 HANYANG

809
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,547
- Tae-pung.
- Tae-pung.

810
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,758
- Pass.
- To the side.

811
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,219
- Run forward.
- Go for it.

812
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,975
Yes. Nice.

813
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,477
Run.

814
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,062
Get him, Ung. Don't let him pass.

815
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,314
- Tackle him, Ung.
- Number 6 is coming for a tackle.

816
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,191
Break through, Tae-pung. Run!

817
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,734
Tackle him, Ung.

818
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,085
You have to stop him. Hurry.

819
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,404
Coach, tackling is important
in rugby, right?

820
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,447
Coach.

821
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,045
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

822
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,381
<i>I can't tackle.</i>

823
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:08,242
THE WINNING TRY

824
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,436
THE WINNING TRY

825
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,605
Every player has their own issue.

826
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:38,856
<i>Launch a counterattack.</i>

827
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,316
<i>They look frustrated.</i>

828
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,318
<i>They want to swap the gold and silver.</i>

829
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,154
- Admission fraud is unacceptable.
- How dare you say that?

830
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,405
<i>Congrats, Coach Ju.</i>

831
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,491
Why would we disband a team
with potential?

832
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,201
<i>What happened to you?</i>

833
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,702
<i>What do we do now?</i>

834
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,996
<i>What matters is how well</i>
<i>we can back him up.</i>

835
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,249
<i>We have to do that</i>
<i>to become a strong team.</i>

836
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,376
<i>Will you believe me</i>
<i>if I say it's not true?</i>

837
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,169
<i>- Is that him?</i>
<i>- We're at the right place.</i>

838
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,340
<i>If you can't do it today,</i>
<i>your rugby ends here.</i>
