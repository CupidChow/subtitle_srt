You scumbag!

00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,430
- Come here.
- Ga-ram.

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,973
Come.

5
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,308
- Ga-ram.
- Come here.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,727
- Don't do this.
- Darn it!

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,979
- Don't.
- Let go.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,564
- Ga-ram.
- Darn it!

9
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,940

- Move!

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,901
Ga-ram!

11
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,153
This is my decision. Don't get in the way.

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,988
Why would you make such a decision?

13
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,740
This is not helping me in any way.

14
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,241
Please go.

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,743
Just go!

16
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,661
How interesting.

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,622
Old sayings are always true.

18
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,086
"Spare the rod, spoil the child."

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,964
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't have to be.

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:36,054
Me? This "scumbag"?
What do you intend to do? Let's see.

21
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,809
If I'm a scumbag, then what are you?
Are you a rotten scumbag?

22
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,604
- What are you doing?
- I can't take it anymore!

23
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:49,275
What kind of man throws a tantrum
just because he took a few punches?

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,820
And especially in front of your seniors?

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,280
You rude piece of shit.
What the heck are you doing?

26
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,615
Go!

27
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,950
Please leave.

28
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,037
Please, Ga-ram.

29
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,248
Please stop.

30
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,668
No, don't leave.
Do whatever you came here for. Go ahead.

31
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,878
He has a grudge against me. That's all.

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,681
Come on, vent it out on me.
Let's see this through to the end.

33
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,854
As for the broken glass,

34
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,648
we should cover the cost
with the Rugby Team's budget, right?

35
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,900
No, it should come out of Ga-ram's salary.

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,653
Interesting.

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,446
Very interesting.

38
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,870
- Sorry.
- Are you going to clean up?

39
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,037
Yes, I'll take care of it.

40
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,747
Okay. You passed.

41
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,292
See you at the shooting range tomorrow.

42
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,461

Why did you barge in?

45
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,315
What if it led to an accident?

46
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,444
You're lucky no glass hit Nak-gyun,
or you'd be done for.

47
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,155
Ju Ga-ram.

48
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,286
- Ga-ram.
- These stains might not come off.

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,833
Ga-ram.

50
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,297
- Ga-ram.
- What?

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,882
I was holding myself back.

52
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,467
What I really wanted to do

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,929
was break that jerk Nak-gyun
into pieces, not the glass.

54
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,313
You're so precious to me.

55
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,525
I'm so careful around you,
just in case I accidentally make you cry.

56
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,863
So why do you treat yourself like this?

57
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,165
Stop doing this to yourself.
To me, you're so…

58
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,002
So what?

59
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,881
- Why'd you stop mid-sentence?
- What?

60
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,523
If I'm not here,

61
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,527
the students will have to deal
with this unfair situation.

62
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,363
I'm going to endure it for them.

63
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,575
Just like you, Ga-ram.

64
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Why did you let Coach Bae come back?

65
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,942
She knows way too much.

66
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,236
It'll be a headache if she starts talking,

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,281
so it's better to keep her close
and watch her carefully.

68
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,492
Be sure to handle any liability concerns
in advance.

69
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,952
Of course.

70
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,832
So, what should we do about Ga-ram?

71
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,209
Make him write an apology letter
for breaking the glass?

72
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,464
- What's an apology going to do for us?
- Then what?

73
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,717
We have to find a way
to kick him out for good.

Let's talk about it

79
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,706
I'll see you at the Nationals.

80
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,378
- Where is she?
- Seo U-jin's training on her own.

81
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,339
She'd rather not be here?

82
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,802
No. I think she should focus
on her mental health rather than shooting,

83
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,470
so I told her to train alone.

84
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,723
- She'd get on your nerves too.
- Hey.

85
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,392
You've become more tactful.

86
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,062
That's good.

87

you'll need special training.

00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,195
I can't even keep my balance

I'll hold you.

97
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,855
All right.

98
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,749
Don't focus on holding your balance.
Just imagine you're on flat ground.

99
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,713
Once balanced, take the basic stance.

100
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,692
Are you all right? Let me see.

101
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,611
Did you hurt your wrist?

102
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,614
How does it feel?

103
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,205
Don't be sorry.
You don't need to apologize for an injury.

Then it would be my fault.

00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,215
I didn't provide you
with the proper rehab.

00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,928
A player just needs to do their best,
and the rest is on the coach.

The draw official determines the opponents
for the tournaments

117

in fencing, table tennis, judo, and rugby,

118

and picks the lanes
for shooting and swimming.

119
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,965

holds great responsibility.

GOLD MEDAL TTEOKBOKKI

177
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,418
- Why are you smiling?
- It feels like a really good dream.

178
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,630
- You had a good dream?
- Not literally.

179
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,384
It feels like a dream,
sitting here with you again.

180
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,680
Geez, that's greasy.

181
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,557
- Do you want a Coke?
- Hey.

182
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,184
- Right. We can't order Coke.
- Nope.

183
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
Look.

184
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,274
There's our history.

185
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,567
Wow, it's from 2004.

186
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,112
I'll write one for this year, too.

187
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,165
We used to come as players every year.

188
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,836
Now, we're sitting here as coaches.

189
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,589
When I was a player,

190
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,676
I didn't know coaches held
such a heavy burden.

191
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,180
I thought they just casually
watched us train

192
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,725
and yelled at us from time to time.

193
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,520
Had I known it was this tough,
I would have listened to them more.

194
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,773
I want to do well.

195
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,445
Just like my coach back then.

196
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,572
Let's do it.

197
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,201
Let's hope our students remember us

198
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,121
as "my coach" or "our coach."

199
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,256
Geez.

200
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,925
Come on.

201
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,260
ALL MY TRIES ARE FOR I-JI

202
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,303
Look here.

203
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,804
I wrote this.

204
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,980
- I wrote one too.
- Don't lie to me.

205
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,148
I'm serious.

206
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,525
- Really?
- Yes.

207
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,863
- Where?
- Just keep eating.

208
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,659
Are you really going to wear that?
Come back.

209
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,620
- Are you really going to?
- Keep quiet.

210
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,537
Are you?

211
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,830
- GA-RAM'S MINE, I'll SHOOT
- I-JI

212
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,500
It's too embarrassing.
Are we really going to wear that?

213
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,502
- I don't see it.
- You promised, okay?

214
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,004
- It's a bit tight.
- It's tight for me too.

215
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,506
JINX 4: BUILD A WINNING ATTITUDE

216
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,549
- I can't go like this.
- We have no choice.

2025 NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL
DRAW CEREMONY

219
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,410
Amazing!

220
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,703
How amazing!

221
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,872
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

222
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,624
Look at them!

223
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,043
Geez. This is embarrassing!

224
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,088
- How embarrassing.
- It was your idea.

225
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,339
Keep your head up.

226
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,427
We'll draw for the general division
for each city and province.

227
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,138
Coaches, please come up to the platform.

228
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,646
Team Seoul will draw first.

229
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,023
- Are you nervous?
- Please draw.

230
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,274
I'm not nervous.

231
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,694
A shooter can keep cool
even in situations like this.

232
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,447
He drew number four.

233
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,452
- I'm nervous.
- You all must be nervous.

234
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,703
- So what?
- We'll keep going.

235
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,080
- Coach of Gangwon-do.
- You…

236
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,415
calm my nerves.

237
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,509
Gangwon-do picked 16.

238
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,055
Next, we'll draw
for the high school division.

239
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,852
<i>Just when I am disheartened</i>

240
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,104
What? I can't even do this, seriously?

241
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,481
What are we going to do?

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,609

246
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,619
Yes!

247
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,997
Quiet!

248
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,709
Track and Field!

249
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,462
I wasn't the unlucky one.

250
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,006
Oopsie daisy. Dropped it again.

251
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
Let's go. Please tell us.

252
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,098
- This is nerve-racking.
- Coach scored 100 points.

253
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,183
Hurry. My heart's about to explode.

254
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,393
NO PRESSURE, WE'RE THE BEST,
WE TRUST YOU

255
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,396
Okay. You can go back to your seat.

256
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,358
Next up, Daesang High will draw.

257
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,112
Which number will they draw?

258
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,075
Okay. It's 14.

259
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,993
He picked 14.

260
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,539
You can go back to your seat.

261
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,292
Next will be Hanyang Physical Education
High School.

262
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,336
Please step forward.

263
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,966
Which number will Hanyang High draw?

264
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,641
The fate of the school
is in the coach's hands.

265
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,477
RUGBY

266
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,982
He picked four.

COACH JU
1ST ROUND HANYANG VS MUJIN

270
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,495
Mujin.

271
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,624
- Mujin is easy.
- It's a piece of cake.

272
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,169
They were eliminated in the preliminaries.
We've got this.

273
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,129
- It'll be easy.
- What about Daesang?

274
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,630
Hold on.

275
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
Daesang is here.

276
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,845
If they advance on and on…

277
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,098
- We'd meet them in the finals.
- You're right.

278
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,852
Let's go to the finals.
Wasn't it our goal to win the Nationals?

279
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,145
- Yes.
- Right, Captain?

280
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,527
Wait. What's with you?

281
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,910
Are you chickening out?

282
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,995
What? I'm not scared.

283
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,248
- Should we do special training?
- What? Did Yeong-gwang say that?

284
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,791
- Geez.
- I'm touched.

285
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,959
Come on.

286
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,213
- Let's do special training.
- All right!

287
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,215
Let's go.

288
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,217
- Let's squat 2 million times.
- Go!

289
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,274
Goodness.

290
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,903
I started eating first
because I was hungry.

291
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,280
Please sit.

292
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,662
Thank you for contacting me.

293
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,373
- You said you had something for me?
- Right.

294
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,293
I was going to wait for you to eat first.

295
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,797
Here it is.

296
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,476
Coach Ju is seeing a neurologist.

297
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,812
As you can see here.

298
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,771
PRESCRIPTION: ANADROL

299
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:17,401
How did the Rugby Team
suddenly get better?

300
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:21,488
Are you suggesting that Ga-ram
made the players take illegal substances?

301
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,533
That's what I want to find out.

302
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,080
Please give me permission
to gather news on campus.

303
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,126
If you help me this one time,

304
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:39,923
I can clear out the principal's office
in no time.

305
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,515
Here you go.

306
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,059
Yes!

307
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,520
Listen up!

308
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,106
This is our last feast
before the Nationals.

309
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,692
From tomorrow
until the Nationals are over,

310
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,861
you'll follow a strict diet, so be ready.

311
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,778
Okay!

312
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:06,408
Coach, we have to eat well to play well.
Diet isn't really--

313
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,326
- Hey.
- Just eat.

314
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,369
Just shut it and dig in!

315
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,089
As for Mujin High, let's…

316
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,011
Let's destroy them like this!

317
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,638
Just Mujin High?

318
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,225
We'll devour Daesang High too.

319
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,560
If you win the Nationals,

320
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,313
I'll give you free chicken for life!

321
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,109
- You promise?
- I'll have to ask Seung-hui first.

322
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,569
- Just eat up.
- Geez.

323
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,446
Ung, when you eat chicken,

324
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,366
you have to hold it tightly like this
to get the full experience.

325
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,619
- Why are you giving it to me?
- So that you can excel.

326
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,080
- Have it.
- Eat it.

327
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,999
Look at you go!

328
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,212
Why aren't you eating, Seong-jun?
Are you unwell?

329
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,798
No, it's…

330
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,884
I'm a little nervous
with the match coming up.

331
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,971
- Seriously?
- Hurry and eat up.

332
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,640
He's cute.

333
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,809
- He can be so adorable.
- I know, right?

334
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>Where's Seong-jun?</i>

335
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,605
He's having a major issue
with his stomach,

336
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,109
so he said it will take some time
to get it under control.

337
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,736
That's what he said,

338
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,281
- but he fixed it.
- Sorry.

339
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,076
How about I feel your stomach
to see if everything's okay?

340
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,121
Let's begin. There's no time for jokes.

341
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,916
- You're the one who's late.
- Hey.

342
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,418
Why don't we chant?

343
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,378
- Okay.
- Let's go!

344
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,255
Let's go!

345
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,594
Hanyang!

346
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,933
Captain.

347
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey, you have to run faster.

348
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,238
Good job.

349
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,366
Captain.

350
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,454
Hey.

351
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,999
- Stop it.
- What?

352
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,584
Stop whatever you're doing.

353
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,087
- Ju-yang.
- Call it.

354
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,215
- You were offside.
- Okay.

355
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,342
Seon-ho.

356
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,095
- I know. Get closer.
- Captain.

357
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,190
- Move.
- Darn it!

358
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,400
Move.

359
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,652
- Hey.
- Captain.

360
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,362
- What's wrong?
- Hey, Seong-jun.

361
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,988
Why? What's going on?

362
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,407
- Hurry, Coach.
- Why?

363
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,993
What's wrong, Seong-jun?

364
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,539
- Did he dislocate his shoulder?
- Wait. Stay still.

365
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,875
Hey.

366
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,964
What is that?

367
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,092
It's highly likely
that it's a rotator cuff tear.

368
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,929
We'll need an MRI and a CT scan
to confirm the details.

369
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,308
He'll stay here in the hospital.
Please arrange his checkup.

370
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,228
- Okay.
- When prescribing his medicine,

371
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,481
please exclude steroid substances.
He's an athlete.

372
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,651
I don't need to be hospitalized, Coach.

373
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,030
Is there anything else we should know?

374
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,783
Watch out for sudden movements or impacts.

375
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,121
I'm really fine. I can train, Coach.

376
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,291
The exam results will tell us
whether you're okay or not.

377
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,084
Thank you.

378
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,463
I mean, it's a minor injury.

379
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,843
As a rugby player, this is nothing.
You know that, don't you?

380
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,303
Coach--

381
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,650
Seong-jun, forget about the Nationals.
Are you trying to end your career?

382
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,945
Stay in the hospital
until the results are in.

383
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,280
That's final.

384
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,542
WARD 73, ROOM 510

385
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,629
OS / YOON

386
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,246
SEONG-JUN'S MOTHER

387
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,253
<i>The number you have dialed…</i>

388
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,505
He's not picking up.

389
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,590
It's all my fault.

390
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,883
Stop crying.

391
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,097
Coach.

392
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,681
How's Seong-jun?

393
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,934
- He's in the hospital.
- Is it that bad?

394
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,648
We're waiting for an in-depth test.

395
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,444
It wasn't your fault, Ju-yang.

396
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,113
He had a bad shoulder before that.

397
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,492
We'll talk again
when we get the test results.

398
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,035
- Go to your rooms.
- Okay.

399
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,037
Good night.

400
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,415
He'll be fine.

401
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,088
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

402
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:40,218
The Shooting Team will hold
an in-school tryout for the Nationals.

403
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,720
Do you have the list of players for it?

404
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,390
It's almost finalized.

405
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,434
But we aren't sure about U-jin.

406
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,645
She's seeing a doctor
to check her condition.

407
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,026
Next, the Rugby Team.
Anything worth reporting?

408
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,571
Yes.

409
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,783
Seong-jun, a third-year student,
injured his shoulder.

410
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,079
Is it severe?

411
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,248
It was diagnosed as a rotator cuff tear.

412
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,294
He doesn't have to get surgery,
but he can't train either.

413
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,756
I'll keep you updated on his recovery.

414
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,219
Lastly, a reporter will be gathering
news materials on campus

415
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,390
for the Nationals,
so I ask for your cooperation.

416
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,644
News coverage is good.
I should ask them to cover fencing.

417
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,230
The archery lane welcomes them
with open arms.

418
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,982
I like that they're covering us.

419
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:40,278
But before any article is released,
make sure it goes through us first.

420
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,654
Okay. Thank you.

421
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,907
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

422
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,036
TEACHERS' ROOM

423
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,455
- Good luck.
- Okay.

424
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,594
SEONG-JUN'S MOTHER

425
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,389
<i>I'd like to do the counseling</i>
<i>without Seong-jun tomorrow.</i>

426
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,600
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

427
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,747
U-JIN

428
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,460
Oh, man.

429
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,551
- Hello?
<i>- Room number?</i>

430
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,345
- <i>What's your room number?</i>
- Right.

431
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,223
It's…

432
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,643
It's Room 510.

433
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,188
What was that?

434
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,944
Darn it.

435
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,655
Why is she coming so suddenly?

436
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,240
Geez.

437
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,158
Ouch. My shoulder.

438
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,243
Where is it?

439
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,745
It's hot! Geez.

440
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,082
Socks. I was wearing my socks. Dang it!

441
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,377
This is driving me nuts.

442
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,802
- When did you get here?
- Bend over.

443
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,266
Give it to me.

444
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,736
It isn't dry yet.

445
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,618
Did you come to see me?

446
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,870
- I came to get my ear checked.
- Your ear?

447
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
Why? What's wrong with your ear?

448
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,458
I knew it. There's a scar.
Did you examine it properly?

449
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,209
- I did.
- Okay.

450
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,045
I have trouble with my balance.

451
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,592
- Let me see your ear.
- What for?

452
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm just worried about you.

453
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,181
- Stop worrying about others.
- You're not just anyone.

454
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,202
- Let's go outside.
- To where?

455
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,663
I haven't eaten yet
because of my appointment.

456
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,747
To eat.

457
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,335
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

458
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,596
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Sorry.

459
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,556
Sit over there. I'll order.

460
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,899
- For me…
- Steak sandwich, please.

461
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,860
Served on Parmesan oregano bread
with ranch.

462
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,739
- And no olives, please.
- Okay.

463
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,074
You remember my usual?

464
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,827
Please make two of them.

465
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,953
- Okay.
- Thank you.

466
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,629
Give it to me.

467
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,684
Does Ung know about your ear?

468
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,313
Did you tell him?

469
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,900
He found out.
He said he'd keep it a secret.

470
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,988
Right. A secret.

471
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,658
I have no other intention,

472
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,453
and I'm not asking
out of jealousy or suspicion.

473
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,580
But can I ask you something?

474
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,042
Is there…

475
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,754
something going on between you and Ung--

476
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,797
Look at you talking nonsense,
you must be fine.

477
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,053
Right? That's nonsense.

478
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,474
I…

479
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,768
I'm fine.

480
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,730
It'll be all right.

481
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,274
The rehab.

482
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,736
We get injured all the time.

483
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,284
U-jin.

484
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,247
Look at that scar on your neck. There.

485
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,958
- You need to get your ear treated quickly.
- Just eat.

486
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:49,921
Hey.

487
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,053
I wasn't done chewing yet.
You can't just feed me like that.

488
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,854
Darn it.

489
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,149
Who are you?

490
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,151
RUGBY TEAM'S ROOM

491
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,446
Mr. Ju, how do you feel?

492
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,949
Are you going to keep playing?

493
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,371
It's been a while, Mr. Ju.

494
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,374
Right. It's Coach Ju now, isn't it?

495
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,500
Hold on.

496
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,591
You remember me, don't you?

497
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,470
I wrote an exclusive article
on your doping scandal.

498
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,597
How could I forget?

499
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,477
How's it going these days?

500
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,313
I heard the rugby captain got injured.

501
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,610
Isn't he Yoon Seok-jun's twin brother?

502
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,488
How's his injury going?

503
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,951
I'm sorry. It shouldn't be disclosed.

504
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,912
Right? That's going to be a problem
when he applies to college.

505
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,913
Stop right there.

506
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,126
Don't mess with my boys.

507
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:16,132
If you write an article rashly
and affect Seong-jun in any way,

508
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,342
you'll regret it.

509
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,865
HANYANG RUGBY

510
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,658
Shouldn't you be resting?

511
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,827
No. It's fine.

512
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,747
Take the day off at least.
You just got discharged today.

513
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,123
Haven't you been injured?

514
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,418
- Captain, still.
- Stop it and get ready already.

515
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,754
- What if it gets worse?
- What are you doing?

516
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,466
- Hello.
- Coach.

517
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,810
It's gym day, isn't it?

518
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,229
- Yes.
- Yes.

519
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,355
- Get ready.
- Okay.

520
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,314
- Yes.
- Okay.

521
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,901
Coach, I feel fine.
I don't even need this anymore.

522
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,569
Seong-jun won't be training today.

523
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,530
As long as I don't move my right shoulder,
it'll be fine.

524
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,241
Move along if you're ready.

525
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,200
- Okay.
- Yes.

526
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,201
- Okay.
- Okay.

527
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,496
Go on.

528
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,206
- Yes.
- Let's go, Ung.

529
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,877
I'll warm up next to them, then.

530
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,046
Yoon Seong-jun!

531
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,217
Focus only on your recovery.

532
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,636
Think about nothing else.

533
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,931
You hear me?

534
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,726
Answer me!

535
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,855
Yes.

536
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,380
YOON SEOK-JUN

537
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,050
COUNSELING OFFICE

538
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,053
Hello, Coach.

539
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,098
- I'm Seong-jun's mom.
- Hello.

540
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,726
I'm Ju Ga-ram, the Rugby Team's coach.

541
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,187
Please come in.

542
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,234
RIGHT SHOULDER ROTATOR CUFF TEAR

543
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,403
He tore his rotator cuff.

544
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,324
We plan to undergo rehab
rather than have surgery.

545
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,701
The tear is less than an inch long.

546
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,248
I'll help him recover.

547
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,835
He's still young,
he'll be better in no time.

548
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,130
- It won't affect his career that much.
- Coach.

549
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,469
I'm here to talk about something else.

550
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,616
I want to take Seong-jun to Spain.

551
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,159
Spain.

552
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,161
This was in Spanish.

553
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,291
To study abroad?

554
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,630
I mean, there is a rugby league in Spain,

555
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:47,301
but he doesn't have to go overseas
to play rugby.

556
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,930
Please persuade him to quit rugby.

557
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,766
Pardon?

558
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,185
Listen, Coach.

559
00:39:56,268 --> 00:40:00,398
I want him to take a path
with a secure future.

560
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:07,071
Has he gotten any offers from colleges
or pro teams?

561
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,784
No, not yet.

562
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,787
Honestly, now that he's injured,

563
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,165
what future can he realistically expect?

564
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:25,548
Working with Seok-jun after studying
to be an agent will be better for--

565
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:27,925
Seong-jun.

566
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,595
I'm going to keep playing rugby.

567
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,140
We still have the Nationals.

568
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,768
If I win, I can get offers from colleges
or pro teams.

569
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:42,356
- How can you play with that shoulder?
- Stop making excuses.

570
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,317
Does my shoulder even matter to you?

571
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,945
You just need Seok-jun's sidekick.

572
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,615
I made it clear that I want to play rugby.

573
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,701
Did you even listen to me?

574
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,705
You've never even come to see me play.

575
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,879
You've never supported me
since I started playing.

576
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,882
How can you talk about my future now?

577
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,844
I'm fine on my own, so please,

578
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,182
go and take care of that wonder child,
Seok-jun.

579
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,644
I know you're upset, Seong-jun.

580
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,271
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:27,610
But leaving you here isn't easy for me.
I care about you.

582
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:33,199
I just want to provide you
with an easier and safer path.

583
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,993
That's an easier path for you.

584
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,919
I'm sorry,

585
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,172
but our afternoon training
is about to begin.

586
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,345
I know how you feel,

587
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,432
but please try
to think realistically. Okay?

588
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:14,698
I assume you understood
what I want, Coach.

589
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,575
I'll leave things to you now.

590
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,268
Seong-jun.

591
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,401
Let me practice.

592
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,528
I'll be careful.

593
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,739
I'll find a way somehow.

594
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,534
- No.
- Coach.

595
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,619
If you damage your shoulder any further,

596
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,706
you might never be able to play again.

597
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,457
I just need to play at the Nationals.

598
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,919
My whole life depends on it.
You saw how my mom was.

599
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,590
I'll do whatever it takes to play.

600
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,466
Please, Coach.

601
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,887
Seong-jun, think about the future.

602
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,557
Are you going to end your career
at the Nationals' first round?

603
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,476
If I can't play the first round,
there won't be a second.

604
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,565
This is my last chance.

605
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,359
It's just a minor injury.

606
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,069
I'll play at the Nationals,

607
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,114
- and then get surgery--
- Seong-jun.

608
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,617
What am I supposed to do?
This is my last chance.

609
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,541
That's exactly why I'm doing this.
So that this won't be your last chance.

610
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,170
Listen to me.

611
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,924
I won't let you train
until your shoulder recovers.

612
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,101
All I have to do is recover?

613
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,609
Yoon Seong-jun.

614
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,694
Seong-jun. Hey.

615
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,129
ROTATOR CUFF TEAR

616
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,220
We might not be able to play
at the Nationals.

617
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,889
It's not something that can heal
in three weeks.

618
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,226
We don't have any substitutes
for Seong-jun.

619
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,520
Does Coach have a plan?

620
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,689
I don't know.

621
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,982
I wanted to play one good final game.

622
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,236
What if we don't get any new players
next year?

623
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,031
Who's going to apply to a team
that couldn't even be in the Nationals?

624
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,744
I put everything at stake
for the Nationals.

625
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,373
Will ox knee soup help?

626
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,122
Hey! You might hurt your hand.

627
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,582
Don't vandalize school property.

628
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:01,967
Hey!

629
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,760
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

630
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,346
You're a shooter, hand it over.

631
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,399
Thinking about U-jin's rehab
made me feel impatient.

632
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,277
Is she getting better?

633
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,113
She's doing her best.

634
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,673
What's going on?

635
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:52,184
You almost quit shooting
during high school

636
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,602
because of your family.

637
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,437
I did.

638
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,105
How did you get through it?

639
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,235
The ones you wanted the most support from
were against it.

640
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,615
I got through it because of Ju Ga-ram.

641
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,158
What?

642
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,954
When no one, including Mom and Dad,
supported me,

643
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,208
you were on my side.
That was how I got through it.

644
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,420
That was it?

645
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:21,964
What do you mean?

646
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,716
The support of just one person…

647
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,803
means more than you'd think.

648
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,976
Thank you for having my back then.

649
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,063
I still have your back.

650
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,274
All done.

651
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,328
Yes. Focus.

652
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,329
That's it.

653
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,540
Geez.

654
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,504
Me too.

655
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:04,840
What do you mean?

656
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,801
I still have your back.

657
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,270
I'm rooting for you.

658
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,614
Thank you and sorry.

659
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,532
Not that.

660
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,493
- Should I kiss you?
- Geez.

661
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,041
Wrong. Try again.

662
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,212
I love you.

663
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,010

What are you doing right now?

692

You can't do this based on an article
that has no proof.

693
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,994
Shouldn't the school
protect its students first?

I don't know.

The real proof.

699
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,720
They're anabolic steroids.
They were in Seong-jun's drawers.

700

How did this happen?

701
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,608
Did he do this alone?
Or did you make him, Coach Ju?

702

No, that's not--

703

- What?

00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,657
- No, stop.
- Ga-ram.

705
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,283
- Let me talk to him.
- Talk about what?

706
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,618
Rugby Team, block them.

707
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,744
What do you need to talk--

708
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,704
- Ga-ram.
- What are you doing?

709
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,040
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let go of me.

710
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,000
You punks. Darn it.

711
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,251
Get out of the way.

712
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,503
- Ga-ram.
- Move.

713
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,338
- Ga-ram.
- Where are the keys? Open it.

714
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,924
What, are you using force against us?

715
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,515
Did you take them?

716
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,602
Did you?

717
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,771
No.

718
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,276
If you lie now, there's no turning back.

719
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,862
Did you really not take them?

720
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,033
I really didn't take them.

721
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,168
Okay.

722
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,255
It's all right.

723
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,553
Excuse me.

724
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,181
Excuse me.

725
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,023
What are you trying to pull?

726
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,399
ANADROL

727
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,027
That's my medicine.

728
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,195
- Coach Ju.
- Ga-ram.

729
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,447
Hey.

730
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,365
What is that?

731
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,203
Coach.

732
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,498
It's okay.

733
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,761
It really is mine.

734
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,645
I have…

735
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,528
I have been diagnosed
with Myasthenia Gravis.

736
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,699
EPILOGUE

737
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,583
Ma'am.

738
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,257
I'm sorry.
I don't understand what you want.

739
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,552
So I can't persuade Seong-jun.

740
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,720
This is a recoverable injury.

741
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,181
He still has a chance to get into college.

742
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,684
He wants to play rugby.

743
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,729
I have no intention
of standing in the way of his will.

744
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,942
You know better than anyone
that will alone isn't enough.

745
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,862
That might be true.

746
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,613
But…

747
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,784
Seong-jun gets to decide when to retire.

748
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,746
It can be when he gets injured
or when he wants to do something else.

749
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,540
It's not for others to decide,

750
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,877
even if they are his own parents.

751
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,381
He might not succeed
as a rugby player, ever.

752
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,469
But the experience of trying his best
for the things he loves

753
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,887
will last forever.

754
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,850
That experience will help Seong-jun
grow in the future.

755
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:05,106
I won't take away his chance
simply out of fear of failure.

756
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,196
I don't want him to experience failure.

757
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:15,366
I'll make sure that he doesn't fail.

758
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:22,540
Please come and watch him play,
even just once.

759
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,543
I bet he'll be thrilled.

760
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,372
THE WINNING TRY

761
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,873
<i>Did the team have no idea?</i>

762
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,292
They didn't. Leave the boys alone.

763
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,002
<i>Shouldn't we get a resignation letter?</i>

764
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,963
<i>It's a clear cause</i>
<i>for Ms. Kang's dismissal.</i>

765
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,215
<i>Think carefully about whose pills they are</i>

766
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,883
while I'm turning a blind eye.

767
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,176
<i>Coach will come, won't he?</i>

768
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,637
- The school will change the coach.
- Have you gone nuts?

769
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,389
- Are you trying to ruin the team?
- Stop!

770
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,307
How could you say that?

771
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,810
<i>"No player is greater than the team."</i>

772
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,312
<i>No coach is greater than the team either.</i>

773
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,483
<i>I really wanted to fight through it</i>
<i>and go to the Nationals together.</i>

774
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,526
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

775
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,492
