00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,960
THE WINNING TRY

2
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,844
Good job today.

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,429
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

4
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,764
Water for you, Coach.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,723
Thanks.

6
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,784
I'm exhausted.

7
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,036
-Well done.
-Thank you.

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,871
-Bye.
-Thank you.

9
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,169
Hey!

10
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,630
EPISODE 9

11
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,640
JU GA-RAM

12
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,865
-Bang Heung-nam.
-You're here.

13
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,788
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:07,961
It's just that your players
have been playing so well recently.

15
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:12,090
They suddenly got better.
I just find that fascinating, don't you?

16
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,469
So I wanted to ask if you had
any special tricks up your sleeve.

17
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,221
Like, how do you train them?

18
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,932
Are you feeding them
something special or what?

19
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,434
I want my team to be better, too.

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,774
Do you dope your players?

21
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,537
I'm kidding.

22
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,625
I just want my team to play well, too.

23
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,461
My mind is full of all kinds of thoughts.

24
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,754
You would never do that.

25
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,757
Get some rest.

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,519
Bang Heung-nam!

27
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,944
Is there something going on?

28
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,952
No. What brings you here?

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,331
You looked exhausted before,
so I was worried about you.

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,792
I'm all right.

31
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
Bye.

32
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,608
-Go and get some rest.
-Coach.

33
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,861
I want to talk to you
about tomorrow's training.

34
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:11,292
THE WINNING TRY

35
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:20,260
She's hurt. At this rate,
she might not be able to compete.

36
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,721
Exactly.

37
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,224
So please look into it carefully. Okay?

38
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,017
Okay.

39
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,937
Right now, she's…

40
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,073
How dare you say that?

41
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,078
Don't test me, you stuck-up brat.

42
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,999
Just prepare for the regular admission.

43
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,208
I don't want to.

44
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
I'll report your admission fraud

45
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,548
to the Association
and the Office of Education.

46
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,510
You little prick.

47
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,471
What are you doing right now?

48
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,307
Let go.

49
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,101
Let go, or you'll get hurt.

50
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,520
Let go of it. Let go!

51
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,160
This is terrible news.

52
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,164
The Shooting Team's ace is injured
right before the Nationals.

53
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,208
The Nationals isn't the issue
right now, is it?

54
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,003
How is U-jin?

55
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,963
She has multiple lacerations.

56
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,923
It'll take over three weeks to heal.

57
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,303
It was no more than an accident.

58
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,390
She wouldn't stop talking nonsense,
so I took disciplinary action.

59
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,435
Physical assault against a student
can't be justified.

60
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,103
Quit calling it physical assault!

61
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,483
Hold on.

62
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,320
What is this nonsense she talked about?

63
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,496
She saw the recommendation letter

64
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,957
for Daehan Sport University
and called it admission fraud.

65
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,674
We'll set up an investigative committee.

66
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,260
There's no reason
to make it into a big deal.

67
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,387
No need to make a fuss out of it.

68
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,348
-Please tell them.
-It is a big deal.

69
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,145
Allegations of admission fraud
and physical abuse are serious.

70
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,441
Let's set up the committee.

71
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,568
We need to be clear about this.

72
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,278
The whole school's reputation

73
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,531
will be tarnished
if it's not handled correctly.

74
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,828
I'm glad you and I are on the same page.

75
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,748
Coach Bae will write a statement

76
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,627
and coach the students
until the investigation ends.

77
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,463
-Okay.
-Coach Jeon will stay away.

78
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,559
What kind of a lousy job is this?

79
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,937
I apologize.
I assure you, I'll take care of it.

80
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,731
-How?
-I'll do whatever it takes.

81
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,109
-I can bribe them or--
-No.

82
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,360
I don't want to hear about it

83
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,239
because I had nothing to do with it
in the first place.

84
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,494
Writing the recommendation for Seol-hyeon
was all on you.

85
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,579
Pardon?

86
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,086
Make sure my name isn't brought up.

87
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,799
If it affects my promotion
even in the slightest,

88
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,261
you'll be sorry.

89
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,523
Vice Principal.

90
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,611
-May I have a word with you?
-Can't you read the room, Coach Bang?

91
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:11,616
I don't have time
to deal with your gym time issues.

92
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,619
-It's not about that.
-For goodness' sake.

93
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,121
You can't take a hint.
No wonder your team sucks!

94
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,335
I'll say it again,

95
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,546
I don't have time for your whining. Okay?

96
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,094
Hey.

97
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,014
You have no idea what's going on, do you?

98
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,101
Keep your head down, dude.

99
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,122
COUNSELING OFFICE

100
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,756
-Good job today.
-Get the bags.

101
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,674
Rugby Team.

102
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,176
Put those down and follow me.

103
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,974
NURSE'S OFFICE

104
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,395
Why are you asking for us
when you're an aerobics coach?

105
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,149
The Rugby Team
has been doing awfully well.

106
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,193
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

107
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,737
How could you improve so fast?

108
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,574
It's all thanks to our coach's teachings.

109
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,956
I need a urine sample from each of you.

110
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,296
These are doping test kits.

111
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,089
-Yes.
-Why are you asking us for this?

112
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,676
We have no reason to be tested
by other coaches.

113
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,220
-Why are you accusing us?
-No.

114
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,181
It's your coach that I don't trust,
not you guys.

115
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,061
-So do we…
-This is…

116
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,071
What are you doing?

117
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,531
Do it.

118
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,701
You don't know what he might have fed you.

119
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,494
Here, do it.

120
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,629
-You jerk.
-Coach.

121
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,798
What are you doing?

122
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,508
Are you scared?

123
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,468
Follow me outside.

124
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,261
-Come on, Coach.
-Coach.

125
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,722
Come on out.

126
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,809
-Coach.
-Coach.

127
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,811
It's all right. Stay here and wait.

128
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,528
You scumbag.

129
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,197
-Do you think I'm that low?
-Let go!

130
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,741
Do you really think I'd dope them
just to get good results?

131
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,494
-Yes, I do--
-You son of a gun!

132
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,955
Did you just punch me?

133
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,916
I do think you would.

134
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,171
You're the lowest of the low!
You're a juicer!

135
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,964
Nobody can go any lower than that.

136
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,886
Let go.

137
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,182
-Let go! What are you doing?
-You jerk!

138
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,600
Get off me!

139
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,318
-You jerk. You don't know anything.
-What is this?

140
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:39,615
You're calling me a traitor?
Look who's talking.

141
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:43,244
-Eat this, jerk.
-You crazy idiot.

142
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,539
You smell like farts.
Stop farting, you bastard!

143
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,999
My eyes!

144
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,962
-Where did they go?
-What? Guys.

145
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,089
Darn it.

146
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,385
-Coach!
-Coach!

147
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,303
Move!

148
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,936
-Our coach won.
-Didn't you see his bald spots?

149
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,440
-Not really. He's hairier than your coach.
-Your coach is going bald.

150
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,483
He isn't, but who cares? Mr. Buzz Cut.

151
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,319
You're going bald too.
You can't use wax or hairspray, can you?

152
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,363
-Keep telling yourself that.
-"Keep telling…"

153
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,782
What was that?
You couldn't even say it right.

154
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,035
"Keep telling yourself that."
Are you farting out of your mouth?

155
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,588
Aren't you ashamed?

156
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,966
Do you think you're still 18 or something?

157
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,259
-Ga-ram was…
-He started it.

158
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,260
Quiet!

159
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:50,269
Both of you are aware that
fighting on campus results in punishment.

160
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,105
I do, but we're not students.

161
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,024
The punishments are only for the students.

162
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,486
Fighting leads to punishment,
whether you're a teacher or not.

163
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,739
If you get a pass
just because you're a teacher,

164
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,532
what would the students think?

165
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:09,205
However, we cannot suspend training
with the Nationals approaching.

166
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,085
For the time being,

167
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:21,592
we'll be switching coaches
between the teams.

168
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
-What?
-What?

169
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,261
I'd rather clean toilets!

170
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,471
-No.
-That'd be better.

171
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,931
Put yourselves in others' shoes!

172
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,854
I hope you get to understand
each other better.

173
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:39,318
Also, use your expertise
to help the students.

174
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,362
-No, I don't want to.
-You, get out.

175
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,697
-Get out!
-I was leaving.

176
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,533
Get out of here!

177
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,997

00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,337
-Just let them practice their routine.
-Don't do anything stupid.

179
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,756
Don't push the mic button
when I'm speaking.

180
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,883
Let them do their basic training.

181
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,470
-Okay. I'll take care of it, so you…
-Don't you dare mess with them!

182
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,223
-That will be the end of it! Got that?
-Stop yelling.

183
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,943
BIRDS FLAP 1,000 TIMES BEFORE THEY FLY

184
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,945
Practice. Just keep doing your thing.

185
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,447
-Go and shave.
-I can't believe this.

186
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,427
How can he just lie down like that?

187
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,596
Gosh, what an eyesore.

188
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,097
LEAP TOWARD YOUR DREAMS

189
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,356
Watch closely.
They always get this part wrong.

190
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,151
What? Why did it cut off?

191
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,570
Hey, Ga-ram. What's going on?

192
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,449
It just got unplugged.
Can you keep your voice down?

193
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,558
Rugby Team, gather around.

194
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,500
Stop what you've been doing.
We'll work on your flexibility.

195
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,668
Pardon?

196
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,381
Hey, what are you doing?

197
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,424
Let them work out.

198
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,552
-Today is strength training day.
-We do weightlifting today.

199
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,554
Get in line and face this way.

200
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,431
-Seong-jun goes first.
-Right now?

201
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,184
-Hurry!
-Okay. Hurry.

202
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,479
Just watch me and do the same.

203
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,276
-Wow.
-Okay?

204
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,903
-Okay!
-Go.

205
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,324
-Let's do it.
-Pass it.

206
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,786
-Bend more.
-Pass it back. Eyes on the ball.

207
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,664
-Keep your heels down.
-Geez.

208
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,250
-We have to pass it smoothly.
-Okay.

209
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,794
-Your coach never taught you this?
-Heung-nam.

210
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,962
Bang Heung-nam!

211
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,217
It's nothing.

212
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,219
-Captain.
-Yes, Coach.

213
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,972
Gather around and make a circle.

214
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,224
Make a circle there too. Quickly.

215
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,269
Everyone, grab a volleyball.

216
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,521
There you go.

217
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,652
You'll pass the ball
to the person next to you. Got it?

218
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,488
Why are we passing?
We're not playing rugby.

219
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,074
Do as you're told.
Looks like you really need it.

220
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,368
Okay. Stay with the count.

221
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,412
One, two, three.

222
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,581
That's right. One, two, three.

223
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,666
There you go. One, two, three.

224
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,501
Good. One, two, three.

225
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,837
Two, three.

226
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,506
Two, three. One, two, three.

227
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,675
One, two, three.

228
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,761
Go!

229
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,387
Bend your back further.

230
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,598
-You're Hyeong-sik, aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

231
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,475
-We're close.
-Yeong-gwang.

232
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,226
-More.
-Why can't you do it?

233
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,771
-There you go!
-More!

234
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,606
-Geez.
-Again.

235
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,857
-What? Again?
-Again.

236
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,609
Keep going. Again.

237
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,278
Keep your back steady. Come back up.

238
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,447
Again.

239
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,282
Two, three.

240
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,785
To the left.

241
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,037
Two, three.

242
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,288
Hey, focus!

243
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,416
Two, three.

244
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,584
Geez.

245
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,961
My back.

246
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,088
Hey, Ju-yang.

247
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,672
Come on!

248
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,883
Go tell them.

249
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,594
-Hey, it's the Aerobics Team.
-Hey, Seong-jun.

250
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,595
-Tell them.
-Hurry.

251
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,222
Do you want to do this again?

252
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,682
-Hurry.
-Talk with them.

253
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,565
-I can't roll my shoulder.
-Come on.

254
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,859
-Start talking.
-Are they talking?

255
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,367
We can't keep training like this.

256
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,163
So, what's your plan?

257
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,790
Let's find a solution.

258
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,210
What can we do?
It's the Principal's order.

259
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,504
It all started because they fought.

260
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,631
Let's get them to make peace.

261
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,341
Our team is in.

262
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,386
But we'll need your help too.

263
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,679
If we help you, then what?

264
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,098
Then what?

265
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,273
We'll share the gym.

266
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,650
There's enough room.
There are only seven of us.

267
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,610
-Are you in?
-Keep your word.

268
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,459
Don't do anything stupid today.

269
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,878
-Look who's talking.
-Stay low.

270
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,212
-Dumbass.
-You're the dumbass.

271
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,797
-You stay still.
-They don't need you.

272
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,507
-Whatever.
-Darn it.

273
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,725
-Hey, get the legs.
-Let's go.

274
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,851
-It's dark!
-Grab him.

275
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,353
I can't see. What is it?

276
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,231
What is this? I know who you are.

277
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,991
Stop slapping my butt. Geez.

278
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,788
-Let's throw him in.
-One, two, three.

279
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,499
Okay, I'm sorry.

280
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,464
Lock it.

281
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,593
We did it!

282
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,350
Rugby Team! Open the door.

283
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,894
We can't go on like this, Coach.

284
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,063
It's In-gu, isn't it? Hurry and open up.

285
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,899
We won't open it until you two make peace.

286
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,776
Darn it.

287
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,154
We'll take turns watching them
while the rest train.

288
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,198
-We'll be back in an hour.
-Rugby Team.

289
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,033
-Let's go.
-In-gu.

290
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,327
Guys!

291
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:52,668
Don't just lie down like that.
Do something, will you?

292
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,086
Hurry.

293
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,256
Hey, Ga-ram.

294
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,799
Ga-ram.

295
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,052
Breathe. Breathe slowly.

296
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,428
My phone. Rugby Team.

297
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,347
Medicine.

298
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,473
-My medicine.
-What?

299
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,766
Where's my medicine?

300
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,559
Medicine? This?

301
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,853
-This?
-Yes.

302
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,066
Darn it. Here.

303
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,402
Open up.

304
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,366
Breathe slowly.

305
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,034
Stretch your legs. You okay?

306
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,763
So this is why you said it was yours?

307
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,558
I got Myasthenia Gravis…

308
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:57,733
three years ago
before the Asian Rugby Cup Final.

309
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:06,158
If I take medicine, it's not too bad.

310
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,869
Once the Nationals are over,

311
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,704
I'll get surgery.

312
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,290
Shouldn't you be at the hospital, then?

313
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,625
What are you doing here…

314
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,963
bringing dangerous medicine to the school?

315
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:27,471
The boys were about to get kicked off
from the field…

316
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,267
just because they weren't performing well,

317
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,395
or contributing to earning school points.

318
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,647
It's always been like this.

319
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,776
If you aren't in first place
or a gold medalist,

320
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,153
you're meaningless in this world.

321
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,785
Do you really think that?

322
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,371
At this school,

323
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,625
we played

324
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,795
171 matches.

325
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,800
We lost 89 of them.

326
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:11,098
We only won the gold medal once.

327
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,436
Because we only won one gold medal,

328
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,857
does that mean all the time and effort
we put in here

329
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,027
was for nothing?

330
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,073
Did the three years mean nothing to you?

331
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,836
I just wanted

332
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,839
to give the boys…

333
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,719
a chance

334
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,974
to work hard for their dreams.

335
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,603
So, please cut me some slack

336
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,815
until the Nationals.

337
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,819
ANADROL

338
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,736
After that,

339
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,240
I can't do it even if I wanted to.

340
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,175
Hey, why are you crying?

341
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,571
Open up.

342
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,574
We made up.

343
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,452
Rugby Team.

344
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,917
-Hey!
-Let's go.

345
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,919
Run!

346
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,089
I-ji.

347
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,810
One more soju, please.

348
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,103
Yang Seung.

349
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,147
You're here.

350
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,776
-Where's Ga-ram?
-Coach Ju.

351
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,319
-Hi.
-Hey, Yang Seung.

352
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,198
-Let's set the table.
-Hurry up.

353
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,659
Three glasses, please.

354
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,077
-Okay.
-Bang Heung-nam?

355
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,288
Geez, they brought an unwelcome guest.

356
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,414
-I'm leaving.
-No. Hey!

357
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,499
Heung-nam!

358
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,833
-Hey.
-Heung-nam.

359
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,961
Sit here.

360
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,087
Sit.

361
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,343
Word is you guys had a fist fight.

362
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,847
What great coaches you are.
Aren't you embarrassed?

363
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,016
So why did you bring him here?

364
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,269
He's Mr. Seong's rat.

365
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,020
-What did you say?
-You're a rat.

366
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,898
Stop. He's a rat, all right.

367
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,192
But he's on our side now.

368
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,199
Come on, we haven't done this in a while.

369
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,117
Here!

370
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,453
What's wrong with you? Geez.

371
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,914
-Do you still do this?
-Seriously.

372
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,708
-Bang-gu.
-Hurry.

373
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,751
-Hurry.
-Hold on.

374
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,005
Seriously?

375
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,506
Come on.

376
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,508
Geez.

377
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,054
I'll do it.

378
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,809
Han!

379
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,478
-Yang.
-Yang.

380
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,648
After all these years, it's still fun.

381
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,444
Cheers.

382
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,154
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

383
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,203
You can't betray us anymore.

384
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,874
We're giving you one last chance.

385
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,044
I did side with Mr. Seong to survive.

386
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,755
But how is that betrayal?

387
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:16,676
You transferred to the Aerobics Team
without saying a word to us, dude.

388
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,345
-He did.
-Why did you do that?

389
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,763
You guys remember, right?

390
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,474
Ever since the Presidents Cup semifinal,

391
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:26,978
the coach stopped putting me
in the starting lineup.

392
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,314
What? That was because you were injured.

393
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,857
How do you know that?

394
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,903
That was why I told Coach to take you out.

395
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,990
That was why…

396
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,412
-Hey!
-For goodness' sake.

397
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,791
I was removed from the lineup
because you told Coach?

398
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,708
Yes.

399
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,877
Why?

400
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,048
I could've still played, you crazy idiot.

401
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,259
Who did you think you were
to take me out like that?

402
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,719
Well, I couldn't stay still!

403
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,097
Were you going to retire after that game?

404
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,973
I thought the team had abandoned me

405
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,394
because I wasn't good enough.
I had no idea that was the reason.

406
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,979
I thought that was why
you guys left me too.

407
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:14,150
That's what I believed all along.
You should have told me or something!

408
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,360
He's drunk.

409
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,656
Is that why you've been sulky?

410
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,699
-I haven't been sulky.
-Seriously?

411
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,495
-Was that why you transferred? Was it?
-Calm down. Heung-nam, here.

412
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,538
Drink this,

413
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,375
-and forget about it.
-To 20 years of misunderstanding.

414
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,711
-You're now settled as a coach.
-It turned out for the better.

415
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,465
Didn't you guys coach each other's team?

416
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,092
-They did.
-What did you do?

417
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,597
-I just watched over them.
-I watched them train.

418
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,683
Clean up. Clean up.

419
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,810
Everybody, clean up.

420
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,233
My body feels lighter today.

421
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,193
I can't stop doing this.

422
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,571
My morning back pain is gone. Take this.

423
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,201
-I got it.
-See? Aren't I better?

424
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,544
Hey. We were perfectly in sync.

425
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,088
Really? Let's watch it together.

426
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:30,310
I noticed you were drinking
on an empty stomach. Here, drink this.

427
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,668
-What are you doing?
-Say it louder for the people in the back.

428
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,638
Is it because of the investigation?

429
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,764
Yeah.

430
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,227
I'm worried because Nak-gyun
is probably scheming something.

431
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:17,816
"What can I do to solve this?"
It's another concern I have.

432
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,902
That's why I've come prepared.

433
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,198
Here.

434
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,038
BAE I-JI, CONGRATS ON SHOOTING

435
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,292
Congrats on overcoming the yips!

436
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,965
The yips are irrelevant right now.

437
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,758
It matters the most to me.

438
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,679
I told you.

439
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,350
I'd give it back to you
when you have to take the shot

440
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:57,063
despite the danger and pressure.

441
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,990
Yes. That's right.

442
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,326
The moment came, and you did it.

443
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,830
BAE I-JI, CONGRATS ON SHOOTING

444
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,874
You're right. I did it.

445
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,127
No one's stronger
than I-ji with a gun in her hand.

446
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,964
Ignore what others say
and don't take it personally.

447
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,636
You know, everyone there has a gun.

448
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,597
You have what they don't have.

449
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,931
-What?
-Me.

450
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,518
If they shoot you, I'll block them all.

451
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,562
How dare they?

452
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,783
-Actually, I dropped the pistol.
-What?

453
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:59,375
I did it! I kissed you! I kissed you!

454
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,752
Have you lost your mind?

455
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,253
Come here.

456
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,381
Why did you have to bring it here?
It's heavy.

457
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,216
Come here, Ga-ram!

458
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,181
INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE

459
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,351
The recommendation letter I wrote
was for U-jin.

460
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,939
But Coach Jeon changed the name
to Seol-hyeon.

461
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,024
If you compare them, it's obvious.

462
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,817
OFFICE OF EDUCATION
PARK YONG-SU

463
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:29,697
Are you saying Coach Jeon swapped
the two students' recommendation letters?

464
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,032
Yes.

465
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,827
And he employed violence against U-jin
when she found out about it.

466
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,747
That was discipline, not violence.

467
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,709
I only referred to the letter
Coach Bae wrote.

468
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,378
I didn't do anything wrong.

469
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,130
Let's hear from U-jin, too.

470
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,966
U-jin.

471
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,719
Can you tell us what happened that day?

472
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,823
-That day--
-It was a mere accident.

473
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,658
Mom.

474
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,622
The Nationals are coming up soon.

475
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,292
I don't want to distract her training
with something like this.

476
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:34,345
Coach Jeon apologized
and said he'd help her recover,

477
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,931
so let's just let it slide.

478
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,434
Ma'am, this is a serious matter.

479
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,395
The upcoming Nationals
isn't the problem here.

480
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,648
This can affect U-jin's future career
as a whole.

481
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,400
Exactly.

482
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,902
That's why I want to move on.

483
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,289
It really was an accident.

484
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,333
I sincerely apologize.

485
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,670
Sorry doesn't fix the fact
that the athlete has been hurt.

486
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,088
Of course.

487
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:13,092
I'd be shameless
if I apologized with words alone.

488
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,308
There's only one spot open
for Daehan Sport University this year.

489
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,644
So I can't do much about it,
but two spots will be open next year.

490
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,522
And one of them will be U-jin's.

491
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,400
You want U-jin to sit around all year?

492
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,862
That year will give her insight
into the world of the pros.

493
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,364
She'll get her training there too.

494
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,409
I promise to get her into a pro team.

495
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,624
As her mom, I care about her
more than anyone else.

496
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,796
I've made this decision
for the sake of her future,

497
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,339
so I ask you to respect it.

498
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,977
Are you out of your mind?

499
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,480
Coach Bae.

500
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,315
Don't cross the line.

501
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,484
It's you who crossed the line.

502
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,569
U-jin is hurt.

503
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,197
She has to train in the same space
as her attacker.

504
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,616
-And you're okay with that?
-If I don't,

505
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,662
should she give up the Nationals?
Is that what you want?

506
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:27,708
-That's not what I'm saying.
-I'm doing this for U-jin.

507
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,711
Is it really for U-jin?

508
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,964
Or is it for U-jin, the athlete?

509
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,342
Is there any difference?

510
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,097
Hasn't it occurred to you
that your problem

511
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,599
is that you're separating the two?

512
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,018
Why are you standing there?
Aren't you going to pack your stuff?

513
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,061
Didn't you see this coming?

514
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,651
You think you did it for U-jin, don't you?

515
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,364
Don't fool yourself.

516
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,993
You're no help to her. Okay?

517
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,580
You're lacking the right network
and contacts.

518
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,874
You've won no medals.

519
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,418
Who would like you?

520
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,675
The players don't need you.

521
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,678
Look at those eyes.

522
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,972
Are you going to shoot me this time?

523
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,351
Go away.

524
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,012
Ga-ram.

525
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,765
Stop it.

526
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,311
I can't let you go like this.
I'm so furious and enraged!

527
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,729
Should I go and punch him?

528
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,524
It's aggravated assault
if an athlete hits someone.

529
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,110
It's just so frustrating.

530
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,866
Tell me what I can do for you.
I'll do anything.

531
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,371
-Anything?
-Yes. Anything.

532
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,677
Darn it.

533
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,101
I'm fine.

534
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,562
I'm rather relieved.

535
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,108
There's no place for me here.

536
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,280
No one needs me here.

537
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,368
There's nothing I can do.

538
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,832
-Is that what that moron Nak-gyun said?
-I'm going to prepare for the Nationals.

539
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,250
What?

540
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,381
I can no longer participate as a coach,

541
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,511
but I still have one last chance
as a player.

542
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,522
So root for me.

543
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,110
That's what you can do for me.

544
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,124
If that's what you've decided,

545
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,502
I'll do that.

546
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,221
Come on!

547
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,698
-Give it to me.
-I'll go with you.

548
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,159
It's all right.

549
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,084
Please check on the shooters
from time to time.

550
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,837
-I'll do that.
-I'll get going.

551
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,680
See you at the Nationals.

552
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,455
SHOOTING RANGE

553
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,985
Aren't you going to get it together?

554
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,824
What's wrong?

555
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,785
Is there something wrong?

556
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,381
You think I'm going to hurt you?

557
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,968
I'm genuinely offended.

558
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,558
Coach.

559
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,061
Please help me. My shooting timing is off.

560
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,438
Okay. I'll be right there.

561
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,193
If you aren't well enough to train, leave.
You're ruining the mood for everyone.

562
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,154
What a weakling. Darn it.

563
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,365
Focus.

564
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,449
Let me check.

565
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,106
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

566
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,401
Thank you.

567
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,296
Get on my back.

568
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,467
-What?
-Training ends soon. Hurry.

569
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,166
Give it. I'll do it.

570
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,005
You're feeling dizzy, aren't you?

571
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,095
Please play dumb.

572
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,935
Ung, the pain relief patches were--

573
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,859
Hey.

574
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,820
What's going on with you?

575
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,590
What are you two doing?

576
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,764
I asked for her help
because I couldn't find the patches.

577
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,436
They're in the cabinet over there.

578
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,693
If you found them, please leave.

579
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,445
I'm here to get some rest.

580
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:51,874
Come on out.

581
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,222
What is it?

582
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,185
What are you and U-jin hiding?

583
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,691
I'm not hiding anything.

584
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,322
Hey.

585
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,948
Am I a joke to you?

586
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,452
-No, it's not like that.
-Then what's with her?

587
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,845
This way.

589
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,060
Hey!

590
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,521
Take cover!

591
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,231
Go!

592
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:58,899
He caught it.

593
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,365
-Did you see that spin?
-Yes.

594
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:13,539
Watch the movements of the players
in your position. Don't miss a thing.

595
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:18,126
Watching the best players up close
is a great way to learn.

596
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,128
-Okay. Got it.
-Okay.

597
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,050
You have to go!

598
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,176
-He's going.
-Go for it.

599
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,302
-Go!
-Now!

600
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,679
-Run!
-Now.

601
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,316
-Exactly.
-They're awesome.

602
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,530
Well done.

603
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,823
-Well done.
-Well done.

604
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:48,782
You're here.

605
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,367
They're all looking great.

606
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,494
You can look forward to next year.

607
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,787
We'll win next year.

608
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,832
We haven't won in the three years
since you left.

609
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,877
Thank you for playing
a practice match with us.

610
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,422
The boys have gotten much better,
thanks to you.

611
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,717
Also, thank you
for letting them watch today.

612
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,428
I got a call from Coach Song.

613
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,805
He told me to help you.

614
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,058
It was all my fault.

615
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:16,893
Also,

616
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,187
it's a thing of the past.

617
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,984
But since you're offering to help,
I am thankful.

618
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,777
It's tough being a rookie coach.

619
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,118
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

620
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,913
-How do you do your weight training?
-Weight training?

621
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,583
-On Mondays…
-Come on.

622
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,422
-Get me his autograph.
-I'm about to faint.

623
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,466
-You're in the same position.
-Right.

624
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,717
So go and talk to him.

625
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,844
-You're good at English.
-Hold on.

626
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,680
It's rude to bother him
right after he finishes a match.

627
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,682
-I'll do it, then.
-I'll do it.

628
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,062
Hello?

629
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,153
What? Fly… The fly-half.

630
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,738
Right, the fly-half!

631
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,617
Me.

632
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,944
-Hanyang!
-Yes, Hanyang!

633
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,531
Play hard, guys.

634
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,490
-What?
-What?

635
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,033
-"Guys"? What?
-What?

636
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,828
I'm a big fan of yours. I'll do my best.

637
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,710
Be honored. The coach right here
will watch you practice.

638
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,878
This kind of chance
doesn't come every day.

639
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,006
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

640
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,300
The third-years, Seong-jun, Myeong-u,
and Yeong-gwang.

641
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,343
-Yes.
-Yes.

642
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:18,014
If he likes you, you could skip college
and go straight to the pros.

643
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,599
This is great, I hate studying.

644
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,226
-He's an airhead.
-It's all right now.

645
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,645
Hurry up, get changed,
and meet me on the field.

646
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,856
-Go.
-Okay.

647
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,318
-Start.
-Yes.

648
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,205
-That's it.
-Nice.

649
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,582
Good job, Ung.

650
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,959
-Good job.
-Nice.

651
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,003
He's Mun Cheol-yeong's son, isn't he?

652
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,671
Yes. He's just begun playing.

653
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,882
Some are born with it.

654
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,803
Who wants to try next?

655
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,515
-I'll do it.
-Okay. Go.

656
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,768
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

657
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:06,980
Ready.

658
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,442
Okay, go.

659
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,580
-Hey.
-Captain.

660
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,040
-Seong-jun.
-Darn it.

661
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,292
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay, Seong-jun?

662
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:28,919
Are you all right?

663
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,381
I'm all right.

664
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,301
You should move first
by predicting his moves.

665
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
It's too late if you react to his move.

666
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,889
Sorry. I'll try it again.

667
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,516
Okay, go again.

668
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,768
Okay. Good luck, Captain.

669
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,977
-Let's go.
-You got this.

670
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,080
ANHYEON CITY HALL

671
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,192
You're on a break, right?

672
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,070
How's practice going?

673
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,531
It would go better if you hung up.

674
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:44,369
A shooter should be able to focus
under any circumstances.

675
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,540
Is the Shooting Team doing okay?

676
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,458
Why don't you focus on your training?

677
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,047
Just a second.

678
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,134
Who is it?

679
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,262
-You know where Coach Bae is, right?
-Why do you ask?

680
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,389
U-jin is missing.

681
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,307
-What?
-What?

682
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,642
-It's--
-Put her on the phone.

683
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,230
She was in school this afternoon.

684
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,815
But she didn't return to the dorm.

685
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,943
She's not in the shooting range,
and she even left her phone.

686
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,238
I'll look for her. Tell Coach Jeon
she went to see the doctor.

687
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,490
-Okay.
-No, I-ji.

688
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,992
-Wait.
-I'm on my way.

689
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,454
Search everywhere, including the rooftop,
classrooms, and the parking lot.

690
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,747
You can't come here!

691
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,012
Seo U-jin?

692
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,056
Coach.

693
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,270
I'm here for Seo U-jin.

694
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,649
U-jin.

695
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,233
Coach.

696
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,657
-Are you all right?
-Coach.

697
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,410
I can't keep my balance.

698
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,499
They say it's because I hurt my ear.

699
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,756
Are my shooting days over?

700
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,550
Why would you say that?

701
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,970
You just need treatment and rehab.

702
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,805
Will I be able to shoot

703
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,432
like I used to after rehab?

704
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,187
If my mom finds out,

705
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,523
she'll make me quit right away,

706
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,151
saying there's no point
if I can't be the best.

707
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,198
But…

708
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,370
I want to keep shooting.

709
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,873
It doesn't matter if I can't win.

710
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,334
I want to shoot.

711
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,797
Help me, Coach.

712
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,550
Please?

713
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,432
You can do it.

714
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,809
You can do it, U-jin.

715
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,687
You can do it, U-jin.

716
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,442
You can do it.

717
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,444
You can do it, U-jin.

718
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,781
It's all right.

719
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,288
It's okay, U-jin.

720
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,249
You can do it.

721
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,425
It's okay.

722
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,322
Go ahead.

723
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,908
Don't think about anything.
Just get some sleep.

724
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,077
Okay.

725
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,007
I'm against this.

726
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,259
About what?

727
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,930
You've recovered from the yips,
and the Nationals are approaching soon.

728
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,267
You should focus on your training.
Focus on yourself and nothing else.

729
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,395
You're not one to talk.
You even gave up surgery to be here.

730
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,606
Can't you be selfish just this once?

731
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,192
I don't want you to get hurt.

732
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:50,824
Darn it.

733
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,537
Go. The taxi's waiting.

734
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,932
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

735
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,401
What are you doing, I-ji?

736
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,779
Can't you see? I'm cleaning.

737
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,740
Exactly. Why are you cleaning here
right now?

738
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,870
Mr. Seong and Coach Jeon are coming.
You should leave.

739
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,580
Give it to me.

740
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,543
-Are you off your game again?
-Geez. You must be happy.

741
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,592
School security must be just for show

742
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,346
for outsiders to be allowed in freely.

743
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,573
What, are you going to hit me?

744
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,713
I'm sorry.

745
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,715
What are you doing?

746
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,300
Coach.

747
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,136
I'm sorry
I accused you of admission fraud,

748
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:39,724
and for escalating things
by calling it school violence.

749
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,227
The sudden change in your attitude

750
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,187
has caught me off guard.

751
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,524
Why are you doing this, Coach Bae?

752
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,485
To make a living.

753
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,780
Shooting is all I know.

754
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,991
I have nowhere to go
if I'm kicked out of this world.

755
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,662
Geez.

756
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,372
Did you realize that just now?

757
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,959
I'll be a puppet.

758
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:11,214
From now on, I won't see or hear anything.

759
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,633
-Really?
-Yes.

760
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:19,264
I mean, how far can you go?

761
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,810
Let's check.

762
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,855
This is the perfect place to practice,
but it has one downside.

763
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:31,276
The ball dispensers aren't automatic.

764
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,487
Come and place the ball.

765
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,200
You're on your knees, anyway.

766
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,870
Think of yourself as a ball dispenser.

767
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,377
Okay. Good.

768
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,753
-I-ji.
-Relax.

769
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,136
-Nice shot!
-Coach Jeon.

770
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,555
Come on, Jong-man.

771
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,852
She wants to be a puppet.
We have to see how determined she is.

772
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:11,357
You should take it easy today.
You're playing with Mr. Na this weekend.

773
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,823
Now, relax.

774
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,138
You scumbag!

775
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:44,974
-Come here.
-Ga-ram.

776
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,517
Come.

777
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,852
-Ga-ram.
-Come here.

778
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,271
-Don't do this.
-Darn it!

779
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,522
-Don't.
-Let go.

780
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,523
-Stop.
-Hey!

781
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,108
-Ga-ram.
-Darn it!

782
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,485
-Ga-ram!
-Move!

783
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,445
Ga-ram!

784
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,697
This is my decision. Don't get in the way.

785
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,532
Why would you make such a decision?

786
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,284
This is not helping me in any way.

787
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,786
Please go.

788
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,287
Just go!

789
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,081
How interesting.

790
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,166
Old sayings are always true.

791
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,797
"Spare the rod, spoil the child."

792
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,592
-I'm sorry.
-No, you don't have to be.

793
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:24,764
Me? This "scumbag"?
What do you intend to do? Let's see.

794
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,684
Come here.

795
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,689
THE WINNING TRY

796
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,774
EPILOGUE

797
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,997
THE NATIONALS
D-30

798
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,084
GET MORE EXPERIENCE, BULK UP,
COMBAT MODE, LEG TRAINING

799
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,420
GAIN WEIGHT

800
01:01:55,503 --> 01:02:01,217
GET THROUGH THE NATIONALS

801
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,246
THE WINNING TRY

802
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,873
What should we do about Ga-ram…

803
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,167
We have to find a way
to kick him out for good.

804
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,170
Coach Ju is seeing a neurologist.

805
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,507
You're so precious to me.
So why do you treat yourself like this?

806
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,135
To regain your balance,
you need special training.

807
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,928
-Will this work?
-Let's try it.

808
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:50,808
The draw official for the Nationals
holds great responsibility.

809
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,394
I want to take Seong-jun to Spain.

810
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,189
Forget about Nationals.
Are you trying to end your career?

811
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,649
What am I supposed to do?
This is my last chance.

812
01:02:58,733 --> 01:02:59,650
This is bad.

813
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,111
Stop right there. Don't mess with my boys.

814
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,488
You'll regret it.

815
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,704
