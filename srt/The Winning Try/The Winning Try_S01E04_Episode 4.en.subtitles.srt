THE WINNING TRY

00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,295
TWENTY YEARS AGO

3
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,838
2005 SPECIAL ADMISSION TRYOUTS

4
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,922
Ready.

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:52,969
Jeong-hyo.

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,433
I heard you brought him here.
Are you recruiting him as a new shooter?

7
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,726
Not exactly.

8
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,228
When I saw him run,
I knew he'd do well anywhere.

9
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,023
I heard he beat a second-year in judo.

10
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,191
TRACK AND FIELD COACH

11
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:10,361
-Did he learn to play sports somewhere?
-Nothing professionally, I heard.

12
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,615
The judo coach is already
threatening everyone he called dibs.

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,033
Ready.

14
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,919
I'm going to have to buy
the judo coach a drink.

15
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,629
He's a runner, not a judo player.

16
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,467
He'll make a clean sweep of the medals
with three months of training.

17
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,637
Ju Ga-ram, he's all mine.

18
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,016
Geez.

19
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,899
THE WINNING TRY

20
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,613
EPISODE 4

21
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,408
Now, we will begin the 2025

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,618
second semester's--

23
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,120
Hold on!

24
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,554
Our player is here.

25
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,098
-He's here.
-He's here.

26
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,349
-He came.
-What?

27
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,642
RUGBY TEAM

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,867
Darn it.

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,878
We have a player.

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,944
There has been a change
in the special admission process

31
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,404
starting this semester.

32
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,205
Each team will hold a tryout.

33
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,919
Any coach who wants an athlete
can participate.

34
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,505
From there, he has to pass
at least half of the tryouts.

35
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,344
Then he'll be admitted to the school
and have a chance to choose a team

36
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,512
among the events he has passed.

37
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:47,644
We changed the process five years ago
because no one could get in this way.

38
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,145
Someone did get in.

39
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,406
It's an order
from the Office of Education.

40
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,453
He can't get admitted to the school
if he doesn't want to try out.

41
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,255
SPECIAL ADMISSION TRYOUTS

42
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,340
-Look.
-Hey, Rugby.

43
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,677
MUN UNG: 1ST-YEAR
RUGBY, FENCING, ARCHERY

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,179
The Rugby Team is done for.

45
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,889
Shouldn't they just give up?

46
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,015
-True.
-Right?

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,977
-Are you out of your minds?
-Do you want another beating?

48
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,938
Man.

49
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,733
CATEGORY: RUGBY, FENCING, ARCHERY

50
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,072
Geez.

51
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,534
Has he ever played sports before, Coach?

52
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,953
Not professionally, I assume.

53
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,330
His body is so perfect, though.

54
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,125
Exactly.

55
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,921
He's 183 cm, weighs 78 kg,
and runs 100m in the high 11s.

56
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,674
We have yet to check his big three lifts.

57
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,387
But he has strong shoulders and arms
from making deliveries for years.

58
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,225
See how it bounces my fingers off?
He has great core strength too.

59
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,897
-We're not that different.
-Let's say we let him win in rugby,

60
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,858
but fencing and archery
are technical sports.

61
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,320
We will find a way.

62
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,157
Ga-ram might try to outsmart us,

63
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,827
so we picked the hardest events
among the technical sports.

64
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,620
Good.

65
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,750
A natural can sometimes
pull a miracle in basic sports,

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,210
like when a newbie beats a professional.

67
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,672
Still, don't let your guard down
and be prepared.

68
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,923
-Okay.
-Yes.

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,676
May I ask why you excluded shooting?

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,721
Of the technical sports,
shooting is the most difficult one.

71
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:53,227
Is it going to be all right?
Ms. Kang seemed very angry.

72
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,398
I'll take care of her myself.

73
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,942
Take care of what?

74
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,528
You can get going.

75
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,821
-Okay.
-Yes.

76
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,202
What are you trying to pull?

77
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,079
You even brought
the Office of Education in.

78
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,875
Please consider it the first step
in the school's development.

79
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,960
Is this development for the students?

80
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,796
Or is it for you?

81
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,592
I understand how you feel.

82
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,720
You want to take care
of every single student.

83
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,808
But of the school's graduates,

84
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,895
less than 10% have become
professional athletes.

85
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,814
Those who don't make it as pros

86
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,359
try to become PE teachers
by going to college,

87
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,860
but that's not easy, either.

88
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,446
Maybe 5% succeed at best.

89
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,409
Then do you know
what the remaining 85% are doing

90
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,286
to make a living?

91
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,623
I heard someone say

92
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,878
that half of the club bouncers in Gangnam
are from PE high schools.

93
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,046
Vice Principal!

94
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,172
Am I being too blunt?

95
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,260
Isn't it the cruel reality
we want to ignore?

96
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,888
What does it mean to be a good teacher?

97
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,934
Someone who inspires hopes and dreams
saying, "Do whatever you want to do"?

98
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,146
Or someone who helps students identify

99
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,815
which paths
are actually feasible for them?

100
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,359
A school,

101
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,819
especially a PE high school,

102
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,322
isn't some fantasy land
for finding dreams.

103
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,701
School is where athletes
learn to face reality.

104
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,287
This is a vocational school.

105
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,333
Your romantic idea…

106
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,545
is an unrealistic fantasy.

107
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,964
Dream all you want,

108
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,800
but don't drag the students into it.

109
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,252
-Did you hear everything?
-The school isn't soundproofed well.

110
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,384
Geez.

111
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,597
Why are you so down?

112
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,433
Because what the vice principal said…

113
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,728
isn't totally wrong.

114
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,485
The teams he wants to disband don't have
enough professional teams to advance to,

115
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,071
and the colleges have limited quotas.

116
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,782
True. Even in rugby,

117
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,536
there are only a handful
of professional teams.

118
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,082
How many of these students

119
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,335
will be able to become
professional athletes?

120
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,679
Was I never a good teacher?

121
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,225
Should I…

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,478
have been more cold-hearted?

123
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,732
Ms. Kang.

124
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,570
Do you remember that…

125
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,988
that thing?

126
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
What?

127
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,411
I didn't start playing rugby
to become an athlete.

128
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:40,997
Ju Ga-ram.

129
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,209
Take a seat.

130
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,589
Have you made up your mind?
The track and field coach wants you.

131
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,424
He did.

132
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,884
But…

133
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,640
How about rugby?

134
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,101
Rugby?

135
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:07,648
In rugby, you can't pass forward.
You can only pass to the side or backward.

136
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,900
In other words,

137
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,696
someone has to protect your side
at all times.

138
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,574
It looks tough on the outside,

139
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,785
but in fact, it's the kindest sport.

140
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,663
You won't be lonely.

141
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,090
It was 17-year-old Ju Ga-ram
who chose to play rugby.

142
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,011
You and Mr. Seong seem to think

143
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,891
you're responsible
for the students' futures.

144
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,815
They run and roll on the ground

145
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,484
because they choose to do so.

146
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,327
Ms. Kang.

147
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,913
Give them a chance

148
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,458
to decide their lives for themselves.

149
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,140
HANYANG RUGBY

150
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,355
Higher.

151
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,817
Ju-yang, go higher.

152
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,859
More?

153
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,361
Stop.

154
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,406
Now.

155
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,449
-Look at the protractor.
-You're here, Coach.

156
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,284
-Coach.
-Already hazing the new guy?

157
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,619
It's not just a hazing.

158
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,746
They say flexibility is key in fencing.

159
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,664
Right.

160
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,290
Save me, Coach.

161
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,000
Help me.

162
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,086
Coach.

163
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,006
DAY 1, DAY 2, DAY 3

164
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,341
Break time.

165
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,301
Geez. This is hard.

166
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,970
Okay. Moving on.

167
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,305
The next step. Let's go.

168
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,016
Now, we use this…

169
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,643
Breathe.

170
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,314
VINEGAR

171
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,607
Why the vinegar?

172
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,609
It's good for flexibility.

173
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,154
Open up.

174
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,614
It looks tasty.

175
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,702
-Did you guys plan this out?
-Yes.

176
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,039
He'll only have a chance
if he sticks to a tight schedule.

177
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,875
It looks good.

178
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,877
-Are you serious?
-Yes. It's great.

179
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,506
But one thing. Let's see.

180
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,927
Just a second.

181
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,476
Give him some time to eat.

182
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,311
For three hours?

183
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,523
Make sure he gets more sleep
so he doesn't get injured.

184
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,526
Then it's perfect.

185
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
Isn't it too loose?

186
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,490
What if he loses?

187
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,868
Our strengths are clear.

188
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,121
We just need to find out
their weaknesses now.

189
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,344
That's good.

190
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,087
What are you doing? Isn't it hot?

191
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,215
Darn it.

192
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,801
You'll hurt yourself.

193
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,053
Geez. I'm so sick of this.

194
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,723
Are you really going to do it, Captain?

195
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,976
Yes. I guess I am.

196
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,895
Is that even necessary?
Even a first-year could beat him.

197
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,398
Coach said I have to crush him
without losing a point.

198
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,568
-For real?
-Of course. You're Park Il-hwan.

199
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,736
The result is obvious.
Isn't it a waste of time?

200
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,073
Geez. You splashed everywhere.

201
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:30,160
Kids these days can't even aim.
For goodness' sake.

202
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,624
Park Il-hwan.

203
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,678
Prets. Allez.

204
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,199
Coach.

205
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,493
-Could you please take a look?
-Sure.

206
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,879
Who are you?

207
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,973
En garde!

208
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,644
What?

209
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,733
Where did you get these?

210
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,777
They all belong to Park Il-hwan.

211
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,614
Il-hwan is our opponent.

212
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,573
Geez.

213
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,285
-He's the fencing captain.
-Aren't they taking it too far?

214
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,204
How could they play their ace?

215
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,540
When did they ever play fair?

216
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,084
You two.

217
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,295
Can you summarize his weaknesses
with the training log?

218
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,838
Yes, we can.

219
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,800
How's Ung's basic training going?

220
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,889
EN GARDE, MARCHE, ROMPRE, FENTE

221
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,228
Wait. How can he do that in one day?

222
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,897
It's thanks to my superb plan.

223
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,733
Even though he's a fast learner,
there's a limit.

224
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,777
Especially against Il-hwan,

225
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,987
he has zero chance.

226
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,322
And there's archery too.

227
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,120
If you keep going without giving up,
you'll find a way.

228
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,788
Don't you know the rugby spirit?

229
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,002
Fente.

230
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,461
Good.

231
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,548
I heard Ga-ram
is poking around the school.

232
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes, especially around the Fencing Team
and the Archery Team.

233
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,680
One bad apple can spoil the barrel.

234
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,640
Pay attention

235
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,185
so that other teams won't be carried away
by Ga-ram and his team.

236
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,979
Okay.

237
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,523
Vice Principal, may I say something?

238
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,817
-Yes.
-Okay.

239
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,156
The Rugby Team's budget isn't that small.

240
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,658
When the team disbands,

241
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,703
we can put the remaining budget
to good use.

242
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:22,541
The coaches who cooperate well
will have their contracts renewed--

243
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,710
-Coach Jeon.
-Yes.

244
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,379
We'll talk about that later.

245
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,505
Sure.

246
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,635
-Let's do this.
-Yes.

247
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,887
You are dismissed.

248
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,555
Thank you.

249
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,392
Shooting Team, please stay.

250
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,396
Please sit, Coach Bae.

251
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,540
It's a coaching contract.

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,294
I see that you had signed
a short-term contract every year.

253
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,130
When I become the principal next year,

254
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,382
I'd like to offer you
a three-year contract.

255
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,885
What do you say?

256
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,929
I'd appreciate that.

257
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,432
You do understand
that a coach's job includes

258
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,643
administrative tasks as well as teaching?

259
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,144
Yes, I do.

260
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,564
I plan to give you some tasks

261
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,982
such as…

262
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,821
keeping an eye on Coach Ju
and seeing what he's up to.

263
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,577
I heard you two have been close
for a long time.

264
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,040
Can you do it?

265
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:54,258
HANYANG HIGH
FIXED-TERM EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

266
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,918
-That's…
-Geez.

267
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,212
Where did it go?

268
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,052
My hopes were too high.

269
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,015
-A few days ago…
-It's his first time.

270
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,393
It's all right.

271
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,023
Let's find someone to teach him.

272
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,025
We just need someone
with archery experience.

273
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,818
It can be the guy next door
for all I care.

274
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,571
It could be your middle
or elementary school friends,

275
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,364
pull all the strings you have--

276
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,994
I…

277
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,495
know someone.

278
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,672
Sorry.

279
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,341
It was 9.7 at 11 o'clock.

280
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,426
You seem distracted,
so I'll check it myself.

281
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,478
It's 10.4. That was good.

282
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,402
COACH JEON NAK-GYUN

283
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,280
-Yes, Coach.
-Hey, I-ji.

284
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,491
Come pick me up. I'm drunk.

285
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,867
Right, it's…

286
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,745
the skewer place I'm always at.

287
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,663
Hurry.

288
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,668
Coach, U-jin is training right now,
so I can't leave the shooting range.

289
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,420
You are of no help to her.

290
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,839
You'd only distract her.
Hurry and come here.

291
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,431
The number you've dialed…

292
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,891
You can go.

293
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,436
I focus better alone.

294
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,940
Don't overdo it.

295
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,152
Wrap it up soon.

296
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,320
Okay.

297
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
What was that?

298
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,719
-Why'd you do that?
-Sorry.

299
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,346
But can you do it?

300
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,431
I have to try.

301
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,309
I'll persuade U-jin by any means.

302
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,310
Coach,

303
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,644
you stop Coach Bae.

304
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,233
Slowly!

305
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,183
Outsiders aren't allowed in.

306
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,357
What is it?

307
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,278
Just say it.
It's probably nonsense anyway.

308
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,488
Well…

309
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,241
Hello. I'm Mun Ung.

310
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,786
Nice to meet you.

311
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:56,917
What does the Rugby Team's rookie
want with the shooting captain?

312
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,962
Actually…

313
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,057
I quit archery four years ago,
and I don't remember a thing.

314
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,393
Even if I do, why do I have to help you?

315
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,896
Do you remember

316
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,607
that we sat together
on the first day of elementary school?

317
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,567
When you didn't bring your supplies,

318
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,904
I lent them to you, got scolded
by the teacher, and my mom--

319
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,531
That won't do it.

320
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,245
Would you please help me?

321
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,832
I really want to play rugby.

322
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:43,380
Well, you're definitely born
to be an athlete.

323
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,965
Right?

324
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,926
He's so talented and full of passion.

325
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,136
How can you not help?

326
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,348
As an athlete in a different sport,
you shouldn't do that.

327
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,225
I don't have enough time
for my own training.

328
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,147
I don't care about passion or talents
in other sports.

329
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,157
Seok-jun.

330
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,662
I'm going to tell people
you had a crush on him.

331
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,998
Will you stop the nonsense and go away?

332
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,099
Can't you help me just this once? Please.

333
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,602
I'll do anything. Okay?

334
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,812
I'll really do anything.

335
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,291
Just once after the training.

336
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,671
-Take it or leave it.
-Yes, that sounds good.

337
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,506
Right?

338
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,926
-Your answer?
-Yes.

339
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,981
Have you carefully read the contract
Mr. Seong gave you?

340
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,901
As a coaching contract,

341
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,154
three years is an amazing offer.
You should sign it.

342
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:36,826
You have to think carefully.

343
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,081
You can't be a player-coach
for a long time.

344
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,585
Are you listening?
I thought you were wearing earplugs.

345
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,882
Are you participating in the tournaments
in the second half again?

346
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,343
Yes, I am.

347
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,345
I-ji. You…

348
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,391
You really have to make a decision now.

349
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,768
This is your life, isn't it?

350
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,978
Let's be honest.

351
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,854
As a player,

352
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,359
you're beyond decline. You're done.

353
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,361
What? Why?

354
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,780
This son of a bitch
keeps blocking my path.

355
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,075
What? Who did you honk at?

356
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,536
Since it's late, it's hard to drive.

357
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,662
I'll focus now.

358
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,042
TTOBONGEE CHICKEN

359
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,836
I ended up like this

360
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,463
all because of Ga-ram.

361
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,923
I know.

362
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,218
If he hadn't caused a problem,
I wouldn't have given up on my tryout.

363
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,553
Of course.

364
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,431
Then I'd be in Team Korea
playing in the World Championship.

365
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,099
With my condition back then, a medal?

366
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,600
I could have won one easily.

367
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,645
-Definitely.
-Then he dares to show up again?

368
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,024
And put me in this shitty situation?

369
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,859
What?

370
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,862
That one's new. What happened?

371
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,448
I was offered a renewal contract,

372
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,992
already signed by the vice principal.

373
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,744
If I sign it, it's a done deal.

374
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,038
That's good news.

375
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,748
You were worried about next year.

376
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,958
Let's party. It's on me.

377
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,588
Bong-bong, let's have
the soy chicken feet with chilis.

378
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,673
Throw lots of chilis in.

379
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,759
Okay?

380
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,347
The problem is Ga-ram has to leave
for me to stay in the school.

381
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,100
What does Ga-ram leaving have to do

382
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,144
with your contract?

383
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,731
I don't know.

384
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,025
Ga-ram is making me

385
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,445
into someone who looks for
others' weaknesses just to attack them.

386
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,240
When an athlete finds others' weaknesses
and attacks them,

387
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,577
they're being smart, not nasty.

388
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,497
Geez. Ga-ram is no stranger, is he?

389
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,249
-Shut up, traitor.
-Traitor…

390
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,086
Are you happy to play rugby
by Ga-ram's side? Are you?

391
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,922
While we're at it, listen, I-ji.

392
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,009
Ga-ram might have an issue
he can't talk about.

393
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,761
Sometimes in life,

394
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,597
-an uncontrollable issue--
-Uncontrollable, my ass.

395
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,641
Everyone has their own issue,

396
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,102
but not everyone crosses the line.

397
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,645
But Ga-ram crossed it.

398
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,773
Where are the chilis?

399
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,818
Are you being thrifty?
Go and slice some more.

400
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,958
The sweat we shed

401
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,878
Fills up the Hangang River

402
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,842
The chant we shout together

403
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,178
Wakes up our passion

404
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,474
Raise your torch

405
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,937
Until the new day breaks

406
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,609
We run toward the golden sky

407
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,874
Was it always this bright?
It's always this bright.

408
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,042
Quiet. Do you want to get busted?

409
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,503
You stand over here.

410
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,932
Hold the grip with your left hand.
Spread your legs shoulder-width apart.

411
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,976
Place your feet parallel.

412
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,728
Place the bow on your foot.

413
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,732
Mission clear. We're at the archery range.
How is it going over there?

414
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,320
Use your three right fingers.
Straighten your hand.

415
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,909
You surprised me.

416
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,244
What do you think? It was awful.

417
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,250
Well done, though. Thanks to you…

418
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,252
Raise your arm. Lower your shoulder.

419
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,762
Now pull.

420
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,854
Why did U-jin change
from archery to shooting?

421
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,397
Well, it was because--

422
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,816
Because it left marks on my face.

423
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,985
-What?
-When you draw the bow,

424
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,654
it leaves marks on your lips and chin.

425
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,823
It might turn into wrinkles.

426
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,033
I don't like outdoor UV rays either.

427
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,620
How cool.

428
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,539
Yeah, right.

429
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,082
Straighten your right hand.

430
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,210
Lower your chin.
Push your left arm as if there's a wall.

431
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,920
Relax your fingers.

432
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,175
Lower your chin.

433
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,556
Level your elbow.

434
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,108
Straighten your body.

435
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,975
Geez. What's wrong with you?

436
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,560
Hold still.

437
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,230
Seriously. Come on!

438
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,190
-Come here.
-No, thank you.

439
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,692
-Give me a hug.
-No.

440
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,027
-Come.
-Geez.

441
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,153
Coach.

442
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,326
You're here.

443
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,161
What are you, kids?

444
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,414
-What is this?
-Our strategy.

445
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,939
Coach,

446
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,526
what do sprinklers at night
have to do with archery?

447
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,111
They'll make the arrows shake.

448
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,906
Creating variables.

449
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,158
Nice plan.

450
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,535
What variables?

451
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,789
The Archery Team trains to handle
environmental factors

452
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,791
such as wind or rain.

453
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,959
Shoot.

454
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,422
Relax your shoulders.

455
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,011
Hold them straight.

456
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,263
Does rain ever soar upward
from the ground?

457
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,934
Rain never soars upward from the ground.

458
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,646
If he can shoot calmly
when the water soars,

459
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,564
he'll be a step ahead of them.

460
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,818
The variable called water
will reduce the technical differences.

461
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:11,030
In that case,
it becomes a competition of physicality.

462
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,271
He got it.

463
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,400
He shot the target.

464
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,782
MOM

465
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,579
Hey, U-jin.

466
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,748
U-jin, please keep…

467
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,082
our secret.

468
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,919
SPECIAL ADMISSION TRYOUTS DAY

469
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,713
Okay. Good luck.

470
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,966
You can do it.

471
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,347
Hello.

472
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,769
I guess you're well prepared.

473
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,896
Well, yes.

474
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,357
Let's do this.

475
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,069
I wonder what your strategy is.

476
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,625
Rugby!

477
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,668
Let's go!

478
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,841
Break our defense.

479
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,176
Do you see the line over there?

480
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,929
Just touch the ball on the ground
past the line.

481
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,514
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

482
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,765
Don't be nervous.

483
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,724
-Okay?
-Okay.

484
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,935
-Good luck.
-Let's get started.

485
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,144
Let's do this.

486
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,525
-Okay. Let's do this.
-Let's go, Ung.

487
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,236
Go for it!

488
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,034
Didn't Seong-jun really fall
for the first feint?

489
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,202
Is he really a newbie?

490
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,882
ROUND 1
RUGBY: WIN

491
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,016
Il-hwan will make a quick dash
when he spots a chance.

492
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,269
Look at his feet. Increase the gap
to make him feel rushed.

493
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,937
That's when you strike, okay?

494
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,314
Okay.

495
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,901
He's ready.

496
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,706
You know the rules?

497
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,043
Three bouts, three minutes each.

498
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,962
The match is over
when one scores 15 points.

499
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,965
-You can attack the whole body.
-Okay.

500
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,096
-You have to win.
-Breathe.

501
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,681
-Let's play rugby!
-You can do it.

502
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,433
Good. You're doing good.

503
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,270
Salute. En garde.

504
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,774
Prets. Allez.

505
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,153
-He scored.
-Nice.

506
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,154
Halte!

507
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,576
-It's okay.
-It's just a point.

508
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,328
-It's all right.
-Go!

509
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,996
Take it slow. Relax.

510
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,417
It's all right.
Remember what you've practiced.

511
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,878
En garde.

512
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,755
Prets. Allez.

513
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,719
Push him. Close the distance.

514
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,389
-Go forward.
-Let's go forward.

515
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,562
It's all right.

516
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,149
Allez.

517
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,319
Thrust.

518
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,075
Press him.

519
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,131
Allez.

520
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,229
-What?
-What's he doing?

521
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,732
I understand. He's cute.

522
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,277
He's dragging by keeping a distance.
We only have a few seconds.

523
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,155
Boo! Hey, Il-hwan!
Don't you have pride as a fencer?

524
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,949
Hey, sit.

525
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,951
-What are you going to do about it?
-Boo!

526
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,994
Why do we have to sit?

527
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,163
He's cutting him some slack
because he's bad.

528
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,831
-So what?
-Hey.

529
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,691
Ung, it's okay.

530
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,526
-It's okay.
-You're doing good.

531
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,694
Good job.

532
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,071
It's okay. You're doing fine.

533
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:26,739
Here.

534
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,577
-I saw it.
-What?

535
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,414
His sword.

536
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,208
I can see it now.

537
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,840
I promise that I'll score
at least one point.

538
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,638
En garde.

539
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,139
Prets. Allez.

540
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,609
-He scored!
-Nice.

541
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,903
-Is he going to score?
-Can he?

542
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,154
How is this possible?

543
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,087
What?

544
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,046
What's going on?

545
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,631
The light didn't turn on.

546
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,268
What in the world?

547
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,942
ROUND 2
FENCING: LOSE

548
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,361
Please.

549
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,448
It's not like he won a gold medal.

550
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,412
-Good job.
-Ung, well done.

551
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,039
-You're so cool.
-You did awesome.

552
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,916
Hey. The game isn't over yet.

553
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,754
I'm sorry.

554
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,841
Don't be. You did a great job.

555
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,637
Strength and focus until the end,
without giving up.

556
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,681
That was great. Good job.

557
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,225
The real match begins now.

558
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,021
Just remember
what we trained yesterday, Ung.

559
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,481
Then you can surely win it.

560
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,401
Is he gifted or what?

561
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,153
He should do fencing, not rugby.

562
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,072
-He still lost, though.
-It's wild he scored against Il-hwan.

563
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,158
He's a National Sports Festival
silver medalist.

564
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,619
At this pace,
he might win the archery match.

565
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,454
-He actually might.
-Seriously.

566
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,374
FINAL ROUND

567
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,668
What now?

568
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,963
-I've created variables.
-What?

569
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,342
Archery is all about the variables,
isn't it?

570
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,972
I don't see the archery coach.

571
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:57,890
-What?
-I think?

572
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,725
The archers aren't here, either.

573
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,311
What? Why aren't they here?

574
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,652
Hold on.

575
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,365
Wait.

576
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,835
We'll cancel today's archery match.

577
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,509
Wait, why?

578
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,554
The whole team got food poisoning.

579
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,807
Oh, no.

580
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,519
We can't help but have another match.

581
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,273
Then we'll discuss
which sport he'll try out for first--

582
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,857
We can play by the rules.

583
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,446
Is there any team that wants a player?

584
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,614
We do.

585
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,866
We, the Shooting Team, will participate.

586
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,784
What?

587
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,955
We have the Shooting Team.

588
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,375
Is there any other team who wants him?

589
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,719
I guess not.

590
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,307
Then the shooting tryout will decide
his admission.

591
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,766
This is foul play.

592
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,060
How can he play such a technical sport
without training?

593
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,979
Will one hour be enough?

594
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,898
-Vice Principal.
-We can't help it.

595
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,650
That's the rule.

596
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,487
We can't wait
until the whole Archery Team recovers.

597
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,574
Or…

598
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,702
will you…

599
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,788
just withdraw?

600
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,771
Hey, U-jin.

601
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,072
-Was it you?
-What?

602
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,324
Did you tell them?

603
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,701
U-jin.

604
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,786
THREE HOURS AGO

605
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,912
Yes?

606
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,455
There will be a tryout later.

607
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,581
You do it.

608
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,999
-A tryout?
-Yes.

609
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,086
You know, the special admission
for the new kid Ga-ram brought in.

610
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,214
Wasn't it decided as fencing and archery?

611
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,801
No need to worry about the details.
Show us your best.

612
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,886
What are you going to do about it?

613
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,184
-I'm competing against him too.
-What?

614
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,021
Please lose, just this once.

615
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,692
Why should I?

616
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,070
Could you just help us?

617
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,906
Winning won't do you any good.

618
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,408
Why not?

619
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,412
They'll upgrade our whole facility
once your team is gone.

620
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,873
You're so mean.

621
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,670
-Why do you have to be so selfish?
-What are you, a child?

622
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,592
Stop whining.

623
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,056
I want to play rugby.

624
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,771
Let me live my life
as rugby player, Yoon Seong-jun,

625
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,943
not just as soccer player
Yoon Seok-jun's twin brother.

626
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,078
I wouldn't have time for this
if I were you.

627
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,164
-Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
-What?

628
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,875
Aren't you ashamed
to pull such a cheap trick

629
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,251
on the students?

630
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,627
Ga-ram.

631
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,628
Watch your mouth.

632
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,631
Why do I need to be ashamed?

633
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,927
I'm doing what needs to be done
for the school.

634
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,930
And is that discouraging
high school students' dreams?

635
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,683
Those dreams aren't free.

636
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,935
We have a limited budget.

637
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:17,441
We aren't well-off enough
to support dreams that have no potential.

638
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,194
The result is obvious.

639
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,406
Why do you eat
when you'll poop it out anyway?

640
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,577
Why do you want to be a principal
when you'll retire anyway?

641
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,954
Are you kidding me?

642
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,873
Everyone lives knowing that they'll die.

643
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,000
Every player plays,
knowing the game will end.

644
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,877
But only the ones

645
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,171
who play until the end
know the result of the game.

646
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:44,968
Our job as adults is to give these kids
a chance to play until the end.

647
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,638
It's not to push them out of the stadium

648
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,350
while talking about their potential before
the starting whistle has even blown.

649
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,560
Your team's match is already over.

650
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,271
The results are out.

651
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,528
You lost already.

652
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,780
No.

653
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,491
It hasn't even begun yet.

654
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,576
You'll see.

655
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:14,164
I'll show you that potential.

656
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,668
Sure. Good luck.

657
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,461
To do so,

658
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,589
you'll have to pass
the shooting tryout first.

659
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,856
Okay, breathe in and raise the gun.

660
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,733
Good. Put it down.

661
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,152
Try it again.

662
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,905
Breathing is crucial.

663
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,450
Hold it up while breathing in.

664
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,452
Aim.

665
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:53,829
Coach.

666
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,999
I'm sorry.

667
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,171
I think U-jin told them
about our archery strategy.

668
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,720
That must be why the vice principal
changed the tryout event.

669
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,603
It's my fault.

670
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,357
I don't think that's the case, Seong-jun.

671
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,775
Come here.

672
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,943
Gather around.

673
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,903
Okay.

674
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,530
Let's huddle.

675
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,080
Rugby Team, smile.

676
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,417
Come on. Smile.

677
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:45,255
The Rugby Team will be fine.

678
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,590
Because…

679
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,551
you've got me, Ju Ga-ram.

680
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,219
Don't give up.

681
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,306
We will definitely win.

682
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,476
Let's chant.

683
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,810
Hanyang!

684
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,480
Louder!

685
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,066
Hanyang!

686
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,360
Hanyang!

687
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,945
Hanyang!

688
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,989
Hanyang!

689
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,160
Hey, Dad!

690
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,370
You're here.

691
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,039
-You're here, sir.
-Dad!

692
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,582
Hello.

693
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,834
Scooch over and make some room.

694
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,466
How did you make the time to come?

695
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,970
I heard the tryout has changed
from archery to shooting.

696
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,766
Was this your plan all along?

697
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,267
-Yes.
-Geez.

698
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,937
You're so meticulous.

699
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,526
But it's not Seol-hyeon who's playing.

700
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,113
It was too minuscule for her
to participate in a match like this,

701
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,489
so I had U-jin do it.

702
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,622
It must be time.

703
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,685
Let's go.

704
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,947
Good luck.

705
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,991
Ung.

706
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,826
Ung.

707
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,121
It's okay to lose. Okay?

708
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,789
It's okay to lose.

709
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,170
Regardless of the outcome,
I will find a way.

710
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,047
Just do your best. Got it?

711
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,014
-Go, Ung!
-Let's go!

712
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,683
-You can do it.
-You've got this.

713
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,268
You can do it.

714
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,061
Gosh. They are loud.

715
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,146
Ga-ram.

716
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,067
Have you got a plan?

717
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,570
I'm looking for a way

718
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,782
to get him into another school
and transfer him back here.

719
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,617
I'll find a way no matter what.

720
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,952
I'll never give up, Ms. Kang.

721
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,332
Okay, silence.

722
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,838
-Go.
-We will begin the shooting tryout,

723
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,925
Round Three
of the special admission tryout.

724
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,803
Mun Ung, begin shooting.

725
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,371
-I knew it.
-He can't do it.

726
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,081
No. It's only the first shot.

727
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,374
It's basically zero points.

728
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,500
He did hit the target.

729
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,963
No, you never know.

730
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,226
TOTAL: 3 POINTS

731
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,148
-I told you.
-It's over.

732
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,900
It's over.

733
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,070
You're doing great.

734
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,154
Go, Ung!

735
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,490
It's not over yet.

736
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,129
TOTAL: 5 POINTS

737
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,025
TOTAL: 7 POINTS

738
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,320
-It's over.
-It's over.

739
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,323
She can outscore him by one shot.

740
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,202
The Rugby Team is certain to be disbanded.

741
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,247
I'll push ahead
with the reorganization plan right away,

742
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,665
as I mentioned before.

743
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,875
Good.

744
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,670
I trust you to win 30 golds
in the National Sports Festival.

745
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,006
Yes.

746
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,010
-Good job.
-Well done.

747
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,887
-You did well.
-Good job.

748
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,848
You did great.

749
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,516
Okay? Well done.

750
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,609
Seo U-jin.

751
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,902
Begin shooting.

752
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,531
Focus and shoot precisely, U-jin.

753
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,867
Do you know what I mean?

754
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,620
Will you answer…

755
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,997
Geez. You surprised me. What?

756
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,458
-What?
-What?

757
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,001
What's going on?

758
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,173
What's going on?

759
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,469
TOTAL: 0 POINTS

760
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:29,808
Is she doing it on purpose?

761
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,073
TOTAL: 0 POINTS

762
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,619
Hey, Ung.

763
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,038
Congratulations on your admission.

764
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,710
-He won.
-He won.

765
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,253
-He won.
-He won.

766
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,009
ROUND 3
SHOOTING: WIN

767
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,084
U-jin.

768
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,719
Why did you do that?

769
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,720
What about you?

770
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,931
-Why did you say it was okay to lose?
-What?

771
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:53,850
Well.

772
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,186
Because it's okay to lose.

773
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,396
It's never okay for any athlete to lose.

774
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,483
Then why did you lose?

775
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,239
You tell me.

776
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,576
Because I don't know why at the moment.

777
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:17,916
Hey, it's U-jin.

778
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,085
-There's U-jin.
-I see her.

779
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,921
Is she running away?

780
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,798
Where are you going?

781
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,676
Where are you going?

782
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,931
I did everything

783
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,767
trusting your words, Mr. Seong.

784
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,686
What is this?

785
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,897
My apologies.

786
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,482
I'll find a way--

787
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,317
Forget it.

788
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,322
There's a lot of talk at the office
about the change in the admission process.

789
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,867
Suppose the Rugby Team doesn't achieve
good results again this year.

790
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,328
In that case, it won't have
enough players next year,

791
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,080
which will automatically disband it.

792
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,582
Let's think about a soft landing.

793
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:07,298
If the Rugby Team somehow wins
at this National Sports Festival--

794
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:11,636
That's why you have to try harder,
so something like this won't happen again.

795
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,391
Bye.

796
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,726
Until next time.

797
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,314
What happened?

798
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,608
I'm not sure.

799
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,236
This is driving me crazy. Darn it.

800
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,238
By the looks of it,

801
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,991
you two don't know what exactly happened.

802
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,743
I'll look into why U-jin did it
right away.

803
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,204
U-jin caused this mess.

804
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,998
But Ga-ram must be the reason.

805
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,088
Right, Coach Bae.

806
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,673
Yes.

807
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,259
I'll call off the contract deal.

808
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,387
I can't leave my athletes to a coach

809
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,639
who can't even fulfill a task
like this, can I?

810
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,476
I got it.

811
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,062
Are you going to leave without eating?

812
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,405
Fills up the Hangang River

813
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:18,119
The chant we shout together
Wakes up our passion

814
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:26,544
Raise your torch
Until the new day breaks

815
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,340
We run toward the golden sky

816
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,968
Hanyang Physical Education High School

817
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:41,017
The sweat we shed
Fills up the Hangang River

818
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:46,731
The chant we shout together
Wakes up our passion

819
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,030
Until the new day breaks

820
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,378
NURSE'S OFFICE

821
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,134
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

822
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,062
Ga-ram.

823
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:53,191
THE WINNING TRY

824
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,343
THE WINNING TRY

825
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,136
Rugby Team, let's practice.

826
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,222
The Track and Field Team
has the field all day.

827
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,640
We need a proper field.

828
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,058
I thought we were training.

829
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,476
This is training too.

830
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,311
Run as fast as you can!

831
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,355
When you play by relying on each other,

832
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,524
it creates synergy.

833
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,192
Synergy.

834
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,652
We have a practice match.

835
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,028
-It's against…
-A pro team?

836
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,533
-Say that again.
-I can't let you guys ruin my life.

837
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,702
I have to give it my all in this tryout.

838
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,537
This is my last chance.

839
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,164
A disease doesn't discriminate.

840
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,999
Even a slight delay can be fatal.

841
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,632
