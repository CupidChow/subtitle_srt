1
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,910
 Ms. Ma is Ms. Ma. 

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 What reason would I need for that? 

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,700
 Because you feel guilty? 

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,940
 But why would I? 

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,050
 Because the murderer you 
saw isn't that woman? 

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,350
 Is that why you're protecting her? 

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,900
 

8
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,740
11:35 p.m.

9
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,240
You must rush from the Seoul National 
Cemetery to arrive here by then.

10
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,660
An average 10-year-old girl 
weighs about 30 kg.

11
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,000
That's Jang Min Seo.

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,810
We'll check how long it takes 
to get to the scene.

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,670
Which scene?

14
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,130
Chief!

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,860
12:05.

16
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,140
It was midnight when I 
found that woman here.

17
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,700
How did she...

18
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,870
How did she arrive earlier than me?

19
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,700
Maybe there was a different route?

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,180
Our route was the fastest one.

21
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,560
Well, then...

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,100
What are you trying to say?

23
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,400
Perhaps that woman...

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
came by herself?

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,300
Did Jang Min Seo fly here then?

26
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,030
Chief?

27
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,300
Hey, let's check again

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,720
- on our way back.
- Again?

29
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,810
We can't leave this 
precious rice behind.

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,840
What the heck are they doing?

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,900
Who cares?

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,220
They have the energy 
to carry a light post or a bull.

33
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,250
It's none of our business.

34
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,670
My back's about to give out.

35
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,760
What time is it?

36
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,890
12:10.

37
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,220
Maybe she was alive 
until she got here.

38
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,480
They could've walked 
together holding hands.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Sleeping pills were
 found in her body.

40
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,890
So that's impossible.

41
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,900
There's only one conclusion then.

42
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,840
She's a crazy b****, right?

43
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Maybe her energy spiked suddenly.

44
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,860
How can a woman wearing heels in the 
middle of the night be faster than us?

45
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,300
Then how would you explain her 
fingerprints found in the car?

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,490
They found the kid's fingerprints 
and blood in the car.

47
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,680
And that crazy b****'s fingerprints 
were on the steering wheel, too.

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,600
Thank you.

49
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,920
Been a while since I was here last.

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,330
It's all thanks to you, Chief.

51
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,510
Have you worked in this 
neighborhood before?

52
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,480
I was a policeman here.

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,770
When you were trailing that crazy b****,

54
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,180
we were scrambling due to that
 voice phishing suspect.

55
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,130
- Voice phishing?
- Yes.

56
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,090
He took money from all the banks and 
convenient stores around here.

57
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,120
We had a hard time because 
he wore a mask and a hat.

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,610
But...

59
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,990
he turned out to be a 20-year-old kid.

60
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,750
I couldn't believe it.

61
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,950
Did you look into Lee Jung Hee?

62
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,310
Oh, her?

63
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,650
Strange things are 
happening around her.

64
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,190
Lee Jung Hee's assistant director 
got poisoned yesterday.

65
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,160
This amazing shaman I know

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,660
put special energies into these.

67
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,420
Yes, Unni.

68
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,110
Seriously.

69
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,580
So many people died recently.

70
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,850
I thought wearing these 
would make me feel safer.

71
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,000
So I tagged along with
 Ms. Yang yesterday.

72
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,590
See the small letters 
on the beads, right?

73
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,310
This was our special request.

74
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,540
"Pa Sal Gui."

75
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,520
It literally means 
"destroy the murderous spirit."

76
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,610
What are you doing?

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,450
Ms. Ma, you should wear one, too.

78
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,790
Me?

79
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,890
We have to put it on her like this.

80
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,900
The man who's trying 
to harm Jung Hee.

81
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,360
Please catch him and 
destroy the murderous spirit.

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,200
That's why we're giving
 it to you. Wear it.

83
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,050
I don't want Jung Hee 
to get hurt either.

84
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,900
There's something I need 
to hear from her.

85
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,650
- I'll still work hard without this, so...
- Well...

86
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,020
Why? Because of your research?

87
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,300
That too.

88
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,480
I get it. But just wear it.

89
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,250
There's no harm in 
wearing these together.

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,500
And...

91
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,020
you said you can't keep ignoring it.

92
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,840
 What did you just say? 

93
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,100
You mean Park Myung Hee knew
 who put the sedative in

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Jung Hee's glass?

95
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,890
Yes.

96
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,480
But you couldn't figure 
out the culprit?

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,550
When the eyewitness was 
right in front of you?

98
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,060
I told you to

99
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,850
to report to me if you
 find any evidence.

100
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,860
But you did nothing even
 after being told that

101
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,600
she knew who the culprit was?

102
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Do you not know my phone number?

103
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,090
I do.

104
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,310
Then you should've called me! Geez!

105
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,920
Do you use your fingers only 
for knitting or something?

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,390
You don't have to dial or anything.

107
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,340
You can call me with one push.

108
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,520
- Chief.
- What?

109
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,580
- Can you get me some water?
- What?

110
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,320
- I'm asking for some water.
- Ms. Ma!

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,780
You don't want to?

112
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,230
Cool off a bit.

113
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,490
This won't fix anything.

114
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
I didn't betray my...

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
country in my former life.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,100
I just want to be a 
neighborhood assemblyman.

117
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,890
But how come all 
my connection "ropes"

118
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,730
keep rotting away?

119
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,660
What are you trying to say?

120
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,200
Choi Man Shik.

121
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,230
I trusted him and clung onto 
him, but the rope rotted.

122
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,160
Then I clung onto the nation's director, 
but that rope rotted too.

123
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,950
Director Seong?

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,900
No. No. No way.

125
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,470
There's no way our nation's 
director killed someone.

126
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,570
Right?

127
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,820
What are you talking about?

128
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,500
Park Myung Hee talked to 
Director Seong right before she died.

129
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,700
He's not the culprit because of that.

130
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,940
Right?

131
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,370
Potassium cyanide was found

132
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,000
inside the asthma inhaler.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,360
She was poisoned.

134
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,330
So around 11 a.m. yesterday,

135
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,820
you got a call from Park Myung Hee.

136
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,420
- Is that right?
- Yes.

137
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,190
Do you remember what 
she said by any chance?

138
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,690
Yes, Producer Park.

139
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,400
 Why are you doing this to me? 

140
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,460
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,960
 Why... 

142
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,020
Producer Park.

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,010
Producer Park.

144
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,420
Myung Hee.

145
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,570
What's going on?

146
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,170
I think she said something,

147
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,650
but I couldn't understand her.

148
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,720
- Not at all?
- No.

149
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
You couldn't hear her at all?

150
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,400
And someone saw Director Seong

151
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,480
going into the conference room 
where Park Myung Hee was.

152
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,100
- Who saw that?
 - Choi Joong Cheol.

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,300
The guy who filmed the illegal video.

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,430
Is this such a big deal?

155
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,140
We'll decide that.

156
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,800
- But are you sure?
- Yes.

157
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,960
I saw Director Seong going in

158
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,940
10 minutes before 
Producer Park went in.

159
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,830
Didn't you go to Ms. Jung's 
studio yesterday?

160
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,460
For the photoshoots?

161
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,760
It was postponed to
 the day after... No.

162
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,280
It was postponed to 
tomorrow. So I came back.

163
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,770
So...

164
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,920
You went to the conference room  
before Park Myung Hee died, right?

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,710
I went there to ask 
about the set model.

166
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,470
Why didn't you just call her?

167
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,520
I was nearby there.

168
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,720
I came back because the set model
 was moved to CEO Koo's room.

169
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,990
Do you recognize this by chance?

170
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,500
It's Myung Hee's bag.

171
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,120
What about this?

172
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,940
You recognize it, right?

173
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,680
The poison was found on this.

174
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,560
It was the instrument of crime.

175
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,010
What are you trying to say?

176
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,160
You were at the place where the

177
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,100
instrument of crime was found.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,600
- And you were alone.
- Are you suspecting me now?

179
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,500
Director Seong, calm down...

180
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
How can I calm down?

181
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,400
Myung Hee worked with me for over
 10 years. Why would I do such a thing?

182
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes, yes, I understand.

183
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
We're good for today.

184
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,400
I'll call you again soon...

185
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
Director Seong Jae Deok.

186
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,800
Why...

187
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,300
did you lie?

188
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,100
Do you think I'm stupid?

189
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,640
I overheard Myung Hee 
on your phone.

190
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,270
She was crying and said...

191
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,400
"You can't do this to me."

192
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,910
Did you do this...

193
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,240
to Myung Hee?

194
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,310
Are you crazy?

195
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,040
Why would I kill Myung Hee?

196
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,200
Why did you lie then?

197
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,520
 Director Seong didn't
 kill Myung Hee. 

198
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,480
That's my wishful thinking, too.

199
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,200
By any chance...

200
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,600
does Director Seong know that 
Myung Hee lied about seeing

201
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,390
An Sung Tae on the set?

202
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,130
That was a lie?

203
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,810
Anyhow, does Director Seong know?

204
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,570
Yes, I told him.

205
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,050
What about An Sung Tae 
making a threat call?

206
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,920
I told him.

207
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,940
He told me to update him 
about the investigation.

208
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,390
So Director Seong knows that 
An Sung Tae's being

209
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,490
framed for the crime, right?

210
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,340
Why does that matter right now?

211
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,570
Think about it.

212
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,850
Director Seong didn't 
poison the wine glass.

213
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,330
In other words,

214
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,250
Director Seong is not the killer.

215
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,240
So he has no reason to kill

216
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,500
Myung Hee, who's the witness.

217
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,700
- No.
- But let's say he did poison the glass.

218
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,210
But Myung Hee said that

219
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,300
"It wasn't Director, 
but it was An Sung Tae."

220
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
That's what she said.

221
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,700
Then he has even fewer
 reasons to kill her.

222
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,760
That's true.

223
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,150
But why did she call Director 
Seong before she died?

224
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,250
Perhaps to bid farewell
 before she died?

225
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,380
She might have.

226
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,190
Myung Hee was in 
love with Director Seong.

227
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,180
Now what are you talking about?

228
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,000
Or she mistakenly thought that...

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,750
Director Seong did that to her.

230
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,370
She must've felt wronged.

231
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,750
She lied and made threat calls

232
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,580
for someone she loves.

233
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,700
She lied for someone...

234
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,160
whom she loves?

235
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,100
Why?

236
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,570
Did something come to you again?

237
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,900
Myung Hee said that...

238
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,770
she lied because she 
wanted to protect someone.

239
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,240
Then perhaps Director Seong
 is lying to protect...

240
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,560
someone as well?

241
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,640
What the heck are you talking about?

242
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,250
Seriously.

243
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,080
 

244
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,470
Please return it by next Monday.

245
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,340
Park Myung Hee knows the
 killer's identity, but lied.

246
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,120
Framing it on An Sung Tae?

247
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,760
That's what Director Seong wanted.

248
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,680
If he wanted to frame someone, 
then he must be the culprit.

249
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,700
It doesn't make sense that 
he'd hurt Jung Hee.

250
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,600
Haven't we already seen 
a husband killing his wife?

251
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,340
Director Seong...

252
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,630
really loves his wife.

253
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,000
Marrying twice won't prove that,

254
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,710
but he chose Jung Hee 
as the lead in his film

255
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,160
to help relaunch her career.

256
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,680
He even threatened me 
in order to protect his wife.

257
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,450
He wouldn't put a sedative 
in her glass,

258
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,090
nor poison her coffee.

259
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,830
If he wasn't the killer,

260
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,250
why does he want to 
frame someone?

261
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,260
Because he knows who the killer is.

262
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,490
He should call the police then. 
His wife is in danger.

263
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,150
He knows who the killer is,

264
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,000
but he couldn't call the police.

265
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,740
What do you mean?

266
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,790
In order to protect 
someone he loves,

267
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,130
he had to lie.

268
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,950
His loved one?

269
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,150
There's only one person...

270
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,140
whom Director Seong loves.

271
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,880
- Where's Jung Hee?
- She's inside.

272
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,490
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,760
Are you suspecting that
 I did that to Myung Hee?

274
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,410
Please don't lie anymore, Honey.

275
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,240
I understand you're 
upset about Myung Hee.

276
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,030
Of course you are.

277
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,990
You couldn't have been together 
for 10 years for work only.

278
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,740
Myung Hee was in love with you.

279
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,910
Did you think I didn't 
know about that?

280
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,750
Honey.

281
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,590
I think what happened 
to Myung Hee...

282
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,870
was what she deserved.

283
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,210
 

284
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,690
Myung Hee sent that?

285
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,470
Who else could it be?

286
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,010
You got her ridiculous threat call, too.

287
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,080
What did she say?

288
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,000
"I'm not the killer. 
The killer is among you."

289
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,930
Honey.

290
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,520
It took me almost 
10 years to get here.

291
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,190
You know better than...

292
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,800
anyone how I spent those long years.

293
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,570
It's all over now. So don't worry.

294
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,500
No one can harass us 
anymore, Jae Deok.

295
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,700
Let's leave.

296
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,120
You and I.

297
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,940
Let's forget everything and leave.

298
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,680
But...

299
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,490
what about the film?

300
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,050
You're more important than any film.

301
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,670
Then don't give it up.

302
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,450
Only films define who 
I am as Lee Jung Hee.

303
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,440
I don't want to see you get hurt.

304
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,790
- Jae Deok.
- I'm afraid.

305
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,580
I'm afraid something
 might happen to you.

306
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,510
You can protect me.

307
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,080
You will, right?

308
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,890
Please, Jae Deok.

309
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,110
Please promise that you will.

310
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,940
Jae Deok.

311
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,050
Okay.

312
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,790
I'll protect you.

313
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,810
So no one could ever touch you.

314
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,250
I'll protect you...

315
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,530
no matter what it takes.

316
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,340
Mal Koo, I have a favor to ask.

317
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,340
Please watch over my Jung Hee.

318
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,420
Yes, I will.

319
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,730
What I mean is...

320
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,700
Please watch her

321
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,920
so she won't do anything anymore.

322
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,490
Do you understand?

323
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,630
Did you hear anything 
about Sun Doo?

324
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,590
You mean your son?

325
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,560
Did he contact you 
by any chance?

326
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,470
Maybe asking for money, or...

327
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,930
No, CEO.

328
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
- Is that so?
 - Yes.

329
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,250
That writer lady...

330
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,340
You mean Ms. Ma?

331
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,560
Yes.

332
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,490
I'd like to see Ms. Ma sometime.

333
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,090
Okay, CEO.

334
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,030
"It's okay, it's okay."

335
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,890
'Have you ever comforted someone?'

336
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,000
Potassium cyanide 
on the asthma inhaler.

337
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It must've been painful.

338
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,980
But it probably didn't last long.

339
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,250
She made a call before she died?

340
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,200
To Director Seong Jae Deok.

341
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,430
What did they talk about?

342
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,290
I'm not sure.

343
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,040
Yes, Seong Jae Deok 
is a prime suspect.

344
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,500
But it's difficult to investigate 
due to his status.

345
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Any other suspects?

346
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,360
They're searching, but...

347
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,970
they don't have anyone in particular.

348
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Why don't you...

349
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,620
The people who're 
involved in the film.

350
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,930
It's not our jurisdiction.
 Why should I?

351
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,820
To speculate or something?

352
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,510
I'm curious to know what kind of 
novel Ms. Ma is writing.

353
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,870
- Well, I...
- There.

354
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,750
- Okay? Hurry.
- What are you talking about?

355
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,870
Hurry up, okay?
 Thanks in advance!

356
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,890
Yes, this is Han Tae Kyu.

357
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,610
Yes, sounds good.

358
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,750
Aigoo, sorry for calling you so late.

359
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,150
It's okay.

360
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,300
I think I owe you an apology.

361
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,410
I'm sorry about what happened 
in Rainbow Village.

362
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,160
There was an 
important business deal

363
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,280
and the buyer suddenly 
changed his mind.

364
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm sure you didn't call me 
to talk about that.

365
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,950
Well, no.

366
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,300
Did you by any chance...

367
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,630
meet Lee Jung Hee then?

368
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,760
Briefly.

369
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,540
What did she say?

370
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,480
She said she doesn't
 know anything.

371
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,040
But it seemed like
 she was hiding something.

372
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,690
I see.

373
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,110
Actually...

374
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,940
I called their production 
company today.

375
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,350
They said they'd let me 
meet with Lee Jung Hee.

376
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,520
But without giving a reason,

377
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,440
they said we won't be 
meeting for a while.

378
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,660
It's probably because her 
life is being threatened.

379
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,080
Her life is being threatened?

380
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,460
- Who?
- Lee Jung Hee.

381
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,110
Lee Jung Hee's life is 
being threatened?

382
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,230
Director.

383
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,370
We're almost ready 
to start shooting.

384
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,230
- Okay. Tell them I'll be there soon.
- Yes, Director.

385
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,210
Did you call Jung Hee 
by any chance?

386
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,090
Is she in today's shoot?

387
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,500
Later today. Should I call her?

388
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,960
- Yes.
- Okay.

389
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,610
Would you be able to shoot?

390
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,880
What else can I do right now?

391
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,940
You...

392
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,830
haven't told me yet.

393
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,510
Why Myung Hee...

394
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,330
would say something like that.

395
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,470
Do you know why?

396
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,980
Because you can't 
handle the truth.

397
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,860
I'll be there soon. 
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

398
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,210
 

399
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,660
Stay in the car for a second.

400
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,390
Geez, you scared me.

401
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,960
I mean...

402
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,800
We came to just spook her a bit.

403
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,100
- Who sent you?
- Well, that's...

404
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,540
We heard the actress is in debt.

405
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,000
So...

406
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,220
Are they your henchmen?

407
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,360
No. We don't have henchmen...

408
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,030
 

409
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,150
Ko Mal Koo!

410
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,760
Ko Mal Koo!

411
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,060
Mal Koo!

412
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,390
Mal Koo! Oh, no!

413
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,570
This is how you smash
 a head, you punk!

414
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,510
You want to see what?

415
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,820
The video of Jung Hee's 
housewarming party.

416
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,830
Could I please see it?

417
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,920
Why?

418
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,410
I'll tell you after I see it.

419
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,470
You know who the
 killer is, don't you?

420
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,380
The face you made yesterday.

421
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,290
You're making the same face.

422
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,910
I'm just speculating.

423
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Tell me. Who is it?

424
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,570
If I tell you...

425
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,510
you'll be angry because 
I had no evidence.

426
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,850
What are you talking about?

427
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,620
Come on. Who is it?
