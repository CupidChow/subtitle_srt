1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,530
Hello?

2
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,520
 By 12:00. 

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,880
How do I believe you?

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,990
How do I believe you'll return Min Seo 
if I give you the money?

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,210
 Come to Yongam Reservoir at 12:00. 

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,440
You'll...

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,510
get the money if you 
return Min Seo safely.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,910
You know what I mean, right?

9
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,780
Geez, seriously.

10
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,660
 - Director. 
- Yes, it's nothing.

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,810
I'll be there soon. Just wait a bit.

12
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,870
 

13
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,930
 

14
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,380
Who's the person...

15
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,650
I need to meet?

16
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,840
You'll see. Follow me.

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,910
Excuse me!

18
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,270
Director wants to see you now.

19
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,800
We'll be down soon.

20
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,270
- Let's...
- No.

21
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,390
Not you.

22
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,210
I meant you, CEO.

23
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,570
Come with me, CEO.

24
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,640
Otherwise, you'd have to wait long 
since there's a lot of guests.

25
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,870
Are you okay?

26
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,320
CEO.

27
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,340
CEO!

28
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,160
What happened?

29
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,200
CEO.

30
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,700
CEO Jang.

31
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,870
I'm sorry, I have an 
emergency at work.

32
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,330
- An emergency?
- Yes.

33
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,660
I think I need to go there.

34
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,820
It's a chance to prove your wife's innocence. 
What's more urgent than that?

35
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,300
CEO Jang?

36
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,450
CEO Koo.

37
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,800
I heard you came but was worried 
when I didn't see you.

38
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,100
Let's go.

39
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,940
The nation's director is
 eager to see you.

40
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,650
Please wait a moment.

41
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,910
The weather's nice, too.
 Thank you.

42
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,680
Thank you for coming 
all the way here.

43
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,070
No, I'm thankful for a 
chance to invest in your film.

44
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,890
Don't mention it.

45
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,720
Where's Jung Hee? 
He really wants to meet her.

46
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,290
Well...

47
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,190
Excuse me for a second.

48
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,030
CEO Hong from Dae Jong is here.

49
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,370
Excuse me for a second.

50
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,020
Would you like more beverages?

51
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,490
It looks like a nail tip.

52
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,160
Is it yours by any chance?

53
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,910
No, I don't use these.

54
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,090
Thank you.

55
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,440
Are you okay?

56
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,260
Of course.

57
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,710
I have someone to introduce to you.

58
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,500
Who is it?

59
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,130
Over there.

60
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,800
At a production company...

61
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,500
Honey.

62
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,940
Who is...

63
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,410
that person?

64
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,820
He's an investor. Why?

65
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,640
Not the man, but...

66
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,420
the woman in front of him.

67
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,220
I'm scared, Jae Deok.

68
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,310
What's wrong? Tell me.

69
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,120
I saw them.

70
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,930
That day...

71
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,580
That day...

72
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,580
After I hung up with you...

73
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
I saw the murderer...

74
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,130
and the child.

75
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,420
My, you're from Daejeon too?

76
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,090
And you're as well, Miss?

77
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,950
I'm Seo Eun Ji.

78
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,460
Eun Ji, you're also from Daejeon?

79
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,150
Yes, I'm from Eoeundong.

80
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,900
Apparently, there was a lot of 
fish there a long time ago.

81
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,440
Do you work at this 
production company?

82
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,890
No, I'm just a part-timer.

83
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,600
Then what brings you here?

84
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,300
To find my younger sibling.

85
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,040
I assume something happened 
to your younger sister?

86
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
Wow, you're impressive.

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,650
How did you know my 
sibling's a female?

88
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,830
I thought a pretty sister suits 
 a beautiful girl like you.

89
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,810
- Did I guess correctly?
- Yes, you did.

90
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,400
Her name is Soo Ji.

91
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,530
She's my pretty younger sister.

92
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,240
Soo Ji?

93
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,170
Isn't it pretty?

94
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,190
My sister was wearing 
the same hairpin.

95
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,600
I think it belongs to Ms. Ma.

96
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,870
Did you see her leave?

97
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,170
Yes, she just left.

98
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,500
Man, s***.

99
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,880
CEO!

100
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,400
I was waiting on you.

101
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you forget I had an emergency?

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,300
I just need a second. 
If you can spare a moment...

103
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,970
I agreed to meet 
Lee Jung Hee next time.

104
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,320
Please move aside.

105
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,510
- You want to see Jung Hee?
- Yes.

106
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,890
CEO Jang wanted to 
relay a message to her.

107
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,430
- Where's CEO Jang then...
- He left due to an emergency.

108
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,050
I see. Follow me.

109
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,070
 Why didn't you tell me then? 

110
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,190
A child got kidnapped and murdered.

111
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,890
You saw the murderer and 
didn't say anything?

112
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,050
Does that make sense?

113
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,750
I didn't know.

114
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,440
I didn't know what I'd seen.

115
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,860
Were you this kind of person?

116
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,670
Jae Deok!

117
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,920
Were you someone 
who lies so easily?

118
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,620
Don't talk to me like that.

119
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,480
I wanted to protect 
you and our baby.

120
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,810
How could you say that?

121
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,290
Jae Deok, believe me.

122
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,540
Trust you?

123
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,720
Did you forget already?

124
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,740
Not only did you abandon me,

125
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,790
but our baby, too.

126
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,990
You wanted to protect us?

127
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,610
What you wanted to protect was...

128
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,100
only yourself.

129
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,340
No, no. Jae Deok.

130
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,580
An associate of an investor?

131
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,550
Yes.

132
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,150
He has something to tell Jung Hee. 
Let him in and...

133
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,940
Thanks in advance.

134
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,580
Okay.

135
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,230
Lee Jung Hee!

136
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,930
Are you okay?

137
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,090
Yes.

138
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,200
You need to be out there.

139
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
The investors are still arriving.

140
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,350
Let me rest for a bit.

141
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,580
I'm exhausted, Myung Hee.

142
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,750
You've been forging 
ahead for so long.

143
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,480
How about taking a 
break from this film?

144
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,610
It'll be difficult to film...

145
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,750
with Jung Hee like this.

146
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,550
What's wrong with Jung Hee?

147
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,340
You know very well...

148
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,080
what Jung Hee's done.

149
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,060
What are you talking about?

150
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,490
- Ms. Park, we...
- Myung Hee, watch your mouth.

151
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,730
Jung Hee's my wife. 
My only wife in the world.

152
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,180
I won't forgive you if 
you say anything stupid.

153
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,580
Got it?

154
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,660
Of course.

155
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,610
How would I not know what 
happened in front of my house?

156
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,930
Then I don't need to explain 
why I wanted to see you.

157
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,070
What do you mean?

158
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,670
The murder from nine years ago.

159
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,500
Did you witness the murderer?

160
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,710
I know you were there at the time.

161
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,330
You're right.

162
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,260
I was there for a shoot.

163
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,560
But I learned of such a 
horrific incident later on.

164
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,630
So you didn't see anything?

165
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,790
No.

166
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,950
It's so strange.

167
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,000
Why does everyone think 
I saw the murderer?

168
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,490
By everyone, you mean...

169
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,890
Ms. Ma.

170
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,920
You know her, right?

171
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,670
You mistook her as the fugitive.

172
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,920
Do you really think...

173
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,050
that woman is Writer Ma Ji Won?

174
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,110
Of course.

175
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,330
Why is that?

176
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,750
Ms. Ma is Ms. Ma.

177
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,700
What reason do I need for that?

178
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,540
Because you feel guilty?

179
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,040
Why would I?

180
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,980
Because the murderer you 
saw isn't that woman?

181
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,940
Is that why you're protecting her?

182
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,700
Detective.

183
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,950
I think you can change your career.

184
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,780
You're so imaginative.

185
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,740
 

186
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,900
I met him for a bit.

187
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,910
He was handsome up close.

188
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,490
By the way,

189
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,160
why did your husband come 
with Han Tae Kyu?

190
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,610
Han Tae Kyu probably brought him.

191
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,220
Because of you?

192
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,910
Han Tae Kyu is still suspicious of me.

193
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,230
He knew that I could fool anyone

194
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,020
but Min Seo's dad. 
That's why he brought him.

195
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,670
Do you think your husband 
knew about that?

196
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,680
What Han Tae Kyu was thinking.

197
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,170
He wouldn't have come if he knew.

198
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,470
Then why do you think he came?

199
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,760
Probably because of Jung Hee.

200
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,710
You mean that...

201
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,190
he came because 
Han Tae Kyu said there's

202
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,260
a witness who could 
prove your innocence?

203
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,990
What are you trying to say?

204
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,250
You ever thought about it?

205
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,690
- About what?
- That your husband could be the murderer?

206
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,730
- No.
- Why not?

207
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,880
Why do you think my 
husband's the murderer?

208
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,380
He has everything because of 
what happened to you.

209
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,520
Your company, fortune, everything.

210
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,240
You think he killed Min Seo for that?

211
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,570
You know humans 
better than anyone.

212
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,360
A man put an awl to his 
son's neck so he could run away.

213
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,010
Have you forgotten what 
Choi Man Shik did to Woo Joon?

214
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,810
I was suspicious of 
my husband at first.

215
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,300
We were facing a divorce and

216
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,450
he was about to lose 
everything he had.

217
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,680
But?

218
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,270
When I found Min Seo, 
he was home.

219
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,020
He had an alibi?

220
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,880
And even though he 
was a bad husband,

221
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,340
he was a good father to Min Seo.

222
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,480
There's no way...

223
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,790
he would've done something 
so brutal to Min Seo.

224
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,020
By the way,

225
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,550
why bring this up all of a sudden?

226
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,250
- Because I'm curious.
- About what?

227
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,160
Why your husband ran away when he saw me.

228
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,360
I'm so curious.

229
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,760
Yes.

230
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,670
I drank a bit.

231
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,670
Lee Jung Hee?

232
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,110
No, I didn't meet her.

233
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,130
I met Seo Eun Ji instead.

234
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,240
Yes, that Seo Eun Ji!

235
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,800
Why was she there?

236
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,850
I'm asking!

237
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,140
Why was she there?

238
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,590
Why, why, why?

239
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,090
 

240
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,910
 Seo Eun Ji doesn't have an aunt. 

241
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,330
This means she's 
strangers with Ma Ji Won.

242
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,920
 

243
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,190
Any other family?

244
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,770
I think she lived with her 
grandma, but she's alone now.

245
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
Does Seo Eun Ji have a sister?

246
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Oh, that?

247
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,550
A girl. She went missing as a child.

248
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,120
Missing? When?

249
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,590
When she was about 10 years old.

250
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,130
Anyway, they still don't 
know her whereabouts.

251
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,030
Her grandmother passed 
away because of that.

252
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,990
Wait, I heard you met 
with Lee Jung Hee.

253
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,090
Yes.

254
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,760
What did she say? 
Did she see anything?

255
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,750
- No.
- How disappointing.

256
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,700
That means it's over now.

257
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,340
It's only the beginning.

258
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,800
Lee Jung Hee knows something.

259
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,990
What are you talking about?

260
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,470
I don't know why, but she lied.

261
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,650
Aigoo, Chief, seriously.

262
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,090
Look into what's going on 
in that neighborhood.

263
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,990
Especially regarding Lee Jung Hee.

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,200
So? Did you look into it?

265
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,910
Lee Jung Hee is 
receiving death threats.

266
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,730
Why would an actress be?

267
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,450
They say it's the guy 
who took her money,

268
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,180
but something's strange.

269
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,900
A few days ago, this was...

270
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,800
found on her bed.

271
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,690
This is f***** up.

272
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,160
The murder from nine years ago?

273
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,340
The one you committed...

274
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,480
No, I mean...

275
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,900
The murder someone who 
looks like you committed?

276
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,940
Jung Hee's the murder witness 
from nine years ago.

277
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,950
Who said that?

278
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,540
According to my research, she is.

279
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,540
But what's important is that

280
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,530
An Sung Tae doesn't know about it.

281
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,940
So it doesn't make sense that 
he'd put something on her bed

282
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,770
to threaten her.

283
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,540
Well, you know that...

284
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,400
An Sung Tae's been threatening 
Jung Hee for money, right?

285
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,300
Yes, I know that.

286
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,410
Then you know he killed his wife while 
trying to kill Jung Hee, right?

287
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,410
We still don't know who 
poisoned that wine.

288
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,240
Didn't you see him bolt 
right after she died?

289
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,320
That's your assumption.

290
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,920
How about the fact that he

291
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,390
snuck into Jung Hee's waiting 
room during the shoot?

292
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,670
What will you do if someone 
saw him sneak in there

293
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,270
the day Jung Hee fainted?

294
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,940
There's a witness?

295
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,990
She's here now.

296
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,390
Did you really see An Sung Tae?

297
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,860
Why?

298
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,660
Disappointed it wasn't the 
murderer from nine years ago?

299
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,000
What do you mean?

300
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,680
If so, the book 
you're currently writing

301
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,170
would've been more interesting.

302
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,030
Did anyone else see 
An Sung Tae besides you?

303
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,190
I heard there were a lot of 
people on the set.

304
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,200
What difference does that make?

305
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,450
I saw An Sung Tae with 
my very own eyes.

306
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,150
Do you know...

307
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,880
what I found the most 
disappointing in your book?

308
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,620
There was no "love."

309
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,100
Especially sad, one-sided love.
