1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,150
 

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,750
 
 It's a girl named Seo Soo Ji.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,320
She's 10 years old and 
her height, weight,

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,650
and features are similar 
to your daughter's.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,640
Her parents died in an 
accident a while ago.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,080
She's living with her high school age
 sister and her grandmother.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,770
She has no relatives, and

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,180
it won't be a big deal if 
she disappears.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,430
If you're afraid, then give it up.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,370
But remember that...

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,180
once you start,

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,860
you can't stop...

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,170
and can't ever stop.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,020
Min Seo.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,430
My Min Seo is okay, right?

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,460
Why do you think I found a 
girl similar to Min Seo?

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,170
Don't worry.

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,040
Min Seo will be okay.

19
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,260
Where's the money?

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,990
It's behind the phone.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,680
 I'll pay you the rest...  

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,410
after the job's done.

23
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,840
You want me to wear this?

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,470
Hey, Soo Ji.

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,790
You think this would suit me?

26
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,390
Grandma bought them for 
us to wear together.

27
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,420
So I should wear this fish on my hair?

28
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,550
It's not fish. It's goldfish, Unni.

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,200
People should become 
closer to meat, not fish.

30
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,570
You prefer pork over 
saury too, don't you?

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,190
But still, Grandma bought them for us.

32
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,480
Ta-da!

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
Wow, there're two bears.

34
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,180
Come here.

35
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,400
How pretty!

36
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,470
Here.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Okay. Come here.

38
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,750
So pretty!

39
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,960
Won't you wear one?

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,430
You can wear them all.

41
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,460
Come here.

42
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,580
Ready?

43
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,960
Yes, what is it?

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,870
 Hurry up. The guys are almost here. 

45
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,180
I don't think I can today.

46
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,900
I'm with my sister.

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,290
 Your favorite, Joon Soo is coming. 

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,630
What?

49
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,310
You should've told me sooner!

50
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,790
I'll be there in 10 minutes. Just wait.

51
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,310
Soo Ji, can you go home...

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,910
Seo Soo Ji!

53
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,230
I have to leave now!

54
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,210
Soo Ji!

55
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,270
Yeah, I am. I'll treat you big time!

56
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,620
Hey, I think I really scored this time.

57
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,230
You know Jang Chul Min, right?

58
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,370
 
Soo Ji!

59
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,810
Seo Soo Ji!

60
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Have you seen a girl 
wearing this clip?

61
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,970
She kind of looks like you.

62
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,130
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,690
Soo Ji!

64
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,420
Soo Ji!

65
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,660
Seo Soo Ji...

66
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,880
What should I do?

67
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,990
My Soo Ji, what should I do?

68
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,340
Soo Ji.

69
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,200
 I'm sorry... 

70
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,070
 for crying, Soo Ji. 

71
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,470
 I'll never... 

72
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,670
 cry again. 

73
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,600
 Never. 

74
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,350
Hey!

75
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,510
Hello, Sir!

76
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,480
Hey! How could you come in so late?

77
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,340
Starting tomorrow, you'd better come in
 30 minutes earlier and call me.

78
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,220
Okay?

79
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,020
Huh?

80
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,720
Who has the nerve to 
break into a police station?

81
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,930
Should I check the 
security cameras?

82
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,790
Why do you even ask, punk?

83
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,340
Hey, over there...

84
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,490
Pardon?

85
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,480
Over there, there. Why is there a...

86
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,570
What?

87
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,080
Why is she here anyway?

88
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,670
Auntie.

89
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,980
What's up?

90
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,460
They told me to sign up for
 the volunteer team.

91
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,600
I heard you're taking Woo Joon in.

92
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,720
Yes.

93
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,550
But he ran away yesterday.

94
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,710
He was found quickly 
thanks to Ms. Hong.

95
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,390
That's all because he's very lonely.

96
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,280
I heard he doesn't have many
 friends at school, either.

97
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,870
If the moms are close, the 
kids get close too.

98
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,000
Also, Unni...

99
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,050
Woo Joon's bullies will be

100
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,010
all taken care of
 if Ms. Oh takes action.

101
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,740
She'll call out their moms
 and scold them.

102
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,770
What do you think?

103
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
That's great.

104
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,890
Do it, Auntie.

105
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,660
Yes, Unni.

106
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,260
Okay.

107
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,270
I'll do it, Ms. Oh.

108
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,240
Community unni, Ms. Ma!

109
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,880
Ms. Oh, something's happened.

110
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,470
A body was found...

111
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,340
at the police station.

112
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,600
Again?

113
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,950
Where's Chief?

114
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,470
Is he all right?

115
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,980
Well, he's in shock.

116
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,290
Would you like to come in?

117
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
- Let's go.
- Whoa, whoa.

118
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,530
- What? 
 - Why?

119
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,020
 We're investigating. 
Please go home. 

120
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,110
This isn't a show! And hey.

121
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,960
You can't let people in 
the crime scene.

122
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,980
Oh, Ms. Ma. Well...

123
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,130
Ask her to do her 
research later, slowly.

124
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,560
Ms. Ma?

125
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,520
I'm sorry about last time.

126
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,590
As an apology, we'd like to...

127
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,940
give you an award for...

128
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,980
Let's go, Auntie.

129
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,910
Well, excuse me, but...

130
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,730
Hey, let's check the 
recorded footage first.

131
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Turn it on.

132
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
The thing is...

133
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,070
What?

134
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,720
If we watch it, we'll see the 
culprit immediately.

135
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,040
I already checked with Chief, but...

136
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
it's broken.

137
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,860
Broken?

138
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,010
Yes.

139
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,150
The estimated time of 
death is between 7 to 10.

140
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,810
Where were you then?

141
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,660
I was at an internet cafe.

142
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,760
I was playing video games 
with my colleagues.

143
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,460
What about you, Hyungnim?

144
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,900
- I was at home.
 - With your wife?

145
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,400
My wife and my kid 
were at my in-law's house.

146
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
So you were alone.

147
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,380
My wife and kid were 
gone, so I was alone.

148
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,020
Would I be home with a ghost?

149
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,400
You punk, how dare you...

150
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Hey.

151
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,660
If I was the culprit, why would I have

152
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,970
smashed the door
 instead of using the key?

153
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,100
Chief.

154
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,200
Is this your niece?

155
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,960
Yes, it's Bo Ra.

156
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,220
But how did she end up like...

157
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,670
I think she was strangled to death.

158
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,910
We need more investigation
 for further details.

159
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,210
Well, you said you're 
Kim Bo Ra's aunt.

160
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,650
Where are Bo Ra's parents?

161
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,120
They both died in an 
accident three years ago.

162
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,060
Since then, she's been 
staying with me.

163
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,710
And she joined an idol group 
 I was putting together.

164
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,690
So you were with Kim Bo Ra...

165
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,200
- all day yesterday?
- Yes.

166
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,050
Bo Ra had a show yesterday.

167
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,220
 After having a meal 
with CEO Shin's family, 

168
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,090
 she arrived around 6:30 p.m. 

169
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,790
 CEO Shin? 

170
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,430
 Do you mean Shin Hyun Jo, 
who has a private loan business? 

171
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,530
 Yes. 

172
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,530
 His entire family died in an 
accident a while ago. 

173
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,980
 I meant his son-in-law 
and daughter-in-law. 

174
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,720
 Although they're not blood related, 

175
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,580
 he considered them as family. 

176
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,330
So...

177
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,970
what time did Bo Ra's show end?

178
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,050
She couldn't do it.

179
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,500
The show was at 8:30 p.m.,

180
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,300
but she disappeared all of a sudden.

181
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,460
When?

182
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,780
When did she disappear?

183
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,950
It was 30 minutes before the show,

184
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,180
so it was around 8 o'clock.

185
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,270
8 o'clock...

186
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,290
I said, I was at home!

187
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,970
Why are you seeing Mal Koo oppa?

188
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,250
To discuss the guardianship, and...

189
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,660
I wanted to see Grandpa, too.

190
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,130
Grandpa?

191
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,650
If Min Seo was alive, 
she'd be around that age.

192
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,130
The girl at the police station.

193
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,010
I wonder who did it?

194
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,820
She was so young.

195
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm glad you're taking Woo Joon in.

196
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,630
I'm sorry for going back and forth.

197
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,980
No worries.

198
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,200
Woo Joon wanted to be with 
you from the beginning.

199
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,200
Also, I'd like to see Mr. Jang.

200
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,240
The CEO?

201
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,420
Yes.

202
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,120
Yes.

203
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,760
I'll be right there.

204
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,210
I'm sorry, but could you watch CEO
 until the caretaker comes?

205
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,860
You'll be taking Woo Joon in?

206
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,540
Yes.

207
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,820
Then...

208
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,030
what about my request?

209
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,210
I'm sorry, but I can't...

210
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,740
honor your request.

211
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,210
Help me up.

212
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,230
Just because I called it a "request,"

213
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,330
do you really see it as a "request?"

214
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,750
I know who you really are.

215
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,250
Right.

216
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,290
I'm not Writer Ma Ji Won.

217
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,470
Then you should be doing your duty.

218
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,010
Ms. Ma was also looking for...

219
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,370
the man who kidnapped 
the girl nine years ago.

220
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,850
The person I'm looking for...

221
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,840
is not your son.

222
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,460
The day that my d*** son
 kidnapped a child was...

223
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,280
the same day your daughter 
was kidnapped and killed.

224
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,810
Are you still saying I'm wrong?

225
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,110
The kidnapper was a 
woman, not a man.

226
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,420
  Is that right? 

227
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,080
Also, I'll be staying here for a while.

228
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,400
Then...

229
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,620
did you decide...

230
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,390
to forget what you went through?

231
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,250
No.

232
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,520
How can I forget?

233
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,920
But the sole eyewitness died and...

234
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,990
since I'm not a detective,

235
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,200
I've reached my limit in 
finding evidence.

236
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm planning on staying here until...

237
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,690
Woo Joon gets settled in.

238
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,370
Although it shouldn't take long.

239
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,540
 Where is your CEO's son right now? 

240
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,530
I don't know.

241
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,510
- Oppa.
- I said I don't know.

242
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,690
I'm begging you.

243
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,890
I must ask him something right now.

244
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,990
I don't know what it is, but 
meeting him will be pointless.

245
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,850
I'll be the judge of that.

246
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,200
Where is that man?

247
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,720
Why are you trying to see him?

248
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,500
I heard he...

249
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,870
kidnapped a girl a while ago.

250
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,280
- Says who?
- Your CEO did.

251
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,760
Where is he?

252
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,360
The girl that bastard kidnapped...

253
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,970
is my sister.

254
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,500
 

255
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,370
Since CEO got ill and

256
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,520
was desperately seeking his son,

257
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,550
I found him by asking around.

258
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,660
It was only a few years ago.

259
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,870
Jang Sun Doo.

260
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,060
Can you hear me?

261
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,880
You took my Soo Ji, didn't you?

262
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,940
Who ordered you to?

263
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,900
Tell me.

264
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,510
Huh?

265
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,100
Tell me!

266
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,300
Tell me right now, you bastard!

267
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,770
Who made you do it?

268
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,290
According to the records,

269
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,070
he was found 
somewhere in Daejeon

270
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,760
nine years ago, badly beaten up.

271
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,630
- You don't know who did it?
- No, we don't.

272
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,070
- Anyhow, his whole body is paralyzed.
- Then...

273
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,270
he's at least conscious, right?

274
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,970
He can see and hear, right?

275
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,640
Yes, according to the brain test.

276
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
But he shows no physical reaction.

277
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,780
Aside from him being conscious...

278
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,410
To simply put, he's in 
a vegetative state.

279
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,900
- The case from nine years ago?
- Yes.

280
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,720
The case where the 
fugitive committed suicide.

281
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,060
Chief Han asked for a copy of the
 case from your archives.

282
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,910
Why would he ask for that?

283
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,900
I'm not sure either.

284
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,820
 
Hankook Tech?

285
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,230
Why is he digging this?

286
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm not sure, but...

287
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,490
Giga Corporation, Baegoon Electronics,

288
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,950
and Sungsan Textiles.

289
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,610
He's looking into the companies that 
had issues with Hankook Tech.

290
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,270
That punk, why I outta...

291
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,040
Get out.

292
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,090
Okay.

293
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,270
It's me.

294
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,820
I'll be needing your guys.

295
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,630
 Yes, Ma'am. 

296
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,310
Prosecutor Yang complained a bit.

297
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,540
What did she say?

298
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
She was asking why I 
made those copies.

299
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,830
You shouldn't be too 
close to that woman.

300
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,030
I'm not close to her.

301
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,890
But still...

302
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,410
Prosecutor Yang called, so I had to go.

303
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,750
I have to get promoted, too.

304
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,460
A promotion?

305
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,670
Yes.

306
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,040
I always fail the lieutenant test.

307
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,920
Detective Chun, would you like...

308
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,080
a special promotion this time?

309
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,600
Special promotion?

310
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,100
How?

311
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,500
You'll have to catch the culprit.

312
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,600
 

313
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,850
Then I must hustle on my feet.

314
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,530
What's the point of sifting 
through a closed case?

315
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,500
The culprit, who'll aid in your
 promotion, is hiding in there.

316
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,410
Geez, Chief. Seriously.

317
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,970
It's Prosecutor Yang and Jang Chul Min.

318
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,200
Prosecutor Yang and Jang Chul...

319
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,340
Sit down, sit.

320
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,110
Think of them as suspects...

321
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,850
and search thoroughly.

322
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,770
Okay?

323
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,180
Okay.

324
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,460
So...

325
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,240
Prosecutor Yang and that 
husband, Jang Chul Min...

326
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,310
They planned this together, am I right?

327
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,570
To take over that woman's company.

328
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,160
After taking over,

329
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,190
Prosecutor Yang removed all their 
competitors to help them grow.

330
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,680
Bingo.

331
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,540
But...

332
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,310
there's a witness who saw that woman
 kidnapping Jang Min Seo.

333
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,070
According to the witness' testimony,

334
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,200
 the girl got in the car voluntarily
 while on the phone. 

335
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
So that's why...

336
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,300
I thought Jang Min Seo's 
mom was in that car.

337
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,720
 Prosecutor Yang was in there. 

338
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,170
Jang Min Seo was 
probably on the phone...

339
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,860
with Jang Chul Min.

340
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,820
Since Dad said it's okay 
over the phone,

341
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,000
she got in the car voluntarily.

342
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,670
But it was definitely that woman's car.

343
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,720
Right.

344
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,010
Look.

345
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,770
They prepared the same exact car.

346
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,590
If you swap the license plates,
 no one would know.

347
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,300
And after that...

348
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,100
she trailed that woman's car...

349
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
and threatened her.

350
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,380
Near Yongam Mountain,

351
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,870
near the house,

352
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,290
and Seoul National Cemetery.

353
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,680
To be in the similar
 location as the killer was.

354
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,420
That's why they thought 
she made those threat calls.

355
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,180
But what I don't understand is...

356
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,360
the car we found later on.

357
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,570
We found that woman's fingerprints,

358
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,660
the girl's fingerprints and blood.

359
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,670
Look.

360
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,340
This is the...

361
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,930
car that Prosecutor Yang planted the 
girl's fingerprints and blood in.

362
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,330
And this is that woman's car.

363
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,200
This is that woman's house.

364
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,880
When the woman arrived at the 
house and went inside,

365
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,060
that's when she switched the cars.

366
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,300
 

367
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,400
 

368
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,090
SInce she was bringing the money
 to get her daughter back,

369
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,190
she didn't notice the switch,

370
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,960
and got in this car.

371
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,670
The car that had Jang Min Seo's 
fingerprints and blood.

372
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,170
That's why that 
woman's fingerprints were

373
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,070
all over the steering wheel.

374
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,610
But still...

375
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,300
Wouldn't she have felt 
strange in the car?

376
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,190
Even if it looked the same, it would've 
felt different from her own car.

377
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,100
Normally, she would've noticed.

378
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,410
 But she must've been in a frenzy then. 

379
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,460
What?

380
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,570
Let me use the restroom.

381
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,840
Chief.

382
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,360
This is daebak.
