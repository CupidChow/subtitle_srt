1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,580
The inheritance is more 
than 100 billion won.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,510
That's more than enough
 motive for murder.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,340
So that niece hired An Sung Tae and...

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,010
tried to kill Do Ja Yeon?

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,980
Since that failed, 
she shut An Sung Tae up.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,990
Which means, the 
culprit was definitely...

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,220
inside that house.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,040
So that excludes Do Ja Yeon.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,940
She said it was a niece, 
not a nephew, right?

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,970
Yes.

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,060
Would she be in her late 20's?

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,390
She was less than 10 years old 
when they met 20 years ago.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,370
So you're probably right.

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,190
Chief.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,790
I must have you look her up.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,110
Eun Ji.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,750
We need a secret password.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,540
You're Auntie, right?

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,130
Did Woo Joon want to come here?

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,040
It was my idea.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,760
He didn't want to go to your house.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,020
And I was scared of 
running into that woman.

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,860
Are you here to see Woo Joon?

24
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,890
I don't think today's the right day.

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,500
I heard the CEO was discharged.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,790
Why do you want to see that grandpa?

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,790
Okay.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,010
One, two, one, two, one, two...

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,900
Left side, right side.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,120
Is Mal Koo okay with...

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,220
Woo Joon staying here?

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,510
Grandpa was happier 
than Mal Koo oppa.

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,050
It's really Auntie.

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,850
Mal Koo met her, too?

35
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,730
Briefly at the hospital.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,830
Let's go in.

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,780
I'll be inside, too.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,870
Okay.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,280
He's got a lot of spirit.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,350
Even though he went 
through some hardships.

41
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,490
I came here to ask you something.

42
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,460
The punk who kidnapped the 
girl nine years ago?

43
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,560
That punk is my son.

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,800
Do you know...

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,990
where your son is now?

46
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,910
That's the favor I wanted to ask you.

47
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,500
The things you went through...

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,260
I think he was involved in it.

49
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,100
I think you can find that bastard.

50
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,590
So I'm asking you shamelessly.

51
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,450
If you meet him,

52
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,230
can you tell him that I want to 
hold his hand once before I die?

53
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,810
Give me one.

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,760
Say, ah!

55
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,050
It's so tasty.

56
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,670
Make some more.

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
He liked it too.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,030
It's delicious.

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,640
 Why did he choose you? 

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,880
 Sister and niece. 
They're still his bloodline. 

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,470
 That's because the CEO and his
 sister had a bad relationship. 

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
I took a lot of pictures.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,940
Go there yourself 
if you don't trust me.

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,940
I want to make something clear.

65
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,300
Sure.

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,780
Whoever loses, you must 
do whatever the winner says.

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,010
Including  the guardianship
 of Woo Joon.

68
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,490
Of course.

69
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,790
Promise me.

70
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,200
Promise?

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,310
Okay, fine.

72
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,130
I promise you, putting my 
writer's integrity on the line.

73
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,300
Okay. First, there's something 
strange about the picture.

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,340
Look.

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,130
The flowers in the vase are wilted.

76
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,140
They couldn't water them
 since the area was restricted.

77
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,860
Then how about this dresser?

78
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,400
It wasn't there before.

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,260
What are you talking about?

80
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,320
Also, this lamp looks 
different than before.

81
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,710
The  police didn't let us in,

82
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,410
so I couldn't change the water.

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,790
Is that true?

84
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,470
Of course!

85
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,890
And this was here before?

86
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,860
That's a...

87
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,650
burnt mark from a mosquito 
repellent last summer.

88
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,220
I don't know how they 
come in through the screens.

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,340
Which "change" was 
she talking about?

90
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,900
 You keep calling her Se Yeon. 

91
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,290
 Who is that? 

92
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,150
 I, I did? 

93
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,480
 Se Yeon's my sister who
 died from thyroid cancer. 

94
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,280
 That's right. 

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,230
 I was close with her. So 
I get confused at times. 

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,030
 I'm sorry, Ja Yeon. 

97
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,260
 

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,650
Woo Joon's mom!

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,050
Unni, I heard the news.

100
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,440
I heard you're taking Woo Joon in.

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,750
You're so amazing.

102
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,880
Honestly, since Woo Joon's dad died,

103
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,370
I was really worried about him.

104
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,660
It felt like there was 
a rock on my chest.

105
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,710
But since I heard you're doing 
this, I felt so relieved...

106
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,770
Let's talk about that later.

107
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,750
That's right. You're 
looking for the killer, right?

108
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,010
I don't know if this will be helpful,

109
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,910
but Ms. Oh said something strange.

110
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,360
- Something strange?
- Yes.

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
That night,

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,880
after the lights went out, An Sung Tae
 shone the flashlight on our faces, right?

113
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,190
Ms. Oh thinks that she 
saw a "new face" then.

114
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,990
So there was a stranger in that room?

115
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,920
Yes.

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,180
Who was it?

117
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,770
Was it Jo Ye Jin, that single mom?

118
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,790
That's what I asked her, but...

119
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,830
she doesn't really remember.

120
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,590
Ms. Oh is pretty old, you know.

121
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,500
It's only been a few days. 
How can she forget it?

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,940
Is she an idiot?

123
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,140
- Unni.
- What?

124
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,770
But you don't need to be so harsh.

125
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,720
Enough.

126
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,810
Ms. Ma, what if someone sees us?

127
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,630
Geez, Chief. You're super shy.

128
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,640
How cute.

129
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,390
What do you mean...

130
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,130
Anyhow.

131
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,800
It was Jo Ye Jin, right?

132
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,280
The woman who'll inherit
 if Do Ja Yeon dies.

133
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,390
Ito Megumi. Her real name is...

134
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,560
Jo Ye Jin. That's her real name.

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,810
Everything is clear now.

136
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,040
Jo Ye Jin, I mean, Ito Megumi...

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,430
tried to kill Do Ja Yeon and failed.

138
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,130
So she killed the hitman An Sung Tae.

139
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,750
But there's no evidence. 
What should we do?

140
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,290
Evidence?

141
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,050
Well, there was no eyewitness.

142
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,420
And no fingerprints 
on the gun, either.

143
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,690
Then...

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,060
we can make one.

145
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,900
The evidence.

146
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,360
What?

147
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,710
- There was an eyewitness?
- Yes.

148
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,460
We couldn't see anything 
because the lights were off.

149
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,170
How could there be an eyewitness?

150
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,880
To be exact, the witness 
didn't see the culprit.

151
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,660
But she saw the ones 
who weren't the culprit.

152
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,460
What do you mean by that?

153
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,280
Remember how An Sung Tae shone the 
flashlight on everyone's faces, right?

154
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,650
Yes, he did.

155
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,460
Someone remembers all of their faces.

156
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,220
This means the person she 
didn't see is the culprit.

157
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,130
Because the culprit left the 
room to kill An Sung Tae.

158
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,380
I can't believe it.

159
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,990
Everyone must've been chaotic then.

160
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,200
How could she remember 
all the faces?

161
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,820
It's possible if she has...

162
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,500
a great memory.

163
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,070
Who on earth...

164
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,790
There's someone.

165
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,030
A very smart person 
whose son is a judge.

166
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,070
You mean Ye Jin, Sung Eun's mom?

167
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,150
That woman is Ito Megumi.

168
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,040
If Do Ja Yeon dies, 
she'll get the inheritance.

169
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,530
I think I'm the one who won this bet.

170
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,490
It's a good motive.

171
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,170
But there's no evidence.

172
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,480
Evidence?

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,550
We'll have it soon.

174
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,170
- Ms. Oh!
- Yes.

175
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,580
You're having a 
glass of wine today, right?

176
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,410
Well, my son is coming over tonight.

177
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,420
Judge Kang?

178
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,610
Judge Kang can't drink
 anything else

179
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,190
but he likes wine.

180
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,570
Sounds great.

181
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,470
I bought an extra bottle
 for him to take home.

182
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,160
For him to enjoy it with
 his wife at home.

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm getting old, but they're not 
working on my grandchildren.

184
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,190
Goodness, what am I doing? 
He'll be here soon.

185
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,310
I'll get going now.

186
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,020
- Take care!
- Okay!

187
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,550
A sting operation?

188
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,010
That's what you did for 
Choi Man Shik's case, too.

189
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,550
I stole your idea a bit.

190
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,370
So, is Ms. Oh aware of it?

191
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,610
Don't worry.

192
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,850
Chief Jo is watching 
Jo Ye Jin like a hawk.

193
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,700
Then what about Ms. Oh?

194
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,360
Who'll protect her?

195
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,160
If someone's protecting her...

196
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,660
will the culprit bite the bait?

197
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,790
You...

198
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,630
Taxi!

199
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,850
What are you doing?

200
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,940
What if Ye Jin is not the culprit?

201
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,560
You also said it was an insider.

202
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,260
Ye Jin wasn't the 
only one in the house!

203
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,970
She's the only one...

204
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,510
with a motive.

205
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,010
Aigoo, it startled me.
 Who would do...

206
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,450
Son...

207
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,930
Hey, you!

208
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,070
Ms. Oh.

209
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,480
Ms. Oh!

210
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,900
Ms. Oh!

211
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,150
 Ms. Ma. 

212
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,110
Jo Ye Jin's not home, right?

213
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,810
But she is.

214
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,060
Who's not home right now then?

215
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,470
That Song Kyung Ah woman
 left an hour ago.

216
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,210
Jo Ye Jin's hired An Sung Tae
 as a hitman before.

217
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,150
I'm sure she did it again.

218
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,470
Do you still think it was Ye Jin?

219
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,810
Motive is the most 
important in murder cases.

220
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,670
And she's the only one with a motive.

221
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,160
But how can you explain that Ye Jin

222
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,140
left the room...

223
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,470
to shoot An Sung Tae?

224
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,420
Because they're a team. 
He made way for her.

225
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,890
Okay. According to the testimonies,

226
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,020
Ms. Cha was passed out
 in front of the door.

227
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,200
And Ms. Oh was with her.

228
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,740
If those two were
 in front of the door,

229
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,220
it's impossible to pass them
 to go to An Sung Tae.

230
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,500
If it wasn't the door...

231
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,200
then how did she get to the hallway?

232
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,660
There was a second door.

233
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,530
Second door?

234
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,480
What are you talking about?

235
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,900
There was only one door in the room.

236
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,010
The room where the crime took place...

237
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,790
was originally two rooms combined.

238
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,340
That's why there are two windows

239
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,820
and two lamps on the ceiling.

240
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,880
But there was only one door.

241
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,040
That door is where the
 dresser is right now.

242
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,980
No.

243
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,870
The reason it was next to the cabinet 
on the day of the incident...

244
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,970
was because the culprit was 
planning to use that door.

245
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,710
It was probably Jo Ye Jin.

246
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,000
As soon as the lights went out,

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,450
she went out the secret door 
and shot An Sung Tae.

248
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,280
Then why did the lights
 go out suddenly?

249
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,910
That was probably 
An Sung Tae's doing.

250
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,720
Because the fuse box 
was in front of the entrance.

251
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,430
Wilted flowers.

252
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,270
And the lights.

253
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,690
What about them?

254
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,210
When the lights go out at 8 o'clock,

255
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,570
we'll choose the mafia first.

256
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,000
Please stay alert.

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,250
We have five minutes left.

258
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,150
 The flowers wilted in two days... 

259
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,560
 because there was 
no water in the vase. 

260
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,660
Are we starting already?

261
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,180
Chief, it's not 8 o'clock yet.

262
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,110
What's wrong with the lights?

263
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,970
 Then the culprit went to the 
hallway using the secret door. 

264
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,870
 Turn the lights on! 

265
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,050
- Hey, what's going on? 
 - I can't see!

266
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,910
- This is against the rules! 
 - What happened?

267
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,600
 The only one who 
could've done this is... 

268
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,940
 Do Ja Yeon, who was already there. 

269
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,610
I'm sure there's a burn mark here...

270
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,830
because of the short circuit.

271
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,400
Give me a break.

272
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,950
She'll inherit a hundred billion 
won just by staying still.

273
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,730
Why would she do something crazy?

274
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,320
What if she's not the heir?

275
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,410
What?

276
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,040
What if "Do Ja Yeon" is someone else?

277
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,040
Think about how 
I'm masquerading as you.

278
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,700
What the hell are you talking about?

279
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,460
The sister of Do Ja Yeon 
who died from thyroid cancer...

280
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,080
It's possible that she's Do Se Yeon.

281
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,430
What's this about?

282
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,140
What should we do?

283
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,280
What's going on?

284
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,610
What are you doing?

285
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,550
I said, what are you doing?

286
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,330
Se Hyun.

287
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,450
This is the end for us.

288
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,210
Shut up.

289
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,600
I only...

290
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,330
did what Se Hyun told me to do.

291
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,210
I'm telling the truth!

292
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,210
I only did what she told me to do.

293
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,310
I told you to shut up!

294
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,100
Shut up, both of you!

295
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,670
Yes.

296
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,610
I have my conviction now.

297
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,840
It's clear.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,210
You stupid b****!

299
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,460
Unni!

300
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,090
How are you feeling?

301
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm okay.

302
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,680
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,990
What are you sorry about?

304
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm alive thanks to you.

305
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,790
I didn't do anything.

306
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,270
Come on now.

307
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,390
Then...

308
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,670
please tell Mal Koo that
 I'll thank him properly later.

309
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,690
It's me.

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,790
I have something to tell you.

311
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,510
Yes.

312
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,310
I'll see you at the hotel then.

313
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,850
Please send backup for 
this town's police dept.

314
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,780
Yes. We're at...

315
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,060
What are you doing right now?

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,740
In this envelope...

317
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,550
there's evidence that Auntie is the 
woman you're trailing after.

318
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,950
If you confirm one thing, I'll give you this

319
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,770
plus bring Auntie to you anytime.

320
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,960
You know I can pull it off, right?

321
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,240
What do you want?

322
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,560
Giga Corporation,

323
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,960
Baegoon Electronics,

324
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,330
Sungsan Textiles, Taeyang Metal
 Engineering and Taeheung Corp.

325
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,730
These companies went
 bankrupt or got taken over while

326
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,030
competing against Jang Chul Min's 
company in the past nine years.

327
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,980
And?

328
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,310
Look into why that happened
 to those companies.

329
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,210
Then you'll find 
Jang Chul Min's accomplice...

330
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,390
whom I've told you about.

331
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,550
Do Se Hyun was  receiving 
thyroid treatment  in Japan...

332
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,340
and got to know An Sung Tae by chance.

333
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,750
She was masquerading as 
her dead sister, Do Ja Yeon

334
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,440
in order to get the inheritance.

335
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,360
But she ran into An Sung Tae.

336
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,660
That's why she wanted to shut him up.

337
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,670
She bought a gun from An Sung Tae 
and called him there.

338
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,490
saying she'll pay him if 
he pretended to be a robber.

339
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,120
Tell me.

340
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,510
Since you won, I'll do 
whatever you want.

341
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,680
Before I leave...

342
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,560
please give up 
Woo Joon's guardianship.

343
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,080
Afterward...

344
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,970
feel free to live in my house...

345
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,110
at your will.

346
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,060
In there...

347
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,610
you'll find my legal seal and ID card.

348
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,740
With these, you can...

349
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,620
take control of 
Woo Joon's guardianship.

350
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,010
Because you're Ma Ji Won.

351
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,420
Then I'll...

352
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,950
have no reason to stay here.

353
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,330
I'll disappear quietly.

354
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,520
But I will...

355
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,960
ask you for a favor.

356
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,520
This is all I have.

357
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,580
I'll ask you something one last time.

358
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,020
Why did you kill your daughter?

359
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,250
Hello?

360
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,750
 It's me, Honey. 

361
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,950
I have a favor to ask you.

362
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,800
- Honey.
- There's something I need.

363
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
Yes, tell me.

364
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,970
I'll do whatever you want.

365
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,060
I need...

366
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,710
to move to another place.

367
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,180
But I don't have money right now.

368
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,640
 

369
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,540
I'll scam money from 
her husband, too...

370
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,670
and report her to 211.

371
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,610
When I go back, I'll become
 Woo Joon's guardian.

372
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,740
I'll live very comfortably.

373
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,650
Arrogant b****.

374
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,400
How dare a murderer f***ing 
pretend to be me?

375
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,130
 These companies went
 bankrupt or got taken over while 

376
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,550
 competing against Jang Chul Min's 
company in the past nine years. 

377
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,000
 Look into why that happened 
to those companies. 

378
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,210
 Then you'll find 
Jang Chul Min's accomplice,  

379
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,030
 whom I've told you about. 

380
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,700
 
This is the last one.

381
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,890
Who's the prosecutor of this case?

382
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,220
Why?

383
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,850
Is this also...

384
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,750
Prosecutor Yang's case?

385
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,340
Probably.

386
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,300
Wow.

387
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,990
I'm here right now.

388
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,910
Yes.

389
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,190
Okay, I'll wait.

390
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,120
So this is where the girl's 
body was found?

391
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,390
My first book will be about 
Choi Man Shik's murder case.

392
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,560
The second one will be 
about Lee Jung Hee,

393
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,150
and the third one...

394
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,370
will be about you.

395
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,170
Jang Min Seo's murder case.

396
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,390
It's interesting.

397
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,610
It's really interesting.

398
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,360
What's so interesting?

399
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,210
Say hello to your daughter for me.

400
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,220
♫  Even if I fall, round and 
round and round  ♫

401
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,610
♫  Even if I disappear, 
run and run and over  ♫

402
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,450
♫  I can't stop myself  ♫

403
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,120
♫  I can't stop  ♫
