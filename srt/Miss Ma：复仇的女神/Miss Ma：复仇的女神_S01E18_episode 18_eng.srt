1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,650
It's Jung Hee.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,950
What?

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,270
That...

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,850
Director Seong knows this, too.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,260
Get out!

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,820
 I won't let you say 
stuff like that anymore! 

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,710
 Got it? 

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,460
Auntie!

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,550
Officer Bae can get you that footage.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,380
The behind-the-scenes video, right?

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,320
With Lee Jung Hee captured
 handing over the glass?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,590
Can I see it?

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,800
I'll give it a try.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,370
Eun Ji asked me for this favor, 
not just anyone.

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,130
Don't talk nonsense. EOD today, okay?

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,180
Okay.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,340
So you came back empty-handed?

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,080
Hey, Mister.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,930
You should've told me 
Ko Mal Koo was her bodyguard.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,700
But he's just one person.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,720
You think that punk's just one person?

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,180
 I'm hanging up! 

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,980
Where's Jung Hee now?

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,920
The thing is, she's not answering.

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,790
Where are you now?

26
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,620
Everyone's waiting.

27
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,380
My apologies.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,820
I think I had the wrong address.

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,300
How's Jung Hee?

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,120
She fell asleep for a second.

31
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,190
I'll bring her there soon.

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,670
Okay, Director.

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,410
Are you okay?

34
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,670
Yes.

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,990
What?

36
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,980
The video Choi Jung Cheol took?

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,180
Yes.

38
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,770
He wanted to check something 
regarding the murder case.

39
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,040
You're not doing what 
I assigned you to do...

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,820
Reporting on the ladies?

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,300
Those two are tied up 
investigating the case.

42
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,670
There's nothing to report.

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,240
Not that, you punk.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,590
I told you to bring her fingerprint.

45
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,600
I'll get it for you soon. Don't worry.

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,950
Can I get that video right now?

47
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,140
I'll wait here then.

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,370
Thank you in advance.

49
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,430
Salute!

50
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,400
I think the car needs to be fixed.

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,110
Are you really okay?

52
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,260
I'm okay.

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,780
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,160
It's all my fault...

55
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,460
Jung Hee sunbae!

56
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,150
We should notify the 
police about today.

57
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,260
I'll see you at home then.

58
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,900
 I can't take photos 
with my phone? 

59
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,970
 No, no... 

60
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,450
Chief looks good on camera.

61
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,020
Is this the...

62
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,190
- behind-the-scenes footage?
- Yes.

63
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,800
That Manager Choi's 
also being investigated.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,250
Hold on a second.

65
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,180
That's all there is.

66
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,830
Lee Jung Hee giving her the glass.

67
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,880
Why is the clip so choppy?

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,380
He said he took cigarette breaks 
and went out for lunch.

69
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,580
Should we...

70
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,880
go and take photos?

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,530
Photos?

72
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,080
I saw them taking
 still cuts that day.

73
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
There might be something there.

74
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,460
 Profile pictures? 

75
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,930
The photographer taking photos 
at Director Seong's party, right?

76
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,470
I contacted her.

77
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,490
I asked her to make you
 look like movie stars.

78
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,030
So what did she say?

79
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,920
It's a bit pricey, but...

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,630
she agreed to make time for us.

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,190
How wonderful!

82
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,280
The price is not an issue 
if I look like a movie star.

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,070
Don't you think, Ms. Oh?

84
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,870
Why do I need profile pics at my age?

85
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,990
Don't worry. She said she'll make 
you look 10 years younger.

86
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,050
- 10 years?
- Let's go, Ms. Oh.

87
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,720
I'll pay for it.

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,370
No. I should pay for stuff like that.

89
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,120
This is so great!

90
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,950
I feel nervous now that we're here.

91
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,080
What are you nervous about?

92
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,470
Ms. Yang.

93
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,330
I saw your legs 
shaking on our way here.

94
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,980
Goodness, when did I ever?

95
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,650
Don't worry, that's why I 
brought these with me.

96
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,190
 Cheers! 

97
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,510
You're Yoo Jung, right?

98
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,100
I heard you took pictures...

99
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,560
at Jung Hee's housewarming party.

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Yes. I was hired for the still cuts.

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,350
Can I see the pics from that  day?

102
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,880
That's not for me to decide.

103
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,950
The actors have privacy rights.

104
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,400
I see.

105
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,120
Are you all ready?

106
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,290
Yes.

107
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,540
Eun Ji, won't you join us?

108
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,050
Then I'll be the only one
 who looks pretty.

109
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,010
True. If someone young joins us,

110
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,790
we'll look even older.

111
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,170
Shall we start?

112
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,530
Yes.

113
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,910
You guys are the 
center of the world.

114
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,680
Loosen up a bit.

115
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,030
Be confident.

116
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,590
It's okay.

117
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,420
Good.

118
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,470
Be seductive.

119
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,670
Let's do a few more of these.

120
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,580
- Is this okay? 
-  Two, three!

121
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,310
I like your expression.

122
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,470
Jung Hee, are you okay?

123
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,950
Lift your head this way.

124
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,480
- Okay. 
 - Look that way.

125
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,850
This is pretty.

126
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,890
Should I wear it?

127
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,860
Try looking elegant this time.

128
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,800
- Elegant? Be elegant?
- Yes.

129
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,190
Elegance.

130
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,460
Your facial expressions look good.

131
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,570
What's the heck?

132
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,970
What are you doing 
in an empty office?

133
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,690
I was so bored.

134
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,470
What are you doing? 
That's my phone.

135
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,690
You know you're invading 
my privacy, right?

136
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,470
Hey!

137
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,070
Give it to me. It's my cell phone.

138
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,340
If you value privacy, then

139
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,570
why barge into 
someone else's office?

140
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,510
What's going on, Oppa?

141
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,630
Ahjussi.

142
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,630
I'll have a look then give
 it back. Be quiet.

143
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,840
What is it?

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,280
It's nothing, Auntie. Let's go.

145
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,730
He confiscated your phone?

146
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,950
Don't worry.

147
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,970
I backed everything up
 on the cloud.

148
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,850
Cloud service.

149
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,630
Someone once said the more 
you know, the more you see.

150
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,820
Isn't this what you wanted to see?

151
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,840
Right?

152
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,540
Yes, this face.

153
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,890
 Tell me, Jung Hee. 

154
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,370
 What you saw that day. 

155
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,030
 Please tell me. 

156
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
When was this?

157
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
When she was with Bae Hee Jae.

158
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,720
You couldn't hear 
their conversation?

159
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,150
I tried to, but...

160
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,500
Ms. Yang wanted to talk to me.

161
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,170
 Geez, I look so ugly. 

162
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,780
You can only see half of my face.

163
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,310
Like Phantom of the Opera.

164
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,160
Do you remember what 
they were talking about?

165
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,390
Not sure. When was this?

166
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,990
When I went up to the second floor.

167
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,260
Oh, was it then?

168
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes, I remember.

169
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,310
This woman was talking
 badly about you.

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,860
Isn't it funny?

171
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,260
I don't know how that 
Ma Ji Won found out,

172
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,810
but she came and asked me 
what'd happened then.

173
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,960
So I told her that...

174
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,510
yes, I was there then.

175
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,560
But I have nothing tell her.

176
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,210
Jung Hee.

177
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,590
Are you okay?

178
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,750
Do you remember what they 
talked about before that?

179
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,260
That she got caught
 for something or etc.

180
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,220
What does that mean?

181
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,660
I don't know, Unni.

182
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,140
It was really loud there.

183
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,000
Is that...

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,190
related to Jung Hee's case?

185
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,620
Ms. Oh, you're here?

186
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,030
That's right. 
You were with me then.

187
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,270
Ms. Oh, did you 
overhear anything?

188
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,680
When they up met in Thailand,

189
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,200
she apparently had the German flu.

190
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,850
- A flu?
- Yeah.

191
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,850
She had headaches and rashes, so

192
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,210
she met Jung Hee 
with a lot of makeup on.

193
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,610
Aigoo, she's a bit dense.

194
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,860
- Isn't she?
- Yes.

195
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,040
That's not the flu.

196
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,900
It's also called the 
German measles.

197
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,430
Yes, I think so.

198
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,440
German measles?

199
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,830
It's rubella.

200
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,330
- Rubella?
- Yes.

201
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,260
Bae Hee Jae had...

202
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,300
rubella then.

203
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,640
It's all done.

204
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,630
Okay. Good job.

205
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,850
 

206
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,740
Jung Hee!

207
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,740
Unni, you're here.

208
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,770
And Oppa's here, too.

209
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,350
Sawadikap.

210
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,700
Why, you little...

211
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,940
You look so radiant 
today, just radiant.

212
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,780
 She had rubella, but didn't take it seriously 
since she thought it was the flu. 

213
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,480
 Rubella doesn't have 
extreme symptoms. 

214
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,060
But rubella's highly contagious

215
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,680
and very dangerous 
for pregnant women.

216
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,580
You can have a deformed child,

217
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,510
or in the worst case...

218
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,960
you might lose the child.

219
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,840
You're right.

220
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,720
But was Lee Jung Hee pregnant?

221
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,710
She was three months pregnant 
when she filmed The Shaman.

222
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,330
Since the Thailand shoot 
was two months prior,

223
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,880
she was probably pregnant then.

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,480
That's when she contracted it.

225
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,490
She knew the baby was ill, 
but she didn't know it was rubella.

226
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,020
Rubella doesn't exist
 in Korea anymore.

227
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,730
What about the baby?

228
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,600
 That's the point. 

229
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,480
 She did something 
bad to the baby. 

230
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,340
I'm sorry to say, 
but she had it coming.

231
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,520
She dissolved an adoption 
because she got pregnant.

232
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,010
That probably added to her trauma.

233
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,490
The guilt from that probably...

234
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,720
made the pain of losing her baby...

235
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,780
that much worse.

236
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,840
Jung Hee didn't know.

237
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,150
Why the fortune of...

238
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,430
shooting a film with a loved one

239
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,940
and finally getting pregnant...

240
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,720
had become...

241
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,020
a curse all of a sudden.

242
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,900
And that day...

243
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,840
she found about everything.

244
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,470
What did you just say?

245
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,000
German measles?

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,990
No.

247
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,460
It's the German flu.

248
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,650
Isn't that funny?

249
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,140
I've never been to Germany.

250
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,920
How did I get the German flu?

251
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,430
Is that...

252
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,660
what you had back then?

253
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,870
When we met in Thailand?

254
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,460
Don't worry. I met you 
when I was almost well.

255
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,890
By the way,

256
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:43,090
did I tell you that I met 
Ma Ji Won before coming here?

257
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,650
She asked me about your 
"The Shaman" shoot nine years ago.

258
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,260
I'll be home early a.m. 
because of the shoot.

259
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,190
Where's Mal Koo?

260
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,540
He'll be here  soon.

261
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,020
There was a problem with the car.

262
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,900
Are you okay?

263
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,440
Yes.

264
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,200
 

265
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,640
 I'll pay you in person. 

266
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,700
 Where should I meet you? 

267
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,640
Aren't you going to the set?

268
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,530
They're shooting until early a.m.

269
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,650
I don't care about the shoot.

270
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,120
You need to pay me a little earlier.

271
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,970
I'm to pay you after 
the filming wraps up.

272
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,160
Then I have a question.

273
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,430
What if the film gets canceled?

274
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,160
Am I not getting paid then?

275
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,390
You got the threat call, right?

276
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,140
It was Park Myung Hee's doing.

277
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,040
She'd seen what 
Lee Jung Hee did, too.

278
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,910
Let go of me!

279
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,010
Even a passing dog would 
notice and want a piece.

280
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,110
"I saw it, too. I saw it, too!"

281
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,740
We already looked through it.

282
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,780
I'm sure no one else saw it.

283
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,850
But I don't understand.

284
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,290
Why keep defending Lee Jung Hee?

285
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,170
Is she your mom or something?

286
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,860
Anyway, Lee Jung Hee will be 
revealed as Bae Hee Jae's killer.

287
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,320
Then the movie's finished

288
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,620
and I'd be finished with you.

289
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,460
Then I won't get my money!

290
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,100
No.

291
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,480
The movie will be made.

292
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,160
You saw what Director 
Seong did for his wife.

293
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,250
You think it was Director Seong...

294
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,700
who killed Park Myung Hee?

295
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,780
No way.

296
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,400
That's why...

297
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,850
you'd better bring me 
the money this week.

298
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,490
Unless you want to 
join Park Myung Hee.

299
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,980
Then...

300
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,470
did Lee Jung Hee also kill 
Park Myung Hee?

301
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,130
I mean, think about it.

302
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,080
Lee Jung Hee received 
Park Myung Hee's threat calls, too.

303
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,590
Isn't that why she killed her?

304
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,560
I understand she killed 
Bae Hee Jae impulsively.

305
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,020
But would she do that Myung Hee?

306
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,150
Who else is there
 besides Lee Jung Hee?

307
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,680
They hushed the witness.

308
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,500
It's most likely someone who 
knew what Jung Hee had done.

309
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,130
Director Seong.

310
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,420
Park Myung Hee.

311
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,960
Does anyone else know?

312
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,470
I don't know.

313
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,280
But that person...

314
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,660
definitely did it with 
a clear purpose.

315
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,060
Either they wanted to 
cover up the crime,

316
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,850
or they had a different goal.

317
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,860
Ms. Jung.

318
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,870
Do you need a ride?

319
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,970
 I can't imagine those two together. 

320
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,550
Either they wanted to 
cover up the crime,

321
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,740
or they had a different goal.

322
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,970
You think so too?

323
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,450
What are you talking about now?

324
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,030
Yes.

325
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,730
Those two...

326
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,420
don't go together at all.

327
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,830
Tell me again. 
Who gave you this order?

328
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,970
I told you already, 
it was Manager Choi.

329
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,330
The manager of the film crew.

330
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,750
This is Ko Mal Koo.

331
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,130
Where's Manager 
Choi Jong Chul right now?

332
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,140
Yes.

333
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,140
At the studio?

334
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,790
Okay.

335
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,050
If you lied to me, 
I'll send you to hell.

336
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,620
Yes, of course.

337
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,140
Geez, seriously.

338
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,660
  
 

339
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,630
Why did you come?

340
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,100
Was it you who...

341
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,720
I told you not to come.

342
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,710
I told you to go back, Mom!

343
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,380
♫  Do you know now  ♫

344
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,230
♫  With you  ♫

345
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,410
♫  Far far away  ♫
