1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,770
- I'm so nervous.
- I know.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,070
- This way.
- Okay.

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,700
It feels stuffy. Can we 
draw the curtain?

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,580
It should be dark when the 
mafias work at night.

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,170
Where's Woo Joon?

6
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,910
Woo Joon?

7
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,240
He's doing homework with 
Sung Eun in the small room.

8
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,070
Can I see him for a second?

9
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,720
Please make it quick.

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,940
The game is starting soon.

11
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,770
I guess Sung Eun is 
close with Woo Joon.

12
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,020
No.

13
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,370
Well, what I meant was...

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,640
I heard they're close since

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,680
Sung Eun doesn't have a dad, either.

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,180
You don't even say hi to me anymore?

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,360
What are you doing here, Ahjumma?

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,160
I came because I heard you'd be here.

19
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,850
I have something to tell you.

20
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,820
I...

21
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,490
came here to say goodbye.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,350
Are you going somewhere?

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,470
There's something I must do.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,970
What is it?

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,270
I wish that...

26
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,760
there'll be an opportunity 
to tell you later.

27
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,570
I have a favor to ask of you.

28
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,290
Eat well and...

29
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,600
don't get sick.

30
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,170
Okay?

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,170
Can I hug you just once?

32
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,700
No.

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,610
Yes.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,950
I was too much, right?

35
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,360
 Weren't you with Woo Joon? 

36
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,620
 I stepped out real quick 
because it was stuffy. 

37
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,240
Ahjumma, what are you doing?

38
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,480
You're Sung Eun, right?

39
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,570
Do you want to finish your 
homework with Woo Joon?

40
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Please tell my auntie that

41
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,140
we want to play 
the Mafia Game, too.

42
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,290
Okay?

43
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,810
Yes, I will.

44
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,730
So Unni, have you 
played this game before?

45
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,080
This?

46
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,970
Many times...

47
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,480
a long time ago.

48
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,290
It's starting at 8 o'clock, right?

49
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,710
We have 10 minutes left.

50
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,480
Would you like another beverage?

51
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,750
Maybe I will.

52
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,860
 

53
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,460
Hello?

54
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,490
You should've told me 
before you came.

55
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,120
You should've answered 
your phone then.

56
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,320
What are you doing just barging in?

57
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,510
 I'm sorry.  
Sorry.

58
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,030
Anyway, I'm busy right now.

59
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,880
Let's talk tomorrow in person.

60
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,630
Who was it?

61
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,990
It's just someone.

62
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,790
By the way, Unni.

63
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,800
Is it true you put the 
house up for sale?

64
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
The house?

65
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm planning on staying forever.

66
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,540
Why would I sell the house?

67
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,140
Right?

68
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,390
That's enough chatting.

69
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,520
Ms. Ma, you turn in your phone, too.

70
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
Everyone knows how to play, right?

71
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,610
Okay.

72
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,900
When it's daytime, 
we put our heads together

73
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,920
and kill the one suspected 
of being the mafia.

74
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,190
During nighttime, everyone 
put your heads down.

75
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,480
But the mafia will get up discreetly,

76
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,400
and they'll kill an innocent civilian.

77
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,320
How do we determine the winner?

78
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,900
If the mafia wins, the town 
she belongs to wins.

79
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,650
If civilians win,

80
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,980
the town with more power left will win.

81
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,010
At 8 o'clock sharp,

82
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,350
we'll pick the mafia 
when the lights turn off.

83
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,350
Please stay alert.

84
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,690
Five minutes left now.

85
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,120
Did we start already?

86
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,850
Chief, it's not 8 o'clock yet.

87
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,420
Timeout! I'm not ready to start yet.

88
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,200
Please turn the lights on!

89
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh my! Aigoo, aigoo.

90
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,680
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

91
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
Don't move! Put your hands up!

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,210
I told you not to move!

93
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,510
- Lights! How do you turn them on?
- I think we have a blackout!

94
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,770
Where's the fuse box? The fuse box?

95
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,550
Try locating our cell phones!

96
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,760
The cell phones!

97
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,690
Hang on!

98
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,460
Ja Yeon!

99
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,700
- What, what's wrong? 
 - Why? What's going on?

100
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,800
Am I...

101
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,840
okay?

102
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,690
Chief!

103
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,860
What is it?

104
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,220
You said that...

105
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,220
she was conspired against, right?

106
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,920
Actually...

107
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,960
I don't know the details either.

108
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,460
It's something I overheard from 
the people I used to know.

109
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,760
Lee Jung Hee, who 
passed away recently

110
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,860
was the only witness of the incident.

111
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,590
She was?

112
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,840
Yes.

113
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,560
And before Lee Jung Hee died...

114
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,860
some people had shown up...

115
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,570
targeting her life.

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,630
The plot you mentioned...

117
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,950
I thought it may actually exist.

118
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,250
Did Lee Jung Hee have 
any final words?

119
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,690
Any info about the killer or 
what they look like.

120
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,370
She said she may have 
seen them on TV.

121
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,610
By any chance...

122
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,200
did she say...

123
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,540
the killer was a woman?

124
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,380
Yes.

125
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,450
I heard it, too.

126
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,830
Since the actress is dead, we'll now 
catch the rabbit that got away.

127
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,290
There's a good hunting dog for this job.

128
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,320
Yes.

129
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,250
Don't worry.

130
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,330
Did she really say it was a woman?

131
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,450
Yes.

132
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,410
Someone popped in your mind, right?

133
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,810
Who is it?

134
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,580
If you promise me something...

135
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,650
I'll tell you who I'm thinking  of.

136
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,600
What do you mean, a "promise"?

137
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,250
Please take Woo Joon in.

138
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,350
This again?

139
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,440
If my guess is correct,

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,500
the moment I say her name...

141
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,970
my life will be in danger.

142
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,310
What are you talking about?

143
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,370
I don't care what happens to me.

144
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,660
But...

145
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,830
I'm worried about Woo Joon.

146
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,090
Ms. Ma, I'm begging you.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm not in a situation 
to take Woo Joon in.

149
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,320
And even if I was...

150
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,710
I don't want something from you 
for taking Woo Joon in.

151
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,830
Ms. Ma!

152
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,670
If you're worried about Woo Joon, 
then you should see him.

153
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,350
I'll never forgive you, but...

154
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,710
I think Woo Joon is...

155
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,410
ready to forgive you.

156
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,020
Woo Joon is?

157
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,090
By the way, what brings 
you all the way here?

158
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,910
I'm here for a case 
and just stopped by.

159
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,890
Chief is doing well, right?

160
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,680
He's been waiting to 
see you, Prosecutor Yang.

161
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,000
What's going on?

162
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,960
Was I mistaken?

163
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,950
Did you see someone you know?

164
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,280
No, it's nothing.

165
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,550
Let's go in for now.

166
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,170
Look at you. How embarrassing.

167
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,140
Prosecutor Yang, 
what are you doing here?

168
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,080
I had some business around here.

169
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,720
What are you doing? Have a seat.

170
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,160
Aigoo.

171
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,390
At this rate, you'll have your 
70th birthday party in jail.

172
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,180
Your oldest's name Eun Young, right?

173
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,500
The one in the U.S.

174
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,920
Does she visit sometimes?

175
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,030
No.

176
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,840
What a rude girl.

177
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,010
Even if she doesn't want to,

178
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,540
she should visit if 
her dad is in this state.

179
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,340
Aigoo, seriously.

180
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,800
How about the youngest one?

181
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,530
Did you get to see Woo Joon?

182
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,770
So no one visits you?

183
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,440
You don't have any relatives either.

184
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,660
But I guess that's a good thing.

185
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,850
There isn't anyone I want to see.

186
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,200
Really?

187
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,010
No one visits me...

188
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,060
except my lawyer.

189
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,320
Sunbae.

190
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,340
If you lie...

191
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,700
I'll kill you.

192
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,250
It was an accidental firing?

193
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,730
Yes.

194
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,670
He came to rob the house,

195
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,160
then got scared when
 he saw my face.

196
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,670
I don't know if it's your 
skill or charm that

197
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,260
makes you wrong all the time.

198
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,880
That's hurtful. What 
do you mean by that?

199
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,710
This is...

200
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,050
definitely a murder case.

201
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,440
The culprit was...

202
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,420
What was the name
 of the deceased?

203
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,600
An Sung Tae.

204
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,210
An Sung Tae.

205
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,640
The culprit...

206
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,460
planned this out to 
kill An Sung Tae.

207
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,430
This was a premeditated murder?

208
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,720
And the culprit...

209
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,240
was one of the participants 
of the Mafia Game.

210
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,930
And what makes you so 
confident about that?

211
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,580
Think about it.

212
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,840
On which hand An Sung Tae was...

213
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,630
holding the gun.

214
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm not sure.

215
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,070
It was in his left hand. Left hand!

216
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,810
 An Sung Tae was right-handed. 

217
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,420
But the culprit didn't have 
time to consider that.

218
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,410
In trying to make 
it look like a suicide,

219
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,230
they made a mistake.

220
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,380
But he could've been 
left-handed. Left-handed!

221
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,560
You know that...

222
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,280
only 10% are left-handed.

223
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,610
You're only...

224
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,350
focusing on the 10%, and

225
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,960
ignoring a wrongful murder.

226
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,720
He was murdered 
by the 90% chance.

227
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,920
Writing must be done...

228
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,260
while surrounded by people.

229
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,780
Whether it's trash or a masterpiece,

230
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,510
it's a story about the people.

231
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,110
Of course I couldn't write when...

232
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,930
I was secluded on a beach.

233
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,400
He's totally my type.

234
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,490
He looks well-built.

235
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,800
Mal Koo?

236
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,260
I'm sorry, but could you 
make some time?

237
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,040
Time for what?

238
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,070
CEO really wants to see you.

239
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,820
Oh. CEO Jang?

240
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,010
When would be a good time?

241
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,760
Right now?

242
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,540
You must be busy. 
Thanks for making the time.

243
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,420
Don't mention it.

244
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,300
I have a favor to ask you before I die.

245
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,570
Tell me, Sir.

246
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,850
Well, what I mentioned last time...

247
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,880
Ms. Ma?

248
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,450
Sir, I'm over here.

249
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,330
Mal Koo.

250
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,950
- I...
- Are you okay?

251
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,920
CEO!

252
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,250
I understand.

253
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,660
What was the favor
 he'd wanted to ask me?

254
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,660
You don't know? Fine then.

255
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,970
Ms. Ma.

256
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,790
Whatever it is...

257
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,240
please turn down the CEO's request.

258
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,980
Otherwise, you'll be in danger.

259
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,590
I don't really know 
what you're trying to do.

260
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,560
But if you meet those people,

261
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,350
even you won't be safe.

262
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,470
Mal Koo, are you...

263
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,730
worrying about me right now?

264
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,480
Please do me this favor.

265
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,950
They're not to be messed with.

266
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't care what 
you do after I leave.

267
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,310
But until then, please 
focus on your writing here.

268
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,260
I humbly ask of you, Ms. Ma.

269
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,800
Do you have a smaller
 chest than me?

270
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,060
Well, it'll be nice and roomy.

271
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,150
Hold this. Right now.

272
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,120
What are you doing?

273
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,720
I have a suggestion.

274
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,210
You said you'll leave this place,

275
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,370
but you must feel 
uncomfortable with me here.

276
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,790
So I was thinking...

277
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,640
do you want to make a bet?

278
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,060
What do you mean, a bet?

279
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,900
If I lose...

280
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,520
I'll disappear from your sight.

281
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,250
But if I win...

282
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,100
You already said that...

283
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,890
you'll disappear, so forget that.

284
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,930
The house you're currently living in...

285
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,610
Why don't you give that to me?

286
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,390
It's already under my name, anyway.

287
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,040
I don't know what you mean. 
Why should I do that?

288
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Then how about this?

289
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,080
I'll send this to 
broadcasting companies

290
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,000
post it on social media,

291
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,700
and spread it all over Rainbow Town.

292
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,760
Should I take this to the police too?

293
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,110
Ms. Ma.

294
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,270
Are you willing to bet now?

295
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,770
What bet do you want
 to make anyway?

296
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,830
An Sung Tae was murdered yesterday.

297
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,240
How funny.

298
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,530
There was supposed to be a
 murder, and someone really died.

299
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,810
By any chance, was it in that house?

300
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,480
Yes, in that house.

301
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,710
It was right after you left.

302
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,020
What about Woo Joon?

303
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,750
Is he okay?

304
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,100
He's okay, don't worry.

305
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,830
But that incident...

306
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,270
was definitely a murder.

307
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,120
Also, the killer...

308
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,700
is one of the people in the house.

309
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,810
But why?

310
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,320
If not, how could 
Ahn Sung Tae have come in?

311
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,340
The only way in is the main entrance.

312
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,930
This bet is about...

313
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,460
finding who the killer is?

314
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,170
That's it.

315
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,390
"Catch the killer."

316
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,900
Not as a game, but for real.

317
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,920
We'll bet on which one of us will...

318
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,930
catch the killer first.

319
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,890
Doesn't that sound interesting?

320
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,460
We'll go out once a day.

321
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,540
And we share with each other 
the info we gather.

322
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,140
Oh, that's right.

323
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,210
Wear this when you go out.

324
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,550
If people notice us,

325
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,170
we should be wearing
 the same outfit.

326
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,850
Hello?

327
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,520
 I'm Choi Man Shik's attorney. 

328
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,270
I was going to call you 
regarding Woo Joon.

329
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,840
- Could you please bring Woo Joon...
 - Ms. Ma. 

330
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,120
 Choi Man Shik... 

331
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,680
 Choi Man Shik passed away. 

332
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,330
Woo Joon!

333
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,690
Writer Ma Ji Won.

334
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,300
I saw Choi Man Shik this morning.

335
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,350
He was fine then. What happened...

336
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,100
I don't know exactly 
what happened either.

337
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,200
I wanted to see you 
regarding the guardianship.

338
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,390
In his will, Choi Man Shik...

339
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,390
had appointed you as 
Woo Joon's guardian.

340
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,830
Me?

341
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,920
What about Woo Joon's sister?

342
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,650
Yes, there's Eun Young, but...

343
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,710
Anyhow, that's what it says on his will.

344
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,720
Regarding this matter...

345
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,350
Eun Young's attorney will contact you.

346
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,950
They'll inform you the details.

347
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,420
And what about you?

348
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,550
I'll close my office and leave
 the country  for a while.

349
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,160
You should  be cautious as well.

350
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,750
I think something scary...

351
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,270
happened to Choi Man Shik.

352
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,980
Yes, that...

353
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,120
Officer Bae asked me 
why you can't be reached.

354
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,310
I just came back from Daejeon.

355
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Jang Chul Min is the culprit.

356
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,450
And Lee Jung Hee did see a woman.

357
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,030
What are you talking about?

358
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,090
Your husband...

359
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,080
has an accomplice.

360
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,630
And Lee Jung Hee saw that woman.

361
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,980
My husband...

362
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,530
has an accomplice?

363
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,030
What's this?

364
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,430
Auntie.

365
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,560
We need you to come with us.

366
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,040
Ms. Ma Ji Won.

367
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,500
♫  Even if I fall, round and 
round and round  ♫

368
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,100
♫  Even if I disappear, 
run and run and over  ♫
