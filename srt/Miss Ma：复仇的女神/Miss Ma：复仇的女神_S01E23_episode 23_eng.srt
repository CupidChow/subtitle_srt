1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,620
Why must I do that?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,080
Seriously...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
You deserve an Oscar 
for Best Actress.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,190
What is this?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,960
Well, the thing is...

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,330
You people! You've done this before.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,270
You can't do this again!

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,270
Why do this all of a sudden?

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,140
Let's take her to Daejeon for now.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,540
Let the chiefs worry 
about the jurisdiction.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,010
Okay, okay, okay.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,530
But this is my jurisdiction. 
I'll handle this, okay?

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,430
Ms. Ma.

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,120
You trust me, right?

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,610
It's not like we met yesterday.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,700
Let's just get this over with.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,490
They cuffed me without a warrant, and

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,070
dragged me all the way here.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,350
This...

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,010
is clearly illegal.

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,480
Now you want me to 
verify my fingerprints?

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,660
The times have changed.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,150
You arrested an innocent civilian and

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,200
want to verify fingerprints?

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,020
But you're not a fugitive.

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,180
Of course not.

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,670
But this happened twice already.

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,540
This is way out of line.

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,450
Hey, hey. There's no need to be fussy.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,540
We have her fingerprints here.

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,000
This is the water bottle you drank
 at the police station earlier.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,210
How did that end up here?

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,450
That's because...

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,340
someone brought it here, that's why.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
- You really handed that in?
- Eun Ji.

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
- There's a reason for it.
- Have you...

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,060
been suspecting my aunt?

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,380
You used to eavesdrop 
on her. Is that why?

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,340
You thought Auntie was the fugitive?

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,550
- Hey, Seo Eun Ji.
- If not, explain yourself.

41
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,180
Why did you do such a thing?

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,910
You really don't know?

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,120
Answer your phone.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,060
 

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,330
Is that  true, Sir?

46
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,920
I guess this is why you live and learn.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,840
I have no idea what's going on.

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,720
If I could see, I would've 
been like that, too.

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,760
But the person who came
 today wasn't Ma Ji Won.

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,830
Then...

51
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,450
Yes.

52
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,230
The real Ms. Ma.

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,460
That Ma Ji Won was here.

54
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,540
Hey.

55
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,020
Why did Officer Bae give you this?

56
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
It just happened, Hyungnim.

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,420
Seriously, you bastards...

58
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,290
I was at the Forensic Science Dept. 
We'll get the results soon.

59
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,160
 

60
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,720
What?

61
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,050
Are you disappointed they don't match?

62
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,600
Auntie?

63
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,180
 - Are you okay? 
- What's going on?

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,160
What are you doing?

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,010
Who was that?

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,090
If the person inside is Ma Ji Won,

67
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,940
who did you just call "Auntie"?

68
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,850
 What a f***ing disaster. 

69
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,560
What are you doing? 
Remove the handcuffs!

70
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,780
You people.

71
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,490
I'm not letting it go this time.

72
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,290
Not just once, either.

73
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,310
I won't take how you keep

74
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,480
insulting Ms. Ma.
 Do you understand?

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,980
Aigoo, Chief. You're really something.

76
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,420
What do you mean?

77
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,880
You know what?

78
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,890
You're worse than them...

79
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,090
for testing me like this.

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,040
What do you mean I "tested" you?

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,860
You say "do you trust me?" to my face.

82
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,870
but you took my fingerprints secretly...

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,300
so you could arrest me right away.

84
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,230
That's not it, but...

85
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,090
And the detectives.

86
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,190
You wanted to see my
 fingerprints, right?

87
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,140
And this is a bonus.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,100
Yes.

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,540
I know you didn't become the police...

90
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,970
to protect civilians and...

91
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,380
to catch the bad guys.

92
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,390
It's a secure job and...

93
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,570
a powerful public official.

94
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,750
It's a job you secured...

95
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,700
by studying hard.

96
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,100
I...

97
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,860
don't expect you guys to...

98
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,640
have a sense of justice.

99
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,960
But still,

100
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,140
don't make an innocent 
person into a criminal.

101
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,550
You punks live off of my tax money...

102
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,300
yet you're framing me.

103
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,000
How can I live with this mortification?

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't worry about your aunt.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,820
As you know, I'm not an officer 
with a sense of justice.

106
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,080
Why did you follow 
Inspector Park's orders?

107
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,820
If not, he would've made 
someone else do it.

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,090
I thought it'd be better to do it myself.

109
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,140
Why?

110
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,390
I wonder.

111
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,370
If I knew we'd get this 
awkward, I would've said no.

112
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,080
Are you okay?

113
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,610
How funny.

114
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,960
Seeing you here makes me...

115
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,310
feel strangely glad.

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,250
Yes.

117
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,470
I'm strangely glad to see you, too.

118
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,910
I knew there was something off.

119
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,080
Pardon?

120
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,460
Nothing. Just confirm it first.

121
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,770
- What about you?
- I'll wait and see.

122
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,560
Do you still think that 
crazy b**** is here?

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,800
Where the needle goes, 
the thread will follow.

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,180
The fact that Seo Eun Ji is here

125
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,840
probably means...

126
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,610
that woman's still around.

127
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,230
Min Seo's dad has an accomplice?

128
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,230
The woman Lee Jung Hee saw...

129
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,460
was that accomplice.

130
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,900
That's why...

131
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,350
your husband had a clear alibi, too.

132
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,670
No.

133
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,720
- Auntie.
- I told you that...

134
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,760
Min Seo's dad cared about 
Min Seo more than I did.

135
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,950
He'd never do something like that.

136
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,650
Then let me ask you something.

137
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,080
Auntie,

138
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,650
did you see Min Seo's corpse?

139
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
- What do you think?
 - In person?

140
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,740
Yes.

141
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,180
I saw it with my own eyes.

142
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,860
Then let me ask you something.

143
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,230
When you first got here...

144
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,490
you said you'll find Min Seo's killer.

145
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,800
What's the reason? Answer me.

146
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,860
Because of my sister.

147
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,980
Your sister?

148
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,820
That bastard...

149
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,030
No.

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,170
That b****...

151
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,550
killed my sister.

152
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,590
They didn't match?

153
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,460
Are you sure?

154
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,770
 Yes. The fingerprints 
were totally different. 

155
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,170
I think she really is Ma Ji Won.

156
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,380
What about Han Tae Kyu?

157
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,570
He still sees Ma Ji Won
 as that crazy b****.

158
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,800
 What should I do? 

159
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,510
Okay.

160
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,260
I'll leave it up to you.

161
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,160
Okay.

162
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,580
We'll send a team...

163
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,100
to Daeheung Corporation
 within this week.

164
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,410
Right now?

165
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,990
I'm meeting the mayor today.

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,860
Okay.

167
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,100
Honey.

168
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,550
Honey...

169
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,990
I'm here to ask you something.

170
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,700
After that incident...

171
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,190
you saw Min Seo's corpse, right?

172
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,530
I was so scared then.

173
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,170
So I couldn't see Min Seo's face.

174
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,640
 Could you confirm
 if it's your daughter? 

175
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,730
You saw her, right?

176
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,760
Was it Min Seo?

177
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,650
Yes.

178
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,450
It was Min Seo.

179
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,140
But why do you ask?

180
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,450
It's nothing.

181
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,500
I checked in case.

182
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,130
In case?

183
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,410
For a moment...

184
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,540
I thought that Min Seo might be alive.

185
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,790
I think I should go.

186
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,220
To where?

187
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,210
Do you have a place to sleep?

188
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,800
Do you eat well?

189
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,350
I'll call you soon.

190
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,650
I may really need your help then.

191
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,200
Ask me anything.

192
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,560
I'll do whatever it is you want.

193
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,220
We're almost there.

194
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,100
If I find that woman 
who killed Min Seo...

195
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,640
I'll keep that promise...

196
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,550
which I made to you then.

197
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,310
I'm sorry I was mean to you.

198
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,950
It'd be so nice if I...

199
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,100
could make it up to you.

200
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,340
Whether it's hard or 
whatever the f*** it is,

201
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,760
see you at Do Ja Yeon's house, Chief.

202
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,040
"For what"?

203
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,610
We must investigate the murder.

204
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,020
I'm hanging up now!

205
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,130
Who are you?

206
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,730
I'm Choi Eun Young.

207
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,410
Woo Joon's sister.

208
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,910
Woo Joon?

209
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,370
Oh!

210
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,740
Geez, what a sad life.

211
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,450
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,500
I have nothing to offer you.

213
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,070
So have you thought about it?

214
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,800
What do you mean?

215
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,680
My father chose you as 
Woo Joon's guardian.

216
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,860
- Haven't you heard?
- Oh, that?

217
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,770
I'm sorry, but I can't.

218
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,010
I'm not in a situation to 
take care of a child.

219
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,260
You're just as I've heard.

220
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,620
I thought you may change your 
mind due to the inheritance.

221
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,260
Inheritance?

222
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,450
If the house sells, it may not be 
enough for Woo Joon's share,

223
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,650
but it'll be at least 2 billion won.

224
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,140
2 billion won?

225
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,570
In the end...

226
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,610
Lee Jung Hee used...

227
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,090
the poison she had...

228
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,850
to commit suicide.

229
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,690
But...

230
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,640
why didn't Lee Jung Hee drink the 
poison her husband gave her?

231
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,190
It was her final consideration
 to protect her husband.

232
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,680
Her final...

233
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,250
consideration.

234
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,010
Geez, they're trying too hard.

235
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,920
I heard that...

236
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,130
you went to the police station.

237
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,450
I did.

238
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,610
But honestly...

239
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,460
I'm not interested in what you've done.

240
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,970
Whether you killed your child 
or escaped from prison...

241
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,030
it doesn't concern me.

242
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,760
I just find the police ridiculous for...

243
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,380
wasting their time.

244
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,850
What is it that you want?

245
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,340
What do I want?

246
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,540
To make a lot of money, and...

247
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,550
to date a really cool guy, too.

248
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,470
But what I want the most is...

249
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,180
this one thing.

250
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,690
Conviction.

251
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,340
You probably don't know...

252
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,790
what type of fear I've been living in.

253
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,630
"Do I have talent as a writer?"

254
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,290
Or was it a coincidence 
that my first book was a hit?

255
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,130
Before I die...

256
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,780
would I ever write a book that could...

257
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,190
take the world by surprise?

258
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,040
I think you definitely have the talent.

259
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,110
I don't need your flattery.

260
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,440
I need conviction. 
A conviction regarding my talent.

261
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,570
How would you confirm that?

262
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,100
That's why I suggested a bet.

263
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,860
You mean, An Sung Tae's case?

264
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,520
If we find the culprit, 
things will be clear.

265
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,940
If I find them,

266
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,920
I'll know that I truly have the talent.

267
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,260
But if I don't...

268
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
it means that I'm not talented.

269
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,730
I'll go to the crime scene.

270
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,790
Oh, by the way...

271
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,780
I met Woo Joon's sister 
in front of  the house.

272
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,680
What was it about?

273
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,800
She asked me to take the child in.

274
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,980
- You turned it down, right?
- No.

275
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,750
I'm a very compassionate person.

276
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,220
 You're taking Woo Joon in? 

277
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,000
It wasn't my decision.

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,980
 Then? 

279
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,360
 Was it that woman again? 

280
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,340
I'll talk to Woo Joon's sister again.

281
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,390
 It's already too late. 

282
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,450
Woo Joon's sister went
 back to the U.S.

283
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,430
What?

284
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,550
Then what about Woo Joon?

285
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,950
He's with me for now.

286
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,760
What?

287
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,180
Woo Joon.

288
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,260
Ahjumma, where are you?

289
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,990
Tell me.

290
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,600
Why did you agree?

291
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,420
You said you're going far away.

292
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,610
The thing is, Woo Joon...

293
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,940
Why did you say you'll take me in?

294
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm so sorry.

295
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,630
I think I was wrong.

296
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,380
Wrong about what?

297
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,340
About taking me in?

298
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,090
Yes.

299
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,650
You should live with your sister.

300
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,290
I'll decide who to live with.

301
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,600
Don't tell me what to do.

302
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,490
Woo Joon!

303
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,830
Noona, can't you live with me?

304
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,140
Forget it.

305
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,150
Then how about this?

306
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,680
For today...

307
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,860
you stay at Mal Koo's place with me.

308
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,150
Let's worry about tomorrow then, right?

309
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,270
An Sung Tae was indeed left-handed.

310
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,140
So this was a misfiring.

311
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,480
I think you were wrong this time.

312
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,590
This was a murder. Stop 
talking and follow me.

313
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,500
- Ms. Ma...
- Otherwise,

314
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,990
the fact that you cuffed 
an innocent person...

315
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,680
I'll go ahead and tell...

316
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,340
the whole neighborhood.

317
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,200
How about the gun?

318
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,110
Where was it from?

319
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,150
I'm looking into it.

320
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,480
Did you get testimonies from 
everyone at the scene?

321
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
Testimonies?

322
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,790
Of course, I did.

323
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,200
So this was when...

324
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,640
the lights were all still on.

325
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,380
I was looking at the clock from here.

326
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,320
I was going to head
 to the sofa at 7:55.

327
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,500
I was sitting on the sofa 
the whole time.

328
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,880
I was also sitting on the sofa 
the entire time with Ms. Yang.

329
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,790
Me too, Chief.

330
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,190
The same for me, too.

331
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,880
What about Jo Hye Jin?

332
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,660
I was planning to go outside
 since I'm not playing the game.

333
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,100
We were looking at
 the clock from here.

334
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,940
But after the lights shut off...

335
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,520
Did we start already?

336
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,400
Chief, it's not 8 o'clock yet.

337
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,530
- What's wrong with the lights?
- Time, timeout!

338
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,980
I'm not ready to start yet!

339
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,380
- Turn the lights on!
- Yes, I'll look.

340
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,300
- Oh my!
- Ms. Cha, are you okay?

341
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,770
- Ow!
- This is against the rules!

342
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,690
If you move, I'll shoot!

343
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,440
Stay still.

344
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,890
- Who's this?
- I told you not to move!

345
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,930
Do Ja Hyun got shot and 
collapsed over there.

346
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,850
The preservation of this crime scene?

347
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,550
It's the same as it was then.

348
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,090
It was a murder?

349
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,240
You seem surprised.

350
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,400
Didn't you say it was a misfiring?

351
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,470
Is there a reason you'd 
want it to be an accident?

352
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,750
Why would I?

353
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,290
She's taken aback.

354
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,050
Se Yeon's  a victim who got shot!

355
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,100
Are you suspecting her right now?

356
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,430
Lee Jung Hee also 
played a victim so that

357
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,840
she wouldn't be a suspect.

358
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,410
Also, that Mafia Game.

359
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,060
I heard it was your suggestion.

360
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,430
Tell me.

361
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,020
Any reason you don't 
want this to be a murder?

362
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,460
Se Yeon.

363
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,420
Let's tell them.

364
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,060
You keep calling her Se Yeon.

365
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,070
- Who is that?
- I, I did?

366
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,570
Se Yeon is my sister who 
died from thyroid cancer.

367
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,330
Right.

368
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,200
I was close with her, 
so I get confused at times.

369
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,230
I'm sorry, Ja Yeon.

370
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,180
It's okay.

371
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,200
Follow me.

372
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,950
Things have gotten this far, 
so I can't hide it anymore.

373
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,790
This here is Miura Hisawa.

374
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,440
Miura?

375
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,750
You mean Miura of
 Japan's Miura Capital?

376
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,430
- You know him?
- Of course!

377
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,320
All the money in Japan goes through him.
 He's one of the biggest moguls.

378
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,420
He's a Korean-Japanese, right?

379
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,790
He's someone I worked for a long time.

380
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,930
His Korean name is Kim Joon Il.

381
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,440
He passed away a few years ago, right?

382
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,710
He had cancer.

383
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,380
He was still so young.

384
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,390
What does that have to do with you?

385
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,620
I was his secretary when he 
started the business.

386
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,510
I was a secretary,

387
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,320
but I was also a 
business partner at first.

388
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,440
I see. That's why you have all this...

389
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,090
But recently, I heard something 
shocking from his wife.

390
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,350
I heard she was ill, too.

391
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,520
Yes.

392
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,900
According to her...

393
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,940
if she passes away,

394
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,150
then I'll be the heir 
of their inheritance.

395
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,750
Of course,

396
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,290
I must be alive before Madam 
passes away. That's the clause.

397
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,190
But what if you...

398
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,450
die before that madam?

399
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,640
- Then...
- CEO Kim's niece will get the inheritance.

400
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,950
The CEO's sister has a daughter.

401
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,070
I don't understand.

402
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,890
Why did he choose you?

403
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,600
Sister and niece.

404
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,730
They're still his bloodline.

405
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,850
That's because...

406
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,700
the CEO and his sister had 
a bad relationship.
