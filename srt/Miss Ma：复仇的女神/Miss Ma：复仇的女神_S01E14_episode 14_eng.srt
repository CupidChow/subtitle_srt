1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,610
- What's up?
 - Auntie, Woo Joon's missing. 

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,920
He's not back yet.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,370
Did you call him? 
He's not answering mine.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,220
I tried a few times, but he didn't answer.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,050
Did something happen at school?

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,810
Well...

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,280
I heard he fought with his classmates.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,350
He doesn't eat well these days either.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,060
Would you know where 
he might have gone?

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,690
You're alone now, aren't you?

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,260
Meaning no one will help you, right?

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,040
Then you need to protect yourself.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,310
What do you do when 
someone bothers you?

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,950
Punch them first. Hard.

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,950
Destroy him so he won't 
look you in the eye.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,380
Okay?

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,330
Let's try again.

18
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,030
Harder.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,670
Woo Joon!

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,910
What are you doing?

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,660
Eun Ji.

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,300
Woo Joon, let's go.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,120
Don't you know he 
should be at school?

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,700
Some kids are bothering him. 
Should I ignore it?

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,560
So you're teaching him violence?

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,750
You want him to be a thug like you?

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,230
If he came to you after 
fighting with friends,

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,340
you should chastise
 and send him back.

29
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,580
What were you thinking?

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,750
If I was that thoughtful, 
I wouldn't be a thug.

31
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,580
Aren't you going to tell us?

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,160
Why did you fight with your friends?

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,640
Tell us. Why did you?

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,700
They called me a baby sparrow.

35
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,150
A sparrow?

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,420
Then  you should've told your teacher.

37
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,330
Why did you leave 
before school ended?

38
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,000
Mind your own business.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,070
What?

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,510
Woo Joon.

41
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,790
It's none of your business

42
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,190
whether I get into fights or not.

43
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,140
Woo Joon.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,380
What? Am I wrong?

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,860
I'll drop him off for now.

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,020
You stay out of this.

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,140
What's the point of arguing with him?

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I'll be back. Calm yourself down.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,270
Let's go.

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,750
Woo Joon.

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,930
What's a baby sparrow?

52
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,470
It's me.

53
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,850
Why are  you a baby sparrow?

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,980
Woo Joon?

55
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,230
I can go on my own. 
Don't follow me.

56
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,540
I'm not worried about you.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,680
Your teacher may be 
upset. I'll talk to her...

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,690
I'm not afraid of my teacher.

59
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,070
Also,

60
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,370
I can talk, too.

61
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,980
Okay.

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,800
Then can I just follow you?

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,170
Until you're inside the orphanage.

64
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,410
I thought that...

65
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,050
maybe I overlooked something.

66
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,100
Even if you were out of your mind, you couldn't 
have killed your daughter so brutally.

67
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,870
- What are you talking about?
- But...

68
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,460
after you threatened me in my home,

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,710
I realized I was completely wrong.

70
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,140
Then everything became clear.

71
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,900
Yes.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,200
I need to annihilate you 
from our society, ASAP.

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,890
No matter what.

74
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,090
I'll be seeing you soon.

75
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,340
And you won't be able to

76
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,500
run anymore.

77
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,670
 

78
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,730
Okay. I'll head over now.

79
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,310
Okay.

80
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,280
Honey! Jae Deok!

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,380
What is it?

82
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,270
He went in without looking back.

83
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,550
He was acting so cold.

84
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,570
They haven't heard from 
Woo Joon's sister yet?

85
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,720
No.

86
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,910
Only the attorney visits sometimes.

87
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,720
 This is Park Myung Hee. 

88
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,350
Are you okay?

89
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,110
I just had...

90
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,850
a dizzy spell.

91
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,450
I think I'm getting old.

92
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,330
Did Jung Hee also...

93
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,940
She has an investor's meeting tomorrow, so...

94
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,350
- Did you call the police?
- Not yet.

95
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,780
It's extreme, but it could be a prank.

96
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,150
A prank?

97
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,910
Why did you call me then?

98
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,290
I told her to call you.

99
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,230
There's a movie where a 
mafia boss beheads a horse

100
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,970
and puts it on a singer's bed.

101
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,370
It was the ultimate threat.

102
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,430
I think the scenarios are the same.

103
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,610
Let me see Jung Hee.

104
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,030
It's not the right time.

105
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,850
She's back in the
 hospital due to shock.

106
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,250
This is because of her past.

107
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,870
If she wants to be free from it,

108
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,330
she needs your help.

109
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,680
Director Seong.

110
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Do you really think that

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,060
the murderer...

112
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,040
has resurfaced?

113
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,910
Of course, I do.

114
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,390
You mean he's around us, too?

115
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,390
What about the police?

116
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,810
Only Lee Jung Hee 
can pinpoint the killer.

117
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,150
I think Chief Jo will.

118
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,700
Jo Chang Gil? You think he's enough?

119
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,430
It doesn't matter who investigates.

120
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,320
I didn't want the police...

121
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,410
to catch the killer anyhow.

122
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,520
What will you do?

123
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,370
If that bastard...

124
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,460
appears in front of you?

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,660
I don't know what I'll do.

126
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,370
But I do know...

127
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,100
what I should be doing.

128
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,190
 Yes, Chief. Okay! 

129
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,890
Let me ask you something.

130
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,840
You're much older than me. 
Please talk casually.

131
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,220
Okay then.

132
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,320
Ms. Ma, what year were you born?

133
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,260
That's impolite to ask a woman.

134
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,210
Tell me what you're curious about.

135
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,630
I'm in charge of

136
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,320
Jung Hee's case.

137
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,500
That's great.

138
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,370
But why do they want you 
tagging along?

139
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,120
I told the...

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,250
nation's director that

141
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,820
I want to cover this case.

142
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,410
Anyway, remember this.

143
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,420
This is my case.

144
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,090
When you find any clues, notify me.

145
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,560
If you suspect anyone, notify me.

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,960
- Got it?
- Of course.

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,370
Geez.

148
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,260
What about the police?

149
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,430
They'll come to the house later.

150
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,290
What the heck did 
Jung Hee see nine years ago?

151
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's drop that topic.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,790
- What about her quitting the movie?
- Quitting the movie?

153
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,560
Jung Hee sunbae?

154
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,180
Not yet.

155
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,440
Fine. Let's do it now.

156
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,750
But we can't cancel this movie.

157
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,780
We already spent several billion.

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,080
What do you want then?

159
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,440
If I quit, the investors will flip out.

160
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
I'll remain as the director.

161
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,330
I'll find a good director
 to replace me

162
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,300
and I'll be the executive
 producer instead.

163
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,670
You want me to quit this movie?

164
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,960
We have no choice.

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Your life is in danger.

166
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,530
I can't.

167
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,000
Innocence is my movie.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,750
We made this decision for you.

169
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,560
You know how long I've been

170
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,620
waiting for this film.

171
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,090
I just started again and 
you want me to quit?

172
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,680
No, CEO!

173
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,030
You can do more films in the future.

174
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,550
When in the future?

175
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,870
Don't you know I've waited 
nine years for this?

176
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,590
Things are different now.

177
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,620
No, it's not different!

178
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,700
This is like my baby.

179
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,020
When I got the part last year,

180
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,240
you know how 
happy I was, don't you?

181
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,690
And now you're telling 
me to give this up?

182
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,910
How can you say that to me?

183
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,320
CEO, if I quit this time...

184
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,340
I might wait another nine years or 
maybe longer than that.

185
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,030
If so...

186
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:30,040
will I have another chance 
in front of the camera?

187
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,240
Jung Hee.

188
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,720
If I leave this movie,

189
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,600
I don't have the energy nor 
any reason to live.

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,090
Honey.

191
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,050
CEO, I beg you.

192
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,340
If I'm to die, I want to die in 
front of the camera.

193
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,270
CEO,

194
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm begging you.

195
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,840
Idiots.

196
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,900
Jae Deok, let's do this.

197
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,880
Since Jung Hee's like that, 
we have no choice.

198
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,980
We'll hold the investors 
meetings as planned

199
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,530
and I'll expand the budget 
for additional crew.

200
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,510
And get Jung Hee a bodyguard.

201
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,270
I'll select the bodyguard myself.

202
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,340
Is there a trustworthy person?

203
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,410
I'm Seong Jae Deok.

204
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,930
Is CEO Jang inside?

205
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,020
CEO, long time no see.

206
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,530
Who are you?

207
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,340
I'm Writer Seong.

208
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,730
Writer Seong?

209
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,490
My debut was "The Cold City."

210
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,060
Do you remember?

211
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,920
Yes.

212
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,080
Seong Jae Deok.

213
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,210
I remember.

214
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,630
Come here.

215
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,380
Three of my guys went to prison 
because of your movie.

216
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,030
You ungrateful bastard.

217
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,450
If you'd sent me to prison instead,

218
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,680
you would've become even 
more successful.

219
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,520
Has it been about 15 years

220
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,970
since you visited me for research?

221
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,350
Yes.

222
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,180
Where's your son?

223
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,690
He's probably somewhere.

224
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,580
What's brings you here anyway?

225
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,670
I know you're not here to just chat.

226
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm here to ask you 
for a shameless favor.

227
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,470
What could you ask of 
from a dying man?

228
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,840
I think my wife is in danger.

229
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,580
- A bodyguard?
- Yes.

230
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,560
I was referred by a trustworthy source.

231
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,650
I don't like it, Jae Deok.

232
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,470
He's trustworthy and 
would never betray us.

233
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,360
I don't want anyone by 
my side besides you.

234
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,450
Honey, I'm doing this for you.

235
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,410
Please, Jae Deok.

236
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,790
I'll drop everything else and

237
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,140
focus only on this.

238
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,300
So let's forget about a bodyguard.

239
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,560
 

240
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,780
I should've told my  wife first.

242
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,210
It's okay.

243
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,670
- I'll call the CEO myself.
- Okay.

244
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,270
Would it be okay if I saw her briefly?

245
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,050
I have something for her.

246
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,310
I humbly ask of you.

247
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,800
Sure.

248
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,380
I'd like to see her alone if possible.

249
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,980
You're...

250
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,310
This is what An Sung Tae had.

251
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,550
How did you get this...

252
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,820
He said there are no copies. 
It's probably true.

253
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,920
Ko Mal Koo!

254
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,080
She said you're trustworthy.

255
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,910
What happened?

256
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,940
It's nothing.

257
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,730
Ko Mal Koo,

258
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,930
this will be the last secret 
you keep from me.

259
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,250
 

260
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,170
 

261
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,790
Chief,

262
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,440
should I hand this in, too?

263
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,700
Of course,  punk. Take it  to them.

264
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,730
Could I have a look?

265
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,150
What is she doing?

266
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,880
Hey!

267
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,830
Will you stay here alone?

268
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,360
Chief.

269
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,070
I'm off duty now.

270
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,920
Hey, where do you think you're going?

271
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,820
Notify me when you hear 
from the forensics dept.

272
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,350
But I made a hospital appointment.

273
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,990
Well then.

274
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,400
What? Officer Bae!

275
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,810
Stay right there! Hey!

276
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,440
How dare he. Hey!

277
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,570
Auntie!

278
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,080
Oppa, are you okay?

279
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,520
Oppa.

280
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,000
- Oppa!
- That's enough.

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,940
I'm really sorry.

282
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,810
It was so dark and...

283
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,970
Let me see. You need some ointment.

284
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,970
That's enough. Leave.

285
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,450
What a temper.

286
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,570
Geez.

287
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,780
Aigoo.

288
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,720
You're really something.

289
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,930
Where did you learn that?

290
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,930
What were you doing there so late?

291
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,310
Mal Koo oppa's their security now.

292
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,510
He's Lee Jung Hee's bodyguard.

293
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,470
- A bodyguard? 
 - Yep.

294
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,020
- What should I do?
- Well.

295
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,520
You should apologize in 
person tomorrow.

296
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,830
No, never mind.

297
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,020
It might backfire.

298
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,820
I mean...

299
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,170
of all people, it was

300
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,100
Mal Koo oppa, defenseless 
against an ahjumma.

301
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,000
You're CEO Kim from 
Boston Investments, correct?

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,320
Am I too early?

303
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,090
No. Take him to the back entrance.

304
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,430
Are there a lot of investors here?

305
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,190
Yes, there are.

306
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,090
My goodness.

307
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,500
You're here.

308
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,430
Are you here for Mal Koo oppa?

309
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,050
No, I had something to check.

310
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,150
Is that so?

311
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,550
Mal Koo oppa.

312
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,860
He must be really upset.

313
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,930
CEO.

314
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,530
Thanks for cooperating.

315
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,240
I don't know if I'll be helpful.

316
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,640
Your wife said Lee Jung Hee 
witnessed the culprit.

317
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,070
This could prove your wife's innocence.

318
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,970
I'm nervous.

319
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,430
Well then.

320
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,510
- CEO Jang Cheol Min.
- Yes.

321
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,310
- Where's CEO Koo?
- He's waiting inside.

322
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,750
Oh, he's an associate of mine.

323
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,240
If it's okay...

324
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,590
Of course.

325
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,790
 

326
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,850
What?

327
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,400
 Auntie, it's Han Tae Kyu. 

328
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,510
Come this way.

329
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,600
 Isn't the man with 
Han Tae Kyu your husband? 

330
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,300
Lee Jung Hee's in the garden.

331
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,770
There's someone you need to meet first.

332
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,630
This way.

333
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,590
Who's the person...

334
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,510
I need to meet?

335
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,090
You'll see. Follow me.

336
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,900
♫  To where, alone  ♫

337
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,440
♫  On an empty street  ♫

338
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,030
♫  Just like that day, tonight  ♫

339
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,650
♫  All the scattered pieces end  ♫

340
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,300
♫  I can't forget. 
Beyond the memories  ♫

341
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,440
♫  I can't recall, today  ♫
