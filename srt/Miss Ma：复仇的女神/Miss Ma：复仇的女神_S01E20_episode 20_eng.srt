1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,050
Eun Ji, why won't you answer?

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,010
It's me.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,020
You don't have the results yet?

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,750
 No, not yet. 

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,240
 Chief, 

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,650
 my work hours are over. 

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,010
You...

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,540
I'm warning you right now.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,810
If you go home before 
the results come out,

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,150
you'll be going home for good.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,870
You'll die, okay?

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,300
 Stop slacking off. 

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,600
Okay.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,510
By the way, Hyungnim.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,350
If in the case...

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,460
If it wasn't Lee Jung Hee...

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,280
then what should we do?

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,500
What the heck are you saying?

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,250
- Is it out?
 - Chief, it's me. 

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,010
It was Jung Yoo Jung who 
killed Manager Choi.

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,940
What?

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,060
Yoo Jung was the daughter 
Jung Hee had adopted.

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,650
She killed Manager Choi for 
threatening her mom.

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,540
What the heck 
are you talking about?

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,860
We're waiting for Lee Jung Hee's fingerprints 
from the murder weapon soon.

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,270
Jung Hee's fingerprints won't be there.

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,070
But it must! Man, seriously.

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,220
 Chief. 

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,580
Yoo Jung is targeting everyone 
who's a threat to her mom.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,770
Eun Ji went to see
 Yoo Jung right now.

31
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,150
So please come to the film studio.

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,840
Chief!

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,250
 

34
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,910
Eun Ji!

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,510
Seo Eun Ji!

36
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,720
Where are the test results?

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,500
Is this it?

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,180
 

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,700
But Hyungnim.

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,590
Who's Jung Ye Ji?

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,000
Seriously.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,950
She should answer if 
her VM isn't active.

43
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,430
 Your call couldn't be reached... 

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,370
Yoo Jung.

45
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,230
You're really doing this for Jung Hee?

46
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,880
She abandoned you 
when she got pregnant.

47
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,840
Is she really worth protecting?

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,130
I know she's not a good person.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,850
But...

50
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,400
she's the only person...

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,330
I used to call "Mom."

52
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,790
Yoo Jung.

53
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,050
I still remember the first time we met.

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,820
With her pale, long hands...

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,530
she held me as we left
the orphanage, and said...

56
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,730
"Call me Mom from now on."

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,580
I felt like I was flying.

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,540
"She's my mom from now on."

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,940
"Lee Jung Hee, the most beautiful 
and elegant actress, is my mom."

60
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,480
I almost cried from joy.

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,300
The three months I spent with her...

62
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,880
was the brightest, happiest 
moment of my life.

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,420
How about after that?

64
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,480
You were abandoned...

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,460
when you were only 13.

66
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,100
I  know.

67
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,220
I was lonely and suffering.

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,140
I was angry...

69
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,450
and I cried a lot, too.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,660
But the more I felt that way...

71
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,090
instead of blaming her...

72
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,250
I started missing her more.

73
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,700
But I couldn't see her.

74
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,830
Yet I still couldn't give up.

75
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,410
I thought I'll see her someday...

76
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,220
so I strove harder in order to 
stand confidently in front of her.

77
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,230
What happened after you met her?

78
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,910
Did she even recognize you?

79
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,810
She didn't.

80
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,390
Think about it.

81
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,810
How you've been living in...

82
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,450
pain for so long because of her.

83
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,470
Do you know this?

84
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,880
A person with a happy life...

85
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,680
feels pain from one misfortune.

86
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,430
But a person with a miserable life...

87
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,720
can be happy with just one fortune.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,910
Yoo Jung, you're still young.

89
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,810
I'm sure you can...

90
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,960
make many happy 
memories from now on.

91
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,450
Will I really be able to?

92
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,750
One mistake is enough.

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,650
Please stop killing...

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,990
to protect a killer.

95
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,390
Yoo Jung, I beg of you.

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,530
But I can't help myself.

97
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,120
You know too much.

99
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,770
Yoo Jung!

100
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,430
Aigoo, well.

101
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,800
I did something...

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,270
terrible this morning.

103
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,980
You know, right?

104
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,450
People are dying and 
we can't find the killer.

105
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,640
I was extremely...

106
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,230
stressed out as well.

107
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,220
Yes, I understand.

108
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,780
Yes.

109
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,940
Aigoo, I feel like crying since

110
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,170
you understand me. 
I'm going nuts here.

111
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,030
I knew you'd be like this, Director.

112
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,970
Yes, by the way...

113
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,010
What about the other 
fingerprints you found?

114
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,990
Yes!

115
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,050
That's why I came over here myself.

116
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,880
By any chance...

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,700
do you know a woman 
named Jung Ye Ji?

118
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,630
I asked CEO Koo Ki Baek, too.

119
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,450
But he said he didn't know.

120
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,970
That's why...

121
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,530
I need you to stop by the station

122
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,960
and confirm it for a second.

123
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,800
Of course, this time I'm...

124
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,370
bringing you as a testifier.

125
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,930
As formally as possible.

126
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,990
Are you okay?

127
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,750
I'm okay. But first...

128
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,120
Ms. Ma.

129
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,960
Ms. Ma!

130
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,430
 Yes, got it. 

131
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
Ye Ji.

132
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,490
Yes.

133
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,300
You really are Ye Ji.

134
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,590
I really did something...

136
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,920
terrible to you.

137
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,060
Don't come any closer.

138
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm sorry I told them I saw you.

139
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,720
I needed time to throw off the police.

140
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,980
What are you...

141
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,200
talking about?

142
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,730
You'll never see...

143
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,590
Writer Ma Ji Won again.

144
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,910
Did you by any chance...

145
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,750
And Eun Ji doesn't have the evidence.

146
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,930
She was only bluffing.

147
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,000
Ye Ji.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,490
It's over now.

149
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,420
There's no one who knows...

150
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,040
what you did anymore.

151
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,860
Ye Ji...

152
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,810
So rest assured and...

153
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,780
make a great movie with Director.

154
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,820
No.

155
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,940
I can't do that anymore.

156
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,290
Then should I tell the truth?

157
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,500
About everything you've done?

158
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Ye Ji.

159
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,780
Please be happy.

160
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,140
That's my final wish for you.

161
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,900
Ye Ji.

162
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,990
Ye Ji...

163
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,450
Min Seo!

164
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,680
I told them to take you to a hospital,

165
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,780
but your niece refused.

166
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,800
Are you feeling okay?

167
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,690
My apologies...

168
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,070
for troubling you.

169
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,390
I'm sorry about last time.

170
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,320
Everyone has different circumstances.

171
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,120
I shouldn't have said all that.

172
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,880
Not sure what you're talking about.

173
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,650
Don't you worry.

174
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,240
No one will listen to an old, blind man.

175
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,580
As my apology...

176
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,630
I'd like to share an interesting story.

177
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,410
I'm sorry, but I have to be 
somewhere urgently.

178
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,790
Since it was nine years ago...

179
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,020
guess it was around October 2009.

180
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,720
A thug I once knew...

181
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,600
kidnapped a girl who was...

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,310
about 10 years old.

183
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,540
It was somewhere around Daejeon.

184
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,850
I'll tell you more details later.

185
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,030
Are you feeling okay?

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,110
Auntie.

187
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,740
Jung Yoo Jung was arrested.

188
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,490
You came here to kill 
Jung Hee from the get-go?

189
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,020
She kicked me out 
without giving a reason.

190
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,910
I've been waiting to 
take revenge since then.

191
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,430
Why not do it right away?
 Why be doing this now?

192
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,620
I didn't know where she was 
the past nine years.

193
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,940
You waited nine years
 to take revenge?

194
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,280
Geez, you're really relentless.

195
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,620
Why did you kill Bae Hee Jae?

196
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,810
I poisoned Lee Jung Hee's glass,

197
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,680
but she ended up drinking it.

198
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,340
Then what about Park Myung Hee?

199
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,520
I got her threat call, too.

200
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,420
She said she knew the killer's 
identity, so I shut her up.

201
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,770
How about Choi Jung Chul?

202
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,320
He threatened me since he knew 
I was targeting Lee Jung Hee.

203
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,620
Same goes for...

204
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,920
Writer Ma Ji Won.

205
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,660
What? You killed Ms. Ma, too?

206
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,100
Jae Deok, we're not shooting today.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Yes.

208
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,510
You look beautiful...

209
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,540
and elegant.

210
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,300
I want people to remember you this way.

211
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,210
Jae Deok.

212
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes.

213
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,890
Writer Ma Ji Won?

214
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,050
Jae Deok.

215
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,440
You know.

216
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,700
There's nothing we can do now.

217
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,470
Yes, send her in.

218
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,190
Jae Deok, I'm scared.

219
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,830
No need to be scared.

220
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,290
I told you that...

221
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,480
I'll protect you no matter what...

222
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,870
so no one in this world...

223
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,740
could touch you.

224
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,550
Yes.

225
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,780
But instead...

226
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,140
I have a favor to ask of you.

227
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,420
What?

228
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,730
Where was Jung Hee standing then?

229
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,910
On the day of the party.

230
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,030
- Around here?
- What about you?

231
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,000
I...

232
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,830
I was...

233
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,470
here, maybe?

234
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,310
Yes, it was just like that.

235
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,630
As if she was staring at me.

236
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,910
No.

237
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,290
Jung Hee wasn't looking at you...

238
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,220
but at that painting.

239
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,550
When she knew why 
she'd lost her child,

240
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,590
she looked at that painting.

241
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,510
The mother holding her child.

242
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,330
Unfortunately, the mom's gentle and

243
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,490
happy face made Jung Hee feel an...

244
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,410
explosive anger in her heart.

245
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,020
That's how much she loved that child.

246
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,180
I feel sorry about the loss of her child.

247
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,340
But there's another child

248
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,240
you need to take care of now.

249
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,970
Do you mean Ye Ji?

250
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,280
She'll pay the price for 
killing Manager Choi.

251
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,800
But the other cases have 
nothing to do with Ye Ji.

252
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,390
Don't worry.

253
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,480
She'll get released for sure.

254
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,300
What do you mean by that?

255
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,460
Just like I said.

256
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,780
Because she suffered...

257
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,350
long enough already.

258
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,170
Are you by any chance...

259
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,480
Where's Jung Hee?

260
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,890
She's probably asleep.

261
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,640
I gave her warm coffee...

262
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,640
since she wanted it.

263
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,450
Jung Hee.

264
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,540
Honey!

265
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,360
 Because of one mistake, 

266
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,380
 I committed a horrible crime. 

267
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,160
 Before I go back to where I came from, 

268
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,450
 I'd like to reveal the truth. 

269
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,080
 The one who killed Hee Jae unni 

270
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,530
 was me, Lee Jung Hee. 

271
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,460
 I sent the evidence 

272
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,630
 to Chief Jo's cellphone. 

273
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,980
 I also killed Manager Choi. 

274
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,070
 Ye Ji, who was arrested... 

275
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,810
 committed no crime. 

276
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,170
No!

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
Auntie!

278
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,920
Jung Hee.

279
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,780
Jung Hee.

280
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,000
No.

281
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,500
You can't die like this.

282
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,020
Jung Hee!

283
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,560
Jung Hee!

284
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,890
This can't be!

285
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,850
Why here...

286
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,250
Honey.

287
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,600
I can't make you...

288
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,750
into a killer as well.

289
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,280
Yes.

290
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,080
That child also had...

291
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,530
the hairpin...

292
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,050
Tell me.

293
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,480
Who was that bastard?

294
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,060
It was so dark.

295
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,620
But what was certain is that...

296
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,380
she was a woman.

297
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,860
A woman?

298
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,920
You're trying to...

299
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,060
take revenge on her, right?

300
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,740
I knew you were framed for this,

302
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,490
but I couldn't come forward.

303
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,900
I was afraid that...

304
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,700
people might say 
I had a deformed baby

305
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,650
for abandoning Ye Ji.

306
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,140
I was so afraid.

307
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,840
Also...

308
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,570
I hated myself more
 than anything for...

309
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,390
killing the child inside of me.

310
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,320
Jung Hee.

311
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,360
But...

312
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,400
please remember this.

313
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
Revenge is...

314
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,060
not for us.

315
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,130
We can't...

316
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,750
bear the void which comes...

317
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,320
afterward.

318
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,350
Jung Hee.

319
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,740
Jung Hee!

320
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,340
Jung Hee.

321
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,520
Jung Hee.

322
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,750
Jung Hee!

323
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,800
Mom.

324
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,100
Oh, no!

325
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,860
By the way...

326
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,390
where's Ms. Ma these days?

327
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,750
It seems like Ms. Ma 
figured out this case, too.

328
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,700
You know what?

329
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,770
Ms. Ma is selling her house.

330
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,840
Why?

331
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Thanks for that time.

332
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,070
You saved my life.

333
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,540
Don't mention it.

334
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,100
I'd like to ask you something.

335
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,750
What made you come to the film set?

336
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,520
There were people targeting 
Lee Jung Hee's life.

337
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,610
Her life?

338
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,010
There weren't just threats.

339
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,480
They were really trying to kill her.

340
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
Who on earth?

341
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know yet.

342
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,440
But CEO told me that...

343
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,820
if that's the case, 
they could target you too.

344
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,490
I...

345
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,660
need to go somewhere.

346
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,780
Where?

347
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,320
I'll tell you later...

348
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,090
if I come back.

349
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,120
I don't know if I'll still be here by then.

350
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,970
Right.

351
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,740
By the way...

352
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,610
why did you play dumb?

353
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,790
About what?

354
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,200
Jung Yoo Jung killed Choi Jung Chul.

355
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,510
Are you okay with...

356
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,810
her being released?

357
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,230
I don't know.

358
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,220
They say humans are hellish.

359
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,730
You've changed a lot, Auntie.

360
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,390
Min Seo's killer was a woman.

361
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,370
Who the heck are you?

362
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,010
 

363
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,900
 

364
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,600
- Yes.
 - This is Seong Jae Deok. 

365
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,750
Ye Ji will get released soon, 
thanks to you.

366
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,730
 Also, there's one more thing. 

367
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,580
Jung Hee said this before she died.

368
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,080
She said that after the 
incident nine year ago,

369
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,610
she may have seen the culprit on TV.

370
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,230
On TV?

371
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,120
Which program?

372
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,480
I think she said on the news.

373
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,310
 I don't know the details. 

374
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,170
 Well, then. 

375
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,800
 Wow, seriously.  

376
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,590
Why didn't you open the door?

377
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,300
Have you been doing well?

378
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,900
Writer Ma Ji Won.

379
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,770
 

380
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,780
 That Ma Ji Won is back. 

381
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,180
 Ms. Ma will be in danger. 

382
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,350
 Are you worrying about me? 

383
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,690
 Even Ms. Ma is wrong this time. 

384
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,820
 Ms. Oh said something weird. 

385
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,370
 You want my fingerprints? 

386
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,690
 Did you really hand it in? 

387
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,720
 If we were going to be this awkward, 
I wouldn't have done it. 

388
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,950
 Are you really leaving? 

389
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,510
 Thanks to you, I can finally leave. 

390
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 That bastard, I mean 
that b**** killed my sister. 

391
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,890
 - Honey.
- I have a favor to ask. 

392
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,240
 I'll do anything. 

393
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,490
 - If my guess is correct, the killer is...
- Who is it? 

394
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,600
♫  Far far away, my heart  ♫
