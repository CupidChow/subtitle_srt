1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
But why?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,700
You gave them to Chief Han 
a few days ago.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,400
Please make another copy for me.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,940
I looked into this in case.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,600
Those evidence photos...

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,280
disappeared from the 
prosecutor's archives.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,140
What?

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,030
The vibe is s***** right now. 
You be careful, too.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,250
Frankly speaking, 
do you really think that...

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,440
Han Tae Kyu died 
from a hit-and-run?

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,090
You gave me Bertram's entry 
and exit records recently.

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,520
So does it make sense
 that it disappeared?

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,780
That's why I'm shocked, too.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,160
Do you...

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,350
really want to go to jail?

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,020
Aigoo, Detective Cheon.

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,070
I worked in banking for 20 years,
 and this is the first time.

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,020
Not only did the transaction records disappear, 
 the entire Bertram Corp. did, too!

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,540
Including the records of the companies
 that had business with them.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,400
What the heck is Bertram...

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,680
What do they do anyway?

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,880
I guess you're very busy.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,540
Since you're not coming.

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,560
 That woman is alive. 

25
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,000
Your wife...

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,740
Jang Min Seo's mom.

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,460
Are you listening to me?

28
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,350
That's impossible.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,000
I saw her corpse with my own eyes.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,980
How could she be alive?

31
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,630
That woman was Ma Ji Won.

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,040
Ma Ji Won, who looks
 exactly like your wife.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,050
Also, I met with...

34
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,050
your wife today.

35
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,540
 She came to see me. 

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,580
Then...

37
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,260
what should I do?

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,640
If my wife is alive...

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,760
then what about...

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,650
fabricating Ma Ji Won's suicide?

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,190
 I handed in her suicide note, and 

42
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,430
called and lied to her 
so she can turn herself in.

43
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,050
But all are about to be revealed now.

44
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,720
You don't have the 
luxury to worry about that.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,710
If she came to me, 
then she can also visit you.

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,820
If she comes,

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,860
let me know and buy as
 much time as you can.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,670
I'll take care of the rest.

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,190
 She'll visit me? 

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,990
Hello? Hello?

51
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,350
Guard CEO Jang's surroundings, and

52
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,330
go to where Han Tae Kyu died.

53
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,680
Yes.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,440
That's where the crazy 
b**** lives right now.

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,740
What the heck is going on?

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,690
Get out.

57
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,140
You're not supposed to be here.

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,190
Do you think I care 
about that right now?

59
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,800
You said she came here.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,470
You said she'll visit me too!

61
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,110
I'll get you a bodyguard. Don't worry.

62
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,270
She'll be suspicious if I have
 a bodyguard all of a sudden.

63
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,200
Suspicious?

64
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,680
It seemed like she 
already knew everything.

65
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,820
What did you say?

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,030
Leave.

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,950
I have a lot to process now.

68
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,450
I told you that...

69
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,230
we should've killed her 
when we first found her.

70
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,840
We had to wait until 
we found the witness.

71
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,360
Lee Jung Hee?

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,100
If you were that worried, you
 should've gotten rid of her too!

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,210
You think it's easy to 
get rid of a woman

74
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,060
who's at the center of attention?

75
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,050
Or what?

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,170
Why?

77
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,800
Did you get scared? Huh?

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,560
Because your true identity 
might get revealed?

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
This is all because of you!

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,300
We're in this mess
 because you hesitated.

81
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,370
Whether it was Ma Ji Won, 
Lee Jung Hee or whomever!

82
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,770
You should've gotten rid of 
them immediately!

83
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,070
Then do it yourself.

84
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,580
Kill your wife when she visits you.

85
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,950
How dare you barge in 
and shoot off your mouth?

86
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,440
Huh?

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,610
Korea Tech's CEO?

88
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,880
How long could you keep that 
title if it weren't for me?

89
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,780
Get lost!

90
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,700
What a loser.

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
Hello?

92
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,610
 Why did you do it? 

93
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,850
 Why did you do that to Min Seo? 

94
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,640
Is it...

95
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,240
 Is it really you, Honey? 

96
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,650
What's...

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,300
going on, Honey?

98
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,810
I thought you...

99
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,420
Where is Min Seo?

100
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,640
 What do you mean, 
where is Min Seo? 

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,550
We put her in the 
mausoleum together.

102
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,530
I know what you 
did with Yang  Mi Hee.

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,400
So tell me where Min Seo is.

104
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Honey, what are you talking about?

105
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,910
Honey.

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,200
I'll visit you soon.

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,400
If you lie to me again...

108
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,350
then I'll...

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,610
destroy you.

110
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,850
 Honey. 

111
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,690
I mean, Honey.

112
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,980
Honey!

113
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,550
Hon...

114
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,600
Who did you call?

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,020
Go to sleep.

116
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,440
Let's talk tomorrow.

117
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,560
Ms. Ma.

118
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,070
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,820
I asked the recently released convicts

120
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,460
about Attorney Choi Man Shik's murder,

121
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,050
but no one knew any details.

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,540
Okay.

123
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,300
Thank you, Mal Koo.

124
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,110
But Ms. Ma...

125
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,160
would you know what Bertram is?

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
Bertram?

127
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,880
I told you there were people
 targeting Lee Jung Hee's life, right?

128
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,060
Yes, I remember.

129
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,490
If Yang Mi Hee is the culprit...

130
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,030
then she probably sent those people.

131
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,290
Because Jung Hee 
witnessed Yang Mi Hee?

132
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,730
That's why she tried to 
get rid of Lee Jung Hee.

133
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,460
Mal Koo, would you...

134
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,430
know who those people are?

135
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,020
I can't really go into details.

136
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,660
But I went to where they were.

137
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,510
And I found out later...

138
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,890
that place is Bertram.

139
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,680
Bertram.

140
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,430
Ber...

141
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,790
Bertram.

142
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,250
 Bertram? 

143
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,560
So...

144
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,420
Lee Jung Hee witnessed
 Yang Mi Hee's crime.

145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,910
And Bertram...

146
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,400
sent thugs to silence

147
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,880
Lee Jung Hee, the witness?

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,520
Yang Mi Hee probably 
controls Bertram.

149
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,630
Then what's Bertram?

150
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,330
Jang Chul Min...

151
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,890
tried sending slush fund to 
Bertram nine years ago

152
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,120
and I found out.

153
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,980
So he almost got
 kicked out of the company.

154
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,930
Then...

155
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,210
those people...

156
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,440
did that because of money?

157
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,790
They did something violent to 
those girls because of money...

158
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,460
Let's...

159
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,700
Let's look for evidence first.

160
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,680
It's clear that they did...

161
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,770
everything including Woo Joon. 
But we need more  evidence?

162
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,300
We need it to...

163
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,530
reveal their identities to 
the whole world.

164
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,330
Then how about revealing that 
Ma Ji Won was murdered?

165
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,800
Yang Mi Hee also...

166
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,140
let you go because 
she was afraid of that.

167
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,030
That's not enough.

168
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,290
I'll reveal...

169
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,500
every one of their sins, then...

170
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,300
I'll make sure they suffer...

171
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,500
10 times,

172
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,210
100 times the girls suffered.

173
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,170
But where should we
 start to find the evidence?

174
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,680
Han Tae Kyu died, too.

175
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,320
First, let's find the one 
who kidnapped your sister.

176
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,330
Whether it was Yang Mi Hee 
or Jang Chul Min,

177
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,850
that person may have
 seen their faces.

178
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,800
Let's find them and make them talk.

179
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,990
We'll worry about...

180
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,870
the rest after that.

181
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,310
Auntie,

182
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,740
that person...

183
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,260
Unni!

184
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Woo Joon opened his eyes.

185
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,920
Can you hear me?

186
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,500
Woo Joon.

187
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,310
Thank you so much for waking up.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,240
Woo Joon.

189
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,690
Thank you so much.

190
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,760
Woo Joon, it's Noona.

191
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,740
You should get up soon,

192
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,410
so we can go to the 
restaurant with that famous chef.

193
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,380
And to amusement parks, too.

194
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,510
Okay?

195
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,960
Chief.

196
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,870
We didn't find the hit-and-run car yet.

197
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,670
We're putting this away already?

198
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,910
We can't find them just by...

199
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,530
looking at this.

200
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,010
Hurry and put it away.

201
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,040
Chief.

202
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,770
Over there.

203
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,180
Hey!

204
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,780
Who are you folks?

205
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,830
Good day.

206
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,820
We're here to see writer Ma Ji Won.

207
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,960
Ms. Ma?

208
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,890
She's at the hospital with Woo Joon...

209
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,670
Well, she went somewhere
 in Gangwondo for research.

210
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,770
Hey, move your foot.

211
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,310
Sorry, Chief.

212
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,040
But why do you want to see her?

213
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
We have personal business with her.

214
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,790
I don't think she's here.

215
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,280
We'll see her next time then.

216
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,490
Let's go.

217
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,780
Why the heck did you 
step on my foot anyway?

218
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,240
I'll run over to the hospital now.

219
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,310
I'll be back.

220
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
Hey!

221
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,110
Where are you going? 
You're still on duty!

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,590
Since he gained consciousness, 
he's over the hump now.

223
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,850
But since it was a big accident,

224
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,490
it'll be good to 
keep him here for now.

225
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,320
Okay.

226
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,280
Thank you, Doctor.

227
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,180
Ms. Ma,

228
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,340
I think you should hide for now.

229
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,790
The thing is...

230
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,180
some suspicious looking men

231
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,560
were observing your house.

232
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,510
Let's go to Jang Sun Doo, Oppa.

233
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,530
Jang Sun Doo?

234
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,390
He's the one who
 kidnapped my sister.

235
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,090
Do you know where he is?

236
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,840
I met him last time.

237
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,440
Eun Ji!

238
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,840
Be careful.

239
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,940
 

240
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,690
He's conscious, but
 in a vegetative state.

241
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,500
Jang Sun Doo, can you hear me?

242
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,750
Do something if you can hear me.

243
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,630
Auntie, it's useless.

244
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
Eun Ji.

245
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,560
Give me Soo Ji's photo. Hurry.

246
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,620
It's this kid, Seo Soo Ji.

247
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,240
The girl you took nine years ago.

248
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,580
We're...

249
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,960
looking for the person who 
ordered you to kidnap her.

250
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,420
You're listening to me, right?

251
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,820
Then try blinking your eyes.

252
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,130
How about we bring CEO Jang here?

253
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,780
He may do something if 
he sees his father.

254
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,820
Yes, let's at least try that.

255
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,850
You missed her?

256
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,730
Yes, stay there and keep watching her.

257
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,740
Take it easy on the alcohol.

258
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,480
Why?

259
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,540
Will you shoot if she shows up?

260
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,310
If she shows up alive.

261
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,020
What if she's talking about 
this to the police or a TV station?

262
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,000
Huh?

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,010
That her husband plotted 
with a prosecutor

264
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,490
and made Ma Ji Won commit suicide?

265
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,430
Huh?

266
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,110
If that was the case, she wouldn't 
have appeared before me.

267
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,060
Then what can it be?

268
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,750
To take revenge herself?

269
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,310
Then you'll make sure to

270
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,120
protect us, right?

271
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,640
Isn't that right?

272
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,820
I get it. Stop drinking and

273
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,350
think about where she might go.

274
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,240
What is there to think about anyway?

275
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,890
Track her location and...

276
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,380
find her using a satellite like in movies.

277
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,650
Everyone has a cell phone these days.

278
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,120
It's because I don't know 
her cell phone number.

279
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,380
Oh...

280
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,940
The phone number?

281
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,700
Didn't I tell you?

282
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,350
My wife...

283
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,090
called me last night.

284
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,620
Here.

285
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,040
Okay.

286
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,170
You're really Sun Doo.

287
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,850
You said you've
 been to Bertram, right?

288
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,480
Where is it?

289
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,290
I can't tell you.

290
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,780
You can't tell me?

291
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,970
- Then did you tell Auntie?
- Yeah.

292
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,790
If so, why can't you tell me?

293
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,370
It's too dangerous.

294
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,040
If you really want to know, 
ask Ms. Ma yourself.

295
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,520
I can never tell you.

296
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,730
Oppa.

297
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,160
What goes around comes around.

298
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,210
I think Sun Doo and I are...

299
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,600
paying the price for the things...

300
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
which we have done.

301
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,270
Do you know who ordered
 your son to kidnap?

302
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,390
I just know that they 
gave him a lot of money.

303
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,380
Even if Sun Doo knew who 
ordered him to kidnap...

304
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,590
would he be of help in this state?

305
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,390
It's my fault that...

306
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,580
Sun Doo ended up like this.

307
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,360
He was cute and smart 
when he was young.

308
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,860
But because the 
father did bad things...

309
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,220
the son learned by watching him.

310
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm just glad that...

311
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,590
I was...

312
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,300
able to see my son's face before I die.

313
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,200
Jang Sun Doo probably feels the same.

314
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,260
He must be happy that
 he met his father.

315
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,420
Right?

316
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm not sure.

317
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,320
If he was okay,

318
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,560
he'd have probably blame me...

319
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,340
for raising him this way.

320
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,760
Jang Sun Doo, 
do you think so too?

321
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,830
Ms. Ma.

322
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,210
Say it.

323
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,580
You missed your father, right?

324
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,500
Go inside, get Ms. Ma, 
and hide away.

325
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,580
- They're the people who followed us?
- Yes, they are.

326
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,850
I'll buy some time, so hurry.

327
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,910
- Oppa.
- Hurry!

328
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,210
I'll ask you one more time.

329
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,840
Can you hear your father's voice?

330
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,570
Sun Doo.

331
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,330
Can you hear my voice?

332
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,860
Sun Doo, my son.

333
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,170
Jang Sun Doo.

334
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,620
You kidnapped a girl 
nine years ago, right?

335
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,960
By any chance, that girl...

336
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,350
Auntie.

337
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,650
Eun Ji, give me Soo Ji's photo.

338
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,590
There are suspicious punks
 outside. We must hide.

339
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,980
I said, give me her photo.

340
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,080
Is this the girl...

341
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,270
you kidnapped?

342
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,910
Then did you see the person?

343
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,340
The one who ordered 
you to kidnap this girl.

344
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,870
Was it her?

345
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,000
It was him, right?

346
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,940
The bastard who
 told you to kidnap Soo Ji.

347
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,770
♫  You're the flower  ♫

348
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,410
♫  You're beautiful  ♫
