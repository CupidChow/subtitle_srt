1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,380
- Is she dead?
- Something's wrong.

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,140
Is she dead?

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,150
What the heck is this?

4
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,480
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,980
Bae Hee Jae's dead?

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,890
I followed her upstairs when I 
saw her and Lee Jung Hee talking.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,090
But this happened when I 
looked away briefly.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,280
The police chief is there, right?

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,370
Yes.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,390
If it was a murder, 
the killer must still be there.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,580
Tell Chief not to let anyone out.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,980
- Okay.
- And find Bae Hee Jae's husband.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,060
An Sung Tae?

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,740
He knew Lee Jung Hee for a long time.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,600
He should know something.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,160
Wait a second.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,620
What are you doing? 
You're the police.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,160
- What?
- If she was murdered...

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,710
the killer is still here.

20
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,430
Sir, perhaps you should leave.

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,820
Someone just died. 
Shouldn't I look into it?

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,440
If it's a murder, everyone 
here is a suspect.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,860
You don't need to be one of them.

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,870
I'm Jo Chang Gil.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,780
Let's go, Sir.

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,220
Take care!

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,170
You guys.

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,240
Stay here from now on.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,380
Don't let anyone out without 
my permission, okay?

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,430
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,590
Someone just died.

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,300
Which means there's a murderer here.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,740
 There's a murderer here. 

34
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,830
 This means there's a murderer here? 

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,550
 Who is it anyway? 

36
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,000
 Where are they? 

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,930
Honey.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,890
Jae Duk, I'm scared.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,360
Why did you invite them anyway?

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,370
I don't know how they heard,

41
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,930
but they contacted me first.

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,700
By the way...

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,910
how's Hee Jae unni?

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,600
My God.

45
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,720
Who would do such a thing?

46
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,720
We just had three people die.

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,130
What's going on here?

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,290
I'm so terrified.

49
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,910
Should we call a shaman?

50
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,160
I know a really good one.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,180
Ms. Yang, are you drunk?

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,240
No one does that anymore.

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,840
You think ghosts only 
existed in the past?

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,560
Excuse me.

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,600
That glass.

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,840
Who does it belong to?

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,100
Oh, my God!

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,050
I think that woman was holding it.

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,620
If so, the murderer must've

60
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,440
- put something in there.
 - What? 

61
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,940
 Did you drink it? 

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,600
- Oh my, Ms. Oh!
- Don't look.

63
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,030
What should we do?

64
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,770
 It was poisoned! 

65
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,080
 Is it okay to drink?  

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,560
Manager Choi?

67
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,880
A murder?

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,110
That's what the police chief said.

69
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,790
What do you think?

70
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,850
What do I think?

71
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,730
A woman who used to 
leech off Jung Hee unni

72
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,120
just died.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
What does that mean?

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,500
Did I say something complicated?

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,210
You mean Jung Hee sunbae 
killed Hee Jae unni?

77
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,400
I guess you still want to work with us.

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,050
You're about to steal 
Jung Hee's role if she quits.

79
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,300
Honestly, this film doesn't suit her.

80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,230
Don't you agree?

81
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,130
It was Director Seong's decision.

82
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,150
If he made a bad decision, 
you should've stepped in.

83
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,400
- You're the assistant director.
- I advised him.

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,320
- Did you?
- I told him that Seo So Jeong

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,820
should never work with us.

86
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,370
What should I do?

87
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,260
You're really growing on me.

88
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,090
This is the guestlist?

89
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,980
I think so.

90
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,910
 
Huh?

91
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,570
She came with her husband.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,450
An Sung Tae!

93
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,280
Is An Sung Tae here?

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,100
No?

95
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,890
His wife died and

96
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,990
he disappeared?

97
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,620
- An Sung Tae disappeared?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,160
Chief Jo says that 
he's the prime suspect.

99
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,440
I'll call you back.

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,420
- What's going on? 
 - What happened?

101
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,370
He's a famous director.

102
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,050
Be careful.

103
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,090
What are you doing here?

104
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,000
The money.

105
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,660
You have something dangerous.

106
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,250
Don't come near me!

107
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,080
And it's loaded.

108
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
Where did you get this?

109
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,640
The thing is...

110
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,980
It's mine, Mr. Koo!

111
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,260
Where's the money?

112
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,710
Well, I...

113
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,150
That's right!

114
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,720
My wife just died.

115
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,160
Here.

116
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,910
If I get the insurance money,

117
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,500
I can easily pay you back!

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,450
I appreciate the effort, but...

119
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,970
you can't just kill your wife.

120
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,240
No! I didn't kill her!

121
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,380
She's really dead?

122
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,480
It wasn't me!

123
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,740
You two.

124
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,200
Why don't you chat later

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,770
and go elsewhere for now?

126
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,620
 

127
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,150
Did Bae Hee Jae know...

128
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,940
that you got an 
insurance under her name?

129
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,560
Of course, she knew...

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,200
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo!

131
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,950
She didn't know.

132
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,340
My lady friend needed to meet her 
quota and asked me...

133
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,960
A younger lady friend?

134
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,440
Yes. I've known her for a while.

135
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
Can't believe this.

136
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,100
Did you cheat on her, too?

137
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,400
If you murder her, there's no 
payout. Did you know that?

138
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,710
-  I said, I didn't kill her!
- Then why did you run?

139
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,520
I got an insurance and 
my wife dies suddenly.

140
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,830
Who would they suspect?

141
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,120
Then...

142
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,750
why were you burning these?

143
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,850
Because I'd be a suspect!

144
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,140
You idiot.

145
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,670
Burning the paper will 
cancel the insurance?

146
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,830
You try being in my shoes. Seriously!

147
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,680
Anyone you're suspicious of?

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,780
Among the people there,

149
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,540
someone who may have 
resented your wife.

150
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,090
Yes.

151
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,480
Director Seong.

152
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,940
Director Seong Jae Duk?

153
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,240
That bastard...

154
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,500
blamed my wife for Jung Hee's retirement.

155
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,240
When will you stop 
leeching off Jung Hee?

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,540
Director, your words are harsh.

157
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,850
We're not leeches here.

158
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,610
Don't you feel sorry for her?

159
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,970
She was in pain for nine 
years because of you.

160
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,230
That wasn't my fault.

161
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,700
No?

162
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,400
Get out, now.

163
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,470
That's enough.

164
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,130
Your wife invited us here.

165
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,650
 Why was she was in 
pain for nine years? 

166
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,390
You've been in contact with her?

167
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,790
No, that's not it.

168
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,110
We didn't know she lived in 
that neighborhood.

169
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,970
When was the last time you saw her?

170
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,420
It was...

171
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,420
the first shoot day of "The Shaman."

172
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,200
Tell me.

173
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,490
What happened that day?

174
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,030
Actually, I don't really know.

175
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,410
You said it'd be a daebak novel.

176
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,780
I was going along with 
my wife. That day...

177
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,520
I wasn't there.

178
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,500
She said Jung Hee was pregnant. 
What did she mean?

179
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,860
I heard that for the first time today.

180
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,460
You didn't meet with her?

181
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,530
You went to see her for money.

182
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,860
No. I'm not a thug or anything.

183
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,310
- Hey, An Sung Tae.
- Yes.

184
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,970
I met her during the 
photo shoot in Thailand.

185
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,260
A photo shoot?

186
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,980
It was two months before 
she started "The Shaman."

187
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
 

188
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,750
Don't give Jung Hee 
a cold, just go later.

189
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,880
She's due back in two days. 
There's no later!

190
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,370
Also,

191
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,480
I need some money for the
 hotel and the plane tickets.

192
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,750
You're really something.

193
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,370
You ripped her off for 10 years. 
You shouldn't talk.

194
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,030
Aigoo...

195
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,300
Hey!

196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
- Hand it over.
 - What?

197
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,000
The reason why you ripped
 her off for 10  years.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,300
That's...

199
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,270
in my office.

200
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,880
Seriously!

201
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,060
If you lie, you die.

202
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,130
Give me to me.

203
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,960
Well...

204
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,340
What's this?

205
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,700
You know.

206
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,200
That thing.

207
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,610
The video.

208
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,080
Geez.

209
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,860
You said you were her manager.

210
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,470
They did this in Japan to keep the 
new actors from bolting.

211
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll give it back later.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,100
Just bring my money before I kill you.

213
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,420
Thanks for helping me.

214
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,010
I have another favor to ask you.

215
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,980
What's this? Why did you 
want to meet here?

216
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,380
Mal Koo oppa's here, too.

217
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,820
Wow, Woo Joon will be so happy.

218
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,760
Woo Joon!

219
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,930
Woo Joon.

220
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,760
I know you're lonelier and 
sadder than anyone here.

221
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,130
I know it's hard to deal with at your age.

222
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,310
But you have to...

223
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,170
overcome it.

224
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,910
- Auntie.
-  No one else can...

225
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,390
fix the wound in your heart.

226
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,880
What are you doing?

227
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,880
We won't visit you in the future.

228
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,420
You shouldn't wait for us either.

229
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,020
That will...

230
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,880
help you overcome what 
you're going through.

231
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,860
Receiving pity...

232
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,410
is what makes you the weakest.

233
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,170
I met with your dad.

234
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,600
He was worried about you.

235
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,810
He said he didn't mean...

236
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,580
what he did that day.

237
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,460
So be strong until your sister arrives.

238
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,090
You got it?

239
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,110
I got it.

240
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,630
Good.

241
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,030
But Ahjumma.

242
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,360
He's...

243
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,870
not my dad.

244
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,240
CEO, I'll start reading.

245
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,080
Something happened, right?

246
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,560
- Nothing's going on.
- Is that so?

247
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,970
You sound like you got beat up.

248
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,670
By the way, what happened to the 
kid you were going to bring?

249
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,790
Can't believe I'm hearing 
Ko Mal Koo sighing.

250
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,170
My apologies, CEO.

251
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,110
Forget the book.

252
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,330
Let's hear what's causing those sighs.

253
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,350
That'll be more interesting.

254
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,850
Wasn't your aunt too harsh?

255
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,980
She's right, but...

256
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,940
it was too much.

257
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,350
Woo Joon's suddenly an orphan.

258
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,340
Eun Ji, there's a lot of people here.

259
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,110
Just for a moment.

260
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,130
Let's stay like this for a moment.

261
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,820
Min Seo.

262
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,640
Why are you so sad?

263
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,100
Because I miss you.

264
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,640
Really?

265
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,220
Min Seo.

266
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,550
What?

267
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,390
You won't...

268
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,800
go anywhere

269
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,010
if I hugged you, right?

270
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,920
Where would I go?

271
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,550
Here.

272
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,400
Auntie.

273
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,940
They got fingerprints.

274
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,360
Lee Jung Hee's fingerprints were 
on Bae Hee Jae's glass.

275
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,370
And no one else's?

276
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,110
A few part-timers' fingerprints, too.

277
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,820
What was the cause of death?

278
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,710
A huge amount of tranquilizer was found.

279
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,850
She died from an overdose.

280
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,190
This means that

281
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,460
Lee Jung Hee put tranquilizer in the wine

282
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
and gave it to Bae Hee Jae, right?

283
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,200
Yeah.

284
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,500
They've been blackmailing 
Lee Jung Hee for a long time.

285
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,570
So Lee Jung Hee's the culprit?

286
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,460
Pretty much. There's a 
motive and evidence.

287
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,660
Did anyone see Jung Hee 
drugging the wine?

288
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,960
No.

289
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,040
But there's a video clip of the party.

290
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,480
Huh?

291
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,340
Mr. Choi, why did you 
film this event?

292
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,030
It's a "behind the scenes" story.

293
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,810
The backstory of the film.

294
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,990
Backstory, my foot.

295
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,050
I don't think that's all to it.

296
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
This punk, I outta...

297
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,500
You doctored it. 
You know that's illegal, right?

298
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,600
You edited this, right?

299
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,480
It's not continuous but 
keeps cutting off.

300
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,470
I went out for cigarettes and...

301
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,500
took it easy here and there.

302
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,270
Huh?

303
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,100
- What?
- What the?

304
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,500
What is this?

305
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,560
It's from Choi Joong Chul's video clip.

306
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,070
I told him to film the event.

307
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,130
Why are you showing us this?

308
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,300
Bae Hee Jae's cause of death was

309
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,460
the tranquilizer in her glass.

310
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,340
In her glass?

311
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,430
Did you put it there?

312
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,390
Why would I?

313
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,510
- You heard her, right?
- Hyungnim, seriously.

314
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,420
Was it originally your glass?

315
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,170
Probably.

316
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,240
They used the glasses 
from the parlor.

317
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,650
Then he must've put it in the parlor.

318
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,190
I mean, An Sung Tae did.

319
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,530
Why was your glass 
given to Bae Hee Jae?

320
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,310
I don't know.

321
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,910
Maybe her glass was empty,

322
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,860
or she was keeping a watch on mine.

323
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,490
Is this the entirety of the footage?

324
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,220
That'll help us understand the context.

325
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,850
This is everything we have.

326
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,960
What do you mean?

327
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,930
The video was choppy overall.

328
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,050
Don't argue and start 
searching for An Sung Tae.

329
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,580
Why him?

330
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,160
She's the prime suspect.

331
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,620
What?

332
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,010
Hyungnim.

333
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,100
The poisoned glass had her fingerprints,

334
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,550
and the person who 
threatened her died from it.

335
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,370
Isn't this obvious?

336
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,050
That's not it at all.

337
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,420
What is it then?

338
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,890
Aigoo, seriously.

339
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,410
Listen.

340
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,260
An Sung Tae went there for money.

341
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,180
But Jung Hee didn't have it 
because she restarted her career.

342
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,790
She can't ask her husband for money.

343
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,360
So she said, "I can't give you money!"

344
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,830
this happened.

345
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,020
An Sung Tae must've been pissed.

346
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,850
That's why he put the tranquilizer

347
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,440
in Jung Hee's glass out of spite, but

348
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,770
that glass went to his wife instead.

349
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,650
And he stood back and watched?

350
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,120
When his wife was about to die?

351
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,650
You know the saying,
 'kill two birds with one stone"?

352
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,790
What?

353
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,760
Look.

354
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,780
Bae Hee Jae's life insurance?

355
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,560
When the glass went to his wife,

356
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,750
he remembered this 
right there and then.

357
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,640
Plus he knew the glass was

358
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
plastered with 
Jung Hee's fingerprints.

359
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,070
It was a bingo. A bingo.

360
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,380
A bingo!

361
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,190
A classic example of "killing two birds 
with one stone," you know?

362
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,170
That sounds believable.

363
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,580
Didn't you see Lee Jung Hee earlier?

364
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,470
She was shaking while 
watching the video.

365
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,250
Man, seriously...

366
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,600
- What?
- Didn't I ever tell you?

367
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,100
I get shaky when I see your face.

368
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,730
Seriously...

369
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
What should we do?

370
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What if Lee Jung Hee gets arrested?

371
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,170
It'll be funny to ask

372
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,360
a murderer who the 
other murderer was.

373
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
We can't assume anything yet.

374
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,210
We don't know who put the 
tranquilizer in the glass,

375
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,520
and frankly, the motive is strange.

376
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,380
- What motive?
- The reason why Jung Hee killed Bae Hee Jae.

377
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,590
Because that woman threatened her.

378
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,850
Technically, it was 
An Sung Tae who made the threats.

379
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,190
He's been taking her money 
from her newbie days.

380
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,180
If it's not Lee Jung Hee or 
An Sung Tae, then who is it?

381
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,430
An Sung Tae said Director Seong got 
angry with Bae Hee Jae.

382
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,710
He said Jung Hee retired 
and lived in pain

383
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,560
for a long time 
because of that woman.

384
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,870
It can't be him.

385
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,880
Why put the tranquilizer in his 
wife's glass to kill Bae Hee Jae?

386
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,920
How would he know that glass 
would end up with Bae Hee Jae?

387
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,750
He could've killed his wife.

388
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,950
According to An Sung Tae, 
we're back to Lee Jung Hee.

389
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,260
She retired because 
Bae Hee Jae bullied her.

390
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,800
It's a good motive.

391
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,490
But wouldn't she know her 
fingerprints would get on the glass?

392
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,260
She could've prevented it by 
covering it with a napkin.

393
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,390
All we know is Jung Hee's poisoned glass

394
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,200
was given to Bae Hee Jae.

395
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,480
It's imperative to

396
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,470
find out who put the drug 
in Jung Hee's glass.

397
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,330
Someone must've...

398
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,500
witnessed it.

399
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,030
Auntie.

400
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,820
What if it was...

401
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,770
that bastard?

402
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,660
What do mean "that bastard"?

403
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,160
The one who's 
afraid of Lee Jung Hee.

404
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
That's because you
 don't know yourself.

405
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,980
What do I not know?

406
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,560
You're not sincere, but...

407
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,870
just covered with a nice shell.

408
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,130
If you take off one layer, 
there's another one.

409
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,880
And if you remove that one...

410
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,540
there's another layer. 
That's you.

411
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,500
If you continue on with that,

412
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,080
do you know what's left in the end?

413
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,830
There's nothing.

414
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,470
Cut! Okay.

415
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,970
- Was it okay?
- You still got it.

416
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,550
It was...

417
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,760
a heartfelt performance.

418
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,280
I'm so touched that

419
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,480
I witnessed something 
so incredible

420
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,430
- in my life...
- Chief, you're overpraising me.

421
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,280
You two shouldn't 
worry about anything.

422
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,870
I'll capture that An Sung Tae

423
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,710
make him confess.

424
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,020
So just keep doing what you're doing.

425
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,580
I'm looking forward 
to your beautiful...

426
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,890
performance of a lifetime.

427
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

428
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Your words are really encouraging.

429
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,030
Is that so?

430
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,830
Enjoy.

431
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,970
- Jae Duk.
- Yes?

432
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,090
What is it?

433
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,220
Who's afraid of Jung Hee?

434
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,480
The bastard who 
killed your daughter.

435
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,490
Lee Jung Hee's an eyewitness.

436
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,210
Didn't he re-emerge 
because the witness did?

437
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,410
To shut her up.

438
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,120
Jae Duk...

439
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,620
There's something wrong...

440
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,570
with the coffee.

441
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,700
- Honey, Honey!
- Aigoo!

442
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,070
What's going on?

443
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,510
Honey!

444
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,460
Jung Hee.

445
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,560
 

446
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Hello?

447
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,830
What?

448
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,510
Lee Jung Hee collapsed.

449
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,070
 

450
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,920
 

451
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,990
 

452
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,280
 

453
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,700
It's me.

454
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,420
Yes.

455
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,700
I'll meet with...

456
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,660
Lee Jung Hee.

457
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,910
 

458
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,110
 I told him to contact you. 

459
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,100
 Was it really him? 

460
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,130
 The murderer who Lee Jung Hee saw? 

461
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,460
 How do you know that? 

462
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,700
 - Why is she there anyway? 
- Why? 

463
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,800
 The man with Han Tae Kyu, 
isn't he your husband? 

464
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,130
♫  You're the flower  ♫
