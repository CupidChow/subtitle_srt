1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,830
Ahjumma,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,940
have you heard of "art rock?"

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,350
Well, geez, Chief Jo.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,090
So...

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,610
I found the hospital so uncomfortable,

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,510
so I came back home to relax.

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,870
But I can't relax 
because of that noise!

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,770
This is not a noise, but...

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,690
it's an art.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,040
It might be art or whatever to you,

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,030
but it sounds like 
noise to your neighbor.

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,480
"A priest sees people at their best."

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,830
"A lawyer sees at their worst."

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,030
What?

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,450
A Buddha sees only Buddhas,

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,670
and a pig sees only pigs.

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,840
Excuse me.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,910
Are you saying that our Ms. Oh is

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,690
a pig or something?

20
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,310
Seriously. How dare you 
say things like that?

21
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,630
- Let go!
- I mean, really...

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,260
No way.

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,730
It's a legendary art-rock band's music.

24
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,480
But you say it's noise? What the hell?

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,330
Is this a comedy skit from the 80's?

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,720
How dare you roll your 
f***ing tongue like that?

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,860
Anyway.

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,020
If it's too loud, please 
cover your ears.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,290
Hey, hey, hey!

30
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,690
Isn't it easier for you to
 wear headphones?

31
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,680
Why should I? Why?

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,410
You must listen to music with "air."

33
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,850
The stuff you listen to 
using headphones...

34
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,510
that's noisy. A true noise.

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,640
Hey, hey! Come on!

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,280
Oh, come on! Seriously.

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,800
Where did that piece of 
work come from anyway?

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,120
He's apparently  from Berkeley.

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
Berkle... what?

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,210
It's a famous music college.

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,070
Aigoo, so annoying.

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,610
I'm annoyed, yet what are 
you eating by yourself?

43
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,870
I have yours too.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,770
Huh?

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,990
Nice.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Ms. Ma.

47
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,980
I was going to call you.

48
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,190
Let's go to the Yellow Sea next week.

49
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,940
What is it this time?

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,310
It's not like that this time.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,170
It's for Do Ja Hyun's case, and

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,490
the chief wants to give you an award.

53
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,020
Not everyone gets those!

54
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,190
I strongly told him that 
we must give you one, Ms. Ma.

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,630
I'm sorry, Chief.

56
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,040
I'll be gone for a while 
for important research.

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,270
You're playing hard to get again.

58
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,020
And Officer Bae.

59
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,360
Thank you.

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,460
It's nothing.

61
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,140
What did she thank you for?

62
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,520
That's a secret between
 Ms. Ma and me.

63
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,760
I asked Mal Koo to take Woo Joon in.

64
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
Woo Joon was happy, too.

65
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,510
I put the house up for sale.

66
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,750
It'll take some time for it to sell.

67
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,840
You can stay here till then.

68
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,920
Do what makes you comfortable.

69
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,380
Auntie, the thing is...

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,160
 

71
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,360
I went to Daejeon.

72
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,360
 Hello? 

73
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,740
Who is it?

74
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,720
- Eun Ji.
- It was Jang Chul Min, wasn't it?

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,790
Give it to me.

76
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,260
Do you not believe me
or are you in denial?

77
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,850
I said, give it to me.

78
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,600
Today, that woman...

79
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,330
That woman...

80
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,630
 

81
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,940
 Those people... 

82
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,590
 killed Ma Ji Won
 thinking she's your aunt. 

83
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,600
Who was that?

84
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,820
I think it was a wrong number.

85
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,960
Send 2 billion won this week
 if you want to get by.

86
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,000
I sent you that much last month.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,580
So?

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,960
You don't want to?

89
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,930
This week will be difficult.

90
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll send it by next month.

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,070
This week, Chul Min.

92
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,640
This week.

93
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,950
Don't forget...

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,270
how you got away from that woman.

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,770
And who gave you all the success...

96
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,240
you've been having 
at your company.

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,190
 

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,060
Three or four fingerprints were 
found on the toothbrush.

99
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,690
It is that crazy b****.

100
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,270
How about the DNA?

101
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,560
I asked them to rush it, but...

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,180
she wouldn't have brushed 
someone else's teeth with it.

103
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,180
Let's report this after the DNA results.

104
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,740
Aren't the fingerprints enough?

105
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,530
Why don't we report this and end it?

106
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,100
Let's really drive it in. Drive it in.

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,790
Also...

108
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,280
I sent a request for cooperation.

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,130
Go to the prosecutor's archives and

110
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,990
make a copy of Jang Min Seo's case.

111
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,050
Including the crime scene 
photos and everything else.

112
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,570
But why do you want those?

113
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,090
Just do as I say!

114
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,880
Who was it?

115
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,100
 Remember that... 

116
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,260
 killing a few people... 

117
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,530
 means nothing to those people. 

118
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,120
Seo Eun Ji.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,810
- It's nothing, Auntie.
- Give that to me right now.

120
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,810
Huh?

121
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,850
I have a favor to ask you.

122
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,200
If you trust me even a little...

123
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,770
please stay as "Ma Ji Won" for now.

124
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,710
At least...

125
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,630
until you move out.

126
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,660
Don't leave me alone here. Okay?

127
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,330
I'm scared and tired, that's why.

128
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,070
Eun Ji...

129
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,920
what happened in Daejeon?

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,340
Tell me.

131
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,210
What happened?

132
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,720
Not now.

133
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,800
You'll find out...

134
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,760
later why I'm doing this.

135
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,950
We should see Woo Joon living 
well at Mal Koo's place, too.

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,770
So please stay with me until  then.

137
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,740
And don't call your
 husband or someone else.

138
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,760
Please?

139
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,730
I beg of you, Auntie.

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
Can't you...

141
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,840
peek at the answer sheet?

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,130
Only our teacher knows the answer.

143
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,260
I'll think this over then.

144
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,750
Go read a book to Grandpa.

145
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,020
"When the lumberjack 
arrived at the heavens,"

146
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,100
"his children and wife
 ran over to him."

147
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,690
"- Dad. 
- Honey, how did you come up here?"

148
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,480
"The lumberjack hugged 
his wife and children,"

149
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,330
"and cried tears of joy."

150
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,370
Grandpa, are you okay?

151
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,080
Could you let me rest a bit?

152
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,780
Does it hurt a lot?

153
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,760
Yes.

154
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,110
I'm about to die soon.

155
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,590
But what happens to 
a person after they die?

156
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,170
They probably go to heaven.

157
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,910
Then...

158
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,570
who lives in heaven?

159
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,990
I'm not sure.

160
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,480
Like you said, probably the 
ones who went there first.

161
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,370
 

162
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,840
Hello?

163
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,490
What?

164
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,430
You can't find Woo Joon?

165
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,830
- Did you find him?
- No.

166
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,050
I looked everywhere, but...

167
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,030
- Did you call the police?
- I did.

168
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,870
I didn't see him around the store.

169
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,590
Did you try calling him?

170
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,940
He's not answering.

171
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,880
Did something happen at 
home by any chance?

172
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,170
Well, the thing is...

173
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,400
I shouldn't have said those things.

174
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,110
Did he mention he's going somewhere?

175
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,090
I'm not sure.

176
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,850
I didn't hear anything like that.

177
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,620
Unni, are you okay?

178
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,680
I came because Eun Ji called me.

179
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,770
What's going on all of a sudden?

180
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,260
Let's do this.

181
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,890
Mal Koo,  go to the orphanage.

182
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,300
He may have gone there.

183
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,760
Also, Eun Ji...

184
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,790
Don't worry, Auntie.

185
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,730
He's probably okay.

186
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,140
Yes. Right.

187
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,490
I'll go to the mausoleum 
where his mom is.

188
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,500
I'll look around the 
neighborhood again.

189
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,130
I'll also notify the headquarters.

190
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,340
He might've gone to the new city.

191
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,800
Then I'll look around  the school.

192
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,610
Auntie, you go home.

193
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,640
He might go there, too.

194
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,860
Probably not.

195
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,040
Right.

196
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,170
I'll visit Woo Joon's friend.

197
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,170
Woo Joon's friend?

198
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,620
What should we do?

199
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,610
Woo Joon didn't come here.

200
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,190
Do you know where Woo Joon
 likes to go by any chance?

201
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,760
You guys are close.

202
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,860
But Ahjumma...

203
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,830
I'm not close with Woo Joon.

204
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,310
But you used to study together.

205
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,970
He came over that day
 because he really wanted to.

206
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,650
Woo Joon did?

207
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,290
I was going to tell you.

208
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,470
The reason why...

209
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,740
he came was probably to see you.

210
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,390
He guessed you'd come to 
play the detective game.

211
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,340
I went because Woo Joon was coming.

212
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,620
Ms. Hong mentioned that to me.

213
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,970
By any chance...

214
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,760
I told Ms. Hong myself.

215
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,450
Woo Joon had asked me that favor.

216
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,880
By the way,

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
he said that someday, he'll die 
where his mom died at.

218
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,290
But that was a lie, right?

219
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,060
Right, Mom?

220
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,040
Woo Joon!

221
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,950
Excuse me!

222
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,540
Hello? Is anyone in there?

223
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,620
Woo Joon!

224
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,030
Woo Joon!

225
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,550
Woo Joon!

226
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,760
Woo Joon!

227
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,580
Woo Joon!

228
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,680
What are you doing? Huh?

229
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,890
That little punk...

230
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,950
Oppa, wait.

231
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,320
I was looking all over for you!

232
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,180
Woo Joon!

233
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,640
I missed Mom.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,380
But I was...

235
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,070
I was too scared to die.

236
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,020
Yes.

237
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,390
I miss Min Seo, too.

238
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,830
But I was too scared to die.

239
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,870
Min Seo...

240
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,880
is my daughter who died.

241
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,730
Truthfully, I'm...

242
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,100
looking for my daughter's killer.

243
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,010
That's the reason...

244
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,150
why I came here and 
why I'm trying to leave.

245
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,130
Please don't go.

246
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,850
Also I'm...

247
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,800
a liar.

248
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm not a writer, and...

249
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,020
the reason why I was 
close with your mom...

250
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,420
and friendly with the library ladies...

251
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
I wasn't being sincere.

252
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,220
But my concerns for you...

253
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,380
were never lies. Not once.

254
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,940
Really?

255
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,900
If I ask you to live with me...

256
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,480
would you say yes?

257
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,390
Auntie.

258
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,650
He finally fell asleep.

259
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,490
For now, I think...

260
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,680
I need to stay with Woo Joon.

261
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,240
Me too.

262
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,900
I...

263
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,600
also need someone next to me.

264
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,140
You can go now.

265
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
I can go by myself.

266
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,590
Do you want to?

267
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,440
What?

268
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,980
By the way, where should
 I go to after school?

269
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,830
You should come home, of course.

270
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,610
Our home.

271
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,110
See you later.

272
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,860
I'm going to the library. Want to come?

273
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,150
The library?

274
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,600
Ms. Hong wanted to see me.

275
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,980
Why don't you go ahead?
 I'll join you after some errands.

276
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,700
Did you find out who 
Jang Chul Min's accomplice is?

277
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,990
Almost.

278
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,100
Who is it?

279
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,580
I'll tell you later.

280
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,620
I don't have definitive evidence yet.

281
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,600
Why are you here then?

282
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,430
I'm here to see your aunt.

283
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,420
Why?

284
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,010
To ask her if I missed anything 
from nine years ago.

285
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,060
And most of all...

286
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,940
I want to apologize to her.

287
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,390
About what?

288
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,640
To say that you're sorry for locking up

289
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,910
an innocent person for nine years?

290
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,940
Tell her that after catching the
 culprit and making them pay.

291
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,220
Don't you agree?

292
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,920
Yes.

293
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,610
That was thoughtless of me.

294
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,320
There's no time.

295
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,170
If Auntie finds out that 
Ma Ji Won was killed instead,

296
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,050
she'll try to find out who did it.

297
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,260
And if Jang Chul Min 
discovers that Auntie's alive...

298
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,170
she won't be safe.

299
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,230
I'm delaying the case 
announcement for now.

300
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,660
By any chance, if you...

301
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't worry about me.

302
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,050
But next time, bring the evidence

303
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,540
that Jang Chul Min
 kidnapped and killed the kid,

304
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,770
who the accomplice is, 
and the supporting evidence.

305
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,870
Without that, don't bother

306
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,760
coming here or contacting me.

307
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,440
You're putting Auntie's life in danger

308
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,550
by just showing up here.

309
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,670
Got it?

310
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,200
How about what I'd requested?

311
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,870
Must you really see that?

312
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,840
Yes.

313
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,930
Eun Ji.

314
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,490
It's more violent and 
devastating than you think.

315
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,700
Why must you see it anyway?

316
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,000
It's my sister's final moment.

317
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,850
Not because I want to see it...

318
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,600
but I have to see it.

319
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,710
I won't forget it...

320
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,380
Soo Ji.

321
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,340
Unni!

322
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,660
Hi!

323
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,600
Soo Ji.

324
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,260
I'll...

325
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,640
never cry.

326
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,560
♫  Somewhere deep
 inside my memory  ♫

327
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,100
♫  Your footsteps  ♫
