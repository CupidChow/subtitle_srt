1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,560
Where can you find the belongings 
of a traffic accident patient?

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,940
If the police didn't take them, 
then their guardian has them.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,210
Then Han Tae Kyu and 
Choi Woo Joon...

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,620
The accident in Rainbow Town.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,650
That hit-and-run accident?

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,210
The officer's belongings 
were claimed by his guardian,

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,580
and Choi Woo Joon's were...

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,990
Just one second.

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,430
Hey.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,600
Geez.

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,060
Did Prosecutor Yang Mi Hee send you?

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,440
To capture me?

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,330
Why?

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,620
Because I'm Seo Soo Ji's sister, 
who Prosecutor Yang Mi Hee killed?

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,040
So...

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,970
what will you do after taking me?

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,910
Huh?

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,080
Kill me then bury me?

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,810
Tell me, you thug punks!

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,290
Eun Ji.

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,520
Are  you okay?

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,720
Eun Ji, were you...

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,280
looking for this?

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,210
It was in Woo Joon's pant pocket.

25
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,690
I came here to take Woo Joon's 
clothes after the hit-and-run.

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,950
But kept this because of an inkling.

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,820
Did you look at it?

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,730
No.

29
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,090
But Woo Joon's accident...

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,720
wasn't a hit-and-run, right?

31
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,070
You stay out of it.

32
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,400
Thanks anyway.

33
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,060
Eun Ji.

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,240
You'll come back, right?

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,600
Yes.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,350
I'll come back for sure.

37
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,790
Hey, hey, hey!  Hold on.

38
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,620
We received a report.

39
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,780
Can you show me your IDs?

40
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,160
Aigoo. You're not 
behaving yourselves.

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,610
Excuse me! Come over here!

42
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,380
Seriously, these people...

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,440
Where are you going?

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,690
What did you just say?

45
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,320
Bertram?

46
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,350
You sent them money nine years ago.

47
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,340
I'm sure you're still doing that now.

48
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,560
The evidence must be there.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,890
I need that.

50
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,960
What will you do with it?

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
Will you fight with Bertram?

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,750
I must reveal Yang Mi Hee's
 true identity.

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,110
You want to dig up 
Bertram because of that?

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,080
Honey.

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,250
Yang Mi Hee is just one of 
Bertram's members.

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,300
There are judges, prosecutors and

57
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,880
a ton of well-known politicians, too.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,330
You can't deal with them alone.

59
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,010
I don't care if the King of 
Hades is one of them.

60
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,530
I can't forgive that...

61
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,460
Yang Mi Hee woman.

62
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,340
There aren't any, Honey.

63
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,010
There isn't any...

64
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,720
evidence at all.

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,970
What?

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,800
Do you have any guilty conscience left?

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,550
Don't you know why I'm doing this?

68
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,490
Okay, fine.

69
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,590
We've come this far, so 
I want to help you.

70
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,710
Yang Mi Hee deceived me, 
and I lost Min Seo.

71
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,700
And I haven't controlled our 
company since then.

72
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,970
But...

73
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,500
After the day you called me,

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,720
some people from there came.

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,760
Afterward, all records regarding 
Bertram completely disappeared.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,710
Are you serious...

77
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,360
- Hello?
 - Let me talk to Auntie. 

78
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,930
Hello?

79
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,640
I found the evidence.

80
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,720
 Where are you? 

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,790
You couldn't even capture that girl? 
What the heck are you doing?

82
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,200
 I'm sorry. 

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,820
Keep searching! Hurry!

84
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,580
May I ask who that was?

85
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,630
You.

86
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,380
I warned you not to use your brain.

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,150
Where's Jang Chul Min?

88
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,250
I couldn't track him down.

89
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,340
Shouldn't he be on the Wanted List?

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,780
Wanted List?

91
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,020
CEO Jang Chul Min
 is an important figure.

92
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,880
If he got kidnapped 
in broad daylight...

93
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,950
Stop spewing nonsense,

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,410
and go to CEO Jang's place.

95
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,650
If he's not there, 
try his vacation home.

96
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,010
Okay, will do.

97
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,060
What brings you all the way here?

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,760
 No, Honey. We'll all end up dying. 

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,150
 I'm serious, Honey! 

100
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,990
At this rate, we'll all die!

101
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,560
Honey! Honey, you must believe me!

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
 Honey! 

103
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,140
 We'll all die! 

104
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,490
 Honey! 

105
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,100
 Honey! 

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,370
Let me go!

107
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,320
Hey!

108
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,250
You better stay quiet.

109
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,030
Hey.

110
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,160
Do you know why it 
was your sister?

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,080
Why your sister was chosen 
among the other kids?

112
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,220
Shut your mouth.

113
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,310
Because you are...

114
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,630
poor folks who have nothing.

115
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,110
Huh?

116
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,580
We thought it won't be an issue...

117
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,340
even if you vanished.

118
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,780
I told you to shut up.

119
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,520
It's too bad.

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,470
This wouldn't have happened to me...

121
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,050
if we got rid of you, too.

122
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,700
Yes.

123
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,380
Keep blabbing on while you can.

124
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,850
You won't be able to after 
your mouth gets filled with dirt.

125
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,370
Could you really do that?

126
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,700
Hey, Jang Chul Min!

127
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,060
Eun Ji's gone?

128
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,040
I think Jang Chul Min took her.

129
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,900
This way.

130
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,240
 How about here? 

131
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,170
Okay then.

132
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,660
They probably didn't get far. 
Keep looking and call me back.

133
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,950
What should we do?

134
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,900
They have the evidence.

135
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,970
It was definitely 
Han Tae Kyu's doing.

136
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm positive.

137
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,830
Where's Seo Eun Ji right now?

138
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,770
I tied her up and 
put her in the trunk.

139
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,330
You managed to earn your way.

140
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,850
Ms. Ma.

141
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,310
Why don't we take that
 to the police?

142
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,090
Didn't you see the detectives
 that came earlier?

143
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,090
Then what about sending it to a
newspaper or a TV station?

144
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,080
Then what about Eun Ji?

145
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,160
 Put Eun Ji on the phone. 

146
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,250
Don't come here.
Put it on the internet, Auntie!

147
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,910
Come to Bertram by midnight 
with Han Tae Kyu's things.

148
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,480
You know where, right?

149
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,670
Evil b****!

150
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,720
Look.

151
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,260
If she does as you say, 
then everyone here will die.

152
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,130
So let's all observe quietly
 from now on.

153
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,750
I'm scared, too.

154
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll take you there.

155
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,240
But this doesn't concern you...

156
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,390
This doesn't concern me?

157
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,150
Yes, it does.

158
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,150
Eun Ji and Woo Joon...

159
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,420
are both precious to me.

160
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,150
And so are you, Ms. Ma.

161
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,340
Get in!

162
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,420
Auntie.

163
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,540
Are you okay?

164
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,580
Why did you come?

165
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,450
Why?

166
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,100
That's enough judging.

167
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,120
Release Eun Ji first.

168
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,830
What are you doing? Uncuff her.

169
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,470
All good?

170
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,400
Then give it.

171
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,220
Not until I...

172
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,140
confirm that she 
left the building safely.

173
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,500
Hurry.

174
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,260
- Auntie.
- Now.

175
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,410
Wait, wait.

176
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,310
But what happens if 
after she leaves...

177
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,510
and I still don't get the goods?

178
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,120
I'll give it to you.

179
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,890
Eun Ji.

180
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,150
Get out now.

181
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,540
That's your idea.

182
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,470
Eun Ji!

183
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,010
Auntie.

184
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,560
Eun Ji.

185
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,300
Eun Ji!

186
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,670
Snap out of it.

187
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,510
Eun Ji, snap out of it.

188
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,930
She's not dead yet. Don't worry.

189
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,980
But she'll need treatment 
soon, of course.

190
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,990
You...

191
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,440
This is it.

192
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,750
It's over now!

193
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,480
Call the ambulance.

194
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,030
Don't be so hasty.

195
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,440
CEO Jang.

196
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,640
You too.

197
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
I said, call the ambulance.

198
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,180
After we finish our chat.

199
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,720
Hurry.

200
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,830
Don't take too long.

201
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,740
Eun Ji.

202
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,270
You probably have an
 idea about Bertram.

203
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,710
How should I explain what Bertram is?

204
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,610
You can't see it,
 but it certainly exists.

205
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,660
It exists, but you can't understand it.

206
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,890
It's like a god, I guess.

207
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,970
A god who's very cruel and sensitive.

208
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,910
Stop talking and

209
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,190
call the ambulance.

210
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,500
There are two kinds of 
people in this world.

211
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,170
The ones who chose god 
and gained happiness,

212
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,320
and the ones who 
didn't and gained pain.

213
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,700
Alright.

214
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,370
You have one more chance 
to make a decision.

215
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,270
If you choose god,

216
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,030
you'll be cleared of the false charges,

217
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,100
and you'll have Korea Tech again.

218
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,740
What are you talking about?

219
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,210
And of course...

220
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,330
that Seo Eun Ji...

221
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,730
will be safe, too.

222
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,450
You think I'll believe 
such nonsense?

223
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,760
Is it too difficult to choose?

224
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,080
Then I'll make it easy for you.

225
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,600
Is it easier to choose now?

226
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,620
If I choose you people...

227
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,690
then what about Min Seo?

228
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,710
Whichever you chose, 
she won't be coming back.

229
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,240
Then you should make
 a realistic decision.

230
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,360
You're crazy.

231
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,010
You're crazy!

232
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,260
Then your answer is...

233
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,690
a no, right?

234
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,500
When Bertram ordered me to 
hear your answer,

235
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,460
honestly, I didn't want to.

236
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,830
Do you know why?

237
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,430
When I look at you, I'm
 reminded of your daughter.

238
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,520
Just like right now!

239
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,820
I told you that...

240
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,210
I'll kill the people 
who killed my daughter.

241
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,650
What is this?

242
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,060
Call for backup. Hurry.

243
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,330
Will do.

244
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,750
Detective Cheon.

245
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,230
Kill that...

246
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,250
b**** right now.

247
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,750
Are you able to move?

248
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,960
If you go in the opposite direction you 
came in, there's an elevator.

249
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,230
Why did you do that?

250
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,450
Chief Han was...

251
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,660
killed by Yang Mi Hee.

252
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,190
I didn't have the courage at first, but

253
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,800
when you came to 
see her the other day...

254
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,410
it's embarrassing to admit, 
but it encouraged me.

255
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,640
Go.

256
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,470
I'll take care of the rest.

257
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,210
The evidence 
Chief Han left behind...

258
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,150
I sent it to Chief Han's email.

259
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,610
Please check it.

260
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,910
 A mysterious organization 
called Bertram that was  

261
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,450
 exposed through a murder 
in central Daejeon 

262
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,990
 is being brought to light 
more and more. 

263
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,850
 The police investigated on
 their fund management records 

264
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,010
 and acquired a list of politicians  

265
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,510
 closely related to Bertram, 

266
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,980
 including Assemblyman Baek Doo Heon. 

267
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,020
 And East Daejeon police dept. 
which is in charge of this case, 

268
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,820
 reopened the investigation for Ms. Jang's 
murder from nine years ago. 

269
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,200
 According to the police, 
Chief Prosecutor Yang of 

270
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,000
 Daejeon Prosecutors' Office, 
who died a month ago 

271
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,640
 and CEO Jang of a Daejeon 
based company 

272
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,600
 framed his wife Ms. Choi for the crime 

273
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,270
 to take the company from her. 

274
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,560
Hey, Ms. Ma!

275
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,170
Why were you gone for so long?

276
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,660
You know Eun Ji's at home, right?

277
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,030
Let's go.

278
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,690
 

279
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,300
My goodness. Goodness.

280
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,370
Unni!

281
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,070
Ms. Ma,

282
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,760
we have a library meeting later. 
Make sure to stop by.

283
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,570
- Ms. Oh.
- Yes?

284
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,480
She's not Ms. Ma, but...

285
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,590
She's Ms. Ma to us, 
no matter what others say.

286
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,380
That's true.

287
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,270
Ms. Ma, mosey along.

288
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,640
- Make sure to come!
- See you later, Unni.

289
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,500
But this is kind of...

290
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,060
Seriously.

291
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,230
Here it is.

292
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,570
Auntie.

293
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,320
Can you call me Mom from now on?

294
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,090
Really?

295
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,630
Mom.

296
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,470
 

297
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:43,890
♫  Where will I go alone? 
On an empty street  ♫

298
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:50,090
♫  Like that day, good night.
The scattered pieces of my heart  ♫

299
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:56,190
♫  I can't forget, beyond the memories 
which I can remember  ♫

300
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:03,640
♫  I'm hiding the truth again today  ♫

301
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,650
♫  The light that's fading away  ♫

302
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,390
♫  I wish to wake up if it's a dream  ♫

303
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:16,210
♫  If it's not too late now...  ♫
