1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,380
Was it you...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,730
who killed Park Myung Hee?

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,030
If she says something she shouldn't,

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,790
my beautiful footage turns into trash.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,330
How do you make money with trash?

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,880
It'll affect both you and Lee Jung Hee.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,200
Did you demand money from
 Lee Jung Hee too?

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,730
Of course.

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,760
She should be on her 
way with money.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,050
I told you I'll pay you, didn't I?

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,890
You did.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,200
You were to pay me if I ignore that 
Jung Hee killed someone.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,500
But I told you that 
it'll come to light soon.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,680
 Go back. 

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,400
 Don't ever come, Mom. 

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,300
What did you...

17
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
just say to me?

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,080
You said "Mom"?

19
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,080
This can't be.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,500
Are you...

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,700
Listen to me carefully.

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,840
Ye Ji.

23
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,390
Are you Ye Ji?

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,970
You can't tell anyone 
you came here.

25
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,520
If someone finds out, 
just say you don't know.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,280
And delete all the texts he sent you.

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,470
Also...

28
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,890
take these and destroy them.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,820
- Ye Ji.
- Are you listening to me right now?

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,240
You need to trust me now, 
no matter what.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,160
If you don't, you'll rot away in 
prison for murder, okay?

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,700
Now go.

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,690
- Ye Ji...
- Didn't I tell you to go?

34
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,200
Oppa!

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,930
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,910
I'm here to see Manager Choi.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,770
Yoo Jung. Yoo Jung!

38
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,270
Police. Call the police!

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,140
  What are you doing? 
That's my phone. 

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,850
Somebody just ran out in a hurry.

41
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,210
Do you know who it was?

42
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,720
I think...

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,970
it was Lee Jung Hee.

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
Thank you.

45
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,600
Are you sure you saw Jung Hee?

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,190
I only saw her back since it was dark.

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,230
But I recognized her hairstyle.

48
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,600
I can't believe it either.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Why would she do that 
to Manager Choi?

50
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,470
Apparently, he threatened
 Lee Jung Hee.

51
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,780
Threatened?

52
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,030
I came after getting the call.

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,980
I'll call you again soon.

54
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,040
You may go home now.

55
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,260
You must be very shocked.

56
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,480
You guys seemed close.

57
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,020
We were close because
 I needed his help.

58
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,960
It's not what you think it is.

59
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,930
By the way, why would 
Manager Choi make threats?

60
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,400
Has Lee Jung Hee done 
something wrong?

61
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,050
You really don't know?

62
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,650
Do you think I'd know why?

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,280
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,450
I thought you guys were accomplices.

65
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,630
Why would you think I was...

66
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,450
Because I thought you were Ye Ji.

67
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,410
Who's Ye Ji?

68
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,440
A girl Jung Hee adopted 
and sent back.

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,890
I think she's about your age now.

70
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,600
I've never heard that.

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,140
Not many people know.

72
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,800
She was adopted but 
got sent back right away.

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,420
I don't understand.

74
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,870
Do you think that way?

75
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,540
This Ye Ji person.

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,130
Even if she did 
something bad to her...

77
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,890
how could she threaten...

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,770
someone she used to call "Mom"?

79
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,910
Maybe she did it because 
she used to call her "Mom."

80
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,840
The closer you are, the 
deeper the hatred can be.

81
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,150
Miss, talk to me for a second.

82
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,650
What did you say?

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,210
That Jung Hee committed murder?

84
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,360
You heard it too, right?

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
Choi Jung Chul's phone disappeared.

86
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,070
Maybe Lee Jung Hee took it 
since it proves he threatened her.

87
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,830
You think Jung Hee really did this?

88
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,950
Jung Yoo Jung saw her running away.

89
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,840
That's what I don't
 understand right now.

90
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,050
What do you mean?

91
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,450
I thought Yoo Jung was the girl 
Jung Hee had adopted.

92
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,000
To take revenge.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,540
she approached Manager Choi, 
who has evidence

94
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,360
that she's Bae Hee Jae's killer.

95
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,090
She did one thing right then.

96
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,180
The police will go see 
Lee Jung Hee soon.

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,670
For revenge, she should've called the 
police when she saw the evidence.

98
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,470
But why do you think 
she waited this long?

99
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,100
Maybe he didn't give her the evidence.

100
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,940
Don't make it too complicated.

101
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
Lee Jung Hee killed someone again,

102
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,370
and Jung Yoo Jung is the eyewitness.

103
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,590
Poisoning a wine glass and beating 
someone to death are different.

104
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,460
No, they're the same.

105
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,260
They're both murders.

106
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,460
And that also means...

107
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,130
we don't have a lot of time.

108
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,340
Ms. Ma!

109
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,380
My sunbae at the special crime 
squad had told me that...

110
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:04,120
if you can't survive on your own, 
then at least leech off others.

111
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,030
You heard of a "double bind," right?

112
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,430
Someone saw Lee Jung Hee 
running from the crime scene.

113
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,850
I'll visit her with a warrant ASAP.

114
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,550
And I might as well arrest...

115
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,410
Lee Jung Hee myself.

116
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,310
If the straws are rotten, 
strew them in the garden,

117
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,540
and use them as fertilizer instead.

118
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,540
Ms. Ma, you told me

119
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,810
Lee Jung Hee killed Bae Hee Jae.

120
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,820
But there's no evidence.

121
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,920
But still. You know where it is, right?

122
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,940
Manager Choi probably had it.

123
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,270
He threatened Jung Hee with it.

124
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,210
It's me.

125
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,070
Find out where 
Choi Jung Chul used to live.

126
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,520
And pull up all his 
recent call history, okay?

127
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,740
- But Chief.
- What?

128
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,760
If we find the evidence,

129
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,330
we'll know who killed Bae Hee Jae.

130
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,360
But I don't know who  killed 
Myung Hee and Manager Choi.

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,450
Don't worry, don't worry.

132
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,160
I'll find out once I 
interrogate Lee Jung Hee.

133
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,790
Who am I? I'm Jo Chang Gil.

134
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,050
Go Mal Koo.

135
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,050
Please come in.

136
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,670
 Mal Koo. 

137
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,740
Jae Deok?

138
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,160
Who are you?

139
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,280
Yes.

140
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,660
You know what this is, right?

141
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,430
And you know who took the 
girl wearing this, right?

142
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,110
Go away! Get away from me!

143
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,550
Tell me.

144
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,950
Who is it?

145
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,130
I heard Manager Choi's dead.

146
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
The police called me.

147
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,040
Have you seen Ms. Lee?

148
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,290
I'm afraid.

149
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,740
Isn't this funny?

150
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,490
Jung Hee's the only 
person in the world

151
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,250
whom I admired, 
cherished, and loved.

152
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,960
But now...

153
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,430
I'm afraid of her.

154
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,460
Tell me.

155
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,150
Is it true?

156
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,450
Did Jung Hee do that to

157
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,250
Myung Hee and Manager Choi?

158
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,600
Mal Koo.

159
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,710
When Park Myung Hee died...

160
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,950
Ms. Lee wasn't there.

161
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,670
How about Manager Choi?

162
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,580
Someone saw her leaving the scene.

163
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,400
That doesn't mean 
Ms. Lee was the killer.

164
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,520
- It's not?
- You should be worried about something else.

165
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,640
Today, at the set...

166
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,720
 Jae Deok! 

167
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,880
I don't know.

168
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,540
I said, I don't know!

169
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,970
 Ma'am, are you okay? 

170
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll help you remember it.

171
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,090
- Rubella. 
 - Open the door! 

172
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,060
Was that it?

173
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,680
Bae Hee Jae passed it onto you,

174
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,310
and you lost your baby.

175
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,610
That's why you killed Bae Hee Jae.

176
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,630
No. No!

177
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,220
You played the victim by 
drinking poisoned coffee.

178
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,730
Do you think only Choi Jung Cheol 
and Park Myung Hee knew that?

179
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,750
Jae Deok!

180
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,740
If I say something, 
you'll lose everything.

181
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,610
That great movie of yours...

182
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,640
and Director Seong who 
treats you like a queen. All of it.

183
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,780
- Jae Deok!
- You lost your baby?

184
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,460
I...

185
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,580
I...

186
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,130
lost my sister.

187
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,170
You know what it feels like

188
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,590
to lose someone you love.

189
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,900
The pain from losing your other half.

190
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,810
The guilt even time can't erase!

191
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,060
That's why you committed murder.

192
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,630
I understand.

193
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,020
I mean it.

194
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,690
I would've done the same.

195
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,020
So...

196
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,900
So please tell me.

197
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,850
I'm begging you.

198
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,630
- I said, I don't know!
- No!

199
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,070
You do know.

200
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,670
- I don't. I don't know!
- You do!

201
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,660
Because that bastard was here.

202
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,190
You saw him with your own eyes.

203
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,760
No. I don't know.

204
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,740
- Hey, Seo Eun Ji!
- Tell me!

205
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,870
It was that Jang Cheol Min bastard.

206
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,430
- What are you doing?
- Say it! Tell me!

207
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,060
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

208
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,910
Just say it!

209
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,350
What did you just do?

210
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,990
Seo Eun Ji.

211
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,490
If I told you...

212
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,480
will you help me?

213
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,550
Tell me.

214
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,930
No.

215
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,400
No one can help me.

216
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,920
No one will help me...

217
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,500
but me.

218
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,860
Honey.

219
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,780
Did I do something so wrong?

220
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,950
No.

221
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,770
You didn't do anything wrong.

222
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,310
Right.

223
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,570
I didn't do anything wrong.

224
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,140
But why am I so scared?

225
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,050
Don't worry. I'm here.

226
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,530
Jae Deok.

227
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,800
Rest assured, Honey.

228
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,850
I'll protect you no matter what.

229
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,770
Really?

230
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,400
Yes, it's true.

231
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,080
The police went to Director Seong's 
place last night and...

232
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,430
They seized and searched.

233
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,400
Yes, seize and search. 
That's what they did.

234
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,060
But why Jung Hee's house?

235
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,420
Manager Choi was found dead in 
Ms. Jung's studio last night.

236
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,540
My goodness.

237
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,650
- That's not the shocking part.
 - Then what is?

238
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,550
What's shocking is that
 Lee Jung Hee is the prime suspect.

239
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,840
Really?

240
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,570
And that's not everything.

241
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,610
My son said that...

242
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,710
Lee Jung Hee killed that 
woman at her party.

243
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,800
Dear God. My goodness, oh my.

244
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,020
What do you think?

245
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,520
Chief Jo apparently
 arrested Lee Jung Hee.

246
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,690
But I just can't trust that guy.

247
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,480
Come on, Ms. Oh.

248
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,620
Chief Jo would be hurt if he heard.

249
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,790
He shouldn't be. It's true.

250
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,260
What do you mean, it's true?

251
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,870
Are you taking Chief Jo's side right now?

252
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,140
Don't be silly, Ms. Yang.

253
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,010
I'm the one who should be saying that.

254
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,340
Seriously!

255
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,040
Be quiet for a second.

256
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,170
What do you think?

257
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,580
Was it really Jung Hee?

258
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,090
  
I think...

259
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,180
it's too soon to give up.

260
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,470
They only have the 
witness's testimony.

261
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,830
You want to continue?

262
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,200
We should.

263
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,250
Are you crazy?

264
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,050
How could you 
continue in this situation?

265
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,460
Why not?

266
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,990
Is Jung Hee a murderer?

267
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,490
She's not. So why cancel our movie?

268
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,530
Don't worry, Jung Hee.

269
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,640
If we prove your innocence,
 it'll help the movie.

270
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,300
Don't you think? A movie where the
 lead actress was framed.

271
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,040
They'll flock to see it out of sympathy.

272
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,350
Director Seong. Director Seong!

273
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,310
Jung Hee, what do you think?

274
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,260
I didn't say anything wrong, right?

275
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,270
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,980
I...

277
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,690
I really don't know.

278
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,540
Thanks for everything. 
I think this is the end for us.

279
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,580
I understand.

280
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,430
I'd like to say one thing
 before I leave.

281
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,530
You know Ms. Lee's 
receiving threats, right?

282
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,510
I know it was Manager Choi.

283
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,100
There are others besides him.

284
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,800
What do you mean?

285
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,350
People who want Ms. Lee dead.

286
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,510
That's enough.

287
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,930
I'm sick of it now.

288
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,250
Eun Ji did that?

289
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,190
Yes.

290
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,080
She went to Jung Hee's place 
and made a scene last night.

291
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,490
What was it about?

292
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,690
I don't know the details either.

293
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,230
It's a bit tight.

294
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,080
What do you think?

295
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,660
It's sensuous.

296
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,910
We won't need a new wardrobe then.

297
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,970
Are they changing the lead actress?

298
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,290
Jung Hee unni...

299
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,120
can't manage it anymore.

300
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,580
Of course, all this is thanks to...

301
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,490
our honorable witness.

302
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,000
Unni.

303
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,850
- I think I know.
- What?

304
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,450
The letter Woo Joon's dad 
sent to Chief Jo a while ago.

305
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,330
I mean, what was it again?

306
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,170
Yes!

307
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,390
"You're fooling around with 
someone at the library."

308
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,980
- Ms. Yang?
- Yes!

309
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,280
You saw her defending him earlier.

310
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,120
Ms. Ma.

311
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,970
Could you accompany me to a school?

312
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,480
A school?

313
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,450
I'm going to a school violence 
committee instead of Chief.

314
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,950
And Woo Joon's name was on the list.

315
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,230
I'm so sorry.

316
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,970
We'll discipline him so 
he'll understand.

317
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,470
I really wonder if he'll 
understand it that way.

318
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,230
Let's go.

319
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,710
Could I steal Woo Joon 
away for a  second?

320
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,380
Officer Bae, you?

321
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,360
I wanted to teach him something.

322
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,860
Does it feel good to hit the kids?

323
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,240
It doesn't. Are you satisfied?

324
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,700
Don't talk like that to an adult.

325
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,170
I was answering your question. Why?

326
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,340
- Woo Joon.
- I'm going now.

327
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,570
- Did they tease you again?
- Yes.

328
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,040
Then you should've told the teacher.

329
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,350
But they don't listen to the teacher.

330
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,850
Did they bring up your dad again?

331
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,570
Something about
 pigeon and sparrow?

332
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,650
- Yes.
- But didn't you say...

333
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,450
that you hate your dad?

334
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,660
I do.

335
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,960
Then why did you beat them up?

336
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,740
My dad...

337
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,870
I mean,

338
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,740
I know what that man did, too.

339
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,620
But if they badmouth him, I can't take it.

340
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,530
That's why I hit them.

341
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,210
But...

342
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,230
I get angry again afterward.

343
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,050
I hate myself so much...

344
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,520
for fighting with...

345
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,570
my classmates for...

346
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,270
someone like that.

347
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,350
 Am I wrong? 

348
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,780
If they tease him, 
you should chastise them.

349
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,220
Isn't that what a teacher should do?

350
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,840
I've told them 
numerously to get along.

351
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,230
After you told them, that's it?

352
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,940
Keep watching them, and

353
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,030
and if they try to harass him again,

354
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,810
you should've told them 
to not tease or

355
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,210
harass him in advance.

356
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,470
There are many students in a class...

357
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,220
Does everyone in your class 
tease and fight with each other?

358
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,900
They don't, right?

359
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,110
Please calm down.

360
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,400
You being like this doesn't 
help Woo Joon at all.

361
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,460
What good will it be if he keeps 
fighting with the kids?

362
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,180
Excuse me, but...

363
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,010
What's your relation to Woo Joon...

364
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,260
I was close to Woo Joon's mother.

365
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,970
- She's not his mother?
- Well, Woo Joon is a special case.

366
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,930
You're not his mother. 
You shouldn't be doing this.

367
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,400
- I shouldn't be doing what?
- You know.

368
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,410
Making a fuss about 
someone else's child...

369
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,510
Because he's like my own child!

370
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,550
You're not Woo Joon's mom. 
Why did you go there?

371
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,450
Because he keeps acting up.

372
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,250
I couldn't hold back my anger.

373
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,270
Then Woo Joon is weird, too.

374
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,430
Why would he defend someone 
who treated him like that?

375
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,250
I can understand Woo Joon.

376
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,340
Whether he hates him 
or not, he's still his dad.

377
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,200
Is Chief at the headquarters?

378
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,770
Yes, he is.

379
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,840
He's analyzing evidence 
at the forensic dept.

380
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,520
- What did Lee Jung Hee say?
- She's denying it, of course.

381
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,200
Did she...

382
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,990
mention me by any chance?

383
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,020
You?

384
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,740
- She didn't.
- I guess.

385
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,250
Because of her guilt.

386
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
Yes, Chief.

387
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,430
Right now?

388
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,400
- I'm going home soon.
 - You'd better come right now! 

389
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,180
Eun Ji.

390
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,760
It's a new car. 
Please drive carefully.

391
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,260
Don't worry. I'm covered by 
the insurance, right?

392
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,220
Of course, I changed it.

393
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,830
You came back late last night.

394
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,540
Did you meet Jung Hee?

395
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,850
Yes.

396
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,650
It'll be difficult to see her if 
she gets locked up.

397
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,550
- Did you by any chance...
- It was simple.

398
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,790
"Tell me because I know what you did."

399
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,320
"Or I'll call the cops."

400
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,090
Do you think she'll talk that way?

401
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,920
She'll act differently if 
you show her evidence.

402
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,060
Evidence?

403
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,790
Jung Yoo Jung called me.

404
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,510
Choi Jung Chul used to keep the 
memory cards on the set somewhere.

405
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,320
The police don't know about it yet.

406
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,310
The evidence might still be there.

407
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,320
Ma Ji Won.

408
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,760
You're not here to...

409
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,800
get your doll back, right?

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,840
I gave it to someone.

411
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,140
That's too bad.

412
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,410
My daughter liked it.

413
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,670
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,520
It's hard to change how I speak.

415
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,830
Tell me.

416
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,830
What is it this time?

417
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,600
I met with Lee Jung Hee recently.

418
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,300
I didn't hear what I wanted,
 but instead...

419
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,040
I got interested in your novels.

420
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,040
They're silly novels.

421
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,680
Why did they pique your interest?

422
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,110
I got a sense that 
Lee Jung Hee might be a witness.

423
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,310
Then you need to re-investigate.

424
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,030
As you know, I already resigned.

425
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,600
I didn't know that.

426
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,400
When you finish the novel,

427
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,540
I thought I may find something 
in the book which I didn't know.

428
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,210
Such as...

429
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,670
the real killer of the case

430
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,710
from nine years ago?

431
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,910
So I investigated around 
Lee Jung Hee in case.

432
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,260
And I found someone...

433
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,840
who's living with  
someone else's identity.

434
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,630
This story again?

435
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,610
It's not you, Ma Ji Won.

436
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,310
Do you know Jung Yoo Jung 
by any chance?

437
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,340
She's a famous photographer.

438
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,800
it seems like...

439
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,450
she should be in the U.S. right now.

440
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,070
 My dad, I mean... 

441
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,480
 I know what that man did, too. 

442
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,690
 But... 

443
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,340
 if they badmouth him, I can't take it. 

444
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,190
 This Ye Ji person. 

445
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,050
 Even if she did 
something bad to her, 

446
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,850
 how could she threaten... 

447
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,050
 someone she used to call "Mom"?
