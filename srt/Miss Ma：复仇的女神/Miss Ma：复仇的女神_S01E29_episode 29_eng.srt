1
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,230
Ms. Ma, please take a break.

2
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,880
Woo Joon has...

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,650
turned a corner for now.

4
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,810
Go home and come back.

5
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,700
It's Soo Ji.

6
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,230
My sister.

7
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,730
Seo Soo Ji.

8
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,210
The girl who was...

9
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,300
found dead nine years ago...

10
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,960
was my sister Soo Ji.

11
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,450
She was wearing this then.

12
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,240
Jang Chul Min...

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,670
lied that my dead sister was Min Seo.

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,310
Like Lee Seo Eun lying about 
that girl is her niece.

15
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,110
Jang Chul Min had an alibi because...

16
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,900
there's an accomplice.

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,250
Han Tae Kyu said he found out 
who the accomplice was.

18
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,880
Is that all...

19
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,980
Han Tae Kyu was trying to tell me?

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,630
I said, is that all?

21
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,350
He said he found the evidence to get

22
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,230
both Jang Chul Min 
and his accomplice.

23
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,350
And?

24
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,230
Min Seo...

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,740
This is why I couldn't tell you.

26
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,110
I was afraid you'd try to 
look for a dead girl.

27
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,620
Yes.

28
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,510
I hope Min Seo is alive, too.

29
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,490
But haven't you heard Lee Seo Eun's 
niece was found dead?

30
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,140
She was found
 in the club's backyard.

31
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,250
She's dead.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
Stop.

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,140
If Min Seo was alive, she'd be 19.

34
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,260
Her mom was framed and
 jailed for her murder.

35
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,660
For nine long years.

36
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,770
Then she made the news for

37
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,700
escaping to find the killer.

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,550
Does it make sense that 
she hasn't shown up yet?

39
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,000
I get it.

40
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,100
I told you to stop.

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,750
I'll be staying right here.

42
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,090
Which bastard did 
that to Woo Joon?

43
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,210
They weren't targeting Woo Joon.

44
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,240
Then...

45
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,670
the detective who died?

46
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,820
Why?

47
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,190
Is this related to Ms. Ma?

48
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,390
Let's talk later, Oppa.

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,140
Eun Ji!

50
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,670
Is Woo Joon okay?

51
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,480
He's turned a corner for now.

52
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,640
What a relief, really.

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,820
Poor Woo Joon...

54
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,950
Don't worry so much, Eun Ji.

55
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,470
Chief is looking everywhere
 to find the car responsible

56
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,150
for this hit-and-run.

57
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,180
They'll get him soon.

58
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,350
But what about Ms. Ma?

59
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,010
She's inside.

60
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,930
What did this young thing
 do to deserve this?

61
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
My heavens.

62
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,520
I don't know who did this, but...

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,080
I'll destroy them 
once they're caught.

64
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Unni.

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,900
What should we do 
about  Woo Joon?

66
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,140
Ms. Hong.

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,850
Talk to me for a second.

68
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,320
You want me to take in Woo Joon?

69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,180
I contacted his sister. 
She'll come soon.

70
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,490
What about you?

71
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,910
Are you going somewhere?

72
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,590
There's something I must do.

73
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,570
I don't know what it is,

74
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,940
but must you do it now?

75
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,200
With Woo Joon like that?

76
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,310
I have to do it now.

77
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,860
Eun Ji will help, too.

78
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,840
Just for a while. Okay?

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,710
Ms. Ma.

80
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,510
There's something you should see.

81
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,830
 The female prisoner who
 made news by escaping 

82
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,550
 the Korean Forensic 
Psychiatric Hospital last June 

83
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,790
 was found dead near 
Yongam Reservoir 

84
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,110
 in Daejeon on Tuesday. 

85
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,920
 The prosecutor identified the
 body using the belongings  

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,760
 found near the crime scene. 

87
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,520
 They're seeing this as
 a suicide based on her 

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,550
 call history before she died. 

89
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,520
 The death of the 
fugitive who escaped 

90
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,040
 from the Korean Forensic
 Psychiatric Hospital 

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,660
 was concluded as a
 "death-leap" suicide. 

92
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,530
She died from a skull fracture

93
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,940
while falling from the 
Yongam Mountain.

94
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,810
 Based on the text message 

95
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,070
 she sent to her husband 
before her death, 

96
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,390
 she made this decision due to 

97
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,460
 the pressure of being arrested, 

98
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,520
 and the guilt regarding her daughter. 

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,050
 On the other hand, the police 

100
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,440
 had thought the fugitive 
who had escaped 

101
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,170
 from Korea Forensic Psychiatric 
Hospital had fled to China. 

102
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,450
 So they're being criticized 
for poor investigation. 

103
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,910
Ahjussi.

104
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,100
 Detective Han of East Daejeon's 
special force police department 

105
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,590
 passed away from a hit-and-run 

106
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,790
  in a neighborhood in Gyeonggi. 

107
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,350
 The police are searching 
 by reviewing the security footage 

108
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,370
  from the neighborhood buildings. 

109
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,510
 They call that a hit-and-run? 

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,950
Han Tae Kyu told me that...

111
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,310
killing a person is nothing

112
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,130
to those people.

113
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,300
Was Writer Ma Ji Won also...

114
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,030
She was murdered.

115
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,110
Really?

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,210
There's no way she would...

117
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,880
leave a suicide note 
to Min Seo's dad.

118
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,660
Can't you stop saying
 "Min Seo's dad" now?

119
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,740
That bastard did this to 
 Min Seo and Soo Ji.

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,600
But anyhow...

121
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,310
that Jang Chul Min also

122
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,690
had an alibi on the 
day of Ma Ji Won's death.

123
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,420
Only Jang Chul Min's 
accomplice is left.

124
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,000
The woman who killed Ma Ji Won.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,810
I think...

126
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,980
I know who that woman is.

127
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,840
Prosecutor Yang Mi Hee.

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,820
 There's something I need to tell you. 

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,990
 Jung Hee told me 
before she died that 

130
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,450
 she may have... 

131
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,520
 seen that woman on TV 

132
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,930
 after the incident nine years ago. 

133
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,250
 By any chance... 

134
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,620
 did she say... 

135
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,800
 the culprit is a woman? 

136
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,420
 The moment I mention 
that woman's name, 

137
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,690
 my life will be in danger. 

138
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,560
Yang Mi Hee killed...

139
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,270
Attorney Choi Man Shik, too?

140
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,000
Then I'll...

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
search the ones released
 from that prison recently.

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,030
If someone was killed,

143
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,750
then there will be a killer.

144
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,220
What will you do?

145
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,800
I must confirm this.

146
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,730
 You'll confirm this? 

147
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,490
But how?

148
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,610
I'll ask her in person.

149
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,830
Ask whom?

150
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,840
Yang Mi Hee?

151
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,440
All we have right now is

152
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,520
merely a suspicion.

153
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,760
But if I see Yang Mi Hee in person,

154
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,910
I'll know something for sure.

155
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,370
So you'll go and see Yang Mi Hee?

156
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,780
Are you crazy?

157
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,140
Yes, it's crazy.

158
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,990
But it's the only way right now.

159
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,480
Then I'll go too. Wait here.

160
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,510
No.

161
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,860
You should wait by Woo Joon's side.

162
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
- But Auntie...
- Don't worry.

163
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,870
I'll come back for sure.

164
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,140
Yes.

165
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,810
You can consider 
Jang Min Seo's case closed now.

166
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,210
Yes, I took care of Han Tae Kyu, too.

167
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,640
Yes, got it.

168
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,850
It's me.

169
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,590
Where is Han Tae Kyu's funeral?

170
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,080
What about Chief Han's wife?

171
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,570
She was so shocked.

172
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,390
She's in the ER now.

173
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,550
Aigoo.

174
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,840
You're Yoo Ri, right?

175
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,450
Yes.

176
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,560
Don't worry, Yoo Ri.

177
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,880
I will...

178
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,700
capture the person 
who did this to your dad.

179
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,020
Please do.

180
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,170
You must.

181
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,150
 

182
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,650
Good job as the chief mourner.

183
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,600
It's the least I can do.

184
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
But how did...

185
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,400
Han Tae Kyu end up like this?

186
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm asking how he ended up like this.

187
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,420
My apologies.

188
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,220
I'm not sure either.

189
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,470
Fine.

190
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,570
There's a saying that...

191
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,450
"ignorance is bliss."

192
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,980
Remember that from now on.

193
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,740
Take care, Prosecutor.

194
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,950
You really look exactly 
like that crazy b****.

195
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,700
So...

196
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,520
what brings you all the way here?

197
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,800
Detective Han Tae Kyu...

198
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,120
died in front of my house.

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,290
It was in front of your house?

200
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,480
Yes.

201
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,220
My goodness.

202
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,840
Why did he go all the way there...

203
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,020
Then...

204
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,330
did you witness the accident yourself?

205
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,720
No.

206
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,420
I only heard about it.

207
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,480
Is that right?

208
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,040
Anyway, I thought I should...

209
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
come here and mourn.

210
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,740
He's helped me, too.

211
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,020
What do you mean, help?

212
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,040
Detective Han Tae Kyu...

213
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,590
was helping me with my research.

214
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,710
Research?

215
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,120
You said you're a writer.

216
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,070
If the book gets published, 
you'll also...

217
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,470
find it very interesting.

218
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm sorry, but...

219
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,300
I hate everything aside from

220
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,260
the statute book and the Bible.

221
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,810
I watched TV today.

222
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,980
The woman who escaped
 from prison last June...

223
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,560
was found dead, right?

224
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,810
It's a novel with that 
woman as the protagonist.

225
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,540
It's piquing my interest.

226
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,160
How much did Han Tae Kyu

227
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,240
help you with the research?

228
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,140
Almost all of it.

229
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,280
Almost all of it?

230
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,700
My interest level in 
that novel is rising.

231
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,800
The story is actually simple.

232
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,660
The woman who was jailed...

233
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,760
for murdering her daughter...

234
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,810
finds out that she was framed.

235
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,850
Then she escapes from
 the forensic hospital

236
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,870
to find the culprit.

237
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,540
So did she find the culprit?

238
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,910
She did.

239
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,200
Who is it?

240
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,570
The fugitive lady's husband.

241
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,930
What a cliché.

242
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,940
But then,

243
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,790
husbands usually kill their wives.

244
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,630
But there's one more thing.

245
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,020
The husband had an accomplice.

246
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,090
The prosecutor in charge 
of the case.

247
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,850
When can I read this novel?

248
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,630
It's almost done, but...

249
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,500
there's a mystery left

250
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,460
which I can't solve.

251
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,220
A mystery?

252
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,760
That woman's daughter.

253
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,940
 

254
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,140
 The crazy b**** showed up. 

255
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,700
 Come to the downstairs cafe. Hurry! 

256
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,900
 Her husband loved 
their daughter like crazy. 

257
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,600
He couldn't go with the plan 
if his daughter gets killed.

258
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,960
So...

259
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,510
he kidnaps a girl who's 
similar to his daughter.

260
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,890
That girl was...

261
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,290
dressed like his daughter, and...

262
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,200
got murdered with her face...

263
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,830
completely destroyed.

264
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,820
- If so...
- So what happened to...

265
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,060
that woman's daughter, 
Jang Min Seo?

266
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,620
I see why you'd be curious.

267
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,900
If the body found at the scene
 nine years ago is a different girl...

268
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,500
then where's her daughter, Jang Min Seo?

269
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,680
You lack talent as a novelist.

270
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,170
Reality is the most 
important thing in a novel.

271
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,690
If Jang Min Seo is alive,

272
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,100
she would've shown up, 
don't you think?

273
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,050
She's dead.

274
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,320
You're right.

275
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
I killed your daughter.

276
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,290
Let go!

277
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,750
Let me go!

278
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,410
This is the true reality.

279
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,200
As for the ending of your novel...

280
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,740
let's settle it at the Prosecutors' Office.

281
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,190
Take her away!

282
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,140
I have something to tell you.

283
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,970
Me too.

284
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,120
Let's take our time and chat 
when we get there.

285
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,750
But what if...

286
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,200
I'm the woman whom you claimed 
committed suicide today?

287
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,300
Crazy b****.

288
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,520
You dare try to pull tricks?

289
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,880
Yes.

290
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,190
The woman whom you claimed 
committed suicide...

291
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,660
is me.

292
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,300
Darn it.

293
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,800
But if I'm alive...

294
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,730
wouldn't you be in a bind?

295
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,070
You told the entire world 
that I'm dead.

296
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,620
But the announcement 
itself isn't important.

297
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,980
What's important comes next.

298
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,210
Then who's the dead woman?

299
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,510
Ma Ji Won?

300
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,330
But why did...

301
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,780
Ma Ji Won who's never 
met Jang Chul Min

302
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,050
send a suicide note 
as if she's a fugitive?

303
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,930
That's right.

304
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,330
The fact that it was 
fabricated will be revealed.

305
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,210
Then the people will wonder...

306
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,880
just who killed Ma Ji Won?

307
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,950
And why...

308
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,520
did they kill her?

309
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,520
There was a reason you boldly
 showed up in front of me.

310
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,530
I think we chose the 
wrong person as our partner.

311
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,140
If I knew you were this clever,

312
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,480
I would've chosen you 
instead of Jang Chul Min.

313
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,320
But remember...

314
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,550
this will be the last time

315
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,590
you escape by pulling tricks.

316
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,910
Release her.

317
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,400
Auntie.

318
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,600
I saw everything.

319
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,940
Do you know how nervous I was?

320
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,840
Why did you come here?

321
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,710
When did I ever listen to you?

322
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,770
What about Woo Joon?

323
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,060
Don't worry.

324
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,860
Mal Koo oppa and Ms. Hong are
 taking turns watching him.

325
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,280
Since you came all the 
way here, let's go together.

326
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,190
To where?

327
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,920
Do you have a picture of Soo Ji?

328
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,670
Maybe it's a good thing.

329
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,350
Because Min Seo and

330
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,270
Soo Ji are...

331
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,380
together.

332
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,860
Let's go back.

333
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,190
What did Yang Mi Hee say?

334
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,230
Later.

335
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,850
This isn't the place to bring that up.

336
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
You're right.

337
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,260
 

338
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,570
 

339
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,960
Hello, this is Yang Mi Hee.

340
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,520
Okay. I'll be on my way.

341
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,730
Prosecutor Yang Mi Hee?

342
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,720
Yes.

343
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,990
The woman who died 
a few days ago...

344
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,140
was Ma Ji Won, the mystery writer.

345
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,730
And you just met the woman...

346
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,930
who was supposed to die.

347
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,640
There's no evidence left 
other than that woman.

348
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,790
Don't worry.

349
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,810
I'll take responsibility 
and take care of it.

350
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,750
Responsibility?

351
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,310
You must think you're...

352
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,780
important enough to 
use words like that.

353
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,310
Fine.

354
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,220
I'll observe how you take care of it.

355
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,850
But until then, 
Bertram will be inactive.

356
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,520
Remember...

357
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,540
that you can end up like

358
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,470
Attorney Choi Man Shik anytime.
