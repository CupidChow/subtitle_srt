1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,690
 

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,380
This is 211, the police department.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,210
 I'm in Seonhadong, in Junggu. 

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,950
Yes, Sir. Go ahead.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,830
My daughter was... 
My daughter was kidnapped.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,470
Please stay calm, Sir.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,970
Could you tell me more?

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,320
My wife left with the money 
to take care of it herself.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,270
 She told me not to report it, 
but I was too worried. 

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,090
 Okay, I'm glad you did. 

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,370
 Do you know where your 
wife is headed to? 

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,340
 I'm not sure. What should we 
do about Min Seo? 

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,180
 
 What's your wife's cell number? 

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,310
 I'll track her phone right away. 

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,870
 Also, the police will be calling your cell. 

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,910
 Stay calm and wait at home. 

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,200
- Hello?
 - This is Han Tae Kyu from Junggu's special force. 

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,800
Hello?

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,120
- Track her phone location again.
- Yes, Sir.

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,820
 

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,800
 

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,550
Attention!

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,770
The child's name is Jang Min Seo.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,800
She's a 10-year-old girl.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,170
Her mom's in her late 30's 
with shoulder-length hair.

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,220
She's wearing a purple outfit and

27
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,260
carrying a black suitcase with money.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,270
 She may have given the 
suitcase to the kidnapper. 

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,390
 We don't have any info about 
the kidnapper yet. 

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,060
 If you see anyone suspicious, 
detain them first. 

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,500
 The most important thing is 

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,290
 the child's security, understand? 

33
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,360
- I heard someone over there!  
 - Let's go!

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
 

35
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,980
 It's this way! 

36
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,670
We found this near the crime scene.

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,860
Do you recognize it?

38
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,560
Could you confirm if 
she's your daughter?

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,300
This can't be, Honey.

40
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,440
This can't be.

41
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,970
Yes, it's...

42
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,430
Min Seo.

43
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,060
No!

44
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,600
Look.

45
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,550
Yes.

46
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,710
I've disciplined her before.

47
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,160
I've fought with her

48
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,690
- because I wanted to keep her, but...
 - But...

49
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,460
you killed her since 
she wouldn't listen.

50
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,890
Because you couldn't have her...

51
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,960
you killed her by smashing her with a rock 
so no one could have her!

52
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,950
- No!
- Why did you kill her so brutally?

53
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,750
Were you afraid of 
seeing your dead daughter?

54
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,540
You'd feel less guilty if you 
smashed her face?

55
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,670
That woman saw him!

56
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,990
That woman said 
she saw the real culprit!

57
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,020
She really said so!

58
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,580
There's a witness!

59
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,130
Yes, I saw a ghost!

60
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,440
Crazy b****.

61
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,260
What are you doing? Take her out.

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,170
Min Seo!

63
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,290
Min Seo!

64
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,620
Stop!

65
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,110
Attorney.

66
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,590
What the heck happened?

67
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,640
 

68
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,750
The fingerprint test results 
from the suspect's car.

69
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,080
The suspect? Watch what you say!

70
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,050
 

71
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,730
Attorney.

72
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,410
What is all this?

73
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,950
Jang Min Seo's blood and 
fingerprints were found in this car.

74
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,110
There's no proof that my 
wife drove this car here!

75
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,100
The fingerprints on the driver's side are hers.

76
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,760
It's not true, right?

77
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,480
There's no way you'd hurt...

78
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,440
our Min Seo.

79
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,630
Honey.

80
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,320
Honey!

81
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,670
What time is it now?

82
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,590
Min Seo will be back from the academy.

83
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,960
Don't worry, Honey.

84
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,230
I'll pick Min Seo up.

85
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,120
I need to cook for Min Seo.

86
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,830
But she won't eat vegetables.

87
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,550
Don't worry, Honey.

88
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,290
I'll...

89
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,910
get you out no matter what.

90
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,280
If Attorney Yoon can't,

91
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll get the best lawyers in the country...

92
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,530
and prove your innocence.

93
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,760
Are you listening to me?

94
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,920
Honey.

95
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,050
Should I try blending them for her?

96
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,530
Honey.

97
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,350
Honey...

98
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
It's time for you to leave.

99
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,100
The visiting hours ended. 
Why don't you go home?

100
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,140
Okay, I will.

101
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,010
It's me.

102
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,370
Yes.

103
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,020
I'll meet with Lee Jung Hee.

104
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,170
Yes.

105
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,770
I'm seeing a buyer around there anyway.

106
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,480
I'll visit her then.

107
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,370
Okay.

108
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,510
 

109
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,050
 

110
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,050
Ki Baek, slow down!

111
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,290
You'd think his mother had collapsed.

112
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,050
How did today's shoot go?

113
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,620
We only finished half way.

114
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,790
You know how much the staff costs?

115
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,240
Where's Director Seong?

116
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,730
He's in there.

117
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,570
What happened to Jung Hee?

118
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,360
Was something in her coffee?

119
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,160
What else could it be but caffeine?

120
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,720
Other than the low hemoglobin count, 
there isn't anything wrong.

121
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,770
Also, don't skip meals and eat well.

122
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,500
No coffee or green tea for a while.

123
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,420
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

124
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,390
After a few days of rest, 
you'll be back to normal.

125
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,470
- Okay.
- Okay then.

126
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,700
Excuse me for a sec.

127
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,530
Did you really come empty-handed?

128
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,250
How disappointing.

129
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,530
How can you joke around?

130
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,020
Do you know how scared I was 
when I heard you fainted?

131
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,390
The drug test came out to be negative.

132
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,800
It was very clean.

133
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,790
Let me know if you have any concerns.

134
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,740
I'll run the tests again.

135
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,430
It's okay.

136
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,450
Thank you, Doctor.

137
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,560
What's wrong?

138
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,620
This is Jung Hee's...

139
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,320
I can call her Jung Hee, right?

140
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,130
Anyhow, this is the coffee 
Jung Hee was drinking.

141
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,470
It's better to be safe than sorry, right?

142
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,850
I'll examine this coffee in case.

143
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,440
Excuse me.

144
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,810
- Pardon?
- Which room is Lee Jung Hee in?

145
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,350
It's #1001.

146
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,910
Thank you.

147
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,840
You'll get better.

148
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,090
Hey, well...

149
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,550
Unni, you must be okay.

150
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,610
I was worried about you.

151
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,030
Arsenic?

152
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,440
It was a little, but it was in there.

153
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,480
Arsenic means poison.

154
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,600
But what was it? Looked like coffee.

155
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,660
It's not just coffee, 
it's the coffee of truth.

156
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,120
Pardon?

157
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,690
The coffee will prove that 
Jung Hee's not a suspect.

158
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,990
What are you talking about?

159
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,950
You'll see.

160
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,360
There was poison in the coffee?

161
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,920
Yes.

162
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,970
By the way...

163
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,940
your name was Bae Do Hwan?

164
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,300
Yes, so what?

165
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,620
 It was poison? 

166
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,120
A small amount, but arsenic was 
found in Lee Jung Hee's coffee.

167
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,520
- How about the investigation?
- Not yet.

168
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,080
That Bae Hee Jae who just died...

169
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,260
She died by drinking poison 
from Lee Jung Hee's glass.

170
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,490
Now there's poison in her coffee 
but no investigation?

171
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,270
I don't think our Headquarters 
know about it yet.

172
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,000
Is Chief at the station?

173
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,460
I think he went to the hospital.

174
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,500
Director Seong asked us 
for the test results.

175
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,430
 

176
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,150
I understand your shock.

177
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,680
Of course you would be.

178
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,380
But this isn't necessarily bad.

179
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,510
What do you mean by that?

180
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:53,410
This excludes Jung Hee from the 
suspect list for Bae Hee Jae's murder.

181
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,880
It's a blessing in disguise, Director.

182
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,620
What's important right now is a

183
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,070
discreet and prompt investigation.

184
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,240
If the word gets out about poison in

185
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,390
Jung Hee's coffee, 
the press will have a field day.

186
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,860
Which will make you and 
Jung Hee uncomfortable,

187
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,160
and the movie will suffer, too.

188
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't you think?

189
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,420
So I was thinking that

190
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,860
if you could...

191
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,040
put me in charge of this case?

192
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,910
I, Jo Chang Gil...

193
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,050
will catch that bastard 
discreetly and ASAP.

194
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,370
That bastard? You have 
someone in mind?

195
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,200
It's An Sung Tae.

196
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,640
I'm 100% sure it's him.

197
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,570
It smells so nice.

198
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,510
I know, right?

199
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,900
What a relief.

200
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,980
We brewed that ourselves 
at Ms. Oh's place.

201
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,390
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

202
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,670
Don't mention it.

203
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,220
It wasn't just anyone, 
it was you who fell ill.

204
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,660
As the president of our committee, 
I couldn't ignore it.

205
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,430
Where are you going?

206
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,690
To the hotel.

207
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,650
I told you to care for Jung Hee 
until she goes home.

208
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,820
There's a lot of people in there.

209
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,000
You come here often, too.

210
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,550
You better not push it.

211
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,530
One can only take so much.

212
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,980
Hello?

213
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,450
I wanted to call you when 
I heard you were shooting.

214
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,380
I finally got around to it.

215
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,820
You know what?

216
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,590
I debated if I should come, 
but wanted to ask you something.

217
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,300
What is it?

218
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,640
What are you curious about?

219
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,430
Are you a fugitive?

220
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,510
Or were those detectives wrong?

221
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,550
Two detectives came after you left.

222
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,420
Are you curious?

223
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,110
No.

224
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,740
It doesn't concern me anyway.

225
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,390
So why did you want to see me?

226
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,910
I'd like to meet CEO Koo Ki Baek.

227
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,340
Why do you want to see him?

228
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,570
I'm worried about Jung Hee.

229
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,930
If she's in much danger,

230
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,170
she can't work on this film, right?

231
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,720
I think so.

232
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,600
What do you think?

233
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,870
Did Jung Hee unni really see...

234
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,970
that murderer from 
nine years ago or not?

235
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,040
What do you think?

236
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,540
I think she did.

237
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,250
And Ki Baek probably knows that.

238
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,180
Is that so?

239
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,670
I called Ki Baek after you and 
the detectives left.

240
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,480
I bluffed that I know what Jung Hee unni

241
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,630
saw that day, and he 
called me back immediately.

242
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,610
And?

243
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,400
By any chance...

244
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,460
What do you mean poison?

245
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,010
What does that mean?

246
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,330
The crew's on standby for now.

247
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,390
I told them we'd start again 
next week or so.

248
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,660
I can start tomorrow.

249
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,220
You might as well rest this week.

250
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,730
Then should I postpone the 
investors' meeting, too?

251
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,350
No, we should keep that.

252
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,200
The crew understands since 
they're like family.

253
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,310
But the investors are different.

254
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,120
Will you be okay?

255
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,730
Don't worry, Jae Deok.

256
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,920
Yes, I'm at the hospital.

257
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,370
Why?

258
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,880
 I heard there was arsenic in 
Jung Hee's coffee. 

259
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,590
I need to see you now.

260
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,130
Later.

261
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,860
I must take care of something now.

262
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,790
 Director Seong, 

263
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,220
Bae Hee Jae died from 
drinking Jung Hee's wine.

264
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,740
And the coffee was poisoned, too.

265
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,760
What's more urgent than that?

266
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,940
I think I warned you that

267
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,850
I won't allow you to lurk around us.

268
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,430
Calm down and have a seat.

269
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,830
- No.
- Director Seong.

270
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,270
You remember the murder on the first day of 
shooting for The Shaman, right?

271
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,510
What about it?

272
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,460
Jung Hee went missing briefly that day.

273
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,690
So?

274
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,410
Perhaps Jung Hee witnessed 
the murderer then?

275
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,670
That's nonsense.

276
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,940
Jung Hee didn't see anything.

277
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,580
The investigation notes state otherwise.

278
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,030
You stay out of this.

279
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,980
The suspect insisted that 
Jung Hee saw the murderer.

280
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,140
She was ignored, of course.

281
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,580
But what if the suspect was right?

282
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,950
- So what?
- Don't you understand?

283
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,910
The murderer could target the witness.

284
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,310
I mean, Jung Hee.

285
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,570
It's been over 10 years.

286
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,290
Why would they do this now?

287
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,230
Because Jung Hee was
 hiding for 10 years.

288
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,780
But now...

289
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,930
her daily life is on public display.

290
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,480
Which includes the murderer too.

291
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,590
Let's change the crew.

292
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,140
- What?
- Please persuade Jung Hee.

293
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,890
No way.

294
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,160
This film's very 
important to Jung Hee.

295
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,070
Is the film more
 important than her life?

296
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,300
Fine, tell me.

297
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,920
Why did Jung Hee disappear that day?

298
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,790
And when she showed up,

299
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,020
she quit and became a 
hermit for nine years!

300
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,870
I had to deal with all the reporters.

301
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,260
There was a reason.

302
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,550
Are you sure she didn't see the murderer?

303
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,080
And if she admitted it, 
then she'd face trouble?

304
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,940
Isn't that why she left you 
and became a hermit?

305
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,260
I said, no.

306
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,780
Then what was it?

307
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,550
Think carefully, Jae Deok.

308
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,170
You can always make more films.

309
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,930
But if something happens to Jung Hee,

310
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,290
there's no next time.

311
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,420
Fine.

312
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,740
I'll ask Jung Hee first.

313
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,870
What's there to ask?

314
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,380
Her life is at stake. 
They need a new actress.

315
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,390
You stay out of it.

316
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:03,310
The interview you 
requested will be difficult.

317
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,240
Director Seong's really against it.

318
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,880
Can I ask you something then?

319
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,540
Go ahead.

320
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,480
When did you realize that

321
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,790
Jung Hee saw the murderer?

322
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:20,020
I'm assuming based
 on what you said.

323
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,770
I don't know if she 
witnessed him or not.

324
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,310
Then why did you call me that day?

325
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,080
Wasn't it because you knew that?

326
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
I said, stay out of it.

327
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,190
Ki Baek, you're too much.

328
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,760
I'm worried about Jung Hee unni.

329
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,220
You're worried about Jung Hee?

330
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,280
You?

331
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,160
What a freaking joke.

332
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,630
Ki Baek.

333
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,280
How could you be selfish 
in this situation?

334
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
What did I do?

335
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,140
You think you'll be the lead if 
something happens to Jung Hee?

336
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,040
You should know your place.

337
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,760
Jung Hee's in a different league from you.

338
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,630
I think you're going too far.

339
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,120
No, Ms. Ma.

340
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,710
I'm okay.

341
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,470
I'm sorry. The reason why I called her...

342
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,570
was due to the scandal.

343
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,020
A scandal?

344
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,870
We were almost ready to 
start Innocence then.

345
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,890
We had to prevent 
Jung Hee from being

346
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,240
involved in a notorious jailbreak.
