1
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,630
It was him, right?

2
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,770
The bastard who
 told you to kidnap Soo Ji.

3
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,320
Get them.

4
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,280
Stop right there.

5
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,610
Mal Koo.

6
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,670
Mal Koo, are you there?

7
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,050
CEO.

8
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640
If you want to come any further,

9
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,580
then kill me right now.

10
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,830
But If you keep me alive,

11
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,430
your parents, siblings, and children...

12
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,910
will be going to hell before me.

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,150
Today will be the last day 
we back out, CEO.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,290
CEO.

15
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,150
You lost her?

16
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,830
Then what about Jang Sun Doo?

17
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,560
It seemed like she was with him.

18
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,040
They already took him away.

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,550
Took him away?

20
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,520
 We'll look around and call you back. 

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,180
Jang Sun Doo is...

22
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,540
the punk who brought 
us Seo Soo Ji.

23
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,690
That punk was alive?

24
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,600
You said you killed him!

25
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,180
I told you that he saw me.

26
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,330
There's no need to be scared.

27
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,960
He's in a vegetative state 
and can't lift a finger.

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,490
Then why did they take him away?

29
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,970
He can't lift a finger, so why?

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,280
 Yes, Prosecutor. 

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,130
Be quiet.

32
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,310
Otherwise, you'll be
 in a vegetative state.

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,970
Try tracking that 
crazy b****'s phone again.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,230
Her cell phone is...

35
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,000
turned off?

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,470
Yes. The first flight tomorrow.

37
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,800
The destination?

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,210
I don't care. Whichever
 is the earliest flight.

39
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,180
What are you doing?

40
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,260
I really think I chose
 the wrong person.

41
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,470
What did you say?

42
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,590
If I locked you up for being crazy

43
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,910
and chose your wife as my partner,

44
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,670
at least I wouldn't have this mess.

45
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,660
What?

46
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,740
Listen to my words carefully 
from now on and obey them.

47
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,240
When the sun comes up, 
go to work as usual.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,450
Have a meeting and eat lunch, too.

49
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,580
And make sure to attend any events.

50
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you crazy?

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,320
My wife could show up anytime.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,390
Are you scared?

53
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,160
Just endure it and 
go about your business.

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,540
That way, your wife will 
approach you easily.

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,870
You'll use me as bait?

56
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,780
You should earn your keep...

57
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,140
if you're Korea Tech's CEO.

58
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,230
By the way,

59
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,640
where is she?

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,790
Jang Min Seo.

61
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,190
I mean, your daughter's corpse.

62
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,640
I cremated her and...

63
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,190
threw her ashes in the ocean.

64
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,810
You did?

65
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,870
What a heartless dad. 
A heartless dad.

66
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,270
 

67
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,560
Just relax.

68
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,410
We'll be seeing each other 
for a long time.

69
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,300
Huh, I see.

70
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,350
Jang Sun Doo is Jang Il Koo's son.

71
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,790
Who's this?

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,010
He was the leader of Ilkoo Gang.

73
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,950
He took care of Jang Il Koo 
after he retired.

74
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,990
So these guys disappeared too, right?

75
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,110
Yes.

76
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,550
That crazy b**** must be 
with these people.

77
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,910
I've already talked 
to your chief, so

78
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,990
look for them with a 
few trusty guys.

79
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,270
- Call me if you find them.
- Yes.

80
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,630
But Prosecutor...

81
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,930
Why did you release that 
crazy b**** a few days ago...

82
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,820
when she was in front of your eyes?

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,080
Remember this from now on.

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,670
I'll be the brains here, so

85
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,790
you just do as I say.

86
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,190
Got it?

87
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,390
- You turned off your phone, right?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,180
Where are we anyway?

89
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,110
Someone's house. He owes CEO one.

90
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,320
We can relax for a few days.

91
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,620
Let's go. CEO needs rest, too.

92
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,530
Geez, darn it.

93
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,580
There's no way...

94
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,130
When I went to Bertram,
 it was packed with people.

95
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,570
I don't know.

96
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,910
The whole building was empty
 when I went there today.

97
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,920
That's even weirder.

98
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,890
All those people 
disappearing suddenly.

99
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,220
I agree.

100
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,190
If we want to reveal 
Yang Mi Hee's true identity,

101
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,920
we need to confirm 
what exactly Bertram does.

102
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,000
Then Jang Chul Min 
needs to tell us.

103
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,260
Will we be able to find him?

104
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,130
He must be hiding because 
he knows you're alive.

105
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,150
I called the company, 
and he's at work.

106
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,330
And he didn't cancel 
any of his schedules.

107
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,730
As usual?

108
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,460
Ms. Ma, by any chance...

109
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,510
Yes, it's too dangerous.

110
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,490
Let's think of a different way.

111
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,200
This is a trap Yang Mi Hee 
set up for you.

112
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,530
Jang Chul Min is the bait.

113
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,680
I think so too.

114
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,690
But we have no choice.

115
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,620
Since time isn't on our side.

116
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,660
 

117
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,940
That woman is here.

118
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,050
Where are you?

119
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,500
 The Cultural Development Agency. 

120
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,720
Thanks to Korea Tech's full support,

121
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,620
we're opening earlier than expected.

122
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,130
- Yes.
- Thank you so much, CEO Jang.

123
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,190
I'm glad I could help.

124
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,010
Then let me show you 
the second floor.

125
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,980
Jang Chul Min!

126
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,960
Let go of me!

127
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,660
What are you doing? Take her away.

128
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,500
Let me go!

129
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,850
CEO Jang, are you okay?

130
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,800
We got her.

131
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,040
 Are you sure? 

132
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,760
Yes, I'm sure.

133
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,600
Hey.

134
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
What's going on?

135
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,810
You bastards!

136
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,750
I said, what's going on?

137
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,480
 Can you hear me? 

138
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,050
 You bastards! 

139
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,860
 I said, can you hear me? 

140
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,360
 You'll see me again soon. 

141
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,390
Excuse me. Excuse me!

142
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,680
No, no, no. I don't know 
anything. It wasn't me!

143
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,880
This is the girl you kidnapped, right?

144
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,580
The one who ordered you...

145
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,530
is this man, right?

146
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,380
No, Honey.

147
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,770
It wasn't me, Honey!

148
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,960
Liar.

149
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,320
- It was you.
- Eun Ji.

150
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,550
Why? Why did you 
do that to my Soo Ji?

151
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,600
- Bring Soo Ji back. Bring her back!
- Eun Ji!

152
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,130
Bring my Soo Ji back.

153
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,580
Bring her back!

154
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,690
Bring her back, you bastard!

155
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,410
I said, bring her back!

156
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,280
Honey.

157
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,740
Honey.

158
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,360
I didn't want to do it.

159
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,440
You know that...

160
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm not capable of such things.

161
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,060
I did it because that 
woman ordered me to.

162
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,270
Yes! That Yang Mi Hee 
ordered me to do it!

163
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,700
Please believe me, Honey!

164
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,820
Get up.

165
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,070
Honey.

166
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,790
I said, get up.

167
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,950
Where is Min Seo?

168
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,370
Honey.

169
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,320
I asked where Min Seo is.

170
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,110
I have somewhere to be.

171
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,920
Call this number

172
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,360
if anything happens.

173
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,630
I'll go with  you.

174
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,700
No.

175
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,640
You stay here with Eun Ji.

176
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,340
They're on the hunt for you.

177
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,640
You can't go by yourself.

178
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,650
Go with Mal Koo oppa.

179
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,230
I'll be fine alone.

180
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,710
Let's do that.

181
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,380
Will you be okay?

182
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,490
Yes.

183
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,030
He deserves to die a hundred times.

184
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,060
I swore that I'll kill him myself...

185
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,660
when I find Soo Ji's killer.

186
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,220
I've sworn many times.

187
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,250
Your sister doesn't want 
you to kill for revenge.

188
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,910
There's an order for revenge, too.

189
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,970
First of all,

190
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,140
find the ones who hired Sun Doo...

191
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,900
and reveal everything they've done.

192
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,350
Whether you'll kill him or 
not comes afterward.

193
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,510
The detective who 
had the evidence died.

194
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,130
That detective...

195
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,570
was trailing Ms. Ma, right?

196
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,680
I've seen a lot of detectives like him.

197
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,190
They're like hunting dogs that 
never let go once they bite.

198
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,610
They all have one thing in common.

199
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,590
If it's important evidence,

200
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,160
they always make a copy.

201
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,210
So even if something 
happens to them,

202
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,460
the culprit  could still be jailed.

203
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,250
Is this the place?

204
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,630
Is Min Seo here?

205
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,940
Honey, please believe me.

206
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,590
I had no idea that'd happen to Min Seo.

207
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,810
 

208
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,300
Min Seo.

209
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
Jang Min Seo!

210
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,410
Min Seo.

211
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,110
Where's Min Seo?

212
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
Min Seo.

213
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,700
Jang Min Seo?

214
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,300
Daddy's here!

215
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,420
Min Seo.

216
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,030
Min Seo.

217
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,480
Min Seo.

218
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,960
Min Seo!

219
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,750
Min Seo?

220
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,410
Min Seo!

221
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,930
Min Seo!

222
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,620
Min Seo!

223
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,940
No, Min Seo...

224
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,830
Your wife is probably 
at the police station.

225
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,140
No, Min Seo...

226
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,350
The police will contact you,

227
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,450
so go home for now.

228
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,360
I'll take care of her.

229
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,100
Take care of her?

230
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,830
Take care of her?

231
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,810
You said Min Seo was okay!

232
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,780
You said Min Seo would be okay!

233
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,830
That's why we 
kidnapped another girl.

234
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,350
So why?

235
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,000
Is this what they 
call "self-deception?"

236
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,850
What?

237
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,430
You already knew it.

238
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,740
You knew I was lying about your
 daughter being safe.

239
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,150
No.

240
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,850
No?

241
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,250
Are you a fool?

242
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,610
How can you succeed in 
framing a mom for a murder

243
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,050
if her daughter is still alive?

244
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,330
Yes.

245
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,600
Her mom went to jail for killing her.

246
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,960
What child would not do anything?

247
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,480
She'd run out and 
say that she's still alive

248
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,580
and that her mom is innocent!

249
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,910
No!

250
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,820
I thought I could send her abroad.

251
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,980
I thought it'd be okay if 
she was at a place...

252
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,960
where the news won't reach her.

253
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,430
It's your charm that 
you think the way you want.

254
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,820
But you know that it's...

255
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,930
complete nonsense.

256
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,970
Don't you?

257
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,230
No. No, this is wrong.

258
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,550
I'll go and tell the police...

259
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,000
that I'm completely innocent!

260
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,910
I warned you...

261
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,060
that there's no turning back
 once you start.

262
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,090
No.

263
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,680
I can stop right now.

264
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,380
If you stop pedaling, 
the bike will fall over.

265
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,110
The ones on the bike will get hurt.

266
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,530
Because that can't happen,

267
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,700
I kept pedaling instead of you!

268
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,230
No, no...

269
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,880
No.

270
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
Min Seo.

271
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,530
Min Seo.

272
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
Yes.

273
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,680
Min Seo liked these flowers.

274
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,080
 Aren't they pretty? 

275
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,410
Why do you like these anyway?

276
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,980
You'll meddle in 
what kind of flowers I like?

277
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,620
But still.

278
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,770
There are roses...

279
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,670
and lilies, too.

280
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,350
Yes, tulips are pretty, too.

281
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,990
I like their name's meaning.

282
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,170
Their name's meaning?

283
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,060
Min Seo, you know 
about such things?

284
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,160
Listen.

285
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,350
They're called mini-mums.

286
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,270
Yes. Mini chrysanthemums.

287
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,440
They're chrysanthemums?

288
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
Mini chrysanthemums.

289
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,670
Are you saying that...

290
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,410
you know their name meaning without 
knowing they're chrysanthemums?

291
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,240
Anyway, I do know the meaning.

292
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,570
Okay, let's hear it.

293
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,620
You don't know the flower's name,

294
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,550
but you know the flower 
name's meaning. Let's hear it.

295
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,780
The meaning is?

296
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,460
It's "Let's be friendly."

297
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,930
- Let's be friendly?
- Yeah.

298
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,230
The word "mini-mum" 
comes from "playing house."

299
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,080
Let's be friendly as if we're 
playing "mums."

300
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,370
That's why they're mini-mums.

301
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,140
Min Seo!

302
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,030
Jang Min Seo?

303
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,080
Okay.

304
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,980
Should we try what we 
practiced again?

305
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,510
Mom. Mommy!

306
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,210
- Did I do well?
- Yes, you did a great job.

307
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,210
By the way, when is Daddy coming?

308
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,120
Daddy?

309
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,810
No.

310
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,560
Min Seo!

311
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,200
Min Seo! No!

312
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,020
Min Seo.

313
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,260
The foolish mom of yours...

314
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,030
hands hurt.

315
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,090
You're buried like this right now.

316
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,120
Min Seo.
