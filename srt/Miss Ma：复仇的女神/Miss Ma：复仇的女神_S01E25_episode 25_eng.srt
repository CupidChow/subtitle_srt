1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,020
 

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,530
 Hello? 

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,560
It's okay.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,500
The child will be safe.

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,030
I'm your dad's employee.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,970
Answer it. It's your dad.

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,150
Hello?

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,480
 Yes, Min Seo. 

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Daddy!

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,350
Dad has a situation today.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,170
Do you want to come in 
Mom's car today?

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,640
I don't want to ride in Mom's car.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,380
 It's just for today, okay? 

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,620
Then order me pizza 
for dinner, okay?

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,020
Then should we have a 
pizza party at the villa today?

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,450
Not at home?

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,660
Let's call Mom and have a 
pizza party, okay?

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,600
- Mom, too?
 - Of course. 

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,890
 - You like that too, right? 
- Yes, Daddy.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,720
Mommy.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,120
Will your mom even budge this way?

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,680
I heard you're good at acting, Min Seo.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,410
You can sound a little sadder,  right?

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,850
Mom. Mommy!

25
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,210
Did  I do well?

26
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,930
Yes, it was great.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,480
By the way, when's Daddy coming?

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,780
Daddy?

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,240
 

30
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,520
 

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,840
Hello?

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,200
 I have the child. 

33
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,180
Hello?

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,310
 Prepare 1 billion won and... 

35
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,810
 wait for my next order. 

36
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,200
 If you call the police... 

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,650
 Min Seo will die. 

38
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,170
Who are you?

39
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,860
Hello?

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,210
Put Min Seo on the phone.

41
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,770
 Min Seo? 

42
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,980
 Didn't you pick her up? 

43
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,520
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,180
Today's your day to pick Min Seo up.

45
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,460
I went to the academy and 
they said you picked her up.

46
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,550
You didn't?

47
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,850
 

48
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,920
 

49
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,140
 Hello? 

50
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,210
 Mom! 

51
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,300
 Are you okay? 

52
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,370
 Min Seo. 

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,170
 1 billion won in cash. 

54
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,920
 Who are you? 

55
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,030
 If you want to see her, 

56
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,150
 come to Seoul National Cemetery
 by 11 with the money. 

57
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,060
Hello?

58
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,910
 By 12 o'clock... 

59
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,470
How can I trust you?

60
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,800
 How can I trust that 
you'll release Min Seo... 

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,220
  if I pay you? 

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,920
 Come to Youngam Reservoir 
by 12 o'clock. 

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,130
You'll get the money...

64
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,390
only if you return Min Seo safely.

65
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,590
You know what I mean, right?

66
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,080
Oh, dear. You should be careful.

67
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,620
 

68
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,420
 

69
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,840
 

70
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,730
 

71
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,390
 Hello? 

72
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,450
It's all done now.

73
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,430
What about Min Seo?

74
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,870
What about my Min Seo?

75
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,120
Don't worry.

76
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,790
Min Seo is safe.

77
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,820
Where is my Min Seo right now?

78
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,920
  Stay calm. 

79
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,020
What's important right 
now is your attitude.

80
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,340
Remember that police 
found the bodies of

81
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,970
the mother and the child.

82
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,500
My Min Seo is safe, right?

83
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,730
Remember.

84
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,260
Don't throw a wrench in the works.

85
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,520
Should I call the police?

86
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,370
There's no need to.

87
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,540
You got the text, right?

88
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,860
Yes.

89
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,370
 When your wife's 
corpse gets found, 

90
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,820
the police will be calling you.

91
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,030
Think of what you'll say 
so they won't be suspicious.

92
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,420
I will.

93
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,720
 

94
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,580
 Answer me. 

95
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,230
 What is this? 

96
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,190
Why must our company...

97
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,540
acquire all these properties?

98
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,050
We acquired them to build factories.

99
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,630
We got approved by the board, too.

100
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,260
Then what about this?

101
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,070
Is this a slush fund?

102
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,170
Anything else I don't know about?

103
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,270
This decision came after running the 
company for the last few years.

104
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,280
If our company can't find a new 
engine of growth, it'll end up dying.

105
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,050
To enter a new business arena, 
we need to build  new factories.

106
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,480
To be a forerunner,

107
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,520
we need some funds as well.

108
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,180
Look.

109
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,210
This is the product we made,

110
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,750
and we'll keep making  it.

111
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,420
The new engine of growth

112
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,910
and new business are all in here.

113
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,980
Then we must expand the labs

114
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,050
and hire more people to work there.

115
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,550
But you acquired all these lands...

116
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,290
and made "dirty" money?

117
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,640
"Dirty" money?

118
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,840
- Are you done talking now?
- No, I'm not done.

119
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Please leave the room.

120
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Please stay.

121
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,320
You'll really be like this?

122
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,980
Why not?

123
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,320
Are you ashamed?

124
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,170
Then you shouldn't have done this.

125
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,710
I'm the CEO of the company!

126
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,310
I protected the company 
while you were with Min Seo!

127
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,520
Not anymore.

128
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,830
What?

129
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,380
It's no surprise, right?

130
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,990
There wasn't anything here...

131
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,370
which belonged to you from the start.

132
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,340
Honey.

133
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,570
Also, this.

134
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,780
Put everything back in its place.

135
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,870
If not, you'll get a call from the police.

136
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,100
 

137
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
 

138
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,020
You started all of this.

139
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,910
You started...

140
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,170
all of this yourself.

141
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,970
Yes.

142
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,830
This is Han Tae Kyu of
 team 2 at Eastern Dept.

143
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,620
What?

144
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,950
Chief!

145
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,490
Yes.

146
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,690
This was found in the 
mountains. What could it be?

147
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,930
Open it.

148
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,070
It's that woman's money.

149
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,970
She took it nine years ago
 to look for her child.

150
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,450
Wow.

151
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,370
Did you call Jang Chul Min?

152
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes.

153
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,990
- Where was he yesterday?
- I couldn't ask the details yet.

154
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,310
But he was at work when 
he took her call last night.

155
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,130
What call?

156
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,680
She said she's in agony 
and missing Min Seo, etc.

157
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,700
Did she seem suicidal or something?

158
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,820
Apparently, she sent him 
a lengthy text, too.

159
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,080
Tell him to cut the BS.

160
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,230
Put it away.

161
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,410
- But Chief...
- Sons of b****es.

162
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,560
She's probably that crazy b****, right?

163
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,800
What the heck do you...

164
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,010
That thing over there...

165
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,820
wouldn't be Ma Ji Won, right?

166
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,940
Ma Ji Won really took the 
money after giving  you this ID?

167
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,520
I can get more money.

168
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,610
How?

169
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,720
From your husband?

170
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,370
I told you he was the accomplice.

171
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,870
Do you not trust my words, or...

172
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,890
do you not trust me?

173
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,300
Eun Ji.

174
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,240
It's not that I don't trust you.

175
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,650
Do you know what you can't...

176
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,370
acquire with money or power?

177
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,980
Your child.

178
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,920
That's why I trust Min Seo's dad.

179
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,140
 

180
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,980
How about the 
document I requested?

181
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,060
Is your aunt there right now?

182
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,100
She just left. Why?

183
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,310
Are you positive?

184
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,750
It wasn't Ma Ji Won?

185
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,480
That woman left with
 the money yesterday.

186
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,450
  Hello? 

187
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,450
Seo Eun Ji.

188
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,710
I need to see you right now.

189
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,920
Is this your wife?

190
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,140
Honey.

191
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,720
Yes.

192
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
I got a call from her last night.

193
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,150
Around what time?

194
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,460
Around 10 o'clock at night.

195
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,360
She was in agony...

196
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,010
and asked me what she should do.

197
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,500
CEO Jang suggested 
she turn herself in,

198
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,990
but she said she'll think about it.

199
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
CEO Jang?

200
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,580
Were you alone when 
you took her call?

201
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,630
What are you trying to get at?

202
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,890
Were you alone?

203
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,930
When she called me, 
I was in my office.

204
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,700
Then I was with 
my attorney afterward.

205
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,210
Han Tae Kyu, you must be happy.

206
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,350
Your tormentor died willingly herself.

207
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,100
How does it look?

208
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,860
First, she has lacerated wounds, 
and she bled all over her body.

209
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,420
I think she died from a fractured skull.

210
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,370
I see deep lacerations on the
 front and back of her head.

211
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,900
She dropped down
 from the mountains, right?

212
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,390
Yes.

213
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,700
I need an autopsy to determine...

214
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,850
whether that was the 
cause or something else was.

215
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,760
That's enough!

216
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,380
She's suffered enough 
because of you people.

217
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,690
She was identified and there was a will.

218
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,850
If you put a knife on her 
corpse, you'll be satisfied?

219
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,470
Give him the corpse then.

220
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,440
What are you talking about?

221
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,050
It's just as I said.

222
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,200
That might not be the crazy b**** 
we've been trailing after.

223
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,280
Then who?

224
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,180
That Ma Ji Won or what's-her-name?

225
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes.

226
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,610
What do you think?

227
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,440
Why don't we just do the autopsy?

228
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,960
It was a suicide. We can't 
without the family's consent.

229
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,850
Well then...

230
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,710
why don't we confirm
 the personal belongings?

231
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,080
Those should still be at the station.

232
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,660
That'll work.

233
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,780
There should be fingerprints
 and other things, too.

234
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,990
Then proceed.

235
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,870
I'll go to the station, so...

236
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,650
- check at the scene if there's any belongings left. 
- Okay.

237
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,370
Let's make the case 
announcement after we confirm?

238
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,860
Okay. Let's do that.

239
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,700
Let me know if you find anything.

240
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,140
Yes, Prosecutor.

241
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,810
- What's this about?
- Did you get what I asked for?

242
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,550
I said, what is this about?

243
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,050
Ma Ji Won was murdered.

244
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,400
Are you sure this is it?

245
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,890
It's what Auntie used to use.

246
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,330
But did Ma Ji Won really...

247
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,310
Her body was found this morning.

248
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,780
But this will...

249
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,940
turn that corpse into someone 
else's, and Ma Ji Won's.

250
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,590
They killed her 
thinking it was Auntie?

251
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,400
Who did it?

252
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,820
Probably someone who wants your 
aunt to die and disappear.

253
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,260
So who did it?

254
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,900
Is it Jang Chul Min?

255
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,690
He has an alibi.

256
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,300
Then it must be...

257
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,500
that accomplice again.

258
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,260
Listen to me carefully.

259
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,580
Those people...

260
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,140
killed Ma Ji Won 
thinking she was your aunt.

261
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,770
This makes "Ma Ji Won"
 the only one left.

262
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,170
Do you understand?

263
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,300
If it gets...

264
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,500
revealed that your 
aunt is not Ma Ji Won...

265
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,140
then she'll be killed discreetly.

266
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,510
But...

267
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,020
Auntie trusts Jang Chul Min.

268
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,690
Tell her to sit tight and 
not do anything stupid.

269
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,160
And...

270
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,240
the same goes for you, Eun Ji.

271
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,410
Remember that...

272
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,460
killing a few people...

273
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,790
means nothing to these people.

274
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,810
Hey! Hold on! Stop!

275
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,170
Man, geez.

276
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,530
Chief.

277
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,890
What should we do? 
There wasn't much at the site.

278
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,320
I took this from that woman's suitcase.

279
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,430
Look into it.

280
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,730
Yes, Sir.

281
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,740
 

282
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,900
 
 So you want another guardian instead of Ms. Ma, right? 

283
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,310
Yes, that's correct.

284
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,080
Did that person agree?

285
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,290
Not yet.

286
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,120
But I think he will.

287
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,630
 Then call me back after he does. 

288
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,130
 Attorney Kim, can you
 call me back later? 

289
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,840
 It's early morning here. 

290
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,180
Okay, I will.

291
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,940
I'll call you again later.

292
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,310
Why don't you get his approval first

293
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,460
then come back together?

294
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,780
Come here.

295
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,850
 Choi Woo Joon. 

296
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,580
Come here.

297
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,710
Come here!

298
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,660
Min Seo! Stop right there!

299
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,720
Gotcha!

300
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,930
Mommy!

301
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,350
Mommy!

302
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,570
It's Sunday. Why are you 
going to work?

303
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,780
Because I have a lot of work.

304
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,030
Why all of a sudden?

305
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,170
Dad takes care of the company.

306
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,730
Well, now...

307
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,970
I'll be taking care of the
 company for a while.

308
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,040
Are you and Dad really breaking up?

309
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,840
Did Dad tell you that?

310
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,340
It's not true, right?

311
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,310
There was a situation.

312
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,770
What situation?

313
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,840
Even if I told you, 
you won't understand.

314
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,360
But instead...

315
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,140
you'll be living with me.

316
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,290
No.

317
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,510
Min Seo.

318
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,540
I'll decide whom I'll live with.

319
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,300
Do you want to live with Dad?

320
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
I don't want that either.

321
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,330
I'll live by myself. I'll live alone!

322
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,060
Min Seo.

323
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,700
 He'd rather live by himself. 

324
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,750
Also, I'm not the one 
who Woo Joon needs.

325
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,930
Ms. Ma?

326
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,330
Ms. Ma!

327
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,170
Are you all right?

328
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,390
I'm sorry.

329
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,210
I got distracted for a second.

330
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,090
I'm not worthy of 
Woo Joon's guardianship.

331
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,400
Mal Koo, you're more than qualified.

332
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,990
Did you forget that I'm a thug?

333
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,010
I'm not Ma Ji Won.

334
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,790
Also, it's doesn't frazzle me at all...

335
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,060
to have police pop up 
whenever, wherever.

336
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,880
Please do me this favor.

337
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,760
I'm not the one to 
take care of Woo Joon...

338
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,310
but it's you, Mal Koo.

339
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,070
Also, if it's you...

340
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,830
then Woo Joon won't resist.

341
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,810
Okay, I understand.

342
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,070
But...

343
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,560
please listen to 
Woo Joon's opinion first.

344
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,620
I'd like that.

345
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,020
Really?

346
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,520
Of course. If I lived with you, 
I wouldn't have to study...

347
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,730
You must study hard.

348
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,080
Okay. I'll study hard.

349
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,340
Woo Joon.

350
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,850
You can be honest.

351
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,850
I can ask Ms. Ma again later.

352
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,810
I hate that Ahjumma.

353
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,960
Choi Woo Joon.

354
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,310
I'm serious.

355
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,030
I want to live with you, 
not with Ahjumma.

356
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,920
I know I can.

357
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,070
Right?
