1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,620
 

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,540
Yes, Honey.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,050
I'm with Detective Chun.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,760
Yes, I'll be home soon.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,540
How about Yoo Ri? Is she asleep?

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,590
Okay.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,890
Yes, I'll take a cab. Don't worry.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,100
Aigoo. I said, okay.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,170
Okay.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
- Chief!
- Yes.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,100
Yeah?

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,020
Okay.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,780
- Let's go back in.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:35,530
Not yet.

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,760
When will you tell him?

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,820
Once I have hard evidence.

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,710
So there's no evidence at all?

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,900
I couldn't find anything
 since it was nine years ago.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,410
- Hello?
 - Well, yes. 

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,900
 Hello, Sir. 

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,190
 I'm Detective Kim Heung Min 
from Daejeon Prosecutors' Office. 

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,220
 I'm calling because... 

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,080
You punk, is this a joke?

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,490
Hey. I'm a detective, you bastard!

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,940
What?

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,650
It was voice phishing.

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,350
There's no Central 
Prosecutors' Office in Daejeon.

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,980
Voice phishing.

29
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,000
 When you were trailing 
that crazy b****, 

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,230
 we went through hell because 
of a voice phishing suspect. 

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,460
  Voice phishing? 

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,280
 

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,350
The crime scene was this way,

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,780
but that woman went that way.

35
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,700
Her car was found over there.

36
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,480
 Whether you go to 
the scene from there 

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 or take this path, you'd arrive 
around the same time. 

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,200
But it shouldn't be 
around the same time.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
They could run into each other.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,330
Of course, Prosecutor Yang knew that.

41
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,040
But Prosecutor Yang went this way,

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,160
and she arrived way earlier.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,510
How do you think that is?

44
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,890
The answer's right there.

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,080
What about it?

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,620
Yongam Reservoir is 
about 30 km from here,

47
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,810
not 1 km.

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,510
But why does this sign say 1 km?

49
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,170
I guess you're right.

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,940
This sign is wrong.

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,500
To be exact,

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,490
when this sign was first put,

53
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,270
there was a path to 
Yongam Reservoir, 1 km away.

54
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,220
 

55
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,410
Right here.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,380
 

57
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,740
You're right.

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,640
When I was a rookie, this was 
the entrance to the reservoir.

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,470
It's blocked now, due to
 private properties.

60
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,300
But if you follow that path, 
you'll hit the crime scene.

61
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,240
If you walk from here, 
you'll get there quickly.

62
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,340
Prosecutor Yang...

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,360
knew about this path.

64
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,630
 

65
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,350
 And today's highlight is... 

66
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,070
 voice phishing. 

67
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,340
Look.

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,430
That's the convenience store we're at.

69
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,200
The shortcut from earlier is that way,

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
and the wrong sign is that way.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,540
Prosecutor Yang followed this path.

72
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,420
She passed the three-way intersection 
and followed this road.

73
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,090
Then she took the shortcut...

74
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,020
and she got in the car.

75
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,690
Then she passed right by
here, taking this road.

76
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm sure since this is the only road.

77
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,650
You told me that...

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,460
when the incident happened 
nine years ago,

79
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,620
you were chasing a voice phishing
 suspect as a police officer.

80
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,050
Yes.

81
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,090
That building over there 
used to be a bank.

82
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,170
His face was caught on
 camera over there.

83
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,780
That's how we caught him.

84
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,630
What time was he caught on camera?

85
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,760
It was around when you found
 the woman and the girl's body.

86
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,040
So maybe it was after midnight?

87
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,920
Then could it be...

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,500
Who was it?

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,350
My colleague from the Western Dept.

90
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,790
I asked him since Prosecutor Yang
 might catch on if I asked you.

91
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,640
Are these the photo 
evidence from then?

92
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,490
Yes.

93
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,790
The photo evidence of the 
voice phishing case.

94
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,680
From the bank's security cams,

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,080
to other buildings' security cams,

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,510
and the police "speed" cameras.

97
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,190
All the culprit's pics are in here.

98
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,430
Maybe Prosecutor Yang's 
picture will be there, too.

99
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,700
Bingo.

100
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,260
Yes.

101
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,070
We finally got it!

102
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,140
Woo Joon,

103
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,970
should we dine out 
together this weekend?

104
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,960
Dining out?

105
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,160
I made dinner reservations at a 
place called "The Moon Hotel."

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,500
A really famous
 chef's there, Ahjumma.

107
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,700
- You'll go, right?
 - Of course!

108
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,640
It was my utmost wish to

109
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,010
talk to that chef, Ahjumma.

110
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,730
Then...

111
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,890
can I ask you for a favor?

112
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,370
What is it?

113
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,070
From now on, could you call me...

114
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,290
Auntie instead of Ahjumma?

115
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,830
Auntie?

116
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,770
If you find Ahjumma more 
comfy, then that's fine.

117
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,740
But since we live together,

118
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,360
Ahjumma is a bit weird.

119
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,910
Why? You don't want to?

120
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,870
Yes, I want to.

121
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,190
Auntie.

122
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,230
Then...

123
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,980
you're dining out this 
weekend with Auntie, okay?

124
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,520
Sounds good, Auntie.

125
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,900
Have you found the evidence yet?

126
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm getting there. Wait just a bit.

127
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,400
Anyway, how's your aunt doing?

128
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,250
You don't need to worry about her.

129
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,810
That's good to hear.

130
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,970
I'll be there tomorrow
 or the day after.

131
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,940
Keep an eye on her until then.

132
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,880
Okay.

133
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,110
Was the culprit caught?

134
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,090
There's someone 
named Ha Eun Jik.

135
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,000
He lives next door to Ms. Oh.

136
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,400
I saw him briefly the other day. 
He was so obnoxious.

137
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,300
I assume he was caught 
on the security cam?

138
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,240
The police station's 
security cam was broken.

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,500
There's no footage.

140
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,920
Then how?

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,510
The black box in the car.

142
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
I mean...

143
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,700
The police station 
security cams were broken,

144
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,700
but our neighborhood cars were fine.

145
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,030
So I told the ladies at the library

146
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,850
that we should look at the footage 
from the cars which were

147
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,430
around the police station last night.

148
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,400
 And that man's face was caught  

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,130
 right on Ms. Park's black box. 

150
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,300
Will you still deny it?

151
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,800
This hair was found in there.

152
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,890
This is Kim Bo Ra's hair, isn't it?

153
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,080
I don't know.

154
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,440
I don't know anything about it.

155
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,300
What do you mean, 
you don't know, punk?

156
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,950
You lured Bo Ra to your 
house to take her money,

157
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,100
but you killed her 
since it didn't go well.

158
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,650
I heard you called her a lot,

159
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,010
trying to seduce her.

160
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,780
I wasn't seducing her.

161
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,730
I was consulting her.

162
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,330
Bo Ra...

163
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,750
wanted to go to
 Berklee Music College,

164
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,240
so I gave her advice.

165
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,490
You little...

166
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,540
So if you didn't kill her,

167
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,010
why was her body at your place?

168
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,730
I don't know. I really have no idea.

169
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,010
I fell asleep drunk and woke up 
after midnight. And Bo  Ra was...

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,690
I mean, her corpse was...

171
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,600
right next to me.

172
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,090
Then why did you put her
 corpse in the police station?

173
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,950
You were trying to frame me, right?

174
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,040
Yup.

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,940
You're absolutely right.

176
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,680
Because you look so obnoxious.

177
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,360
What?

178
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,500
So that Han Eun Jik confessed?

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,120
He keeps insisting that it wasn't him.

180
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,940
Do we even need his confession?

181
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,620
There are tons of evidence.

182
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,400
And the corpse was originally
 found at his place.

183
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,220
Just because he was 
with the corpse,

184
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,630
you can't say that he's the culprit.

185
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
Well,  Unni...

186
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,910
If the one in front of the 
corpse isn't the culprit,

187
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,190
then who is it?

188
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,060
Anyhow, they're almost done 
with the investigation.

189
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,720
Thankfully, I can finally
 enjoy some peace.

190
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,920
Money was the motivation.

191
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,490
There was 500 million won

192
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,590
in Kim Bo Ra's bank account.

193
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,740
Bo Ra?

194
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,210
That's her name. Kim Bo Ra.

195
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,560
The girl found in the police station.

196
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
She looked like a high school student.

197
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,190
How did she have so much money?

198
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,920
There's this CEO Shin.

199
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,520
He's an old man who runs 
a private loan business.

200
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,210
He gave it to her.

201
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,510
So did Han Eun Jik take the money?

202
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,320
The money's still in her bank account.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,910
That's strange.

204
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,810
If money was the motive, 
he should've taken that first.

205
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,840
She probably refused him.

206
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,270
Maybe he killed her out of anger.

207
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,460
Then which people know that Bo Ra...

208
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,800
had 500 million won?

209
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,980
CEO Shin, his son-in-law, 
and daughter-in-law.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,700
And Kim Bo Ra's aunt
 probably knows, too.

211
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,820
You want the investigation file for 
agreeing to accept the award?

212
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,470
As expected, Ms. Ma...

213
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,150
you're a true writer for sure.

214
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,530
How's next Wednesday?

215
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,330
Chief is busy on
 Monday and Tuesday.

216
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,860
Aren't there other photos?

217
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Here.

218
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,750
What are these?

219
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,970
That?

220
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,820
Kim Bo Ra's fingernails.

221
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,010
They were found 
in the club's trash can.

222
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,800
These fingernails.

223
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,580
Are they really Bo Ra's?

224
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,800
They are.

225
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,480
Before she went missing,

226
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,840
CEO Shin's daughter-in-law 
clipped them for her at the club.

227
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,900
Why?

228
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,730
Did you get a hunch again?

229
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,010
But this time, it's for certain.

230
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,100
Among the ones who knew that 
Kim Bo Ra had 500 million won,

231
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,490
Ha Eun Jik was the 
only one without an alibi.

232
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,590
The original estimated time of
 death was 7 to 10 o'clock.

233
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,180
But Kim Bo Ra was
 at the club until 8 o'clock.

234
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,610
So the accurate time of death is
 between 8 and 10 o'clock.

235
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,920
We shouldn't include the 
time while she was alive.

236
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,150
What was Ha Eun Jik doing then?

237
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,440
He was drunk and sleeping at home.

238
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,800
But who'd believe that?

239
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,970
Between 8 and 10 o'clock?

240
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,020
Yes.

241
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,480
That's Kim Bo Ra's 
estimated time of death.

242
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,810
I'm not interrogating you.

243
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,530
No need to worry.

244
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,360
Ms. Ma here wanted to 
conduct interviews.

245
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,210
What were you doing then?

246
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,330
I left the club around 8:30 p.m.

247
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,810
I went to see Bo Ra's performance,

248
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,640
but So Eun performed
 instead of Bo Ra.

249
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,630
So what did you do afterward?

250
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,030
I went to a market with my 
daughter-in-law, then came home.

251
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,320
I think we got home after 9:30 p.m.

252
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,410
Then you stayed home
 the whole night?

253
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,840
Yes.

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,330
Let me ask you one more thing.

255
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,630
Bo Ra wasn't even your
 granddaughter, CEO.

256
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,510
Why did you give her such 
a huge amount of money?

257
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,540
It was for her education abroad.

258
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,900
Education abroad?

259
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,640
She wanted to move to the U.S.

260
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,150
and study music.

261
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,260
And I wanted her 
dreams to come true.

262
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,470
 
He wanted her dreams to come true?

263
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,560
Sounds like a bunch of crap.

264
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,120
I could see his 
eyes were full of greed.

265
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,260
Don't you think?

266
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,300
But where are we now?

267
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,580
Eun Jik seemed so drunk,

268
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,720
so I dropped him off at home.

269
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,150
He's one of our regulars.

270
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,220
Around what time 
did he arrive here?

271
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,710
It was a little before 8 o'clock.

272
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,790
And he stayed here for a while.

273
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,510
Right?

274
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,620
Do you want to check out 
the third floor too?

275
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,540
I don't know if Lee So Eun is here.

276
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,950
I think she's here.

277
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,100
The money your 
father-in-law gave to Bo Ra.

278
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,900
Did you know
 it was for her education?

279
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes, I was aware of it.

280
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,400
That's why she doted 
on him so much.

281
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,360
I was at the club, then 
came here a little after 8.

282
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,210
I couldn't get a hold of Bo Ra.

283
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,760
That's why I had to perform with 
them instead of Bo Ra.

284
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,350
Until what time?

285
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,830
The show went on until 9:30 p.m.

286
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,370
Then I came up here afterward 
and ate with those girls.

287
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,830
By any chance, did 
Bo Ra have any habits?

288
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,300
For example, twisting her hair or...

289
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,510
biting her nails?

290
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

291
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,550
Did you catch a cold or something?

292
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,020
Why are you shaking so much?

293
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,730
- Chief.
- What?

294
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,210
By any chance...

295
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,080
the girl found at the police station.

296
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,150
Kim Bo Ra? Why?

297
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,510
Who confirmed that it was Bo Ra?

298
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,670
Lee Seo Eun we met earlier did.

299
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,900
She's Bo Ra's only family.

300
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,040
Woo Joon just fell asleep.

301
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,900
What are these?

302
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,590
Pictures of the dead girl's hands.

303
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,450
Her name was Bo Ra.

304
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,980
Kim Bo Ra.

305
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,640
Yes.

306
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,380
Focusing on these 
things isn't bad either.

307
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,190
But something's weird.

308
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,350
What?

309
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,070
Bo Ra's aunt confirmed the body.

310
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,260
But I think she's lying.

311
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,570
When I asked her, she said Bo Ra...

312
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,270
didn't have any habits.

313
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,390
But if you see this,

314
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,820
she used to bite her nails.

315
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,650
These are Kim Bo Ra's fingernails.

316
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,790
And these are the dead girl's hands.

317
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,310
There are no signs of 
biting on the clipped fingernails.

318
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,270
But the dead girl's fingernails...

319
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,870
definitely had a sign of biting.

320
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,560
Are you sure these are
 Bo Ra's fingernails?

321
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,200
I'll find out when I check.

322
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,090
But if these are Bo Ra's fingernails,

323
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,140
it means there are two girls.

324
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,330
The girl who bites her nails...

325
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,740
and the one who doesn't.

326
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,460
Which means the corpse there 
was someone else.

327
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,570
Long time no see.

328
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,480
It's been a while.

329
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,700
Alright.

330
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,450
Okay, I got it.

331
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,480
Is that Bertram?

332
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,780
Bertram International.

333
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,390
It's registered as a trading business,

334
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,570
but I can smell their "laundry."

335
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,780
- Money laundering?
- Yes.

336
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,410
And this.

337
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,830
 
Since Yang would notice
 if I request a warrant,

338
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,580
I got this illegally
 by bugging a bank teller.

339
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,710
It seems like...

340
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,660
Korea Tech isn't the only 
company that bribes Bertram.

341
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,750
They're probably the companies 
that Prosecutor Yang supports.

342
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,200
Not all of them, but most are.

343
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,940
Yang backs them, and 
they bribe Bertram.

344
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,580
Okay.

345
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,800
That's good.

346
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,200
The superintendent is
 asleep. Should I...

347
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,600
- wake him up?
- Not yet.

348
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,900
Let's get the "hidden card" first.

349
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,370
The hidden card?

350
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,890
Writer Ma Ji Won.

351
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,860
It's a closed case. Why  
bother these busy people?

352
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,700
It's such a shame.

353
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,940
She should wear pretty clothes

354
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,620
and eat delicious foods 
while hanging with friends.

355
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,300
But she's dead.

356
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,290
I said, we're busy.

357
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,720
The reason why I invited you here...

358
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,250
is to find this girl's killer.

359
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,420
What?

360
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,700
What do you mean by that?

361
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,450
You mean Ha Eun Jik
 isn't the culprit...

362
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,380
It means there's a real culprit...

363
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,750
who wants to frame Ha Eun Jik.

364
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,310
In this very room.

365
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,060
But Ms. Ma.

366
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,610
The people in this room...

367
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,110
all have alibis when Bo Ra died.

368
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,000
That'd be true if the estimated time

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,640
is between 8 and 10 o'clock.

370
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,160
But the original 
estimated time frame is...

371
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,320
between 7 and 10 o'clock.

372
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,040
Geez, I already told you.

373
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,920
Between 7 and 8 o'clock,

374
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
she was seen alive at the club.

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,420
That's why it became 8 to 10 o'clock.

376
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,520
That'd be true if this is Bo Ra.

377
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,680
Here's a list of recent
 "missing" people.

378
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,080
 
To the right is the application

379
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,040
submitted to Majestic Entertainment.

380
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,010
So this body belongs to

381
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,500
Sung Hae In who's missing?

382
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,200
The killer chose someone 
around Bo Ra's age...

383
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,720
The killer chose someone 
around Bo Ra's age...

384
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,900
and who had a similar physique.

385
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,290
Because they needed
 someone to replace Bo Ra.

386
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,650
Yes. The dyed hair suits you.

387
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,740
A little makeup would be perfect.

388
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,250
Really, CEO?

389
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,470
Don't call me CEO. 
Just call me Unni from now on.

390
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,300
 No, this girl isn't Bo Ra. 
She's Hae In. 

391
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,010
 Sung Hae In. 

392
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,400
We can confirm that by
 running a DNA test.

393
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,900
I was with Bo Ra all day and was

394
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,950
at the club after she disappeared.

395
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,490
How could I kill Bo Ra?

396
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,080
Your alibi is great, of course.

397
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,300
But what about your accomplice?

398
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,550
Accomplice?

399
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,200
The person with no alibi 
between 7 and 10 o'clock.

400
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,250
And who went to 
Han Eun Jik's place,

401
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,860
where the body was first found.

402
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,010
It's Kye Soo Gil.

403
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,150
 He probably put sleeping pills... 

404
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,010
 in Ha Eun Jik's drink. 

405
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,250
 Since if he woke up, 
it'd get messy. 

406
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,300
 Hae In, who was dressed like Bo Ra... 

407
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,380
 was probably also given sleeping pills. 

408
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,230
 He took Hae In to 
Ha Eun Jik's place and... 

409
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,420
I treated you like my son. 
How could you!

410
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,380
It's all your fault, Father-in-law.

411
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,330
If only you'd given me that
 money you gave Bo Ra,

412
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,200
this wouldn't have happened.

413
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,180
- What did you say?
- CEO, please.

414
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,850
Tell me.

415
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,030
What did you do with Bo Ra?

416
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,330
And you still call yourself a human?

417
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,320
You told me...

418
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,580
that Min Seo's dad is 
the culprit, right?

419
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,700
But you didn't believe me.

420
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,870
You said he had an alibi.

421
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,220
Yes.

422
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,330
An accomplice.

423
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,750
A woman.

424
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,850
You said that she killed your sister.

425
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,660
Then the girl who died 
before my eyes...

426
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,700
Is it your sister?

427
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,940
Tell me.

428
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,610
You should ask him instead.

429
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,130
Him?

430
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,600
Han Tae Kyu.

431
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,570
He's in front of your house now.

432
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,590
What's your name?

433
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,860
Choi Woo Joon.

434
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,200
- How old are you?
 - I'm 10.

435
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,670
Really? The same age as my daughter.

436
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,380
Are there any adults inside?

437
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,210
Ahjussi, who are you?

438
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,310
Me?

439
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,980
I'm Ms. Ma's friend.

440
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,010
Did you make plans to 
meet with Auntie?

441
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,010
Yes.

442
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,290
That's weird.

443
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,490
We're supposed to dine out today.

444
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,930
Is that so? You can still dine out.

445
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,090
I won't take too long.

446
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,010
There she comes!

447
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,640
Auntie!

448
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,560
Noona!

449
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,170
Ahjussi.

450
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,880
Are you okay?

451
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,020
Yes.

452
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,870
Are you okay?

453
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,050
Choi Woo Joon.

454
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,040
If something...

455
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,030
bad happens to me...

456
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,360
No!

457
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,920
♫  I turn back...   ♫

458
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,930
♫  My pitch black heart to you  ♫
