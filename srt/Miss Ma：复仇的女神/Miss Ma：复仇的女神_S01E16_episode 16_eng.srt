1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,660
 Hey, hey. Come here! 

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,460
 Do you know who I am? 

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,500
 I'm the No. 1 fighter, you punk. 

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,190
 - Hey, come here.
- You can't even fight. 

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,070
- What are you looking at?
- Looks fun.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,510
Hurry up.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,530
You're dead meat.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,900
- Those punks...
 - What a wimp.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,800
Don't cry later.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,540
You sparrow bastard.

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,040
- This will be fun.
- Teach him a lesson.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,910
- Don't cry.
- Go ahead!

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,110
Hey, sparrow.

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,600
Fight!

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,990
Fight!

16
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,540
They're the ones who tease 
Woo Joon calling him a sparrow.

17
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,120
Fighting!

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,640
Fighting!

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
Yes!

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,060
Auntie.

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,540
If you call me a sparrow again,

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,550
then you're all dead.

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,920
Got it?

24
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,300
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,240
Mal Koo oppa taught him well.

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,350
Nice, Choi Woo Joon.

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,890
Woo Joon, let's talk for a second.

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,880
Woo Joon!

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,290
Don't follow me.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
I haven't seen you exercise in a while.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,180
There's a reason for that, CEO.

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,770
Does it have to do with Ma Ji Won?

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,120
Woo Joon!

34
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,230
Choi Woo Joon, you fight well.

35
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,440
Be quiet.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,960
Woo Joon,

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,870
how could you fight 
because they harassed you?

38
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,160
I won't fight anymore...

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,670
since they won't make 
fun of me anymore.

40
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,180
Seriously.

41
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,180
Talk to me for a second.

42
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm going somewhere with 
Eun Ji and Woo Joon.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,700
Please take care of 
CEO in the meantime.

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,950
What did you say?

45
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,580
He's in the garden.

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,110
We'll be back by the time
 he finishes a book.

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,160
I found this where the stones were.

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,210
I'll tell you more later.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,790
Bringing Mal Koo into this world

50
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,010
was the best thing I've done.

51
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,850
I've never seen a fighter
 like him before.

52
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,740
But I also regret it 
the most as well.

53
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,820
Since he became a thug 
because of me.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,500
I don't know what you mean.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,850
That's why I made him 
read children's books

56
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,610
and grow flowers, too.

57
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,910
I want to return his 
innocence before I die.

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,030
I don't think people change that way.

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,810
Yes.

60
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,620
Only people can change people.

61
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,990
Woo Joon, Eun Ji, and Ms. Ma.

62
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,470
I felt hopeful.

63
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,090
He seemed more lively

64
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,170
whenever he mentioned
 those names.

65
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,560
I felt something that
 he had lost a long time ago.

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,260
That's why I wanted to meet you.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,670
Especially you, Ms. Ma.

68
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,230
I mean,

69
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,920
Writer Ma Ji Won.

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,530
Why me...

71
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,550
Because you were different.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
The Ma Ji Won that punk talks about

73
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,760
and the Ma Ji Won I used to know.

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,000
Your voice is very similar,

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,800
but you're not Ma Ji Won.

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,410
You're not that vain and arrogant Ma Ji Won

77
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,750
who came to interview 
me a while back.

78
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,580
Who the heck are you?

79
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,290
Auntie.

80
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,380
Auntie!

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,980
Did something happen?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,100
No.

83
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,200
We should be open.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,600
Your face tells me 
something happened.

85
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,200
I said, no.

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Just a second.

87
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,940
A few days ago...

88
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,930
Mal Koo oppa found this where 
he was humiliated by you.

89
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,830
It's a nail tip, right?

90
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,460
 Are you a fugitive? 

91
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,300
What's this?

92
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,260
The stones on the bed.

93
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,030
It was found where the stones were.

94
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,580
Goodness.

95
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,640
Does it belong to that murderer?

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,200
I guess so if you're the murderer.

97
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,710
But my nail tips are intact.

98
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,140
They can find the fingerprints.

99
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,920
These days, you can
 find the person

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,590
even with a small fingerprint.

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,690
Ms. Ma, you must think I'm a joke.

102
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,180
Where are those 
fingerprints anyway?

103
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,150
And where did the nail tip go?

104
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,770
Yes.

105
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,200
There's nothing left 
anymore, So Jung.

106
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,070
So you can get it off your chest.

107
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,380
Why did you do something like that?

108
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,360
Whether good or bad,

109
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,970
that's how actors are.

110
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,530
They want attention and 
don't want to be ignored.

111
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,190
But my man was into someone else. 
Can you imagine?

112
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,100
You mean CEO Koo Ki Baek is...

113
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,450
He's still not over Jung Hee unni.

114
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,480
How embarrassing.

115
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,860
Koo Ki Baek is like that.

116
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,610
He flirts with actresses 
using his CEO position.

117
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,450
But knowing that...

118
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,950
someone like him had feelings for 
Jung Hee made me angry.

119
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,950
He thinks he's romantic
 or something.

120
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,310
Then...

121
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,170
the one who poisoned 
Jung Hee's wine...

122
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,640
was you?

123
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,710
You were at the party

124
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,530
and at the shoot, too.

125
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,520
Do I look that evil?

126
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,130
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,540
That's not what I meant.

128
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,250
I think it was...

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,960
probably that person.

130
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,950
I heard this from Ki Baek.

131
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,700
Jung Hee unni...

132
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,070
dissolved an adoption in the past.

133
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,630
Let's take a break.

134
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,820
Who did you hear that from?

135
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,350
Is it true?

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Why bring up that child 
all of a sudden?

137
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,850
If Jung Hee had abandoned them,

138
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,260
isn't it possible they resented her?

139
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,740
The police say 
An Sung Tae's the culprit.

140
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,910
We need to consider 
all the possibilities.

141
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,530
If you don't want to talk about it,

142
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,940
I'll ask someone else.

143
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,200
It was Ye Ji.

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,980
That child's name.

145
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,270
Is the meeting over?

146
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,000
Not yet.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,140
Are you on a break?

148
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,190
I guess.

149
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,750
Where's Jae Deok? In the library?

150
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,670
He's with a guest.

151
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,430
Who?

152
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,380
Ms. Ma.

153
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,700
It was actually brief.

154
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,050
She lived with us for three months.

155
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Around when was this?

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
It was when I finished 
writing "The Shaman."

157
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,680
It was when Jung Hee did 
the shoot in Thailand.

158
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,000
 

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,310
Honey.

160
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,870
Say hello.

161
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,610
Hello.

162
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,420
Hi.

163
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,980
 A grown child? 

164
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,840
Jung Hee really wanted a child.

165
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,120
But it didn't go as intended.

166
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,750
Since we had work, we adopted 
an easier child to raise.

167
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,610
Anyway,

168
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,070
we really loved her.

169
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,860
And Ye Ji loved Jung Hee like a mom.

170
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,060
Then why did you give her up?

171
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,630
Well...

172
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,110
because...

173
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,030
Because Jung Hee became pregnant.

174
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,570
She couldn't get pregnant 
no matter how she tried.

175
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,870
But she got pregnant when 
she adopted a child.

176
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,420
So you abandoned the child...

177
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,160
you had adopted.

178
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,470
Was she just an...

179
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,260
object for you?

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,700
- How could you do that?
 - Yes.

181
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,090
We did a wrong thing that
 can't be undone.

182
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,760
Doesn't everyone go
 through things like that?

183
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,450
Haven't you?

184
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,250
What happened to Ye Ji?

185
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,260
When I came home after a 
few days, my wife said that

186
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,660
they had a big fight and 
she ran away with our money.

187
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,760
Ran away?

188
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,060
Water, please.

189
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you.

190
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Did she go back to the orphanage?

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
We went there to check...

192
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,100
but she wasn't there.

193
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,080
Where did she go then?

194
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,330
We were starting "The Shaman,"

195
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,260
so we couldn't do anything.

196
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,970
You didn't do anything 
when she'd disappeared?

197
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,990
No. And I feel...

198
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,180
sorry toward Ye Ji.

199
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,300
But at the time...

200
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,400
- Oh, ow.
 - Oh, no!

201
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,660
Don't blame yourself.

202
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,200
I didn't know he was in bad health.

204
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
It's not your fault he's like that.

205
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,390
Jae Deok, Jae Deok!

206
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,100
Jae Deok!

207
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,130
Jae Deok!

208
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
What did you do to Jae Deok?

209
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,040
I asked him about a girl named Ye Ji.

210
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
What?

211
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,940
How could you...

212
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,190
Ye Ji.

213
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,600
Have you seen her recently?

214
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,800
Mal Koo!

215
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,240
Are you okay?

216
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,300
Did you find the owner of the fake nail?

217
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Yes.

218
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,280
But she wasn't...

219
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,720
targeting Jung Hee.

220
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,780
But I need to ask 
Jung Hee something.

221
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,200
I'll ask her about the child 
when I get a chance.

222
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
Instead, I'd like you to

223
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,540
stop coming here for a while.

224
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,330
Seo So Jung made 
the threat with a doll?

225
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,960
Should I tell Chief?

226
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,420
There's no evidence.

227
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,560
What about the nail tip?

228
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,500
- It's gone.
- Gone?

229
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,590
Why?

230
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,700
It just did.

231
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,270
Did Seo So Jung try to kill 
Lee Jung Hee too?

232
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,640
The one who poisoned the 
wine and the coffee.

233
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,600
I don't think so.

234
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,370
Was it that bastard then?

235
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,390
The murderer Lee Jung Hee witnessed.

236
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,310
How do you know that?

237
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,660
What?

238
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,600
I overheard Ms. Ma and Chief.

239
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,380
You're being weird.

240
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,800
Why the interest all of a sudden?

241
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,110
Chief is interested in it.

242
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,690
Was it really that murderer?

243
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,470
I'm not sure.

244
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
There's an unexpected suspect now.

245
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,710
Who is it?

246
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,500
There's a girl Jung Hee 
adopted then sent back.

247
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,570
What about it?

248
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,170
Do you think she's 
related to this case?

249
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,740
It's not certain.

250
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,580
But that girl...

251
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,540
must've been hurt by Jung Hee.

252
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,560
Yes.

253
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,480
Lee Jung Hee knows 
who the murderer is,

254
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,690
but she won't speak.

255
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,670
That's why Ms. Ma's 
involved in this case.

256
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,680
Because she can't have
 Lee Jung Hee die.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
That's all I know for now.

258
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,800
Do you still think 
Ms. Ma's a fugitive?

259
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,630
That's none of your business.

260
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,780
What about Seo Eun Ji?

261
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,910
You know Woo Joon? 
Attorney Choi Man Shik's son.

262
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,430
She meets him sometimes, 
but that's all I know.

263
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,060
Did Ms. Ma see anyone else?

264
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,000
- Other than the film people.
- I'm not sure.

265
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,630
I heard she met 
Woo Joon's dad recently.

266
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,400
Attorney Choi?

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,390
Attorney Choi Man Shik?

268
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,600
 Yes, that's correct. 

269
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,310
But why would she?

270
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,430
I think it's because of his son.

271
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,000
His name is Choi Woo Joon.

272
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,790
 Okay. 

273
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,460
Yes, keep me posted.

274
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,460
It's me.

275
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,180
You know Choi Man Shik from 
the 15th graduating class, right?

276
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,640
Yes.

277
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,460
Where is he right now?

278
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,110
Hello?

279
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,070
What...

280
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,800
What on earth?

281
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,130
Ki Baek.

282
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,220
Ki Baek!

283
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,810
- Wake up.
- Why?

284
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,100
Ki Baek, your phone.

285
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,110
I see. Thank you.

286
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,250
It was Officer Bae.

287
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,250
He couldn't find the name "Ye Ji"

288
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,260
among the part-timers 
and the film crew.

289
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,900
She wouldn't use the name "Ye Ji."

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,700
She's in her early to mid 20's

291
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,360
for sure, right?

292
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,080
Okay.

293
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,310
 

294
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,600
Is Director Seong okay?

295
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,070
Yes. Mal Koo oppa said 
he was discharged last night.

296
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,640
It was due to stress.

297
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,520
It's me.

298
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,690
Can I ask you another favor?

299
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,740
 

300
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,150
 Give up the movie right now and 

301
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,570
 follow my directions. 

302
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,070
 Remember, 

303
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,610
 I know who the killer is. 

304
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,120
This call was from last night.

305
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,800
I recorded it...

306
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,990
because it seemed too 
strange for a prank call.

307
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,440
While you were listening?

308
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,940
I couldn't record the beginning part.

309
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,170
But I remember it.

310
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,220
What did they say?

311
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,150
"It's not me. There's 
a killer among you."

312
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,680
That was it.

313
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,800
"It's not me, but it's among you"?

314
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Are you sure?

315
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,460
If you don't trust me, 
ask other people.

316
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,270
Not just our film crew, but

317
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,400
Director and Jung Hee unni got it too.

318
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,940
Any inkling?

319
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Not sure.

320
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,380
"Not me, but among you."

321
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,870
You still don't know?

322
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,130
I, An Sung Tae isn't the
 killer, it's among you.

323
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,350
It's obviously An Sung Tae. 
99%, no, 100%.

324
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,200
Chief Park, it's me.

325
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,460
That phone number from earlier.

326
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,830
Try tracking it.

327
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,660
Chief.

328
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,100
- Don't you think it's strange?
- What?

329
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,760
They said, "It's not me

330
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,360
but among you."

331
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,470
Don't you think they're trying

332
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,100
to frame An Sung Tae?

333
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,500
Yes, I'll catch him soon.

334
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,190
I'm Jo Chang Gil, I'm Jo Chang Gil.

335
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,510
Chief!

336
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,440
 Give up the movie immediately and 

337
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,750
 follow my directions. 

338
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,030
 Follow my directions. 

339
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,610
By any chance,

340
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,710
did you notice anything

341
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,830
unique during the call?

342
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,500
- Anything unique?
- Yes.

343
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,850
Maybe a weird noise,

344
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,060
such as a cough or etc.

345
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,790
I guess I did hear something.

346
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,420
You know,

347
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,010
like they were coughing with 
their mouth covered.

348
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,460
I'm upset.

349
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,340
I didn't think I'd get caught so quick.

350
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,990
How did you know?

351
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,450
I guessed from the coughing sound.

352
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,270
Correct.

353
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,140
I made that phone call.

354
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,790
Wasn't the voice cute?

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,670
What was the reason?

356
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,780
It was as I said.

357
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,100
It's not the right time 
to make the film.

358
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,000
The lead actress' life is being threatened,

359
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and the director collapsed 
from stress.

360
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,560
How could we make the movie?

361
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,150
Is it true you know who the killer is?

362
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,940
Of course.

363
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,510
I know who put the...

364
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,080
sedative in Jung Hee's glass.

365
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,370
I saw it myself.

366
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,860
You think it's the killer 
from nine years ago?

367
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,970
You were wrong.

368
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,680
The culprit is

369
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,570
among everyone, including...

370
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,710
you and me.

371
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,490
Who is it?

372
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,170
I'm sorry,

373
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,240
but I won't tell you.

374
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,390
The set model arrived.
 Could you take a look?

375
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,010
Is the director here?

376
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,530
Yes, he's with CEO.

377
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,150
- Go show it to him.
- Okay.

378
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,840
- Also, tell Writer Jung to come see me.
- Yes, Producer.

379
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,150
So you lied about seeing 
An Sung Tae on the set.

380
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,440
I don't know.

381
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,490
Why did you lie about that?

382
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,900
Ms. Ma,

383
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,690
why do you think people lie?

384
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,970
Because they want to 
protect something.

385
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,220
But you don't want to 
protect the killer, do you?

386
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,910
Of course not.

387
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,590
Then tell me.

388
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,100
Who did it?

389
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,140
Why don't you tell me first...

390
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,100
why I need to tell you.

391
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,610
The wrong person's
 on the run right now.

392
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,660
An Sung Tae?

393
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,910
He deserves it considering 
what he's done.

394
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,400
Too bad Jung Hee got involved 
with someone like him.

395
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,590
He needs to pay for his crimes.

396
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,380
But he's not responsible

397
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,200
for what's been going on.

398
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,220
Why do you care whether 
trashy people get framed or not?

399
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,990
Is it because you're 
on the same boat?

400
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,650
Because the police is trailing you while

401
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,010
you're disguised as Ma Ji Won?

402
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,450
My, did I hit the nail on the head?

403
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,630
You still don't know what you did.

404
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,900
What I did?

405
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,760
Did you want to see me?

406
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,370
The cast photoshoot's
delayed for two more days.

407
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,120
I'll note that in my preparations.

408
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,150
Did I say An Sung Tae was the killer?

409
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,520
No, right?

410
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,640
I only said I thought I saw him,

411
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,490
and made a prank call
 stating my wishes.

412
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,900
It's not my fault that people think 
An Sung Tae's the killer because of it.

413
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,100
Don't you agree?

414
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,250
That's not what I meant.

415
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,840
Then what did you mean?

416
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,240
If the killer also got the prank call...

417
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
would the killer...

418
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,710
also take it as a joke?

419
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,070
Tell me if you know.

420
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,500
If you don't,

421
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,990
something terrible might happen to you.

422
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,070
- Myung Hee.
- Ms. Ma.

423
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,200
As you can see, they call me

424
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,010
"Producer" and not "Myung Hee" here.

425
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,580
Please address me as
 "Producer" from now on.

426
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,100
Something terrible may happen to me?

427
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,680
How dare she?

428
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,070
How interesting.

429
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,370
I wonder if that's poisoned...

430
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
or not.

431
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,990
If it is, then...

432
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,350
who'd done it?

433
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,200
Oh, no.

434
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,920
 

435
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,050
 Yes, Producer Park. 

436
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,400
Why are you doing this to me?

437
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,320
 What are you talking about? 

438
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,020
Director...

439
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,130
you can't be doing this to me.

440
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,950
 Producer Park. 

441
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,630
 Myung Hee! 

442
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,480
 Myung Hee! 

443
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,990
 What's going on? 

444
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,140
 

445
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,190
 You know what this is, right? 

446
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,240
 You'll lose everything if I speak. 

447
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,320
 Hey, Seo Eun Ji! 

448
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,500
 Is someone holding something
 over Lee Jung Hee's head? 

449
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,750
 I told you to get her fingerprints. 

450
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,250
 I'll get them soon. Don't worry. 

451
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,490
 They were both murders. 

452
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,390
 It means we don't have much time. 

453
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,010
 It got me interested in 
Ma Ji Won's novels. 

454
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,440
 Are you sure you saw Jung Hee? 

455
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
 You got the prank call, right? 

456
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,710
 You saw what Director Seong 
did for his wife. 

457
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,860
 No one can harass us
 now, Jae Deok. 

458
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,870
 So, please tell me. 

459
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,420
 - Her life is being threatened?
- You mean Ma Ji Won? 

460
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,880
 No one can help you. 

461
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,750
 There's no one. 

462
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,250
♫  Because you can't have it all  ♫
