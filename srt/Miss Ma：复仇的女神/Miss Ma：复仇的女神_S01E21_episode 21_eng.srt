1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,840
You idiot.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,810
You have a garden with an ocean view...

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,780
and a pool, too.

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,350
So what's the f***ing matter?

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,410
Why?

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,050
Why, why can't you write?

7
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,780
 Yes, go ahead. 

8
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,060
Rice, kimchi,

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,450
beer,

10
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,690
coffee, and...

11
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,880
rat poison.

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,890
  Rat poison? 

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
Don't say anything 
and just bring them!

14
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,680
What's the rat poison for?

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,260
Aren't you supposed to...

16
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,280
bring it no matter what?

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
I know, but...

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,060
Just  drop them off and leave.

19
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,900
 

20
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,900
 Don't you know how to drive? 

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,480
  Hey! Move the car! 

22
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,570
One iced caramel macchiato, 
with lots of syrup and...

23
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,600
this, this, and this.

24
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,390
Excuse me.

25
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,180
Are you a writer by any chance?

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,210
You are, right?

27
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,460
You're Writer Ma Ji Won.

28
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,790
- Who are you?
- I'm your fan!

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,370
By the way, did you come here

30
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,870
to solve a case, too?

31
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,040
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,180
My friend lives in Rainbow Town.

33
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,180
She said that all her town's cases...

34
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,450
were solved by you.

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,680
Cases?

36
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,300
Yes.

37
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,940
The murder cases.

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,770
By the way, is it true?

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,020
Did you really catch all the killers?

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,480
Yeah.

41
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,830
 
 Geez, seriously...  

42
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,320
 Why didn't you open the door? 

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,470
Have you been doing well?

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,870
Writer Ma Ji Won.

45
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,430
Why did you...

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,610
What do you mean? 
I have business here.

47
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,210
Anyhow, will you 
keep me standing here?

48
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,270
 

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,140
 Oppa! 

50
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,690
Drive me to the terminal.

51
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,530
Are you going somewhere?

52
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,860
- Daejeon.
- Get in.

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,330
Thank you.

54
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,270
This house has a tasteful vibe.

55
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,250
What's this about?

56
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,540
What's this?

57
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,300
Why do you eat stuff like this?

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,490
I asked you what this is about.

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,380
Don't look at me with a scary face.

60
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,500
I was going to die, but...

61
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,610
I changed my mind and came here.

62
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,370
Did anything bother you 
while you were writing?

63
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,560
Not at all.

64
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,230
A vacation home by 
the ocean with a pool.

65
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,200
- It was the best.
- But?

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,870
That's the problem.

67
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,230
The studio was excellent, but...

68
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,720
I couldn't f***ing write.

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
That's why...

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,540
I thought I should get your help 
once more. That's why I'm here.

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,580
What is there for me to help with?

72
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,630
The two cases you solved here.

73
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,070
Attorney Choi and 
Lee Jung Hee's cases.

74
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I...

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,260
want to try again with those.

76
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,080
For one last time.

77
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,900
If I can't write...

78
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,120
a good book with material like that,

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,960
I won't bother you anymore.

80
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,490
I'll disappear forever.

81
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,470
So please this one time...

82
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,130
I beg of you.

83
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,760
Regarding those,

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,690
you could've read the news articles.

85
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,920
Would news articles cut it?

86
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,710
I need to meet them and interview them.

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,570
Don't you think?

88
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,150
Unni, you'll really be like this?

89
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,590
You didn't answer my calls either.

90
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,070
You have a guest?

91
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,430
- No, not a guest.
- Who is it?

92
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,750
No.

93
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,190
What brought you here anyway?

94
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,150
Well, this...

95
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,950
- It's the pic we took at the studio the other day.
- Thank you.

96
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,730
Well, Unni.

97
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,750
Ms. Oh asked you for a favor.

98
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,830
A favor?

99
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,360
Let's talk inside. 
It's an important favor.

100
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,920
Now's not the right time.

101
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,910
It's messy in there.

102
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,940
Messy?

103
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Why?

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,160
Unni, I heard you put the 
house up for sale. Is it true?

105
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,790
That's not it.

106
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,890
Where's Ms. Oh right now?

107
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,940
She's at the library.

108
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,920
Let's talk there. Let's go, let's go!

109
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,620
On the way to the new city,
 there's a town called Chungeohram.

110
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,620
It's an invitation from their library's volunteer team.
 

111
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,720
Not exactly an invitation, but...

112
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,990
more like a challenge. Right, Ms. Oh?

113
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,930
Around this time of the year, Chungeohram 
and Rainbow Town make a bet.

114
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,940
We fight over the appreciation plaque 
from the borough offices.

115
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,580
But what does
 "A murder will happen" mean?

116
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,940
It's the Mafia Game.

117
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,190
Mafia Game?

118
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,680
You know, it's a children's game.

119
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,950
A game where the civilians 
catch the mafia killers.

120
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,280
Yes, a detective game.

121
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,120
Everyone knows you're a detective.

122
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm kind of busy these days.

124
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,030
Don't be like that. Try to make time.

125
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,790
Appreciation plaque is important, but

126
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,850
our pride as a volunteer team 
is on the line here.

127
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,280
Yes, Ms. Ma.

128
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,110
Let's prove ourselves to those women.

129
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,430
Come with us, Unni. Please?

130
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,730
I'm so sorry.

131
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,960
Sorry.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,870
- Aigoo. 
- Seriously.

133
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,590
By the way, on that day...

134
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,050
Woo Joon will be there, too.

135
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,000
The daughter of the maid who 
lives there is Woo Joon's classmate.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,540
They invited Woo Joon 
for dinner tomorrow.

137
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Unni, you haven't seen him in a while.

138
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,770
No?

139
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,690
Mafia Game?

140
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,480
That sounds fun.

141
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,220
Okay. I'll go.

142
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,400
Really?

143
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,110
Yes.

144
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,350
What are you trying to do?

145
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,890
The lady with the 
angular face is Ms. Oh.

146
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,420
The one who with the 
cat face is Ms. Yang.

147
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,040
But why is Ms. Oh the leader?

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,080
Ms. Ma.

149
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,810
Because she leads the volunteer team?

150
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,520
I guess, even mom-and-pop store 
owners state themselves

151
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,590
as CEOs on their business cards.

152
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,720
Ms. Ma Ji Won!

153
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,930
You don't have to intimidate me.

154
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,150
I'm here to interview them.

155
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,830
By the way, who's that lady?

156
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,020
The one who came to the house.

157
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,510
Should I go and ask myself?

158
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,950
Wow. You have great manners, Oppa.

159
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,050
You could've dropped me 
off at the terminal.

160
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,150
I have business here, too.

161
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,490
Is that so?

162
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,180
Thank you anyway.

163
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,800
Did Jang Chul Min 
do something to you?

164
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,120
At Director Seong's house...

165
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,010
you said he was the culprit.

166
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,970
It's my problem.

167
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,250
You don't have to know.

168
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,870
So you will solve it on your own?

169
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,720
I have someone helping me.

170
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,380
Ms. Ma?

171
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,460
Why do you think Auntie
 would help me?

172
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,880
I know that she's not
 really Ma Ji Won.

173
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,210
And her relation to 
Jang Chul Min, too.

174
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,510
Then why aren't you
 doing anything?

175
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,860
If you report her, 
you'll get a big reward.

176
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
Seo Eun Ji.

177
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,870
I don't know who 
you're meeting here.

178
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,380
But...

179
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,090
the people who'll help you are...

180
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,230
the ones who've been by 
your side. Don't forget that.

181
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,660
Did you come alone?

182
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,850
Auntie is busy.

183
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,390
Auntie.

184
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,070
That's enough.

185
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,340
I know you don't have 
an aunt, Seo Eun Ji.

186
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,710
Why wouldn't I have one?

187
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,930
I'll have another one, Auntie.

188
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,000
Thanks, Auntie.

189
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,030
Did that answer your question?

190
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
So, why did you want to see me?

191
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,290
There's something I'm curious about.

192
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,730
Why must I satisfy your curiosity?

193
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,290
Because I heard 
Lee Jung Hee's last words.

194
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,960
 

195
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,790
 

196
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,030
 The locations where the
 kidnapper made phone calls from 

197
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,280
 
 matched that woman's location. 

198
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,470
Also, her car was found
 on the crime scene,

199
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,330
and the hair and blood from there...

200
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,750
belonged to Jang Min Seo.

201
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,530
Any possibility that this was forged?

202
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,100
None.

203
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,990
How about switching of 
the hair or blood?

204
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,770
You think of the police as a joke.

205
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,810
That means...

206
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,530
it might've been possible if she 
thought of the police as a joke.

207
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,680
She?

208
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,080
Lee Jung Hee said that...

209
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,930
the killer she'd seen...

210
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,280
was definitely a woman.

211
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,600
If Lee Jung Hee said
 it was a woman...

212
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,640
It's not...

213
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,470
my Auntie.

214
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,810
If it was her,

215
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,660
she would've said more than
 "the killer is a woman."

216
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,580
By any chance...

217
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,060
have you suspected Jang Chul Min?

218
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,960
You mean Jang Min Seo's father?

219
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,480
He gained the most from that incident.

220
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,090
No.

221
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,480
Jang Chul Min had the cleanest alibi.

222
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,350
What if he did it with another person?

223
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,120
- Another person?
- An accomplice.

224
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,360
A female accomplice who did that...

225
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,090
with Jang Chul Min.

226
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,540
 

227
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,960
Fine.

228
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,720
Let's say there was an accomplice.

229
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,910
But why do you think that 
Jang Chul Min is one of them?

230
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,100
If you did a background check on me,

231
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,350
you probably know I have a sister.

232
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,580
The sister who went missing?

233
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,870
After Soo Ji went missing...

234
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,670
I looked for her like crazy.

235
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,110
But I couldn't find her.

236
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,540
So I looked up...

237
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,180
the children who 
died around the time...

238
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,330
my sister went missing.

239
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,140
That's when I first saw 
Jang Min Seo's case file.

240
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
But...

241
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,010
in Jang Min Seo's memorial case...

242
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,970
I found my sister's belongings.

243
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
What?

244
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,640
That doesn't make any sense.

245
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,900
So I started wondering.

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
And I found out...

247
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,110
that Jang Min Seo and Soo Ji...

248
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,420
were the same age...

249
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,450
and their height...

250
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,770
and their weight...

251
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,540
were all similar, too.

252
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,750
That's why I thought...

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,980
that Jang Min Seo who died...

254
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,080
 

255
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,150
might be my sister, Soo Ji.

256
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,690
But then...

257
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,820
I saw the news that the woman who killed 
Jang Min Seo escaped from prison.

258
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,270
She said she'll kill her 
daughter's murderer, right?

259
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,500
 I'll find that bastard. 

260
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,670
 I'll find him and I'll... 

261
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
 I'll do the same to him... 

262
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,230
 as he did to my daughter Min Seo. 

263
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,040
 I'll smash his face... 

264
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
 with a rock and kill him. 

265
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,130
That's why I went to see that woman.

266
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,920
 Auntie! 

267
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,700
 Seriously! Why didn't you 
answer my calls? 

268
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,130
 Why are you looking at me like that? 

269
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,280
 Didn't you miss me? 

270
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,530
 I thought that... 

271
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,870
my Auntie might...

272
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,000
be able to find her.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,120
The person who killed...

274
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,230
my Soo Ji, not Jang Min Seo.

275
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,590
You're mistaken.

276
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,980
That corpse was 
definitely Jang Min Seo.

277
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,040
You saw the documents earlier.

278
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,380
This is...

279
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,690
the hairpin I made for my sister and me. 
Only two of them exist this world.

280
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,680
But Lee Jung Hee saw this, too.

281
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,310
On the girl who the killer was carrying.

282
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,630
 That girl... 

283
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,850
 had that hairpin... 

284
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,760
You really don't recognize it?

285
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,320
Even the detective can't remember it.

286
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,780
But how did Jang Chul Min 
recognize it right away?

287
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,540
 Yes. 

288
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,250
 Her name's Soo Ji. 

289
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,710
 She's a very pretty sister of mine. 

290
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,170
 Soo Ji? 

291
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,130
You're not making any sense.

292
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,010
How did Jang Chul Min recognize this?

293
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,750
Because he's the accomplice 
in my sister's kidnapping.

294
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,080
And that means...

295
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,270
the girl in here...

296
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,630
isn't Jang Min Seo,

297
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,620
but my sister Soo Ji.

298
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,100
 

299
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,940
 

300
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,570
Could you wait over there for a moment?

301
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,520
 Sorry about last time, Sunbae. 

302
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,870
Who are you?

303
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,410
 I'm a hoobae who admires the CEO. 

304
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,900
Who told you to kill Lee Jung Hee?

305
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,620
 I'm an admirer of yours as well. 

306
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,330
Hey, punk.

307
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm asking who gave you the order.

308
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,440
 For the blind CEO's sake, 
don't pry anymore. 

309
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,170
 I don't want both of you getting hurt. 

310
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,060
 Then please take care. 

311
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,480
This is a perfect room for a great book...

312
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,800
to be conceived in.

313
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,700
I told the front desk. 
Ask them if you need anything.

314
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,110
I'll come around 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

315
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,550
By the way...

316
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,980
why are you living in Rainbow Town 
masquerading as me?

317
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,290
Must you know that 
for your book, too?

318
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,960
Not right now, but...

319
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,150
I'll be leaving this place soon.

320
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,960
I'll tell you everything you 
want to know before then.

321
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,450
But until then, I'd like you to...

322
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,140
only focus on your writing.

323
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,700
I guess I should.

324
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,530
If people see that there 
are two Ma Ji Wons...

325
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,740
it'll make things very sticky.

326
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
 

327
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,870
 

328
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,750
 Where are you? You're not 
answering your phone. 

329
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,260
 Is something going on? 

330
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,750
So...

331
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,060
Choi Man Shik, who was cornered...

332
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,920
attacked his son...

333
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,200
What was his name again?

334
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,740
Woo Joon.

335
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Choi Woo Joon.

336
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,330
Right.

337
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,670
Choi...

338
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,350
Woo Joon's neck with a letter opener...

339
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,890
No, no, no.

340
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,700
A knife sounds better.

341
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,710
Like an X-Acto knife.

342
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,500
Seems more real, too.

343
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,450
Yes.

344
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,850
It must be a knife, so the 
readers feel terrorized.

345
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,390
He threatened his son 
with a knife to his neck.

346
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,880
But at that moment...

347
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,460
our protagonist...

348
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,600
What did you do?

349
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,730
I said, what did you do?

350
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,110
This thug I know 
showed up and saved him.

351
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,920
Okay.

352
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,820
Wow.

353
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
A thug.

354
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,340
I like this character, too.

355
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,050
A thug punk who does gardening?

356
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,720
Let's call it a day today.

357
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,740
Can I...

358
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,900
ask you for a favor?

359
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,600
I want to meet this thug.

360
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,580
Feel free...

361
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,250
to meet him later.

362
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,660
Are you okay?

363
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,500
Yes.

364
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,580
Did you find out who sent them?

365
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,350
I don't know yet.

366
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,810
I'm sorry, CEO.

367
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:56,670
I think my days are numbered now.

368
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,020
But before that, I must 
ask her for a favor.

369
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,470
I mean, Ms. Ma.

370
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,490
You can tell me instead.

371
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,260
Okay.

372
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,150
I'll bring her here soon.

373
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,610
Geez, seriously.

374
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,580
Aigoo. Unni!

375
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,440
Sorry.

376
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,080
I was busy with something.

377
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,360
Now that Ms. Ma is here,

378
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
we should loosen up and...

379
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,630
- smile.
- Smile?

380
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,130
Ms. Ma, try it.

381
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,290
Aigoo.

382
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,170
Not a sickly smile. Look.

383
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,250
You know, the lower abdomen?

384
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,550
Feel the confidence and pull it up...

385
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,460
I'll touch you a bit.

386
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,000
Pull it up all the way here, and...

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,510
"Those people are nothing."

388
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,050
Yes, right?

389
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,440
You already knew how to do it.

390
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,840
Well, then...

391
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,790
Shall we go?

392
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,070
Let's relax and...

393
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,720
Let's relax.

394
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,930
What an elegant scarf, Ms. Oh.

395
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,380
You lost a lot of weight, Ms. Cha.

396
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,380
And is this Writer Ma?

397
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,040
Oh my, I guess they heard 
of Ms. Ma already.

398
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,970
I heard a lot about you.

399
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,860
That you're the ace of Rainbow Town.

400
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,240
Nice to meet you.

401
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,790
Then who's the ace 
of Chungeohram?

402
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,980
Ms. Do?

403
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,650
I'm Do Ja Yeon.

404
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,170
Ms. Do is retired now, but

405
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,170
she was a successful analyst

406
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,320
in Japan.

407
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,990
You know that Japan is

408
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,300
still ahead of us in finance.

409
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,550
I don't know.  I don't 
really agree with that.

410
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,330
Anyway.

411
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,540
I'm looking forward to today.

412
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,680
Then...

413
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,540
shall we go inside?

414
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,130
Hold on a second.

415
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,910
The most important person
 in a Mafia Game is...

416
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,530
the moderator, right?

417
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,870
Well, Sung Eun's mom
 will be doing that.

418
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,660
No. It should be 
someone non-partial.

419
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,600
For example...

420
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,570
someone who's a public official.

421
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,350
Do you think that's necessary?

422
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes, I do.

423
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,230
That's why I invited someone.

424
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,440
Did you see Ms. Cha's 
face change? My goodness.

425
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,440
"Well, Sung Eun's mom will be..."

426
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,270
Who did she think we were?

427
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,020
Anyhow, our trusty Chief Jo is here.

428
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,280
We'll win for sure.
