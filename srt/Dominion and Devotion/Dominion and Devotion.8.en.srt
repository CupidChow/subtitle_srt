=Episode 8=

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,079
(Master, do you want more ice?)

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,960
(Master, do you want more ice?)

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,600
Master, do you want more ice?

6
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,000
Get out.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Understood.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,280
(Master Pei.)

9
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,079
(Come and detoxify me.)

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,640
(What am I thinking?)

11
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,759
(Hallucination.)

12
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,159
(Must be a hallucination.)

13
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,079
Auntie.

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,400
You must be hungry.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
I made some porridge.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Have some.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Auntie.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
How did I come back last night?

19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,400
Gao...

20
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,400
Madam Li and I brought you back.

21
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,319
So,

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,480
did I do anything
out of line last night?

23
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,000
If Madam Li and I had arrived later,

24
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,120
Your Majesty might have slept

25
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,480
with Lady Gao.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,599
(His expression looks just normal.)

27
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,680
(It must be a dream.)

28
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,120
Thank you for your help, Master Pei.

29
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,599
Lady Gao drugged you.

30
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,640
How do you want to handle it?

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,120
She delivered me the leverage.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,319
How can I waste it?

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Right?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
This medicine

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
can relieve headaches.

36
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,960
You really don't

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
remember

38
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,360
anything from last night?

39
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,520
No, I don't.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
But I think

41
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,479
I had a weird dream.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I dreamed that I

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,599
groped Master Pei.

44
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,399
Thankfully, it was a dream.

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,919
Or I wouldn't know how to face him.

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,439
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
That was not a dream.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,719
What did you say?

49
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,960
(It's over.)

50
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,039
(It's over.)

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,560
(I actually groped a eunuch.)

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,039
His Majesty has arrived.

53
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,439
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

54
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,800
Do you confess?

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,199
I confess.

56
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,919
I shouldn't have drugged Your Majesty.

57
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,199
Although it did no harm,

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,559
it enraged Your Majesty.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll accept any punishment.

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,680
I only hope Your Majesty

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,439
could show leniency,
considering that I did this

62
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,239
out of desperation, only to stay close

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
to Your Majesty.

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Hmph.

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,759
Out of desperation?

66
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,479
You think

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,318
I don't know
that you are sent by Master Zhuo

68
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,840
to keep an eye on me?

69
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,239
As a concubine in the harem,

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,400
you don't even know whom to side with.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I can lock you up

72
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,119
in the cold palace
for the rest of your life,

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,279
completely unattended to,

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,959
starving throughout the year,

75
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,718
and freezing to the bone in winter.

76
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,719
No one will ever

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,280
care about you in this lifetime.

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,240
Do you think

79
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,240
that Master Zhuo will take care of you?

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
He will only send me more concubines

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,078
and never cast a glance

82
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
at a discarded pawn like you.

83
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,959
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,360
I sincerely repent.

85
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,800
Please show mercy.

86
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,319
You're scared?

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Your Majesty.

88
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,279
Lady Gao.

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
Now you know

90
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,438
who decides your fate

91
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,000
once you've entered the palace.

92
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,559
I know your father

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,439
favors his concubine over his wife.

94
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,439
You're the Minister's
legitimate daughter,

95
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,040
but your half-sister
lives a better life than you.

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Therefore,

97
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,838
being sent here by Master Zhuo

98
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,040
was your only chance to rise again.

99
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,399
Therefore,

100
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,559
you desperately wanted my favor

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,039
and Master Zhuo's trust.

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Am I right?

103
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,680
How do you know all this?

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,480
Bring them in.

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,199
Your Majesty.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,240
They are...

107
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,039
I can promote your rank right away.

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,198
From now on,

109
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,759
you won't have parents-in-law to serve

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,438
or children to discipline.

111
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,279
Meanwhile,

112
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,079
you have a husband

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,078
who only gives you money
when you need it.

114
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,799
Otherwise, I'm as good as a dead man

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,999
who will never bother you.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,398
Eat and drink as you please.

117
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,679
Go home when you are bored

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,679
and lash out
at your malicious stepmother.

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,519
No one would dare to pick on you.

120
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,560
If you

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
feel lonely and bored,

122
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,759
and want several gentlemen
to keep you company,

123
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,759
I can also grant your wish.

124
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,719
Master Zhuo can't offer you

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,879
a life like this.

126
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:58,920
But

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,439
I can give it to you now.

128
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,040
This is the perfect life
that many women dream of.

129
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,879
Do you

130
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
want it or not?

131
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,159
Such a great temptation.

132
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Your Majesty.

133
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,319
What should I do for you?

134
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,480
Master.

135
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,879
Shaoyao, Lady Gao's maid, is here.

136
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,720
Bring her in.

137
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,959
Understood.

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I pay my respects to Master Zhuo.

139
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,319
Rise.

140
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Understood.

141
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,488
(Shaoyao, Lady Gao's Maid)

142
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,360
Speak freely.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Understood.

144
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,560
My lady said she should come in person,

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,999
but she couldn't get out of bed.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,479
So she sent me here

147
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,319
to not keep you waiting.

148
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,800
My lady said...

149
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,078
My lady said that His Majesty

150
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,199
kept her busy all night.

151
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
The young emperor looks flimsy.

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Yet he's quite capable.

153
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,838
My lady made it.

154
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,680
His Majesty sent her many gifts

155
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,600
and offered to promote her rank.

156
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,279
Let's see how fast she gets pregnant.

157
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,639
You may leave.

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,879
Understood.

159
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,439
Men can easily

160
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,439
lose themselves

161
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,199
once they fall for women,

162
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,560
especially the pretty ones.

163
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,639
That is true.

164
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:44,320
(Junlai Village)

165
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,880
(Huo Zheng, Hanlin Academy Scholar)
(Master.)

166
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
(I've come too late.)

167
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,040
(I know you've been wronged.)

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,240
(They say you were killed by bandits.)

169
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,959
(I won't believe a single word of it.)

170
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,839
(I've been keeping an eye
on the Zhuo family.)

171
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,720
This case gives me a great opportunity.

172
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,399
I swear on my life

173
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,239
that I shall kill Zhuo Shangxian
in front of everyone

174
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,080
to honor your spirit in the heavens.

175
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:52,659
(Grave of Mentor He Yanbai)

176
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,879
Master Zhuo.

177
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,000
The emperor has been absent for long.

178
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Why is that?

179
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,158
I have told you.

180
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,359
His Majesty is unwell

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,519
and needs rest.

182
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,720
If you have a memorial, just present it.

183
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,279
His Majesty hasn't

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,639
replied to my memorials
in the past half month.

185
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,518
No matter what,

186
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,519
today,

187
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,399
I must speak with His Majesty.

188
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,399
Huo Zheng.

189
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,240
Are you plotting a coup?

190
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,399
I wouldn't dare.

191
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,159
But the empire needs a ruler.

192
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,080
His Majesty neglects court affairs.

193
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,399
We

194
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,440
need an explanation today.

195
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,600
If His Majesty does not meet us,

196
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,918
we

197
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,320
will kneel in this hall

198
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
and keep waiting.

199
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,518
His Majesty is no longer unwell.

200
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,879
If he wishes to see His Majesty,

201
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,120
let him do so.

202
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,159
I will be watching over,

203
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,200
and nothing will go wrong.

204
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,919
Fine.

205
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,039
Since Master Huo insists,

206
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,599
Shenzhi,

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,320
take Master Huo to see His Majesty.

208
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Understood.

209
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,278
I know you pulled the strings

210
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,279
and promoted me

211
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,200
to fulfill my ambitions.

212
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
But if you intend
to win me over like this,

213
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,200
you've miscalculated.

214
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,679
I have no interest in winning you over.

215
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,639
I only helped you

216
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,960
at someone's request.

217
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,240
At someone's request?

218
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,960
Who is that?

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,639
I'm afraid

220
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,918
that only one person in this world

221
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,360
could look after you.

222
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,080
Before I go back,

223
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
I want to ask you for a person.

224
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,720
You may have

225
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,960
whoever you want.

226
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Naturally,

227
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,919
that would be His Majesty.

228
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,840
His Majesty cares about his people.

229
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,120
Of course, I believe that.

230
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,159
But I wonder why Master Pei

231
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,120
would agree to help me.

232
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,799
What are you after?

233
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,799
Don't you think

234
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,959
that His Majesty

235
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,279
has some charm?

236
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,399
Master Huo.

237
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,399
Let's go.

238
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,759
Bring Huo Zheng in.

239
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,080
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

240
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,879
Master Huo.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Please rise.

242
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,599
You spoke out for Master He
in court that day.

243
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,639
I admire your relationship
with your mentor.

244
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,919
Has your wound

245
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,919
fully healed yet?

246
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,638
Thank you for your concern.

247
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,639
It has healed.

248
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,240
But my mentor was ambushed

249
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,080
and murdered

250
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,678
on his way back home.

251
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,320
The murderer is still at large.

252
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
It's such an important matter.

253
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,359
Why the delay in reporting?

254
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Your Majesty.

255
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,919
I submitted ten memorials in a row.

256
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,399
Someone is hiding them from you

257
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,519
out of his guilty conscience.

258
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,279
Master Huo.

259
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,000
Be cautious with your words.

260
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
What?

261
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,200
Someone doesn't want me
to speak about his evil deeds?

262
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,399
Master Pei.

263
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,440
Master Huo.

264
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,159
You'd better not

265
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,039
make accusations without evidence.

266
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,440
Or you may get into trouble.

267
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,799
Master Pei.

268
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,720
Did you do it?

269
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,360
Your Majesty.

270
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,240
Do you also believe in
such groundless rumors?

271
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,840
As long as you deny it,

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,159
I will believe you.

273
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,839
Master Huo.

274
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Did you come here

275
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,519
to complain about me?

276
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,558
(Could there be some hidden truth?)

277
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,798
Master Pei.

278
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,080
Sooner or later,
I will find the evidence.

279
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,159
Your Majesty.

280
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,840
I am here to present my memorial.

281
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,639
Please issue a decree

282
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
to execute Zhuo Minghua,
Magistrate of Jinghua Prefecture.

283
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,960
(Master Zhuo?)

284
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
What happened?

285
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,480
As the Magistrate of Jinghua Prefecture,

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
Zhuo Minghua harbored
the wealthy merchant Luo Fuhai

287
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,720
and killed 36 innocent people
from Junlai Village in Qinnan County.

288
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,799
That is a heinous crime.

289
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Your Majesty,

290
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,279
please do justice to the deceased.

291
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,039
What did you say?

292
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,159
Who died?

293
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Qinnan County.

294
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,559
Junlai Village.

295
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,120
All 36 villagers were killed.

296
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,888
(Memorial)

297
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
Master Huo,

298
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,240
please elaborate on the details.

299
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Does Your Majesty

300
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,279
remember the case of Junlai Village

301
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,679
from over a month ago?

302
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,159
Yes, I do.

303
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,480
There was a broker
named Sun Daqiang in Qinnan County.

304
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,398
After Hu Quan's incident,

305
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,519
Sun Daqiang was also flogged

306
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,839
and couldn't make money.

307
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
He held a grudge

308
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,440
and instigated the merchant Luo Fuhai

309
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
to assault Zhao Rulan.

310
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,320
Zhao Rulan hanged herself

311
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,600
in the village due to the humiliation.

312
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,559
After that,

313
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,360
Zhang Guifen and the village women
sought justice at the court.

314
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,080
But Zhuo Minghua accused them
of causing a disturbance,

315
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,919
and sentenced
all 36 of them to death right away.

316
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,079
(Zhuo Minghua
is Zhuo Shangxian's only cousin.)

317
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,558
(If not handled properly,)

318
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,720
(her life as the emperor)

319
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,600
(could very likely end here.)

320
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,158
As Zhuo Minghua's close relatives,
Master Pei should

321
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,159
excuse himself.

322
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,600
It's not for you to decide.

323
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,759
Your Majesty.

324
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,398
I will report this to Master Zhuo

325
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,399
for a full investigation.

326
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,679
Full investigation?

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,479
Who knows what you're plotting?

328
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Even if I'm plotting something,

329
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,879
what can you do?

330
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,480
You...

331
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,799
Shut up!

332
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,559
I will

333
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,159
visit Junlai Village
to look into this case in person.

334
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Master Pei,

335
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,759
