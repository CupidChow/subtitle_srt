00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,928
=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,478
I'm Luo Wenjing, the Huiyuan.

4
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,679
I'm appealing for justice.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,159
I request to see Your Majesty.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,199
I'm Luo Wenjing, the Huiyuan.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,438
I'm appealing for justice.

8
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,639
I request to see Your Majesty.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
(Luo Wenjing, Examinee)
Hold on.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,479
Let him speak.

11
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,158
First, I accuse Li Changjia,
Chief Censor of the Censorate,

12
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,758
of abusing power,

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,599
detaining a scholar of this year
without cause,

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,640
and torturing him.

15
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,119
Second, I accuse
the Court of Judicial Review

16
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,799
of killing innocent Qin Yu,
a Juren of this year,

17
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,159
with utmost cruelty.

18
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,399
Third, I accuse
this year's Chief Examiner

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,359
of leaking, corruption,

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,518
rigging the imperial exams,

21
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,680
and wrecking the governance.

22
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,200
I knew it.

23
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,318
You took me out

24
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,319
for some reason.

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Your Majesty, forgive me.

26
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,919
This scholar has suffered greatly.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,358
Having heard of my mentor's virtue,

28
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,439
he sought help from me.

29
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,040
Your Majesty,
please investigate the case

30
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,560
and bring justice back

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
to this country's scholars.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
Please look into the case,

33
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,719
kill vile courtiers,

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
stop the eunuch scourge,

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,959
and bring justice back to the scholars.

36
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,718
The imperial exams
are a major state affair.

37
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,760
Even if you hadn't made such a scene,

38
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,120
I would still deal with it.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Huo Zheng,

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,439
investigate this case personally.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,000
All officials involved,

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
regardless of their rank,

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
will be suspended
for a full investigation

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,159
and be punished severely
once the truth is clarified.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,319
Yes,

46
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,319
Your Majesty.

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,319
Thank

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
you...

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Qian Ming is close to Master Zhuo.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Zhuo Shangxian

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
must be stirring things up behind this.

53
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,000
Your Majesty.

54
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,199
You are injured.

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,240
No need for formalities.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

57
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,639
Greetings, Master Huo.

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,879
Tell me in detail

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
about what happened.

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Qin Yu and I are classmates and friends.

61
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
(Grade List)
(When the list was revealed,)

62
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,399
(we checked the list together.)

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,319
Congratulations, Luo.

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,719
You're the Huiyuan.

65
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,400
Luo,

66
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:56,159
you are truly a model for all of us.

67
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,038
Thank you.

68
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,159
(I became the Huiyuan.)

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,719
(While Qin Yu, usually outstanding
in talent, failed to rank.)

70
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,919
(That night,)

71
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,919
(I accompanied him to drink.)

72
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,400
(After drinking, I sent him home.)

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
(And I overheard)

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,079
(Ding Shanwen, son of Vice Minister
of Imperial Granary, mention cheating.)

75
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,840
You said

76
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,438
you got the exam questions in advance,

77
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,159
yet you didn't rank at all.

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,759
Quiet.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,638
(Qin Yu and I followed them to find out)

80
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,120
that it's Chief Examiner Qian Ming
who leaked the questions.

81
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,919
It's a serious matter,

82
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,680
so we went to the Censorate
to report it.

83
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,400
But Li Changjia, Chief Censor
of the Censorate, detained us,

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,800
forced us to admit that the leak
was a false accusation,

85
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,759
(and drove us out of the city.)

86
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,240
Move.

87
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,199
Stop dawdling.

88
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
Hurry up.

89
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,639
Hurry.

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
With no background, yet you dared
report to the Censorate?

91
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Ridiculous.

92
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,638
It's out of benevolence
that I spared your pathetic lives.

93
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,719
Now get lost.

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Hurry up.

95
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,759
(They humiliated us all the way.)

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,319
Move.

97
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Get up.

98
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,319
You ignorant fools.

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,159
You're lucky to be alive.

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Behave yourselves.

101
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,719
Don't return to the capital.

102
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,520
Get up quickly.

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Get lost.

104
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,399
If you come back,
I'll beat you to death.

105
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
I told you long ago.

106
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,079
Fairness and justice?

107
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,439
In their eyes, it all means nothing.

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,920
I aimed to retake the exam.

109
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,958
But you made such a big fuss.

110
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,600
I wouldn't have come if I had known.

111
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,240
Why am I so useless?

112
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,519
I admitted false accusation

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,878
and signed a confession.

114
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,079
Now I've even left a record
in the Censorate.

115
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,879
This completely ruins my career path.

116
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,560
If you didn't admit it,

117
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,439
I fear you couldn't even
keep your remaining half-life.

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,720
Luo was already the Huiyuan.

119
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,240
Now all efforts are in vain.

120
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,639
In this case,

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,959
we should all leave

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,959
and each look for livelihoods.

123
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll return to the capital.

124
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,399
I'll return to file a suit.

125
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,198
Fellow scholars,

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,639
are you willing to return with me?

127
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,920
Whoever goes is looking for death.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,680
I advise you all
not to follow his madness.

129
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,560
I'll go with you.

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,559
(Qin Yu and I decided to return.)

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,519
We discussed strategies along the way.

132
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,759
We planned to ask Master Huo to do us
justice once we were in the city.

133
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,632
(South Gate)

134
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,318
Why are the guards suddenly so strict?

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,800
They may fear we're not giving up

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and will go back.

137
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,160
Let's follow the plan first.

138
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,120
We can fake outsiders
seeking livelihoods in the city.

139
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,319
If stopped,

140
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,879
we can pay to get through.

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Go in.

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,759
Halt.

143
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,438
Why are you going into the city?

144
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,439
Officer,

145
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,600
times are tough.

146
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,639
I'm trying to find a livelihood
in the city.

147
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,720
Go quickly.

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,319
Thank you.

149
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,319
Thank you, officer.

150
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,438
(Qin Yu entered the city successfully.)

151
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,039
(But when it was my turn,)

152
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,799
(I ran into a censor.)

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Halt.

154
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,959
Name?

155
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
How dare you come back?

156
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,959
Tell me.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Where are the others?

158
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,159
The Censorate leaked exam questions.

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,279
Where is justice?

160
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,600
The Censorate leaked exam questions.

161
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,279
Take him down.

162
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,839
Where is justice?

163
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,199
Don't come over.

164
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,759
I have explosives on me.

165
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
If anyone comes over, I'll ignite them.

166
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:52,544
Stop!

167
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,519
Stop!

168
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,399
Stop!

169
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,879
Later,

170
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,279
I told Master Huo everything.

171
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,959
But when Master Huo
went to inquire about Qin Yu,

172
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,560
he brought back only his corpse.

173
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,038
You should rest well for now

174
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,639
and don't think too much.

175
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,479
Huo Zheng,

176
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,879
start with Li Changjia.

177
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Examine carefully.

178
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,159
Don't overlook any details.

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

180
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,399
You may leave first.

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,720
I'll ask him something alone.

182
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,679
I know the whole story

183
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,919
of this matter now.

184
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,679
But

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,000
I have a question.

186
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,039
I know

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,519
you are a woman.

188
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I lied to Your Majesty.

189
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I deserve death.

190
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,159
I am a bit curious.

191
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
Why did you dress
as a man to take the exam?

192
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,000
My real name is Luo Wenxi.

193
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,600
Luo Wenjing was the name
of my elder brother.

194
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,798
He obtained the title of Juren
but soon passed away due to illness.

195
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,360
My family struggled to live.

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,279
So my father forced me to be a concubine
of a moneylender in the city.

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,199
I couldn't accept that.

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,000
I have my own aspirations.

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
So I borrowed my elder brother's name

200
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,120
to take the metropolitan exam.

201
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,399
You may rise.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,038
I'd like to hear

203
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,559
what your ambition is.

204
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,399
I fear Your Majesty

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,799
might find my ambition amusing.

206
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,639
Speak freely.

207
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,360
As a child,

208
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,960
I had read and written
together with my elder brother

209
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,399
to be cultivated.

210
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,080
I thought more than once

211
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,399
that if one day,

212
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,919
when people talked about a woman,

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,758
the first thing they thought
wasn't her virtuous character

214
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,000
or her compliance,

215
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,319
but phrases

216
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
like "boundless ambition"
and "great aspirations."

217
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
How great that would be.

218
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Therefore,

219
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
my ambition since childhood

220
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,519
has been to stand in court like a man,

221
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,159
to cultivate myself,

222
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
to govern the country,

223
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,120
and to bring peace to the world.

224
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,759
If that could be achieved,

225
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,639
I would die without regret.

226
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,000
You're already the Huiyuan.

227
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,079
You're just one step away
from the court.

228
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,960
I've never heard of a precedent
of a woman in the imperial court.

229
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,360
To me, this step is like

230
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,279
an insurmountable gap.

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
You heard it all?

232
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Your Majesty,

233
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,919
what's on your mind?

234
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,399
If Zhuo Shangxian wants money,

235
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,320
there are better means
than cheating in the imperial exams.

236
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,879
What he wants

237
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,038
is to use the imperial exams

238
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,119
to place trusted aides in court

239
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,599
and gradually expand his power in court.

240
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
He aims at the ruling power.

241
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
For so many years,

242
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,639
how many of his people
have been planted in the court?

243
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,999
I'm afraid they are fully prepared.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,039
But there is one person

245
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,840
who might be the breach.

246
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,879
- Ding Shanwen.
- Ding Shanwen.

247
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,279
It's a big issue.

248
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,919
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

249
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,918
Are you seeking death?

250
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,279
Since you knew about the leak,
why didn't you silence them?

251
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,079
(Li Changjia, Chief Censor)
Calm down.

252
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,240
I didn't expect

253
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,320
that those few scholars
could cause such a big issue.

254
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,759
No one expected
that they weren't afraid of death.

255
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,039
So annoying.

256
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,799
And the evidence destruction?

257
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,000
Rest assured, Master Zhuo.

258
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,999
All relevant evidence
has been destroyed.

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,399
There won't be any traces.

260
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,960
(Qian Ming, Minister of Personnel/Chief Examiner)
Related scholars will keep quiet.

261
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,678
Who did those scholars say

262
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,120
they learned about the leak from?

263
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,758
Ding Shanwen, the only son
of Ding Qiyuan, Vice Minister

264
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,159
of the Imperial Granary.

265
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,159
Where is he now?

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He's probably

267
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
at home.

268
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,080
Probably?

269
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,320
Master,

270
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,079
Huo Zheng didn't see you
at your mansion.

271
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,879
Your butler

272
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,879
said you're here.

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,639
They are heading here now.

274
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Li Changjia,

275
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,679
go with Huo Zheng.

276
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,120
When you're there,

277
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,879
you should know what to say

278
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,399
and what not to say.

279
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,959
Rest assured, Master Zhuo.

280
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,159
I know what to do.

281
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,759
I have been helping you
for so many years,

282
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,799
and now I am implicated.

283
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,719
If anything happens to me,

284
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,799
it will be complete chaos.

285
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,678
I'm afraid all of you

286
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,879
will go down with me.

287
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,480
You are still safe.

288
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,080
I will settle this matter.

289
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,039
Then I'm relieved.

290
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,679
Where is she?

291
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,919
Who?

292
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,159
My wife.

293
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,559
She may be in the backyard.

294
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,039
You are here too.

295
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,719
Are there any other instructions?

296
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Any other?

297
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,440
Who else?

298
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,519
(Ding Qiyuan, Vice Minister/Ding Shanwen's father)
Master Pei.

299
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,360
Master Zhuo, I must thank you.

300
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I didn't know what to do about it.

301
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,399
Fortunately, Master Pei arrived in time

302
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,039
and took Shanwen away to hide.

303
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,960
When did he come?

304
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,039
Where did he go?

305
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,799
Half an hour ago.

306
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
They went to the suburban Yunqi Villa.

307
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,679
I won't say anything.

308
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,799
Master Li,

309
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,360
I will give you another chance.

310
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,919
You detained the scholars,

311
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,398
tortured them to make them

312
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,679
admit that their accusation
of the leak was false,

313
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,558
and expelled them
to cover up the leak itself.

314
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,759
You even killed Qin Yu,
the scholar who told the truth.

315
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,720
Do you admit guilt?

316
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Master Huo,

317
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,158
don't be like the commoners

318
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,240
and believe those rumors.

319
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,559
It is true that those scholars
were detained.

320
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,799
It's because they bypassed
proper channels to report,

321
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,120
and they must be checked.

322
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,200
I detained them according to the law.

323
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,558
And the sentence of expulsion

324
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,480
was already a light one,
as I took their youth and impetuosity

325
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,639
into account.

326
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,240
As for Qin Yu,

327
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,959
he carried explosives,

328
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
trying to blow up the city gate.

329
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,399
It was witnessed by many people.

330
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,120
A decapitation sentence

331
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,799
was totally just.

332
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,519
Open the door.

333
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,879
Yes.

334
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,000
You have official duties.

335
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
You may leave now.

336
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

337
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
