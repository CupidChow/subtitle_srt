00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
Auntie.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Come and take a look.

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,640
I prepared a birthday gift for you.

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,559
Does it look good?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:24,960
Auntie,

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,198
my birthday is not until next month.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,320
Isn't it too early now?

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,399
It's not too early.

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,279
This garment is not yet embroidered.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,240
Worried it won't finish in time.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,479
Turn around and let me see.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Come on.

15
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,079
Auntie,

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,240
you should leave the palace.

17
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,280
As I said,

18
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,000
no matter what happens,

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
I will always be by your side.

20
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,159
Okay.

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,719
Have you lost weight recently?

22
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,079
Rest assured.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,718
Master Huo got everything ready.

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,120
She will leave the palace safely.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,640
Thank you.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,199
(I'm sorry, Auntie.)

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,040
(I can't let you take risks with me.)

28
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,079
Tomorrow's court trial,

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,840
are you ready?

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Rest assured.

31
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,799
I have confidence in restoring justice
for Junlai Village.

32
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,640
Master Huo,

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,839
I know the clues you have found

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
involve both Zhuo Minghua
and the Imperial Advisor.

35
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,319
Yes.

36
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,599
What's your plan?

37
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,000
He is amassing wealth
and exploiting the people.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,640
Now's the time to bring him down.

39
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,079
I...

40
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,079
Enough.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,479
Now is not the time to move against him.

42
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,080
The matter ends with Zhuo Minghua.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,598
Do you understand?

44
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,599
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,679
Master Zhuo is a national scourge.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
He deserves to die even more!

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,119
Nothing would atone for his sins!

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I understand.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
But now is not the time.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,960
Are you afraid?

51
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,599
Huo Zheng,

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
how dare you!

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
I

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
will obey.

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Step down.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Cousin!

57
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,639
Cousin!

58
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,159
Cousin!

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Huo Zheng didn't dare to torture me.

60
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,159
Don't worry.

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,439
He didn't get a word out of me.

62
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,080
Don't worry?

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,240
I told you not to act so outrageously.

64
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,520
Now you've left such a big loophole.

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,718
Do you really think I'm the emperor?

66
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,280
Just a bunch of rogues.

67
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,439
How can you scold me like this for them?

68
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,680
Cousin,

69
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,039
get me out of here.

70
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,879
Idiot.

71
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,120
Have you been living too happily

72
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,759
that your brain has stopped working?

73
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,280
That was more than 30 lives!

74
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,199
Now it's escalated to a court hearing.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,360
You could be demoted to exile at best.

76
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,439
At worst,

77
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,319
your life might be at risk!

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,400
You're the Imperial Advisor!
You can save me!

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,959
Cousin,

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
you're not giving up on me, are you?

81
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,040
For so many years,

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,439
I've done so many dirty deeds
for the Zhuo family.

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,839
I contributed a lot!

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Now you're scared?

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,759
Let's first figure out
how to keep you alive.

86
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,480
Don't be foolish in court.

87
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,639
The less you say, the fewer mistakes.

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,959
Got it?

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you.

90
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,639
Alright.

91
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,680
Tell me what happened

92
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,160
in detail.

93
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,639
(Censorate)

94
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,319
Oh, no!

95
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,079
There's a fire!

96
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,599
(Censorate Morgue)
Put out the fire!

97
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,439
Hurry!

98
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
Coming!

99
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,199
Master Huo,

100
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,600
the fire happened suddenly.

101
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
The bodies inside are all charred!

102
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,920
The hearing is tomorrow.

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,240
What should we do?

104
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,920
They burned the evidence.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,199
Zhuo Minghua, Jinghua Magistrate,

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,000
to conceal Luo Fuhai's rape and murder
of Zhao Rulan,

107
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,720
wantonly killed 36 people
from Junlai Village.

108
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,959
Are you guilty?

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,399
Pure fabrication!

110
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,920
The unruly villagers were dissatisfied
with Luo Fuhai's not guilty verdict,

111
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,079
and attacked
the county office with weapons.

112
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
That was evil.

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
We executed them

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
based on the Laws of Great Ning!

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,599
Summon the suspect, Luo Fuhai,

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
and Coroner of Jinghua County, Li Siqi.

117
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,439
Luo Fuhai,

118
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,959
did you rape and murder Zhao Rulan?

119
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,639
Master,

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,559
Zhao Rulan

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,800
was notorious for her promiscuity.

122
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,560
Sun Daqiang introduced her to me.

123
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,799
And I

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
slept with her.

125
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,000
But then I gave her a lot of money.

126
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,720
Unexpectedly, she was extremely greedy.

127
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,040
She wanted to blackmail me

128
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,079
but couldn't.

129
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,518
So she grew irritable

130
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,319
and hit my head with a stone!

131
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,279
Everyone,

132
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
please look.

133
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,600
Look.

134
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,199
I fled from Junlai Village,

135
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,480
and reported it immediately

136
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,439
to Master Zhuo.

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,680
Master Zhuo was kind-hearted,

138
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,519
and did not convict her of injury.

139
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
As a result, she was ungrateful.

140
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,839
With a ruined reputation,

141
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,720
she hanged herself.

142
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,439
Li Siqi, the Coroner,

143
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,839
how did Zhao Rulan die?

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,399
Master Huo,

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,680
based on my examination,

146
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,759
Zhao Rulan indeed hanged herself.

147
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,639
The proof is clear.

148
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,079
What else is there to investigate?

149
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,398
Summon the Coroner from the Court,

150
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,399
Zhou Fangzheng.

151
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

152
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,519
Coroner Zhou,

153
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,199
please state the autopsy results
of Zhao Rulan.

154
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,839
According to my re-examination,

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,519
there are clear finger marks alongside
the rope marks on Zhao Rulan's neck.

156
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,720
She should have died from asphyxia
caused by hand strangulation,

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
not by hanging herself.

158
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,240
Oh?

159
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,079
You mean Li Siqi's autopsy was wrong?

160
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,639
What evidence do you have?

161
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,438
Luo Fuhai is so rich.

162
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,278
He can have any woman he wants.

163
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,438
Would he really need to rape and kill
a common woman?

164
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,439
Sure.

165
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Bring it up.

166
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,879
The evidence is Zhao Rulan's corpse.

167
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,439
It was almost destroyed
in a mysterious fire last night.

168
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,319
Fortunately, it was moved in advance.

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Did you see that?

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,319
Aren't the bodies all burned?

171
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Shut up!

172
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,920
What else do you have to say?

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,360
I-I accidentally misjudged!

174
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,639
Accidentally?

175
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,480
You, by accident,
let an innocent woman unjustly die!

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you pretending to be foolish,

177
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,720
or did someone instruct you to do this?

178
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,639
Master Huo,

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,519
without any evidence,

180
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,639
please speak cautiously.

181
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,039
Master Huo,
are you implying that I instructed this?

182
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,879
Enough!

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Zhuo Minghua,

184
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,200
what is your current status?

185
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,960
Did I permit you to interrupt?

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Master Huo,

187
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,279
even if she was strangled to death,

188
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,720
it wasn't me who killed her.

189
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,320
What does it have to do with me?

190
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,919
How is it irrelevant?

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,399
Summon the villager, Song Zhaodi.

192
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,199
Isn't she mad?

193
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,480
Can her testimony be trusted?

194
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,759
Zhaodi,

195
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,240
repeat what you told me a few days ago

196
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,960
to seek justice for your sister.

197
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
Song Zhaodi,

198
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
on the night Zhao Rulan died,

199
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,200
what did you see?

200
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,399
Zhaodi,

201
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
do not be afraid.

202
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,320
His Majesty is here.

203
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Do not be afraid.

204
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,000
They don't dare to hurt you.

205
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,079
How dare you bring a crazy woman here?

206
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,720
It is really an eyesore.

207
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,759
Your Majesty,

208
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,879
if there is no new evidence,

209
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,879
then let's adjourn the court.

210
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,600
Rulan.

211
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,799
She was an ordinary woman
who liked medical skills.

212
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
She was gentle.

213
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,919
She was by no means a fickle woman.

214
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,919
Her heart was very pure.

215
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,599
Some people have dirty hearts,

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
so they see everything as dirty.

217
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,639
I know,

218
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,439
even if she was raped,

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,919
she would not hang herself.

220
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,960
She had already died once.

221
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,679
Moreover,

222
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,159
she promised Guifen

223
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,638
to be together with her and the others

224
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,399
for the rest of their lives.

225
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,759
She wouldn't leave just like that.

226
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
She wouldn't bear to.

227
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Zhaodi,

228
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,000
look up.

229
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,799
Who am I?

230
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,720
Wu?

231
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
I know

232
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,360
you are doing this for Tudou,

233
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,960
our little village chief.

234
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,679
I also know

235
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,360
you don't dare to trust anyone.

236
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,799
But please trust me this once.

237
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,039
Even if I risk my life,

238
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,919
I will stand up
for all the ladies in Junlai Village.

239
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Luo Fuhai

240
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,080
is the murderer!

241
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
That night,

242
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,559
I was at home feeding the chickens.

243
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,120
Tudou ran over and brought the bad news.

244
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,559
It was him!

245
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,799
He killed Rulan!

246
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,960
Tudou said

247
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,279
he saw Rulan being strangled to death

248
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,519
then hung on the beam.

249
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,519
I immediately ran over,

250
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,320
and happened to see Luo Fuhai fleeing.

251
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,159
His jade pendant fell in the yard.

252
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,759
This is the jade pendant he dropped.

253
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,559
Your Majesty, please give Rulan justice!

254
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,399
Luo Fuhai,

255
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,518
witnesses saw you kill Zhao Rulan.

256
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,279
You left this jade pendant at the scene.

257
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,879
Still want to argue?

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Zhaodi,

259
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,159
go on.

260
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Later,

261
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,600
Guifen took us

262
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,679
to county office for justice.

263
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,639
Zhaodi,

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you better not go.

265
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,440
You'll take care of Tudou.

266
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,558
We will get justice for Rulan.

267
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,559
Yes.

268
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,399
This is very important.

269
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,279
Keep it safe.

270
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,519
Unless you're sure,

271
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,559
don't take it out.

272
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,480
Let's go.

273
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,638
- For justice!
- For justice!

274
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,439
- A life for a life!
- A life for a life!

275
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,319
- For justice!
- For justice!

276
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,119
- A life for a life!
- A life for a life!

277
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,519
But later I found out,

278
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,879
they were
sentenced to immediate execution!

279
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,879
I...

280
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,039
I was too scared.

281
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,679
I pretended to be driven mad.

282
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,278
I am guilty

283
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,200
for hiding the truth!
I accept the punishment!

284
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,480
But Your Majesty, for Junlai Village,

285
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,039
please bring justice!

286
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,279
Your Majesty,

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,759
according to the law,

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,038
please sentence Luo Fuhai

289
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,039
to immediate execution!

290
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,679
As for Magistrate Zhuo,

291
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,320
he must have been deceived.

292
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,559
Master Huo spoke out righteously.

293
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,599
I am truly grateful.

294
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
Master, what about me?

295
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,360
Please plead for me too!

296
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,919
The country has its laws.

297
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,600
What does your sentence
have to do with me?

298
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,480
You...

299
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,919
You...

300
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,279
Corrupt official!

301
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,158
When you took my bribe,

302
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,518
you didn't have this attitude!

303
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,519
Who took your bribe?

304
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,080
You did!

305
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,360
How dare you slander a court official!

306
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,679
Any evidence?

307
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,279
Well said.

308
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:45,879
Wretch!

309
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:46,559
Any evidence?

310
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,398
You should look at yourself in mirror!

311
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,959
Look at your greedy and lustful face.

312
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,879
Do I need to slander?

313
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,918
I will kill you!

314
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,919
Zhuo Minghua!

315
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,199
Faithless and ungrateful!

316
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,518
You coward, bah!

317
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,679
Without me, you'd have died long ago!

318
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
How did I rely on you?

319
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,559
You raped that woman.

320
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,399
I cleaned the mess!

321
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:03,799
Shut up!

322
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,519
Who did he rape?

323
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,799
The woman from Junlai Village,

324
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,919
Zhao Rulan!
