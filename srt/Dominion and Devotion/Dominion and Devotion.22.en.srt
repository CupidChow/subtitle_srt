00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:36,880
Your Majesty,

4
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,159
I've tried my best.

5
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,679
My deepest condolences.

6
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,079
Auntie,

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
for me,

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,959
you were stuck in the palace
your whole life.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,439
Be cautious

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
and fearful.

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,680
I never even had a chance
to do anything for you.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,760
Auntie,

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,439
I owe you more than I could repay

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,879
in this life or any other.

15
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,599
Auntie,

16
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,120
rest in peace.

17
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
Shenzhi,

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,599
can I ask you a question?

19
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,199
Go ahead.

20
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,960
Are you a former prince?

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,719
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

22
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,039
That's just insane.

23
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,960
Insane?

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Regardless of who I am,

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,879
it won't change my decision.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Pei Shenzhi,

27
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,360
as a former prince,
why are you helping me?

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,199
You know Zhuo Shangxian.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
He's got you by the short hairs!

30
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,800
Helping me is like suicide, isn't it?

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,919
If you'd told me,

32
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,599
we could've
figured something out together.

33
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,400
Now you've made it known all over town.
Trying to get yourself killed?

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
What's so funny?

35
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,719
My bad.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
I should've told you earlier.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,159
We could then discuss.

38
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,800
I will get you a way out,

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
help you disappear,

40
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,639
and vanish to the middle of nowhere.

41
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,840
Your Majesty, you know

42
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,199
it's too late.

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,519
If the people don't
get a proper explanation,

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,439
they'll think
you seized the throne unjustly.

45
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,840
Once the court is in chaos,

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,159
it'll be a bloodbath

47
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,319
and total disorder.

48
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,159
Besides,

49
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm a former prince,

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,840
and I've been playing dirty for years.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
My death is the only way

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,319
to put everyone's minds at ease.

53
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,159
Listen.

54
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm with you, no matter what.

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,080
I want you to live!

56
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,039
As you command,

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,824
(Death Prison)

59
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,720
Look, change your tune.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,360
Admit you were framing Master Pei.

61
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,000
I might spare your life.

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Your Majesty,

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
are you begging my mercy

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
for my son?

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
I'm asking you one more time.

66
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
Will you change your tune?

67
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,839
No.

68
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,319
And I can't.

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,198
As long as I stick to it,

70
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,079
you can't touch me.

71
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,879
Living in the imperial prison

72
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,920
is still living, isn't it?

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,560
I have ways to make your life
a living hell.

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
I've given you my word.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
But my patience

76
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
is wearing thin.

77
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,879
Think hard before you speak.

78
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,399
Guards.

79
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,599
Get him healed. Make sure he's alive.

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Yes.

81
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,959
I wouldn't lie to you, Master Pei.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,278
(Fifth Prince's register)
Lady Liu

83
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,759
delivered a prince.

84
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,519
I checked it myself. No doubt.

85
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,120
Your Majesty is newly crowned,

86
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,279
Master Zhuo...

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Zhuo Shangxian

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,119
(Fifth Prince's register)
checked Your Majesty's birth details

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
and medical records.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,319
He didn't say anything.

91
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,919
What did I do wrong,

92
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Master Pei?

93
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,519
Any more copies of this Register?

94
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,680
Nope.

95
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:46,720
This is the only one.

96
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,199
You've worked hard all your life.

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,399
Time to retire and go home.

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
That's what I've been hoping for.

99
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,920
Thank you, Master Pei.

100
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,278
(Y-You are)

101
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,680
(a prince of the previous dynasty.)

102
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,679
(Turns out)

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,758
(Madam Li has known everything.)

104
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,878
Only if you are,

105
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,879
will she

106
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
be able to

107
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,040
live.

108
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,879
(Madam Li gave me this longevity lock
of the previous dynasty)

109
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,800
(to protect Jinyi's real identity.)

110
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,920
(Zhuo Shangxian took me
from the previous dynasty's Empress.)

111
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,279
(Fifth Prince's birthday
is only three days after mine.)

112
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,079
(So,)

113
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,079
(on the day of the coup,)

114
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,920
(the previous Empress switched us!)

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
(I)

116
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,240
(am actually the current Fifth Prince.)

117
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,480
(Then, Jinyi's the last
remaining descendant)

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,439
(of the previous dynasty.)

119
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,399
So, you're here.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, I'm scared to die.

121
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,160
Surely I'll come.

122
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,199
You're scared too, huh?

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,680
You're curious

124
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,879
how I'll expose you

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,319
and take you down, right?

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Fine.

127
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,199
You tell me,

128
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,720
and I'll let you go.

129
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,879
Pei Shenzhi,

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,279
you think I'm just some total idiot

131
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,879
and you can walk all over?

132
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,000
Even if I've lost,

133
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,839
I'm definitely dragging you

134
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,720
straight to hell with me.

135
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
Alright then.

136
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,639
First bow,

137
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,920
to thank you
for saving my life back then.

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Second bow,

139
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,879
to thank you for raising me up.

140
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Third bow,

141
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
is me seeing you off.

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,678
I'm not claiming your body,

143
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,999
or building you a tomb.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Nobody will remember you.

145
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
No one will visit you.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This

147
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,840
will be your ending.

148
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,039
After all these words,

149
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,720
you think I'd be upset?

150
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,080
Just ridiculous.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,919
You've been dying to know

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,320
how I prove who you are, haven't you?

153
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,039
Come.

154
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,120
I'll tell you now.

155
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,879
It can't be proven.

156
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,919
Pei Shenzhi,

157
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,320
you really believe you're her kid?

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you saying?

159
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,799
You wonder?

160
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,440
You think I'd actually tell you?

161
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,399
The second I'm gone,

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,440
someone's going to seal your fate.

163
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,120
With this person's status,

164
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,000
if she came forward,

165
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,399
everyone would believe her

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
that you

167
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,120
are the prince of the former dynasty.

168
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,679
Why...

169
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,639
Why?

170
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,039
If so,

171
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,159
very good.

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Only the dead

173
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,360
won't talk.

174
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,360
So

175
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,399
annoying.

176
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Perfect timing.

177
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,360
Check it out for me.

178
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Where to put this piece?

179
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,639
You could have flipped things around.

180
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,919
But you were too attached to this piece.

181
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,559
Trying to protect it

182
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,360
ultimately cost you the game.

183
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,679
Honestly, that piece

184
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,000
has gotten me out
of some real jams before.

185
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,679
So I'm indeed somewhat attached to it.

186
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,600
But as the Empress,

187
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,879
you have to make hard choices
and cut your losses.

188
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,959
No matter who it is.

189
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,279
If I were such a person,

190
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
would Master Pei

191
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,840
even consider me for the throne?

192
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,200
I killed him.

193
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,039
You killed Zhuo Shangxian? Why?

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,639
Killing him

195
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,679
just makes the court think
you're silencing him.

196
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,519
It's a matter between us.

197
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,479
I won't explain.

198
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,120
Pei Shenzhi, what are you thinking?

199
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,559
What's done is done.

200
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,639
I'll just announce

201
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
that the criminal Zhuo Shangxian
offed himself in prison.

202
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,759
Let me go.

203
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

204
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,840
Don't be mad, okay?

205
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,720
I'm not mad.

206
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,879
What are you doing?

207
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,879
You're tired today.

208
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:47,919
How about

209
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
I serve you to rest?

210
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
No need.

211
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,080
Put me down!

212
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,600
