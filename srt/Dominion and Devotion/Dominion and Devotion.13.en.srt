00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,718
Wouldn't it be better
for us to depend on each other?

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,600
Auntie!

5
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,000
I would rather die than...

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,000
Sorry, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,079
You have called me Auntie for years.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,240
This slap

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,600
is not considered overstepping.

10
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,759
You are wise.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,640
You should know what to do.

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,799
You need to understand

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,679
what should be done

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,520
and what shouldn't.

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,518
Master Zhuo, I am willing to follow you.

16
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,879
Master Zhuo,

17
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,159
please treat me well.

18
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,959
Auntie.

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Shush.

20
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,519

(Being caught by Zhuo Shangxian)

27
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,960

the night is deep.

47
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,488

Master Pei,

51
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:07,808
you really have

52
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,088
heroic courage.

53
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:14,849
A precious sword for the hero.

54
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,969
Is it

55
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:24,488
the sword that's lacking?

56
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,009
Or,

57
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,768
is the person giving the sword

58
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:33,328
not to your liking?

59
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:45,169
Your Majesty,

60
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:46,849
you are drunk.

61
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,129
Am I hallucinating?

62
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,928
Are you worried about me?

63
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:58,088
No.

64
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:00,368
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,889
what exactly do you want to do?

66
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,408
Master Pei,

67
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:26,449
I don't understand.

68
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,528
I had escaped from the palace.

69
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,049
Why did you insist on bringing me back?

70
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:35,208
You said you would help me.

71
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:40,609
Then why did you abandon me
when I needed you the most?

72
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,728
I once said

73
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,288
if you're determined to oppose
the Imperial Advisor,

74
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:54,009
I would not be able to be on your side.

75
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:56,408
Now you have made a choice.

76
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,609
I can only let go of you.

77
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:00,728
As for the rest,

78
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:02,489
Your Majesty,

79
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:05,728
you misunderstood.

80
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:09,968
Master Pei,

81
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,728
one last question.

82
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:17,408
I want to know

83
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,929
if this is also a misunderstanding.

84
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:23,609
Master Pei,

85
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,168
did you ever have feelings for me?

86
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,288
Never.

87
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,768
I never fell for you.

88
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,929
I advise you

89
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,768
not be so conceited.

90
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,968
Understood.

91
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:51,648
Master Pei,

92
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,327
this is my last time

93
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:54,328
being honest with you.

94
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:57,088
For public reasons,

95
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,967
Master Zhuo controls the government

96
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,328
and harms the people's livelihood.

97
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,009
For personal reasons,

98
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:06,647
he took away my most important family

99
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,208
and forced me to comply.

100
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,408
Since you stand on his side,

101
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:17,648
then we

102
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,809
are enemies.

103
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,449
Master Pei,

104
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,408
do not regret.

105
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,448
The night is getting deeper.

106
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,327
You should leave, Master Pei.

107
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:50,889
So this won't cause
any further misunderstandings.

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,232
(One Month Later)

109
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:07,009
(Your Majesty,)

110
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,129
it has rained in the south
for over half a month.

111
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,407
Now, many refugees
are gathered outside the city.

112
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,168
Please, Your Majesty, issue a decree
to provide disaster relief.

113
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,488
The Southwest has recently
faced droughts.

114
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,009
I petition your decree

115
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,848
to help the disaster victims!

116
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,489
Heavy rain here,

117
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,328
and drought over there.

118
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,689
Master Zhuo,

119
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,168
what do you think we should do?

120
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,048
Your Majesty, you have grown up.

121
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,929
You should have your own opinions,

122
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,048
and learn to find solutions yourself.

123
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,528
I am but an Imperial Advisor.

124
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,648
What right do I have to answer
your question?

125
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,648
Of course, you have the right.

126
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,128
This...

127
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,369
This is so inappropriate.

128
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:17,328
Even heaven has felt my sincerity.

129
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:23,128
I, in recognition of Master Zhuo's
hard work and high achievements,

130
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,568
from today on,

131
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,688
will honorably see him
as Supreme Master.

132
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:30,009
All court affairs
will be managed by Master Zhuo.

133
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,088
Master Zhuo's orders

134
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,729
will be my orders.

135
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:35,849
Your Majesty,

136
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,928
you must not!

137
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,527
- Your Majesty, no!
- Your Majesty, no!

138
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,729
I specially bestow Zhuo Shangxian

139
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,728
a free pass.

140
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,849
You are spared penalties,

141
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,568
and the Zhuo family members, too.

142
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,288
For those committed crimes,

143
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,568
officials may not punish them further.

144
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,808
Please accept this, Master Zhuo.

145
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:53,792
(Free Pass)

146
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:00,729
Good.

147
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,889
Good.

148
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:09,249
Then, I thank you, Your Majesty.

149
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:12,687
You should also study diligently

150
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,969
to make progress in state affairs.

151
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:19,168
I will follow your teachings.

152
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:25,768
Huo Zheng,

153
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,168
last time, you defied my will,

154
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:31,209
and compared Master Zhuo
with the criminal, Zhuo Minghua.

155
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:34,088
You are hereby dismissed
from your position,

156
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,528
demoted to a commoner.

157
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:59,088
(For this game of mutual destruction,)

158
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,647
(Auntie has really thought of
a way to solve it.)

159
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,488
Now you and I are both pawns.

160
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,609
What should be the next step
to break the deadlock?

161
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,889
Your Majesty.

162
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,089
(Auntie,)

163
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,648
(I will definitely bring you home.)

164
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,288
Now,

165
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,609
let's start a new game.

166
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:51,849
(If this order can be issued,)

167
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:54,448
(perhaps it can help me.)

168
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,648
Huo Zheng.

169
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,648
Your Majesty,

170
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:17,768
you are awake!

171
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:21,608
You got me out of the palace.

172
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,288
But why did you knock me out?

173
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:36,249
You didn't put me

174
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,808
in the waste to take me out, did you?

175
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:43,288
I prepared incense to remove the smell.

176
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,048
Forget it.

177
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:50,089
Your Majesty,

178
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,369
time is limited.

179
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,688
We must return
before the last shift change.

180
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,009
They are outside.

181
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,009
Follow me.

182
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,009
Wait.

183
00:11:58,808 --> 00:11:59,808
Master Huo,

184
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,928
how many of them?

185
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:36,129
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

186
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:44,369
Before,

187
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:48,768
when I ordered Master Huo to gather you,

188
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,567
I never thought

189
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,729
I would receive such positive responses.

190
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:55,288
I even worried

191
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,168
that no one

192
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,088
would show up.

193
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,089
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,568
we are ashamed.

195
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,648
Before, we thought you were
Zhuo Shangxian's puppet.

196
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:06,527
But the case of Junlai Village,

197
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,969
not only made your benevolence
known to the world,

198
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:12,288
but also showed us your courage.

199
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:13,288
Your Majesty,

200
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,807
I thought you were a weakling

201
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:18,648
who had never fought a day in battle
nor left the capital,

202
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,889
and only spoke in scholarly terms.

203
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:22,048
Master Gu,

204
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:23,448
mind your words.

205
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,609
Do not be so vulgar.

206
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:27,048
That's just how I speak.

207
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:27,688
Your Majesty,

208
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,167
the other day in the court,

209
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,648
you risked your own life

210
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:31,928
and was so brave.

211
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:32,969
I am impressed.

212
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:35,609
Your Majesty,
the Great Ning is only decades old,

213
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:36,729
and is still unstable.

214
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:37,729
Now, with corruption,

215
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:38,889
people live in misery.

216
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,729
The people hope
you can change the situation,

217
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:42,889
eliminate the ills

218
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:44,808
and bring about a new beginning.

219
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:47,648
We

220
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:48,928
wish to assist you,

221
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,688
seeking eternal peace.

222
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,288
I, Wang Xiunong, wish to assist you.

223
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:00,009
I, Lu Zizhao, wish to assist you.

224
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:01,767
I, Gu Xingzhi.

225
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:05,568
- Wish to assist you.
- I, Hu Jingxi, wish to assist you.

226
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:09,168
- We wish to assist you, Your Majesty.
- We wish to assist you, Your Majesty.

227
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:15,168
I have understood your intentions.

228
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,288
With the assistance of you all,

229
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,889
we will be able to clean up the court

230
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:24,009
and restore peace to the world.

231
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:29,688
Your Majesty,

232
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,448
I have an important matter to report.

233
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:32,369
Recently,

234
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,528
for the Qinan plague,

235
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:35,448
Zhuo Shangxian ordered disaster relief,

236
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:38,209
but in fact,
he embezzled the relief funds.

237
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,609
After days of investigation,

238
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:42,209
I have obtained reliable leads.

239
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:44,009
He has hidden a large amount of money

240
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,927
in his secret treasury.

241
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,609
If we can raid the treasury,

242
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,208
the relief funds will be recovered,

243
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,729
and that'll weaken him largely.

244
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:53,687
Do you know where the treasury is?

245
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:55,168
I am still investigating.

246
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:57,328
Serving in the Yilin army for years,

247
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,009
I'm always suppressed by Pei.

248
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,647
If I can seize
the command of the Yilin army,

249
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,128
even if I rob this treasury,

250
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:05,129
Zhuo Shangxian won't be able
to do anything to me!

251
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,567
It seems like a mess,

252
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:11,129
but there is a trace to follow.

253
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,287
Primary task

254
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,849
is having Master Zhuo

255
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,969
personally take us to his treasury.

256
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:20,089
He...

257
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,808
