=Episode 9=

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Master Pei,

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,800
you won't stop me, will you?

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Of course not.

6
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:32,148
(Junlai Village)

7
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,540
(Junlai Village Mass Grave)

8
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,879
(Guifen, Rulan, and Zhaodi.)

9
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,280
(I swear I will seek justice for you.)

10
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,799
Who is there?

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,239
Tudou.

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,599
Zhaodi.

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,640
Zhaodi.

14
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,599
Don't hit me.

15
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,519
I know nothing.

16
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't hit me.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,599
Don't hit me.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,039
Pei...

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
Huo Zheng.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,959
Please help them settle down.

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
Do your best to keep them safe.

23
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,080
Understood.

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,840
What's on your mind?

25
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
I want to conduct an autopsy on Rulan.

26
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:32,435
(Censorate Morgue)

27
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,319
This is an urgent matter.

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,599
Master Huo.

29
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,159
I appoint you

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
to temporarily serve as the Censor

31
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,080
over this matter.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,279
Since Master Pei
insists on looking into this case,

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,478
please kindly

34
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,039
assist Huo Zheng

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,598
in arresting Magistrate Zhuo Minghua

36
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,479
and the merchant Luo Fuhai.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,680
Okay?

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,319
No...

39
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:58,879
I

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,879
will obey.

41
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,800
His Majesty,

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
he harbors evil.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,599
We can't put him on this case.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,959
Please withdraw the edict.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Master Huo.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,159
This case involves Magistrate Zhuo.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,959
Jinghua Prefecture is a vital area
for revenue and provisions.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,000
And Zhuo Minghua
has an intricate local social network.

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,799
Master Pei will be of great help to us.

50
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Besides,

51
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,879
I believe that Master Pei

52
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,639
will not disappoint me.

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,519
Wise judgment, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,479
The news has spread.

55
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,479
We must speed up.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,319
Master Huo,

57
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,319
after you.

58
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,319
Why are you sitting in the rain?

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Don't catch a cold.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,639
What are you thinking?

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm contemplating.

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,400
Zhuo Minghua killed
36 ladies from Junlai Village.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
He was devoid of humanity.

64
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,198
If I can't put him to death,

65
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,159
I will never be at peace in my life.

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,439
But

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,199
if I punish him according to the law,

68
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,279
it will surely anger Master Zhuo

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,080
and even get me killed.

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,438
But if I don't stand up for them,

71
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,240
then who in the world

72
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,600
will be able to soothe their grievances?

I once wanted to live for myself.

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,160
So I ran away once.

78
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,079
But I've been restless

79
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,639

that since I have ascended the throne,

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,559
I want the people

00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,439

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,040
that someone in the imperial court

wants to uphold justice for them

(fools in this world.)

How dare you arrest me?

101
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,560
Do you know who I work for?

102
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh.

103
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,879
Enlighten me.

104
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,199
Who do you work for?

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,079
(Luo Fuhai, Wealthy merchant)
I want to see

106
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,680
Magistrate Zhuo Minghua
of Jinghua Prefecture.

107
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,519
If he knew you had arrested me,

108
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,839
you would all be dead!

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,959
In that case,

110
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,959
Master Huo,

111
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,000
let's visit Master Zhuo.

112
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,719
Let me out.

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Let me out!

114
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,959
Let me out!

115
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,839
I wondered who was bold enough
to get me here.

116
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,279
It turns out to be my dear nephew.

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,319
(Zhuo Minghua, Jinghua Magistrate)
I haven't seen you since my return.

118
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,560
What now?

119
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,480
Is this how you treat guests?

120
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,800
Uncle Zhuo,

121
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I hope you've been well.

122
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,800
Do you still see me as your uncle?

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,279
You'd better release me

124
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,240
before I get mad.

125
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,879
Otherwise...

126
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,800
The case of Junlai Village
affects a lot.

127
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Uncle Zhuo,

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,519
I hope you can work with us.

129
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
What do you mean?

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,199
You want to interrogate me?

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,519
Pei Shenzhi,

132
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,839
who gave you the authority?

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
The Law of the Great Ning, of course.

134
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,439
Even if you're royalty or nobility,

135
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,879
you can't defy it.

136
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,120
And who are you?

137
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
I am Huo Zheng,

138
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,399
the Censor appointed by His Majesty,

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,279
in charge of the trial
of the Junlai Village case.

140
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,479
Who doesn't know

141
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,279
the true master of this empire?

142
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,120
He is just
a wet-behind-the-ears little boy.

143
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,720
How dare he arrest me?

144
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,040
Uncle Zhuo,

145
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,279
here's a word of advice.

146
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,719
Right now, your life is in his hands.

147
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,879
Pei Shenzhi,

148
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,879
do you know what you are saying?

149
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,079
Master Huo,

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,600
I have brought you the suspect.

151
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,720
The rest is up to you.

152
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,399
Pei Shenzhi!

153
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,599
Listen to me.

154
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,120
No one can put me on trial.

155
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,680
I might as well tell you the truth now.

156
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,720
If you put me on trial,

157
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,720
I will drag the entire Zhuo family down

158
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,319
into the bottomless abyss with me.

159
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:18,528
(Zhuo's Mansion)

160
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
Understood.

161
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,519
I heard you were busy solving cases.

162
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,759
Yet you still make time to visit me.

163
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,759
I really appreciate it.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
I've heard all about it.

165
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,440
Trouble started with unruly women
storming the yamun.

166
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,000
Minghua

167
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,679
does have a temper.

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,918
He should have restrained himself

169
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,159
as Magistrate.

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,399
He needs to be taught a lesson.

171
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,119
But he has done quite a lot

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,399
along our way up.

173
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,639
He's worked hard
even if he didn't accomplish much.

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,759
Do whatever you want.

175
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,279
I have no objections.

176
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,519
Even if it's immediate execution,

177
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,759
you have no objections, either?

178
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,639
If you really think he deserves to die,

179
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,159
feel free to execute him.

180
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,479
But after all, he is my only cousin.

181
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
If he dies,

182
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,839
naturally,

183
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,639
I won't spare the person who kills him.

184
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Understood.

185
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,759
Whoever wants him dead

186
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,279
has to perish, for sure.

187
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,918
Besides, I don't think

188
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,240
there is anyone
so imprudent in this world.

189
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,599
Not necessarily.

190
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,559
For example, our young emperor.

191
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
For example,

192
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,879
you.

193
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,519
Foster father,

194
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,840
what do you mean?

195
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,319
You are a clever boy.

196
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,039
You can easily figure out
how things work.

197
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,999
After all, you're still in charge
of the Yilin Army.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,279
Besides, you've been quite close
to our young emperor.

199
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
Am I wrong?

200
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,839
But don't forget

201
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,279
the secret of your birth.

202
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,599
Only I truly care for you.

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Do you understand?

204
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,200
Rest assured.

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I know what I should do.

206
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,279
Your Majesty,

207
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,559
what are you reading?

208
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,879
The case files.

209
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,240
It seems Master Huo
has made some discoveries.

210
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,000
Master Pei,

211
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,158
I have a question for you.

212
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,599
Ask away.

213
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,320
I will

214
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,240
definitely tell the truth.

215
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
Master Pei.

216
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,039
Did you kill Master He?

217
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,960
If I say yes,

218
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
will you

219
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,919
immediately convict me?

220
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,879
It was really you?

221
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,879
Why?

222
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,879
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,079
Of course, it is because he confronted

224
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,840
my father and me in front of everyone.

225
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,279
Master Pei,

226
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,639
I don't think I know you anymore.

227
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,879
I thought you...

228
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,879
You thought what?

229
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
Do you know?

230
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,720
I once thought

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,918
that if one day

232
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,759
I could truly rule the empire,

233
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,559
I would tell everyone

234
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,319
that Pei Shenzhi

235
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,440
is a good official worth trusting.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Your Majesty,

237
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,679
you should never have

238
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,440
any hopes about me.

239
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,399
(Pei Shenzhi,)

240
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,159
(why have you changed so much?)

241
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,758
I have come today

242
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,240
to tell you

243
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,720
that I won't stand by your side

244
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,440
in this case of Junlai Village.

245
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,999
You are smart.

246
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,278
Know your place

247
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,398
before you overstep.

248
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,479
If you cross Master Zhuo,

249
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
will you be able to

250
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,039
calm his wrath
with your life and Madam Li's?

251
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,519
To contend with heaven,

252
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,679
are you

253
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,279
prepared for it?

254
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,000
(Pei Shenzhi,)

255
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,720
(you've been so resolute.)

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,720
(Why are you
showing signs of retreat today?)

257
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,519
(Are you afraid of Master Zhuo's power?)

258
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
(Or)

259
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
(do you have another plan?)

260
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,759
(After all, you're still in charge
of the Yilin Army.)

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,599
(Besides, you've been quite close
to our young emperor.)

262
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,080
(Am I wrong?)

263
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,319
But don't forget

264
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,439
the secret of your birth.

265
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,279
Only I truly care for you.

266
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you understand?

267
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,719
(Master Zhuo has detected our alliance.)

268
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,399
(You're just gaining momentum.)

269
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,720
(If something happens to me,)

270
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,600
(I fear you will perish
before you achieve anything.)

271
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
(At this point,
I must stay away from you)

272
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,399
(to secure an opportunity)

273
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,759
