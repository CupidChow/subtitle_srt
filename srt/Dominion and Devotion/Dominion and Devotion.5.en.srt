00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,928
=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,119
I wonder if all the money
is enough to pay the fine.

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,920
Even if we gather enough this time,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
what about next time?

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,840
They forbid private sale of cloth now.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,519
Next time,

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,439
we won't even get to keep Tudou's field.

9
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,719
When will these days come to an end?

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
It's okay.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
At worst, we can all
rent fields to farm.

12
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,358
It'll be a bit harder.

13
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,079
But we still have to get by.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,760
Am I right?

15
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,879
I used

16
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,079
to live in constant fear

17
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,920
for a slim chance of survival.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
I thought

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,200
even if making a living

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
is tough outside the palace,

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,000
at least there'd be fewer schemes

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,519
and no worry about survival.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,719
But now,

24
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,238
as I stand outside the palace,

25
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,319
I realize

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
that the country
is ruined by traitors and pests,

27
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,799
and people's livelihood

28
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,400
has withered to this extent.

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,480
The women of Junlai Village

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,799
struggle to survive against all odds,

31
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,760
for they cannot own land as women.

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
And I

33
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,240
can do nothing?

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Are you

35
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,599
thinking of going back to that place?

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,639
I can't go back.

37
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,758
Pack up.

38
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,759
We'll set off now.

39
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,439
Yulu Buns are tasty.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
(Junlai Village)
Chewy and bouncy,

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,240
they're divine.

42
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,319
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Have you had enough fun?

44
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,719
Time to return.

45
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
Your Majesty is actually a woman.

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
What a grand lie!

47
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,439
Master Pei,

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,758
it's all my fault.

49
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,039
Her Majesty did nothing wrong.

50
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,639
Who do you think you are

51
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,039
to conceal such a big matter

52
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,479
and keep it hidden?

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,159
Back then,

54
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,240
Prince Ning's concubine went mad.

55
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,719
She gave birth

56
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,280
to a girl.

57
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,199
But for some reason,

58
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,360
she insisted that
she had given birth to a prince.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,439
I had no choice back then.

60
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,559
At that time,
it was the former emperor's ascension,

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,520
and the princes were about
to be conferred.

62
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,439
If at that time we told people
she was not a prince,

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
I fear

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,960
she wouldn't survive at all.

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Master Pei,

66
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,839
Her Majesty has been burdened
by his birth mother

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
and trapped in the palace
for many years.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now,

69
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,638
she finally managed to leave there.

70
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,720
Please, Master Pei, have mercy on her.

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,198
I am willing to take Her Majesty's place

72
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,240
and follow you back
to the palace to face death.

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Then you might as well

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
die now.

75
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,439
Your Majesty,

76
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,480
no!

77
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,759
Let go.

78
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,040
Master Pei,

79
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,519
I beg you.

80
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,480
I beg you to spare her.

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,838
Master Pei!

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,319
It is all my fault.

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,560
It was me who told the lies.

84
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,319
Master Pei,

85
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,519
I beg you to spare Her Majesty.

86
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,360
I beg you!

87
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:09,519
As a dignified monarch,

88
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,199
you kneeled to beg me.

89
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,600
I thought you were capable.

90
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,680
That day in the imperial study,
you were indignant.

91
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,120
But you simply escaped from the palace.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,639
I thought highly of you.

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
You're cowardly.

94
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Your Majesty!

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,839
Your Majesty!

96
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,839
Master Pei,

97
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
as you have known,

98
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,000
I am a woman.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,198
I was walking on thin ice in the palace.

100
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,318
Protecting myself was hard.

101
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,480
Let alone caring for others.

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,919
You're a woman, so what?

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,360
Is this your excuse?

104
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,639
So it turns out

105
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,399
you are as selfish

106
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,079
as those people.

107
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,399
You

108
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
really disappoint me.

109
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,680
Wu!

110
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,240
Wu!

111
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,680
Wu!

112
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,519
Thank you both.

113
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,958
We appreciate your kindness.

114
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,639
But we cannot accept the money.

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
I made these.

116
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,800
They're durable

117
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,720
and very soft and won't hurt your feet.

118
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,079
If you don't mind,

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,839
take them with you.

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,679
Thank you.

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
I like them very much.

122
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,879
Then we will go back now.

123
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
When you have time,

124
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,279
come visit us again.

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Let's go.

126
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,079
See you.

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Let's go.

128
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,240
Since it has come to this,

129
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,879
I don't want you, a puppet.

130
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,079
If you return to the palace to die,

131
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,079
I will release Madam Li.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Thank you.

133
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,800
Your Majesty, don't!

134
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,000
Before returning,

135
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
can you let me finish one more thing?

136
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,680
Don't think about running away.

137
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,480
I absolutely won't.

138
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Who is beating the Drum of Justice?

139
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
It's me.

140
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,438
Where did this brat come from?

141
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,240
I don't know.

142
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,680
He is so presumptuous.

143
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,279
Exactly.

144
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,800
Do you have a scholarly rank
from imperial exams?

145
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,399
No.

146
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,519
How audacious!

147
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,159
If you have no scholarly rank,

148
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,360
why didn't you kneel to me?

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,639
Guards!

150
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,680
Make him kneel.

151
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Ten strokes with the cane

152
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,879
for contempt.

153
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,240
Yes!

154
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
You're so eager to punish me.

155
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,959
Do not regret it later.

156
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,480
(What's the background of this brat?)

157
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,240
(He speaks so arrogantly.)

158
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,759
Then tell me.

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,199
Why did you beat the drum?

160
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,839
I want to accuse Local Gentry Hu Quan

161
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,479
of running amok

162
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
and bullying women.

163
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,399
Do you know who Hu Quan is?

164
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,759
How dare you accuse him?

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,319
I haven't finished yet.

166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
What's with the rush?

167
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,679
Qinnan County's new policy forbids

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,560
private cloth sales
without market tickets.

169
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,479
Did you issue that policy?

170
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,119
Finally, someone is here
for that policy.

171
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,399
I wonder about his background.

172
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,079
That policy has cut off our livelihoods.

173
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Silence!

174
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,399
Without rules,
nothing can be accomplished.

175
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,159
Clear policies are needed
to better control the cloth market.

176
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Therefore,

177
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,999
I also want to accuse

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,440
the magistrate of Qinnan County,

179
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,080
Cao Shouren.

180
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,360
Who did you say you want to accuse?

181
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,679
It's you,

182
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,960
Master Cao.

183
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,000
Article 274 of the Laws of Great Ning

184
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,399
forbids local officials to make laws
and regulations in private.

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,959
You privately issued new policies

186
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,440
and colluded with Hu Quan
to monopolize the cloth market.

187
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,200
Can you hear people's grievances

188
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
outside the court?

189
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,600
Moreover,

190
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,240
the rent for farmland
is stipulated by the imperial court.

191
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,559
Yet you allow Hu Quan
to arbitrarily increase rents,

192
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,080
overburdening the tenant farmers
in Junlai Village.

193
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,799
What I want to accuse

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
is precisely the two of you.

195
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,759
Mr. Advisor,

196
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,919
please record it clearly.

197
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,720
According to article 84
of the Laws of Great Ning,

198
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,319
if someone doesn't
record cases truthfully in court,

199
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,359
they commit the crime
of falsifying documents

200
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,000
and will be exiled for ten years.

201
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Master Cao,

202
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,799
do you admit guilt?

203
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
How audacious!

204
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,119
What crime could a magistrate
like me admit to?

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,519
If we follow your words,

206
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,119
according to article 106
of the Laws of Great Ning,

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,080
civilians who hit the Drum of Justice

208
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,200
will be punished with 30 strokes first.

209
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,679
Okay.

210
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,039
Then go ahead and beat me.

211
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
Young Master,

212
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,679
why don't you

213
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,679
be honest with me?

214
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,918
Tell me.

215
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,758
Who is the noble you work for?

216
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,399
We might be on the same side.

217
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Mr. Advisor,

218
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,519
the county magistrate just said,

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,679
"Young Master,"

220
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,559
"why don't you be honest with me?"

221
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,120
"Tell me. Who is the noble you work for?"

222
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,240
"We might be on the same side."

223
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,960
What are you waiting for?

224
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,399
Write those down.

225
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,999
Since you are so determined to die,

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
don't blame me for being cruel.

227
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Beat him!

228
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Yes.

229
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,639
How audacious!

230
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,799
Do you have a death wish

231
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,919
to lay a hand on him?

232
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,600
Greetings, Seal-Holding Eunuch
of the Inner Court.

233
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,879
You're Seal-Holding Eunuch.

234
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,840
Then

235
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,039
who is he?

236
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,558
I, Pei Shenzhi, failed

237
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,599
to protect Your Majesty.

238
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,679
Please punish me.

239
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,960
Your...

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,679
Your Majesty?

241
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,120
Your Majesty!

242
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,199
I deserve a hundred deaths

243
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
and cannot be pardoned.

244
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,360
Now you admit to your crime?

245
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,559
But it's too late.

246
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,839
You colluded with Hu Quan

247
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,039
to bully women and children.

248
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,638
Return every single cent of the money

249
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,799
you took from Junlai Village.

250
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,398
You're a corrupt official

251
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,399
(Court Record)
who embezzles.

252
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,798
Your duty is removed immediately.

253
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,638
You'll be deprived of family property

254
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,759
and exiled to the far south.

255
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,039
Your Majesty,

256
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,879
I have noted everything down.

257
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Lastly,

258
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,639
by imperial decree,

259
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,279
you and relevant persons
will be punished with 30 strokes each

260
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,559
right

261
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,279
at the entrance of Junlai Village.

262
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,558
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

263
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,399
-Your Majesty is wise.
-Your Majesty is wise.

264
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,559
Start!

265
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,360
They deserve it.

266
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
Bathed with imperial grace,

267
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,039
Junlai Village's people
are all overwhelmed.

268
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,399
Is Your Majesty satisfied?

269
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,799
They don't know it's me, do they?

270
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,799
Do you want them to know

271
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
or not?

272
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
No.

273
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,039
Why?

274
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,480
They treat me sincerely.

275
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,279
But I've kept secrets.

276
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,759
I feel a bit ashamed.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,639
Don't worry.

278
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
It's so disgraceful.

279
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
I've kept it a secret.

280
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,240
Master Pei,

281
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,080
your words are really harsh.

282
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,919
Pleasant words

283
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
are often traps.

284
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
I still want to thank you.

285
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,399
It can be considered as having done

286
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,519
one comforting thing

287
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,600
before taking off my imperial robe.

288
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,720
It's the imperial power.

289
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,679
The throne you escape from

290
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
can both kill people

291
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
and save people.

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Now

293
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,240
do you want to return

294
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,919
and continue to be an emperor?

295
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,279
Master Pei,

296
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,639
will you spare my life?

297
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,879
I have changed my mind.

298
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,440
I can keep your secret of being a woman.

299
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,879
Moreover,

300
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,918
a female emperor

301
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,279
is unprecedented.

302
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,200
