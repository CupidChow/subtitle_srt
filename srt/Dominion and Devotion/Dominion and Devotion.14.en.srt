00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,559
(How to)

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,320
(uncover Zhuo Shangxian's vault?)

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,719
Master Pei?

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,119
Master Huo, for what purpose
did you take His Majesty

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,399
out of the palace late at night?

8
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,520
Hearing the capital's night market
was bustling,

9
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,200
His Majesty wanted to visit it.

10
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,039
But he didn't want to trouble you.

11
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,799
So he ordered me
to take him out of the palace secretly.

12
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,999
Please forgive me, Master Pei.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Master Huo,

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,719
did you

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,679
take His Majesty to see someone
he shouldn't have

16
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,280
to deal with me and my foster father?

17
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,599
Master Huo, don't be nervous.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Firstly,

19
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,719
it's my duty

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,439
to care about His Majesty's safety.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,639
Secondly, I also don't want

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,400
His Majesty to get hurt again
due to confronting Master Zhuo.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,078
Since you care so much
about His Majesty,

24
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,639
why don't you stand up

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,359
for him during court sessions?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
Master Huo,

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,959
to serve His Majesty,

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,159
one must act cautiously

29
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,079
and leave no loose ends.

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,039
I trust you will handle it properly

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,760
and not arouse suspicion
from Master Zhuo.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
(He acts)

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,799
(so unpredictably.)

34
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,119
The second watch of the Hai hour!

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,479
Close your doors and windows

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,760
to prevent theft and robbery.

37
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,358
Is this the legendary

38
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,040
Yama Carrying the Lantern?

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Run!

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,598
regarding the strange fire
at night recently,

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,638
I investigated

43
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,439
but found nothing.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,319
Such fire burns without a source,

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
which is bizarre.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Your Majesty,

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,718
it's allegedly

48
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,839
Yama Carrying the Lantern.

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,080
Not long ago,
there was a plague in Qinan.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,159
And now such an anomaly appears.

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,439
I fear it is an ominous sign.

52
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,439
Your Majesty,

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,439
there is speculation among the officials
and the civilians about this matter.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,039
I wonder whether to say it or not.

55
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,280
Speak freely.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,359
It is said that Master Zhuo
was ineffective in disaster relief

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,479
and embezzled the relief funds,

58
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,319
infuriating the late emperor.

59
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,918
Then the Yama Carrying the Lantern

60
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,879
intended to bring Master Zhuo down
to account.

61
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,199
It's just the nonsense
of the despicable.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Master Zheng,

63
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,359
as an appointed official of the court,

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,399
you do not use your talent in court
to relieve His Majesty's worries,

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,279
but instead confuse His Majesty
with rumors.

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,359
Do you take His Majesty
as a three-year-old child

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,800
who is curious about your strange tales?

68
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,599
Moreover,

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,478
the strange fire appeared on the street.

70
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,159
What does it have to do with me?

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,599
Isn't it obvious?

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,399
The rootless fire

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
burns you,

74
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,599
a rootless eunuch!

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,840
Before my father passed away,

76
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,839
he appointed Eunuch Zhuo
as Imperial Advisor

77
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,719
with the heavy duty
of overseeing the state.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
Ever since my father passed away,

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,039
you have slandered Master Zhuo
with rumors.

80
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,359
Do you think
that because my father is gone,

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
his authority is too,

82
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,000
and you can bully a veteran official?

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,520
Or do you think

84
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,520
you don't need to take me seriously?

85
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,199
Master Zhuo has worked hard
for the country all his life.

86
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,079
If he is ridiculed
just because he is a eunuch,

87
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,279
then it is my negligence.

88
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,399
In my opinion,

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,758
we need
to build a shrine of loyalty and valor

90
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,279
and sculpt a gold statue for him,

91
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,479
so that all under heaven

92
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,319
and future people

93
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,720
can remember his honorable name.

94
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,839
Your Majesty,

95
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,199
I am just a humble eunuch.

96
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,239
Such a large expenditure of resources

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,279
may not be appropriate.

98
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,160
Moreover,

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,920
all the officials in the court

100
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,360
have a lot of criticism towards me.

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,720
Building a shrine

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
and sculpting a gold statue

103
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,920
can pray for blessings for both you

104
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,398
and the displaced people
across the land.

105
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,839
It will be a great merit.

106
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,920
Those who oppose

107
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,839
must have ulterior motives
against Great Ning.

108
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,680
My mind is made up.

109
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,919
Order the Finance Bureau to gather funds

110
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,319
to build a shrine and a gold statue

111
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,879
for Master Zhuo.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Let Astronomical Bureau

113
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,639
select an auspicious day

114
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,279
for me to personally kneel and pray
in the Fasting Palace for three days,

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,399
praying for Master Zhuo
and all my people.

116
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,240
Your Majesty is wise.

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
Master Zhuo, I believe under your grace,

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,838
the plague will soon dissipate

119
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,519
and the displaced people
can return home.

120
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,599
The funds for building the shrine

121
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,639
will be sent to my mansion
in a few days.

122
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,999
You know what to do.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,719
Still three-tenths
to the Ministry of Works

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
and seven-tenths
to your private treasury.

125
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,639
The young emperor seems

126
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,560
to know better now.

127
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,399
Master Pei, you are here.

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,079
What is the matter?

129
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,878
Your Majesty,

130
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,799
by your order, the Astronomical Bureau

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
has picked the right day for praying

132
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,759
for Master Zhuo.

133
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,279
It will be in seven days.

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Good.

135
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,079
(Silence)
Glad to know.

136
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,680
Is there anything else?

137
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,279
I'm afraid your flattery

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,920
toward Master Zhuo

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
is a futile attempt.

140
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,399
Master Zhuo won't truly trust you.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,319
Flattery?

142
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
(Memorial)
Master Pei, I can't follow you.

143
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,519
On the court, Master Zheng and Master Gu

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,160
played tough

145
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,959
just to help you

146
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,480
win Master Zhuo's favor.

147
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,439
I was afraid that Master Zhuo
might vent his anger on them.

148
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Furthermore,

149
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,160
it all began with the strange fire.

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,040
Was Yama Carrying the Lantern

151
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,160
also acting along with me?

152
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,000
Yama Carrying the Lantern

153
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,800
is just phosphorescence.

154
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,600
What is phosphorescence?

155
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,720
I just want to remind you

156
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,319
that Master Zhuo was severely battered
by Zhuo Minghua's death.

157
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,879
If you build a shrine for him now,

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,439
he will use it to get funding

159
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,959
to make a comeback.

160
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,439
Isn't this giving him power,

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,120
allowing him to rise again?

162
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,439
I am increasingly unable

163
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,399
to guess what you are thinking.

164
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,160
You are getting better at plotting.

165
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,879
Do you know

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,839
the process of praying for blessings?

167
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
A three-day fast.

168
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
I'll survive it.

169
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,480
Your Majesty...

170
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,000
Master Pei,

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,439
are you worried about me?

172
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,439
You pleased Eunuch Zhuo,

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
and now you're showing goodwill to me.

174
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,560
With your ability
to gain favor from both sides,

175
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,240
you are truly a model
in the officialdom.

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,240
As you insist,

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I shall take my leave.

178
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,159
All of you, hurry up.

179
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,839
Master Zhuo,

180
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,839
Prefectural Magistrate of Lingnan,

181
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,079
Military Governor of Mobei,

182
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,279
and Manor of Defender-General

183
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
sent the gold and silver
for your gold statue.

184
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,599
To the private treasury.

185
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,679
Yes.

186
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,758
Everyone, come over.

187
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,759
Quickly.

188
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,839
Send all these to the private treasury.

189
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,399
Move quickly.

190
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,367
(Zhuo's Mansion)

191
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,679
Master Zhuo,

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,519
bad news!

193
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,519
Something big happened!

194
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,798
What's with the fuss?

195
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,320
Explain it clearly.

196
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,479
Crabapple Grove's private treasury
was attacked.

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,559
What?

198
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
What about my things?

199
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,278
Those bandits were rampant!

200
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,279
They used explosives.

201
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,919
Luckily, we had many guards there.

202
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,080
They repelled the bandits.

203
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
The fortune is safe.

204
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,960
Bandits?

205
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,840
Yes.

206
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,759
We captured a live one.

207
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,759
He said

208
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,999
someone spread the word

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,519
that Crabapple Grove hides fortune
of the previous dynasty.

210
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,878
They doubted at first.

211
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,440
But seeing the treasury always guarded,

212
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,678
they believed it

213
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,240
and decided to rob the treasury.

214
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,558
Crabapple Grove is sparsely populated

215
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,278
and full of snakes and insects.

216
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,799
Ordinary people dare not venture there.

217
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,639
Why would there be such a rumor?

218
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,080
I don't know.

219
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,679
Then look now.

220
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Get out.

221
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,639
Father, please calm down.

222
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,440
Shenzhi, you're here.

223
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
Why didn't you have someone inform me?

224
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
How come I didn't know

225
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,799
you have a private treasury?

226
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,039
I heard about
the Crabapple Grove matter.

227
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,519
It's been spreading wildly recently.

228
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,278
Three forces all want to stir up chaos.

229
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,839
Also, that bunch of bandits
is fleeing everywhere.

230
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,518
Can you guess

231
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,679
what they will say?

232
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,279
They will say

233
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,799
it has been confirmed

234
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,878
Crabapple Grove

235
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,159
indeed has treasures.

236
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,240
Who is behind all this?

237
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,519
Are you suspecting me?

238
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,279
Why would I suspect you?

239
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,758
The private treasury
has always been secret.

240
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,479
And I spent heavily

241
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,879
on the private soldiers.

242
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,039
I didn't expect the bandits
to target it.

243
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,919
I am thinking

244
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,279
if it were a national treasury,

245
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,599
no matter how bold these bandits are,

246
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
they would dare to strike.

247
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,639
So you mean...

248
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,120
The treasury is no longer safe.

249
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,839
I'll secretly move the fortune

250
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,119
and have Huting Army escort it.

251
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,759
By then, an empty treasury will be left.

252
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,200
Whoever dares to attack

253
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,720
will be caught like an easy prey.

254
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,079
Privately mobilizing the Huting Army
is a serious crime.

255
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,399
Not...

256
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,039
The Huting Army is surnamed Zhuo too.

257
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
Shenzhi,

258
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,119
why is it that as you grow older,

259
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,519
your courage diminishes?

260
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,120
Master Pei has arrived.

261
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,120
Good afternoon, Master Pei.

262
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,799
The attack on Master Zhuo's
private treasury

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,279
is related to Your Majesty,

264
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
right?

265
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,919
Master Pei, why do you speak
so incoherently?

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,399
What private treasury?

267
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,559
Master Zhuo puts a lot
in his private treasury.

268
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,999
You're plotting behind his back.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,679
If Master Zhuo discovers it,

270
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,919
he will definitely kill you.

271
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,080
Master Pei,

272
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,200
please show some respect.
