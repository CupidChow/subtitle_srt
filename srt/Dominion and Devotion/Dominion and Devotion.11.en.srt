00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,928
=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,558
Faithless and ungrateful!

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,878
You coward, bah!

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,039
Without me, you'd have died long ago!

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,079
How did I rely on you?

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:22,920
You raped that woman.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,760
I cleaned the mess.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,160
Shut up!

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,879
Who did he rape?

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,160
The woman from Junlai Village,

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Zhao Rulan!

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,519
So Master Zhuo wasn't deceived.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,038
Truth has been revealed.

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,320
How foolish.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,039
You did it on purpose.

17
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,640
You tricked me!

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,240
Yes.

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,759
So what?

20
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,439
Didn't you admit it personally?

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,359
Your Majesty,

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,960
the facts are already clear.

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,200
Master Zhuo was not deceived.

24
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,840
He knew Luo Fuhai raped Zhao Rulan,

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,079
accepted bribes and fabricated evidence,

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,200
causing Junlai Village people
to storm the yamun in anger.

27
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:08,439
Then he used this as a reason
to impose severe

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
and malicious penalties.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
He killed 36 lives without hesitation!

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,040
That was utterly audacious.

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,640
Your Majesty,

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I request to remove

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,640
Zhuo Minghua from his position,

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,519
and execute him by dismemberment!

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
How dare you!

36
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,959
What would I not dare?

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,280
Move without permission,

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,759
I will kill you.

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Let me go!

40
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,000
You ungrateful thing.

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,640
My family fed you!
How dare you treat me like this?

42
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,040
Cousin,

43
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,319
save me!

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
It is well known

45
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,000
Zhuo Minghua
is the Master Zhuo's cousin.

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,318
But surely,

47
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,199
about Zhuo Minghua's serious crime,

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,480
Master Zhuo was unaware.

49
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,039
Master Zhuo is altruistic,

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,719
and unselfish.

51
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,840
I wish to take the Master Zhuo's advice.

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,520
Master Zhuo,
what do you think about this case?

53
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,479
Your Majesty, do what's right for you.

54
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,039
I have no objection.

55
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,759
I declare the verdict.

56
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,639
Luo Fuhai,

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
beheading.

58
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,599
Zhuo Minghua,

59
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,520
death by dismemberment!

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,639
On what ground can you sentence me?

61
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,000
And Zhuo Shangxian, you old guy!

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,360
How dare you not help me?

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
I did so much for the Zhuo family!

64
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,759
Zhuo Shangxian,

65
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,719
let me tell you this.

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,840
I still got your secrets...

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,000
I said,

68
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,319
move without permission,

69
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,560
you will be killed without mercy.

70
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,960
Your Majesty,

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Master Zhuo,

72
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,239
Zhuo Minghua defied his superior,

73
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
and intended rebellion.

74
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
I have executed him.

75
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,439
The case of Junlai Village

76
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,360
is closed.

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,120
Guards,

78
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,319
drag Zhuo Minghua out.

79
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,439
Junlai Village,

80
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,240
also known as Widow Village.

81
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,919
This case

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,879
almost led to the destruction
of the entire village.

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,839
They lived difficult lives
and were heavily oppressed.

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,680
But they tried so hard to live better.

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
Even when pushed
into such a desperate situation,

86
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,959
they never thought of leaving this place

87
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,439
called Widow Village.

88
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,080
Why?

89
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Because the world is vast,

90
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,759
but there was no place for them.

91
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,479
Because no matter where they go,

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,039
they couldn't have their own land.

93
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,560
Because they

94
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,039
simply had no choice.

95
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,960
I

96
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,199
do not want such things to happen again.

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I

98
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,840
want to give those
who endure similar hardships a choice.

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I

100
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,040
will issue a new policy.

101
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,399
From today onward,

102
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
we will establish women's households.

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
Women can be the head of the household.

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,319
They can own land under their name.

105
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,839
No different from men!

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Your Majesty,

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
please listen to me.

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,759
A woman obeys her father at home,

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,518
her husband when married,

110
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,879
and her son when her husband dies.

111
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,559
This has been an unchangeable rule
since ancient times.

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,319
A woman being the head of the household

113
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
is truly absurd.

114
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,439
In this world,

115
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
the vast sunlight and rainwater

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
nourish all living beings,

117
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,600
both male and female.

118
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,480
This means

119
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,240
every being in the universe has a place.

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,318
From ancient times to the present,

121
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,120
all beings

122
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,560
are born from a mother.

123
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,720
This is an eternal truth.

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,759
Sir,

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,359
the sages taught you how to govern.

126
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,479
Your teachers
taught you to know honor and shame,

127
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
but who

128
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,519
gave you the ears to listen and learn?

129
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Who

130
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,040
gave you the mouth to debate?

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Who

132
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,519
molded you with a spine
that does not fear my wrath!

133
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,079
Sir,

134
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,240
you stand in my great hall,

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,319
talking about ancestors
and the principles of this world.

136
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
But that's wrong.

137
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,759
What you should talk about

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,959
is the tombstone of your mother
that only bears her husband's surname,

139
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,040
and her lifetime of suffering
that no one cares about.

140
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,439
It is you

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,720
who harmed the dignity of your mother!

142
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Your homes

143
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,720
are not only yours,

144
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,519
but also theirs.

145
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,839
Announce my decree.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,359
From today onwards,

147
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,359
women can be the head of the household

148
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
and the leader of the family.

149
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,639
Your Majesty is wise!

150
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,278
Your innovation

151
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,720
will bring benefit to the world,

152
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,800
blessings to all people.

153
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,839
A new decree has been issued.

154
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,000
You and Tudou

155
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,439
can live a good life now.

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,399
You'll be safely escorted back.

157
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,439
Go.

158
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,560
(Ning Wu,)

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
(why standing there?)

160
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
(Come join the fun!)

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,039
Come on.

162
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,480
Come play in the water!

163
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,600
Come over!

164
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,560
Come on!

165
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,360
Come on!

166
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
Come over!

167
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,199
Come over!

168
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,519
Come play in the water!

169
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,040
Come play!

170
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,839
(Ladies,)

171
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,639
(rest in peace.)

172
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,680
The new policy is really good!

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
What's the point?

174
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,679
He offended Master Zhuo.

175
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,679
This emperor likely won't reign long.

176
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,839
Stop.

177
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,319
Got it.

178
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,399
Huo Zheng handled the case well.

179
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
From this day onwards,

180
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,600
Huo Zheng is promoted
to Left Chief Censor

181
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,439
to supervise decree implementation.

182
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,160
Your Majesty,

183
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,879
Huo Zheng is just a seventh-rank
Hanlin Academy editor.

184
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,560
The Left Chief Censor
is a second-rank position.

185
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,159
Such rapid promotion

186
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,439
is unprecedented.

187
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,439
I fear it's inappropriate.

188
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,039
Your Majesty,

189
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,919
I am unworthy of this honor.

190
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,200
There's one charge against Zhuo Minghua
that has not been mentioned.

191
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,679
Huo Zheng!

192
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,279
I have defied the imperial will,

193
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,720
the crime is unforgivable.

194
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,439
I am following my mentor's example.

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Advise with my own life.

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,960
You...

197
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Bring it here!

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,679
These are the account books obtained
from Zhuo's Mansion.

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
The quantity is shocking.

200
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,678
Based on this quantity alone,

201
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,879
one can imagine

202
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,919
how much wealth Zhuo Minghua
has secretly amassed.

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,199
I found

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
these funds flowing to one person.

205
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,119
The Imperial Advisor of Great Ning,

206
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,799
Zhuo Shangxian!

207
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,240
Your Majesty, I humbly request

208
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,678
to investigate the accounts,

209
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,799
and eliminate the parasites

210
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,480
utterly!

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
- Your Majesty, please investigate!
- Your Majesty, please investigate!

212
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,960
Master Huo is indeed good with words.

213
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,559
Parasites?

214
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,440
Are you referring to me?

215
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,279
You are making baseless accusations.

216
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,519
What is your intention?

217
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,120
To cleanse the eunuch faction,

218
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,480
and rectify the government!

219
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,799
You truly are righteous and dignified.

220
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,919
Since the time of the late emperor,

221
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,120
I've served with all my heart,

222
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,840
always thinking of the realm.

223
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,919
Now,

224
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,320
a greenhorn who's barely been here
a few years

225
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,159
is allowed to frame me.

226
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,759
I'd like to ask,

227
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,799
what exactly are your intentions?

228
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,360
Your Majesty,

229
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,480
what do you intend to do?

230
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,398
Master Zhuo,

231
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,639
you act with integrity

232
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,000
and have a clear conscience.

233
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,000
You should fear no investigation.

234
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
You want to investigate me?

235
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,519
This matter is just Master Huo's
unfounded claim.

236
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,679
Who has seen

237
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,720
these fabricated account books?

238
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,879
I'd like to see

239
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,279
that besides Master Huo,

240
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,519
who else wants to investigate.

241
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,399
Huting Army!

242
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes!

243
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,159
Master Zhuo,

244
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,519
how dare you threaten His Majesty
with military force?

245
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,639
This is rebellion!

246
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,519
Master Pei,

247
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,360
where is the Yilin Army?

248
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,559
Stationed in the north of the city.

249
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,519
Someone says I am rebelling.

250
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,518
Master Pei, do you want to eliminate me,

251
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,240
the rebel in Master Huo's words?

252
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Master Zhuo, stop joking.

253
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,480
Your loyalty and patriotism
are renowned worldwide.

254
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,279
These account books

255
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
are just waste paper.

256
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,240
