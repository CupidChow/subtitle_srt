=Episode 12=

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,198
- Come and see.
- Come and see.

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,120
Everyone, come and see.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Come and see!

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,839
Everyone, come!

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,839
Come and see!

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,239
Everyone, come and see!

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,280
What is this?

10
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,399
What is written?

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
Come and take a look.

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,160
(Shocking)
Master Zhuo is furious.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,920
The emperor went mad with fear.

14
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,839
Master Zhuo intends to kill,

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,320
and the emperor won't live long!

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,038
Let me see.

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,039
This...

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Master Zhuo.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,280
What is this for?

20
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,478
The court trial just ended.

21
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,600
Now rumors are spreading.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,560
Your Majesty, you're a good planner.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,600
How could there be such absurd rumors?

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,880
You are very clever,

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,040
using public opinions to prevent me
from acting against you.

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,438
I have been unhappy these past few days.

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,480
Very frustrated.

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,319
What should I do?

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,159
(He should not dare to kill me.)

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,400
Do you think I don't dare to kill you?

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
Imperial Advisor...

32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,319
I...

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,840
Don't forget.

34
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,680
Your current position is given by me.

35
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,840
I can promote you.

36
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,159
I can also kill you.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,958
I don't mind

38
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,280
making you disappear from this world.

39
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,760
Look at you now,

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,959
I feel much more at ease.

41
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,560
Here you are.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,199
You arrived faster than I thought.

43
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,280
Seven-star Pill.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,038
His heart will soon fail,

45
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,759
like having a heart disease.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Shenzhi,

47
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
we should depart to avoid suspicion.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,319
Foster father,

49
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,800
what does this mean?

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,680
It's because he didn't listen.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
The antidote.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,439
What if I refuse?

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,520
Then I

54
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,960
can only take it from you.

55
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,520
Are you going to defy me
for this little emperor?

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,598
You really intend to rebel!

57
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,719
So what?

58
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,919
You unfilial son!

59
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,319
Unfilial son?

60
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,598
Have you ever truly considered me
as your son?

61
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,758
Have you ever truly trusted me?

62
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,719
Trust you?

63
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,199
How do you expect me to trust you?

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
Unless you
hand over the Tiger Tally right now!

65
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,080
I knew it.

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Yes.

67
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,599
You taught me not to trust anyone.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,000
So you never trusted me.

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,679
As long as I am slightly non-compliant,

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,279
you'll use my being a former prince
to pressure me right away.

71
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,439
In your eyes,

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,480
I am just a pawn to you.

73
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,240
I am going against you.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,479
That's because you poisoned the emperor

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,360
without informing me at all!

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,999
Don't you understand

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,879
if you kill him now,

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,198
you will verify the rumors?

79
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,959
The whole kingdom will be against you!

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,240
Are you taking me to the grave with you?

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,000
You said all these

82
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,040
just to save him, right?

83
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,199
Alright.

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,879
Isn't he just a puppet emperor?

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
Go ahead and kill him.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,160
If things can't be resolved then,

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
the whole kingdom will be against us.

88
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,759
We may survive together,

89
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,319
or die together.

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,040
The emperor recklessly tried

91
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,360
to harm the Imperial Advisor,

92
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,959
turning himself into a useless pawn.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,399
If he has to die, so be it.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,359
I know a bit about Seven-star Pill.

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,720
After the poison acts,
it does look like a heart attack.

96
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,999
But redness will appear on the face,

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,959
causing suspicion.

98
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959
However,

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
there's an apothecary

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,919
from the Imperial Food Bureau,

101
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,439
skilled at making up.

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,078
I will summon her right now

103
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,518
to cover it for His Majesty.

104
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,560
Foster father, please wait a moment.

105
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,360
Master Pei.

106
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:26,079
Go and call the apothecary.

107
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
And also,

108
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,279
go to the Shenxing Camp.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,079
Yes.

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
(She is a woman.)

111
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,759
(Setting female households?)

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
(This idea)

113
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,120
(is quite novel.)

114
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,959
(You're not just anybody.)

115
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,759
(You're someone trustworthy.)

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
(Master Pei.)

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Master Pei.

118
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,560
The apothecary has arrived.

119
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,040
Let's go.

120
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,759
Foster father,

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the apothecary is here.

122
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,480
Foster father, why?

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,758
Shenzhi,

124
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,759
pardon me.

125
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,720
I failed to consider your feelings,

126
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,360
and made you misunderstand.

127
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,958
Of course, I know

128
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,839
we have to spare his life
to shut everyone's mouth.

129
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,040
I did this to teach him a lesson,

130
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,000
so he won't forget
who rules this Great Ning.

131
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Next time, I will inform you in advance.

132
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,560
We'll spare his life this time.

133
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,879
For an emperor without any foundation,

134
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
I have plenty of ways to control him.

135
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:32,064
(Shocking. Master Zhuo is furious.
The emperor went mad with fear.)

136
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,240
(Golden Scales
are not ordinary fish in a pool.)

137
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,919
(Pine and cypress
should soar to the highest peak.)

138
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,679
(Ning Jinyi,)

139
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,480
(I was being conceited.)

140
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,639
(When have you ever needed someone
to shelter you from the storm?)

141
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,080
(You are the one)

142
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,080
(about to stir up the biggest storm.)

143
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,639
(I am still alive.)

144
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
Master Zhuo.

145
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,399
Shouldn't you thank me
for not killing you?

146
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I...

147
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Forget it.

148
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,639
I don't mind.

149
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Today I came

150
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,799
to ask a favor from you.

151
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,279
Your Majesty!

152
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,679
Auntie!

153
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,600
Auntie!

154
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Your Majesty!

155
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,480
Let her go!

156
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,120
Come at me. Let her go!

157
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,759
You don't think I'm using Jingxian
to threaten you, do you?

158
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,840
I fell in love with Jingxian
at first sight.

159
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,960
I would like to ask you

160
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,518
to grant a marriage

161
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,559
between us.

162
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,879
I will not allow that!

163
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,959
You can humiliate me any way you want.

164
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
Let her go!

165
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,080
Humiliate?

166
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,600
I genuinely want Jingxian.

167
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,919
However, if in this way,

168
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,599
I can keep you under control,

169
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,799
I would feel quite pleased.

170
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,919
I always have had a habit.

171
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,240
If I can't get what I want,

172
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,240
I would rather destroy it.

173
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,039
After all,

174
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,240
you still owe me a life.

175
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
You have to think clearly.

176
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
I

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,159
am not very patient.

178
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,240
Alright.

179
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,840
I'll give my life for Zhuo Minghua.

180
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,200
As long as you let her go.

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
I beg you.

182
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
What do you say?

183
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,000
Shall I fulfill our little emperor?

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Master Zhuo,

185
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,759
please allow me to say a few words.

186
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,879
Your Majesty,

187
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
I've spent my life

188
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
having others decide my life and death.

189
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,639
But today,

190
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,480
I want to make a decision for myself.

for us to depend on each other?
