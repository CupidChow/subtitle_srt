2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Come on.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,719
Jade Dragon Soup.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,078
Amber Pigeon Eggs.

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,000
Shrimp Rolls.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Agate Meatballs.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,480
Sit.

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:24,519
Oh,

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,519
this is inappropriate.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,920
It's appropriate because I say so.

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,599
Come on, Auntie.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,119
You are not the same as before now.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,719
You can't be so childish anymore.

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,119
Delicious.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,759
Auntie,

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,759
I want to eat yours.

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,520
Slow down,

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
no one fights with you.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
(Without fighting,)

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
how can you achieve the goal?

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,520
(Ten Years Ago)
Useless.

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,159
Remember,

24
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,040
when you were born,

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,879
Xia State had just fallen.

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,760
Your life has only one goal.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,280
That is revenge

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,879
to console the departed souls!

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,920
Your Majesty, enjoy your meal.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
Auntie,

31
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,359
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,640
We agreed to escape the palace together.

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
It was about to come true.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
But I ruined it.

35
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,359
I know.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,120
You wouldn't have done this
unless you had to.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,439
It's just that today,

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,359
you are in the most prominent position.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,679
The fact that you are a woman

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,159
may expose.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
I know.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,959
Your Majesty,

43
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,519
let's escape.

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,800
Escape?

45
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,120
How?

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,400
These years,

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,758
I have been living in fear.

48
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,919
Planning for years,

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,039
I finally found a way out of the palace.

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,359
It is at least a fallback.

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,718
But

52
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,199
if we escape now,

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,639
wouldn't this be too dangerous?

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
It will.

55
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,239
But the palace is like a chess game.

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,520
We are down to our last two breaths.

57
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,599
If we want to stay alive,

58
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,158
we can only take risks.

59
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,159
Perhaps,

60
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,080
this is the only way to survive.

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,879
You are right.

62
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,918
This incense calms the mind.

63
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,919
You can use it before sleep.

64
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,319
It is late.

65
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,120
Master Pei, anything else?

66
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,439
Yes.

67
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,439
Prepare your bath and bed.

68
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,479
Such matters can be handled by Madam Li.

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
How can I trouble you?

70
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,439
Yes.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Such minor tasks

72
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,280
have always been my job.

73
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,879
His Majesty must be used to it by now.

74
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,560
Then, Your Majesty,

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
please get used to me from now on.

76
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,400
After all, serving you

77
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,960
is my duty.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No need.

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
You may leave.

80
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,879
Your Majesty, you seem so flustered.

81
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,879
Is there

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
any unspeakable secret?

83
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,439
Don't...

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,439
No, Auntie.

85
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,039
Auntie,

86
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,679
you may leave.

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,039
But...

88
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,520
I need to talk to Master Pei.

89
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,879
(What should I do?)

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
If you move again,

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
I will kill you.

92
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
Master Pei,

93
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,000
since you said you would serve me,

94
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,560
then

95
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,199
can you grant me one request?

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
What is your request?

97
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,839
The person who serves me

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,879
must

99
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,839
cater to my preferences.

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Actually,

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,480
have long noticed

103
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,279
that you

104
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,199
are much stronger

105
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,040
than other eunuchs.

106
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,319
I

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,240
like you more.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Your Majesty,

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,879
what exactly are you trying to say?

110
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
What I mean,

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,319
of course,

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,279
is a night together.

113
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,519
Is it okay?

114
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,319
I know little about that.

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,879
Let Madam Li

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
continue to serve you.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Is it okay?

118
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,959
Master Pei?

119
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,519
Master Pei!

120
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,920
Master Pei, something happened!

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,959
Take some rest, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,319
Who sent you here?

123
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,800
Master Pei,

124
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,480
are you here to kill me?

125
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,519
Your Majesty, are you okay?

126
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,079
Find a place to hide.

127
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,479
Why is there no sound anymore?

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't know.

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,439
It's all right. Come out.

130
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,039
Your Majesty.

131
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
The Imperial Advisor.

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
Your Majesty,

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,480
many assassins came tonight.

134
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,600
All are carefully cultivated diehards.

135
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Fortunately, we acted in time.

136
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,320
Otherwise,

137
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,000
it would be a disaster.

138
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
Diehards?

139
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,039
Who sent them?

140
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,759
Your Majesty,
please order an investigation.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Otherwise,

142
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,759
our lives are in danger.

143
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,480
Your Majesty, you're indeed wise.

144
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,599
This number one lost game in the world

145
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,840
has been solved by you.

146
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,039
I have been playing this game with you
for more than two months.

147
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,240
Now I figured out why this is called
"mutual destruction".

148
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,399
Auntie,

149
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,720
do you have another solution for this?

150
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,519
I am not sure.

151
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,840
But I do have some ideas.

152
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
Auntie,

153
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,279
do you feel

154
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
that today

155
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
the palace is unusually quiet?

156
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,120
Due to the incident the other day,

157
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
the servants must be cautious now.

158
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,200
Your Majesty, please spare me!

159
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,960
Why so scared?

160
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,758
You merely spilled some tea.

161
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,919
Why would I want to kill you?

162
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,279
I...

163
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
If you don't tell me,

164
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,440
I

165
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,960
will really take your life!

166
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,639
I dare not say!

167
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,278
Your Majesty, spare me!

168
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,919
Your Majesty, spare my life!

169
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,879
(Zhuo Shangxian.)

170
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,639
(Think you dominate the world?
You'll die miserably!)

171
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,279
Your Majesty,

172
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,639
you shouldn't be here.

173
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,879
What crime did they commit?

174
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,720
They all came to assassinate you.

175
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Just that?

176
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,039
Get out.

177
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,039
Yes.

178
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:12,448
(Name List)

179
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,440
(Name List)

180
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,719
If they don't die,

181
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
you will.

182
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,239
You don't have to feel guilty about it.

183
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Really?

184
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,199
Do you really think they
all deserve to die?

185
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,719
They rebelled with the Crown Prince...

186
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,960
Master Pei.

187
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,440
By keeping telling a lie,

188
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,039
will you be able to deceive yourself?

189
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,960
Fine.

190
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,480
They all deserve to die.

191
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,360
Zhang Yanqing,

192
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,360
Governor of Western Sichuan,

193
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,559
cleared silt from the floodgate
to alleviate the flood, personally.

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
He almost gave his life

195
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,360
to save the people.

196
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,440
Zhao Changji,

197
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,360
Director of the Imperial Granary.

198
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,440
To bring fairness to people,

199
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,600
he ran around for months
despite being ill

200
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,799
and got disabled for life.

201
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,720
Shen Hanwu,

202
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,039
Commander of the Western Fort.

203
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,559
To resist the Yan army's invasion,

204
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,960
all three of his sons died
on the battlefield.

205
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,440
His hair went gray overnight.

206
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
And there is Yue Guishan,

207
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Ren Haibin,

208
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,360
Yu Changping...

209
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Master Pei,

210
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,639
in your eyes,

211
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,200
do they really deserve to be killed?

212
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:46,432
(Name List)

213
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,639
Yes!

214
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,399
They all deserve to be killed.

215
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,080
Your Majesty,

216
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,039
now you are in a high position.

217
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,398
Determining if someone should die

218
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,519
is not about his political achievements,

219
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,798
but whether he stands by your side

220
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,519
as your tool for ruling the world!

221
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,480
But they

222
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,678
once shared the country's burdens

223
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,080
and solved problems for the people.

224
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,720
What is it

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,159
that made them forget their belief?

226
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,678
What is it

227
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,080
that forced them to take sides?

228
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,080
It's this cruel world

229
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,679
and the chaotic Great Ning!

230
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,440
Even if they picked the wrong side,

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,758
it's the Great Ning's fault!

232
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,759
It's...

233
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,759
It's the fault of you people

234
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,719
who are causing chaos in the court,

235
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,559
and having everything in your control!

236
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
It's the fault of you eunuch party!

237
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,519
It's also my fault.

238
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,639
Your Majesty, if you don't like it,

239
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,399
why not do something yourself

240
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,919
and set things right?

241
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,544
(Name List)

242
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Master Pei.

243
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,279
Master Pei!

244
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,679
Madam Li, what is it?

245
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,039
His Majesty hasn't been

246
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,558
eating for three days.

247
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,759
He's getting thinner.

248
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,799
I am really worried about his health.

249
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,799
I'll see him.

250
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,879
Master Pei,

251
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,158
His Majesty had a serious illness
as a child,

252
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,558
vomited everything he ate.

253
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,960
His life was hanging by a thread.

254
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,679
Later,

255
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,720
I asked a servant who went out
to visit his family

256
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,440
to bring back tofu pudding
from the Shi'er Drink Shop.

257
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,079
His Majesty had it

258
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,519
and then got a lot better.

259
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,080
Master Pei, could you please

260
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,759
have someone bring it here?

261
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,278
How dare you command me?

262
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
I dare not.

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,360
His Majesty treats me like family.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,360
Seeing him like this,

265
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,519
I am truly worried.

266
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,759
But in this palace,

267
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,039
I really don't dare to trust others.

268
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,279
Only you

269
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,399
take care of us.

270
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,679
And you're free to leave the palace.

271
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,120
So I begged you.

272
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,278
Please.

273
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,639
Please!

274
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Please!

275
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,360
I will bring it here
tomorrow at Chen hour.

276
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,279
