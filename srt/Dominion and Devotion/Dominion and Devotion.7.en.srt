=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,199
If you dare to deceive me,

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,120
I will definitely kill you.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
I would not dare.

6
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:42,995
(Twenty Years Ago, Former Xia Dynasty)

7
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:02,119
(Consort Liu, Fifth Prince's mother)

8
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,439
(Mad again.)

9
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,079
(Even ignoring the crying kid.)

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
(Did he wet his pants?)

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,840
How could it be a girl?

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
Where is Fifth Prince?

13
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,239
(Xia?)

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,760
(I heard that the Empress of Xia
just gave birth.)

15
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,559
(Could she be)

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,598
(the Princess of Xia?)

17
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,199
General Ning will be enthroned tomorrow.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,039
He summons Lady Liu and Fifth Prince

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,159
to the main hall to be conferred.

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,919
(If I report this,)

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
(I'm afraid none of us will survive.)

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
(From this moment on,)

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,480
(you will be Fifth Prince.)

24
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,120
Our fortunes are tied together.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,120
We'll be in life and death together.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Your Majesty.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,639
You haven't eaten in days.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
You must be starving.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,000
Your favorite pork knuckle.

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,639
Eat up.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm starving.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,999
(Last night, Master Pei)

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
(brought me braised pig trotters
and lamb shank.)

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
(I'm still full.)

35
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,000
Weren't you hungry?

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
are you alright?

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,759
What's the matter?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,399
I haven't eaten for days.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,559
I'm too weak to eat meat.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,159
I'll have some porridge first.

42
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,360
You scared me.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,479
That's more like it.

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,479
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,080
has Master Pei come to see you
these past few days?

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,759
(He comes every night.)

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,520
He came a couple of times.

48
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,960
Did he

49
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,319
mention anything?

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
He didn't say anything special.

51
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,240
That's good.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Auntie,

53
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,638
when I've been grounded here,

54
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,000
I've found a very interesting book

55
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,199
called Eunuch's Tale.

56
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,479
Eunuch's Tale?

57
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,479
I haven't heard of such a peculiar book.

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,599
The eunuch in that book has
special feelings towards the consort.

59
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,960
Do you think

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,840
eunuchs also like women?

61
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,919
Of course.

62
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,919
A castrated man is still a man.

63
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Of course, they will...

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,399
Did Master Pei do something

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,919
to you?

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,159
No.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,000
It's in the book. So I was just asking.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
It's in the book?

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
Where is it? Let me see.

70
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,680
I haven't finished it yet.

71
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,159
I'll show you later.

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,240
(Could it be that she
has feelings for Master Pei?)

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Your Majesty,

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,719
in that book, what sort of feelings

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,599
does the consort have for the eunuch?

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,319
Well,

77
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,439
she seemed to have developed feelings
for the eunuch too.

78
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,719
And then,

79
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,279
she got a bit scared,

80
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,319
so she transferred the eunuch
away from her side.

81
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
That's all.

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,199
After all, eunuchs

83
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,399
can't bring true happiness to women.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,360
To withdraw early

85
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,920
is a wise move.

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,720
What are you looking at?

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,439
Setting up female households?

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,279
This idea

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,639
is quite novel.

90
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,560
Really?

91
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,959
Do you think it'll work?

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Yes.

93
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,639
Master Zhuo has arrived.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,119
I have come today

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,199
to discuss an important matter
with Your Majesty.

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,720
This is the daughter of Minister Gao.

97
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,439
The 10th of this month
is an auspicious day,

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,759
suitable for marriage.

99
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,239
You can

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
take Miss Gao into your harem
on that day.

101
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,480
T-Take her into my harem?

102
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,600
You are at the right age.

103
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,240
It is time for the harem
to add more members.

104
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,959
(It seems he finds it difficult
to control me as a puppet.)

105
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,359
(Once I take her,)

106
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,879
(the day when a prince is born)

107
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,319
(will be the day of my death.)

108
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,920
Your Majesty, are you not satisfied?

109
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,438
Of course, I'm satisfied.

110
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,560
Miss Gao is clearly a beauty.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,838
Master Zhuo, thank you

112
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,279
for having me in your heart
besides being burdened by duty.

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,240
To alleviate your worries is my duty.

114
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,439
Then let me congratulate you in advance.

115
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,039
I'd like to see how Your Majesty

116
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,959
will consummate the marriage
with Miss Gao.

117
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,720
It seems you've been very idle lately.

118
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:45,800
Naturally.

119
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,680
Your Majesty couldn't wait
to accept this marriage.

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
I couldn't say no.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,920
My rejection
would only arouse his suspicion.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
I can only take it one step at a time.

123
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,920
This is awful.

124
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,275
(Wedding)

125
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:10,425
(Miss Gao, Daughter of Minister)

126
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,920
What should we do now?

127
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,920
I have no experience in this regard.

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,279
Master Pei, please think of a solution.

129
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,879
To be honest,

130
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,879
in this regard,

131
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I have no experience.

132
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,680
I-I got so anxious that I forgot.

133
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,040
How about we set a fire

134
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,439
and burn down the bedchamber?

135
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,359
It's rare

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
to see you so flustered.

137
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,318
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

138
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,560
I am a bit nervous,

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,839
so I broke the wine pot.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
But we must stick to ceremony.

141
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,279
Please, Your Majesty,

142
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,879
drink the wedding wine with me.

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Why are you undressing?

144
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,920
To serve Your Majesty in bed.

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
In bed?

146
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
They're going to bed.

147
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,199
Master Pei, quickly think of a solution.

148
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm begging you.

149
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Maybe we should

150
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
burn the bedchamber.

151
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Okay.

152
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,799
No, we can't do that.

153
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
What if the fire

154
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,399
accidentally burns them both to death?

155
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,799
Then let's think

156
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,039
of another way.

157
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,039
Okay.

158
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,360
How about

159
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,158
we tell them

160
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,720
there'll be a meteor shower tonight
that's once in a millennium?

161
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,639
Okay.

162
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's watch

163
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,799
the meteor shower together.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,799
I'll think of a way myself.

165
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,919
Isn't this a good idea?

166
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,240
Your Majesty, rest assured.

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,758
The teaching palace maid has taught me

168
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,279
how to serve Your Majesty.

169
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,199
I am willing to give my all

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,519
to bringing you joy tonight.

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
No need.

172
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,600
I remembered
I have some memorials to review.

173
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,919
Go to bed early.

174
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,919
Your Majesty, do you not like me?

175
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,519
To tell you the truth,

176
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,399
I never go near women

177
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,399
because...

178
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,039
I like eunuchs.

179
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,480
You like eunuchs?

180
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,039
So that's Your Majesty's taste.

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
But what should we do?

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,919
A distant water
can't quench a nearby thirst.

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,480
Let me be the one
to relieve your aphrodisiac.

184
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,639
Aphrodisiac?

185
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,759
What aphrodisiac?

186
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,279
Your Majesty,

187
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,679
consent to me.

188
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,919
What did you give me?

189
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,519
