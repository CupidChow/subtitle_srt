00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,960
Let me help Your Majesty get changed.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,920
What are you doing?

5
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,439
Are you addicted

6
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,520
to being a eunuch?

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,719
I just like serving Your Majesty.

8
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:39,640
Are you

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
displeased?

10
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,200
No.

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,439
Fine then.

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,799
Permission granted.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,118
Your Majesty is good-looking

14
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,119
and graceful.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,359
I suppose

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,439
it comes from your mother.

17
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,560
I wonder how Your Majesty's mother was.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,640
Can you tell me about her?

19
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,680
My mother

20
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,840
passed away due to illness
when I was young.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,040
My memories of her are quite blurred.

22
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,760
But Madam Li once told me

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
that she was
a graceful and beautiful woman.

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,718
When she was lucid,

25
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,280
she would hum nursery rhymes

26
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,400
to put me to sleep.

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,120
Why did you suddenly ask about her?

28
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,879
It's nothing.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,439
I'm just curious.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
You are acting strange today.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,359
Don't go to court today.

32
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,640
Lay low for now.

33
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,079
All right.

34
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,159
I'll do as you say.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,599
I should get going.

36
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,439
Okay.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,799
I'll wait for you.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
(Your Majesty,)

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,560
(why didn't Master Pei come to court?)

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,479
(He was severely injured
while we tried to eliminate)

41
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,159
Zhuo Shangxian.

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
He needs some rest.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,279
I heard that Zhuo committed suicide
in prison out of guilt last night.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,400
Is this true?

45
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,159
Yes.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,439
I verified it in person.

47
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,000
Is there a problem?

48
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,680
In that case,

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,520
I have

50
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,000
no more questions.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Your Majesty,

52
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,280
I have a memorial to present.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Permission granted.

54
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,919
Your Majesty,

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,240
I denounce Pei Shenzhi,
the Seal-Holding Eunuch.

56
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,198
He colluded with Zhuo Shangxian
to obtain power

57
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,759
when the late emperor

58
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,439
was in his sick bed.

59
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,799
They eliminated dissidents

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,840
with the excuse of

61
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,918
investigating the assassin case

62
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,400
to protect the Zhuo family.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
They destroyed evidence

64
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,000
to cover up the truth.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,119
I hope Your Majesty will execute

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,758
such a wicked criminal

67
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,879
and bring peace to the world.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,639
You might not know this.

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
Ever since my enthronement,

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
Pei Shenzhi has secretly helped me
overcome numerous difficulties.

71
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,400
From the Junlai Village trouble
to the scholar case,

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,719
and the takedown
of Zhuo Shangxian's revolt,

73
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,039
he has always been here.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,039
He might have made mistakes,

75
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,159
but his achievements are remarkable.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
I intend to

77
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,280
offset his faults with his merits

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,680
and let him retire.

79
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,000
I hope you

80
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,160
can understand it.

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,959
That's right.

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,279
I saw Master Pei
knock that traitor to the ground

83
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,399
with my own eyes.

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,319
Tell me.

85
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,199
Which one of you is capable of that?

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,879
You only engage in meaningless talk.

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,839
Your Majesty,

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
I still believe that

89
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,079
Pei Shenzhi should be executed.

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,879
Master Pei's achievements
are indeed remarkable.

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,278
But it's also true

92
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,759
that he has done numerous misdeeds.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,799
Zhuo Shangxian insisted that he was
a prince of the previous dynasty.

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,879
He also helped you ascend the throne.

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,480
If he stays alive,

96
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
people will question the legitimacy
of Your Majesty's ascension.

97
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,879
Then,

98
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,879
how can Your Majesty
silence the widespread criticism?

99
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,279
Your Majesty, please issue a decree

100
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,319
to execute Pei Shenzhi.

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,240
What if I don't?

102
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Your Majesty,

103
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,439
I know well that Master Pei
is loyal to Your Majesty.

104
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,439
And I understand
that Your Majesty is in a dilemma.

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,799
But the stability of your reign
is the foundation of the empire.

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Master Pei must die.

107
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,278
If he is lonely
on the road to the afterlife,

108
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,160
I am willing to keep him company
and offer my death

109
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,879
as a sincere remonstration.

110
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,199
Master Zheng.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Master Zheng.

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Summon the physicians.

113
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,359
Please execute

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,319
Pei Shenzhi.

115
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:04,960
- Please execute Pei Shenzhi.
- Please execute Pei Shenzhi.

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Stop

117
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,000
pressuring me.

118
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
My decision has been made.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
That's the end of it.

120
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,519
The court is dismissed.

121
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,560
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

122
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,439
Your Majesty is back.

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Did it go well today?

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Yes, it went well.

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
There was nothing special.

126
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,279
What is this?

127
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,839
It's a plant I picked from the road.

128
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,398
In the beginning,

129
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,519
it was extremely fragile.

130
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
But after I cared for it,

131
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,800
it actually bloomed and bore fruit.

132
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,600
I tasted its fruit just now.

133
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,519
It turns out to be sour

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,319
with a hint of bitterness

135
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,838
and a lingering sweetness.

136
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,879
Of course,

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,839
sweetness follows suffering.

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Pei Shenzhi,

139
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,679
can you

140
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,879
promise me one thing?

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Sure.

142
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,519
You haven't asked me what it is yet.

143
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,159
Whatever Your Majesty wishes

144
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,480
is my wish as well.

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I

146
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,360
want to marry you.

147
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
Shall we hold

148
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,439

However,

193
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,960
it's under one condition.

194
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,679
Pei Shenzhi.

195
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,799
No matter what people say,

196
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,519
you must not give up.

197
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,799
I will not give up, either.

198
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,519
You are my one and only

199
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,559
in this lifetime.

200
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,080
Pinky promise.

201
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,159
How can Your Majesty be so childish?

202
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,399
Your Majesty.

203
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,759
How is Master Zheng?

204
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,720
Your Majesty,

205
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
he is out of danger.

206
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,799
But the ministers are still kneeling,
refusing to get up.

207
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,320
You can go.

208
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Understood.

209
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,879
Your Majesty,

210
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
the ministers have been fasting

211
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,398
and kneeling for two days.

212
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,439
Let them kneel if they wish to.

213
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Understood.

214
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Your Majesty,

215
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
Master Zhou said

216
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,159
someone could prove Master Pei
was not a prince of the former reign.

217
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,399
Please come to the main hall.

218
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Zhou Mu?

219
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,600
Who did he bring?

220
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:34,279
The midwife who helped
the former Empress give birth.

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
Your Majesty, I'd like to see her.

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,279
Why are you so eager?

223
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,600
There's a slim chance.

224
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Of course, I'm eager.

225
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,120
Master Pei and I will be there shortly.

226
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,519
Understood.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,558
Tell Your Majesty

228
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,120
everything you told me.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,319
I am Liu Chunfang,

230
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,759
a midwife of the f-former dynasty.

231
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,398
The former Empress
gave birth to her child

232
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,279
the night before the late emperor
ascended the throne.

233
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,319
I was responsible
for assisting in the birth.

234
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,439
It was a chaotic night.

235
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,000
After I helped
the former Empress give birth,

236
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,719
I hid somewhere

237
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,959
out of fear.

238
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
However,

239
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,359
I remember

240
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,519
how the newborn looked very clearly.

241
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,240
He had a mole under his eye.

242
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
This child

243
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,919
must be

244
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,399
Master Pei Shenzhi.

245
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,279
Zhou Mu,

246
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,639
how dare you deceive me?

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Otherwise,

248
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,799
you wouldn't have come.

249
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,960
I had no choice but to do so.

250
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,639
Where did you find this midwife?

251
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,519
Your Majesty,

252
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,759
she came to my mansion

253
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,278
and informed me of this matter.

254
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,600
She went to your mansion?

255
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,440
Yes.

256
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:13,792
(Registry of personnel)
The registry

257
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,945
can prove the identity of this midwife.

258
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,279
I have verified it

259
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
to be authentic.

260
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:34,885
(Registry of personnel)

261
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,879
Tell me.

262
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,079
As a midwife of the former dynasty,

263
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,839
why did you volunteer to be a witness?

264
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,000
Aren't you afraid of death?

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,758
I...

266
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,039
I heard the evil deeds of Master Pei.

267
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,080
Everyone condemns him.

268
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,480
What a righteous person.

269
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,600
Then tell me.

270
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,240
You only had a glimpse

271
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,639
of the newborn back then.

272
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,199
How dare you testify

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,879
that it was Master Pei

274
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,120
merely based on a mole under his eye?

275
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,759
Were you threatened

276
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
to come forward and testify against him?

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,720
Speak the truth

278
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,799
and I will spare you.

279
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
Zhuo Shangxian is dead.

280
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,919
He no longer holds power.

281
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,919
I will send someone
to protect you and your family.

282
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,960
If anyone dares to harm you,

283
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,000
I will not

284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
let them off.

285
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
If you don't confess,

286
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:36,639
I will

287
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,080
kill your entire family.

288
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,999
Actually...

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,679
Actually...

290
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,840
The former Empress

291
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,919
g-gave birth

292
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,840
to a girl...

293
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,320
Why?

294
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
