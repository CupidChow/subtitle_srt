=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,296
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
How is it?

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,600
Master Pei,

5
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,398
His Majesty's wound is not serious.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,398
But he's been overthinking.

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,558
And he's weak
from the fasting in the past days.

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,119
That's why he has a fever.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,479
I will prescribe dosages
of the soothing, tonic decoction.

10
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,600
I see.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,280
You may leave.

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,399
Yes.

13
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,240
I know you are awake.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
I am awake.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,039
But I

16
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,719
do not want to see your face.

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,039
Does the wound

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
still hurt?

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,959
I do not want

20
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,879
your concern either.

21
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,719
You used refugees against Huting Army.

22
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,760
How could you be sure

23
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,840
that they'd risk their lives
to plunder the money?

24
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,040
Or rather,

25
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,479
how could you be sure they'd succeed?

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,679
If you are about to starve to death

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,078
and there is a chance
to survive in front of you,

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,200
would you wait to starve to death

29
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,239
or

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,359
give it a try and fight for your life?

31
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,799
Besides,

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,199
Huting Army's main duty
is to protect the palace.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,279
They are soldiers.

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,799
I bet

35
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,599
that they would not want to

36
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,680
or dare to kill civilians.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
You

38
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,319
are such a bold gambler.

39
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,359
I won that gamble,

40
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,799
didn't I?

41
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,359
Besides,

42
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,319
wasn't Master Pei there too?

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
It seems that in your eyes,

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,319
I am not an unforgivable person.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,718
But I'm curious.

46
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,599
Aren't you afraid
that the lost money will be recovered?

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,680
To be recovered,

48
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,560
the lost money
must first be brought into the open.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Does Master Zhuo dare to disclose

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,439
where his fortune comes from?

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,840
He looted it from the people.

52
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,799
Since it's from the people,

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,878
returning it to the people

54
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,280
is the best solution.

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Moreover,

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,559
refugees lives depend on that money.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
They would never let go.

58
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,279
If Master Zhuo dares
to order the mass killing of refugees,

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,319
it might cause national chaos.

60
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,079
He is very well aware of that too.

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,239
But he can't do anything.

62
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
So

63
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,879
he could only vent his anger on you.

64
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,360
Right?

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,039
If you had not come just now,

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,599
this plan could be called perfect.

67
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,360
But you softened in the end

68
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,239
and almost got yourself involved.

69
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,119
It was the Huting Army soldiers
who softened first.

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
What I was betting on

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,759
was the benevolence
in the hearts of my subjects.

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,800
If abandoned them
after using their kindness,

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,758
don't you think

74
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,360
that would make me a beast?

75
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,439
Your Majesty

76
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
is getting better and better at ruling.

77
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,439
Master Pei,

78
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,560
do you regret it?

79
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,680
But once a move is made,

80
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,120
there is no regret.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,960
You're out of opportunities.

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
Opportunities

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,319
must be fought for.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
It's rare for you

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,120
to throw yourself at me actively.

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,519
A beautiful night is scarce.

87
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
I am

88
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,319
willing to indulge in it

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,639
with you.

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
Why are you dodging?

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,680
I won't eat you.

92
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,279
Who do you take me for?

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,759
Who can it be?

94
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,199
You are just someone

95
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,759
who pleases me in my bedchamber.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,599
But your eyes

97
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,120
say differently.

98
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,680
Is that so?

99
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,839
Master Pei,

100
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,959
you are a bit self-important.

101
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,279
Who do you think

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,599
you are

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
in my heart?

104
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,838
You're just someone who would abandon me

105
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,680
in the time I needed you the most.

106
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,160
I no longer need you now.

107
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,279
Like I have said,

108
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,839
Master Pei,

109
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,839
you'd better not regret it.

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
It's late now.

111
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,719
You should leave.

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
I won't see you off.

113
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,079
What brings you here?

114
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,959
I

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,439
have come to apologize.

116
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,959
Before I first met you,

117
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,680
when the late emperor died,

118
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,720
I wanted to die
together with my foster father.

119
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,040
But then I met you.

120
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,079
You stood out
in this cold imperial city.

121
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,199
You're benevolent

122
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,439
and wise,

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,679
like an uncarved gem.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,079
So I helped you ascend to the throne

125
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,519
and followed the heart

126
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,078
to move forward step by step.

127
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,160
I don't want to explain too much

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,999
why I left you
when you needed me the most.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
Perhaps there were better ways
to accomplish you.

130
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,800
But I chose the worst one

131
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,439
and hurt you.

132
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,879
Master Pei,

133
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,399
do you regret it?

134
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
Yes.

135
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
I regret it.

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Your birthday is in two days.

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,399
If you are willing to give me a chance,

138
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,959
I will

139
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,680
wait for you at Luolin Garden.

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I will think about it.

141
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
The wind is chilly.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,519
Don't catch a cold, Your Majesty.

143
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,879
Master Pei.

144
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,240
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

145
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
Auntie gave this to me as a gift.

146
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,360
I didn't wear it specially for you.

147
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,639
The moon is beautiful tonight.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,039
I have prepared some wine.

149
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,000
Why don't we enjoy the moon together?

150
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,799
Happy birthday.

151
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,799
Thank you.

152
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,639
Thank you for gracing me
with your presence.

153
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,960
I have a question.

154
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
That day,

155
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:10,359
you said

156
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,879
you wanted to die together
with your foster father.

157
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,360
Why is that?

158
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,000
It's simply

159
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,000
a sad old story.

160
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,719
If I tell you,

161
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm afraid

162
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,439
it'll ruin your mood.

163
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Just go ahead.

164
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,399
I once

165
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,559
had a cherished friend.

166
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,559
(He was the first person
willing to become my friend.)

167
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,039
(His name was Liu Fangtong.)

168
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,960
Tell him, what did you do?

169
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,519
He told Zhuo Shangxian the secret

170
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,080
we agreed to keep.

171
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,120
I arranged for him to approach you

172
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,480
to test if you could keep a secret.

173
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
But your performance

174
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,799
disappointed me greatly.

175
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,639
Kill him now

176
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,159
so that no one
will know your secret anymore.

177
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,519
(Remember.)

178
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,759
(In this world,)

179
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,279
(except for me,)

180
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,200
(you can't trust anyone.)

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,559
(Later on many nights,)

182
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
(I would dream of that scene.)

183
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,799
(Just like that,)

184
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,200
(I became a blade
in Zhuo Shangxian's hand,)

185
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,639
(removing dissidents for him
by any means.)

186
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
Then you must hate Zhuo Shangxian a lot.

187
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,200
But Fangtong didn't want me to hate him.

188
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,360
At the moment of his death,

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
he smiled at me.

190
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,600
Don't cry.

191
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
I couldn't understand before

192
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,960
why he would smile at me then.

193
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,360
But later, I figured it out.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
It's because he was freed

195
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,480
at that moment.

196
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,440
And he didn't want me to feel guilty

197
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,240
because of his death.

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,679
So,

199
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,638
he was indeed forced to approach me,

200
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,120
but it's also true that he considered me

201
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,879
a friend.

202
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,720
Master Pei,

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,720
do not let him down.

204
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,999
He wouldn't wish you

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,239
to remember betrayal

206
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,440
and hatred.

207
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,440
Master Pei,

208
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,840
I don't wish that either.

209
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,720
Your Majesty,

210
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,678
you and he

211
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,360
are both warm and bright people.

212
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,159
Thank you for the compliment.

213
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,518
You asked me

214
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,240
whether I ever have feelings for you.

215
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,639
I do, and it's more than that.
