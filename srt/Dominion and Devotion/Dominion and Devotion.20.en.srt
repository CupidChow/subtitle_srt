00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,928
=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:22,496
(Zhuo's Mansion)

4
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,839
Master,

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
the people from the palace

6
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,880
turned our mansion upside down.

7
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,640
They are audacious beyond measure.

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,320
You must teach these blind fools
a good lesson.

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,919
Your Majesty, don't worry.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,280
Master Pei's injuries
have not reached his vitals.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,439
He will recover shortly.

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
You may leave.

13
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:11,920
Your Majesty,

14
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:13,000
everyone is here.

15
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,519
Got it.

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,239
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,799
Li Changjia's confession
has been read without omission.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Qian Ming,

19
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,279
do you admit guilt?

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,040
Your Majesty,

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,040
(Qian Ming, Minister of Personnel/Chief Examiner)
Li Changjia is falsely implicating me.

22
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,919
Imperial exams
are our nation's foundation.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,519
I wouldn't dare

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,039
rig it even if I died countless times.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,680
Fine.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,318
Do you think

27
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,040
you need not confess
with the witness dead?

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
I

29
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,760
will let make you convinced.

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,719
Guards.

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,560
Summon Ding Shanwen.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,079
Greetings,

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,159
Your Majesty.

34
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,239
(Ding Shanwen, Son of Vice Minister
of the Imperial Granary)

35
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,040
Aren't...

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,439
Aren't you dead?

37
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,840
You're quite informed, aren't you?

38
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,919
I anticipated
that you would kill the witness.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
So, I selected a death row inmate

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,639
to take his place.

41
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,360
Your Majesty,

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
I...

43
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,120
I...

44
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,319
I'm willing to report Qian Ming

45
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,399
for selling imperial exam questions

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,399
and to expose other examinees
involved in buying the questions.

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,559
I only beg Your Majesty

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
for a lighter sentence.

49
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,639
Heed my orders.

50
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,919
Beat Li Changjia, Right Chief Censor,

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,159
to death.

52
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,000
Remove Qian Ming's duty
as Hanlin Academician

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
and beat him to death.

54
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,280
Ding Shanwen

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,199
bribed important ministers

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,039
and harmed imperial exams' fairness.

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,599
But he's meritorious for reporting.

58
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,199
He shall take 30 strokes.

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,879
And he's not allowed

60
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,240
to take the imperial exams.

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,639
Thank you, Your Majesty.

62
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,919
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,279
spare me!

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Your Majesty!

65
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,080
Zhuo Shangxian

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,718
embezzled state funds,

67
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,239
formed factions for personal gain,

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,759
and disturbed the court order.

69
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,598
Strip him of the title
of Supreme Master.

70
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,119
Remove his duty as Imperial Advisor.

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,279
Take back Tiger Tally
of Huting Army from him.

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,679
Confine him for fault reflecting

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,479
to serve as a deterrent to others.

74
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,599
That's all with the punishments.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,598
It is time to reward based on merit.

76
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,879
Ministers,

77
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,400
what do you think of Luo Wenjing?

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,039
Your Majesty,

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Luo Wenjing is Huiyuan of this year.

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,080
He could have stood by and done nothing.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,959
But he risked his career and life

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,719
to seek fairness for all scholars.

83
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,080
He took risks to make

84
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,120
an imperial appeal.

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,840
He has a righteous spirit.

86
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,520
Having him

87
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,039
is truly a blessing for this country.

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,919
In my opinion,

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,559
Your Majesty should
promote him exceptionally

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
and entrust him with key duties.

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,198
Since this is the case.

92
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,318
I'll promote Luo Wenjing exceptionally.

93
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,679
From today onwards,

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,039
he will join the Censorate

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,639
as the censor.

96
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you,

97
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,600
Your Majesty, for your great favor.

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,519
But I have something to say.

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,759
What?

100
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,199
She is actually a woman?

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,879
This is a crime
of deceiving the emperor.

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,000
How could a woman
take the imperial exams?

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
This is unlucky.

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,758
My real name is Luo Wenxi.

105
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
I took the exams
with my elder brother's name.

106
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,240
Here I confess to Your Majesty.

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,759
Your Majesty, in my opinion,

108
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,278
Luo Wenjing exposed
the Imperial Advisor's crimes,

109
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,639
but deceiving Your Majesty
is an unforgivable crime.

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,680
She should be disqualified as Huiyuan

111
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,999
and be severely punished

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,399
to serve as a deterrent to others.

113
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,360
Who said she deceived me?

114
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,639
She told me about it

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,199
when she first met me.

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Moreover,

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,638
such a brave and astute person

118
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,600
with both virtue and talent

119
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,879
should not be punished.

120
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Rather, I want to heavily employ her.

121
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,360
I'll appoint her
as an official in the court

122
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,839
to help me govern.

123
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,560
Well...

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,240
Your Majesty,

125
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,399
this is unacceptable.

126
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,879
It's against the norms and laws.

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,839
Oh?

128
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,398
Tell me.

129
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,680
Which law of this country
does it violate?

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Well...

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,759
Since the law doesn't forbid it,

132
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
why can't it be done?

133
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,839
Your Majesty,

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,319
no woman has ever held
an official position before.

135
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,360
How can women

136
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,599
be involved in state affairs?

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,319
Moreover,

138
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,958
women usually stay in their boudoir.

139
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,319
Even if they read a few books,

140
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,719
what ability do they have
to govern the country?

141
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Is it so?

142
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,199
But before Luo Wenxi
revealed herself as a woman,

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you gentlemen

144
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,919
were full of praise for her,

145
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,279
saying that she was a blessing
to Great Ning.

146
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
Now, with just a change of gender,

147
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,519
everything is no longer acceptable.

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,518
Aren't you

149
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,839
ashamed?

150
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,560
Starting from this year,

151
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,160
Great Ning's imperial exams

152
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,838
will not consider the background

153
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,839
or gender.

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,759
Anyone with the will
can serve the country.

155
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,399
My decision is final.

156
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,000
Anyone who dares to oppose

157
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,759
will be severely punished.

158
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,359
I, Luo Wenxi,

159
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,838
thank you for Your Majesty's grace

160
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,439
on behalf of all women in this country.

161
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,680
Your Majesty,

162
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,000
why did you help me?

163
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,439
You want to know why?

164
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
That's right.

165
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,439
I

166
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,079
am indeed a woman.

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,879
You are now holding my biggest secret.

168
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,399
Anything you want to say?

169
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,799
I've offended Your Majesty.

170
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I am guilty.

171
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
You're not guilty.

172
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,720
I only know

173
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,119
since Your Majesty ascended,

174
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,518
you've fought the Imperial Advisor

175
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,240
and fought for the people's land.

176
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,078
And with the initiation
of women in imperial exams,

177
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,319
countless women are provided
with new livelihoods.

178
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,879
In my heart,

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,800
Your Majesty is a wise ruler.

180
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,838
I am willing to give my all
for Your Majesty

181
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,000
and assist with all my might.

182
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,519
When I first saw you,

183
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,959
it was like seeing myself.

184
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,600
I

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
am a woman.

186
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,720
But to survive,

187
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,759
I was forced to become a puppet emperor.

188
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,439
The hardships I endured

189
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,799
are beyond words.

190
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
What I admire most about you

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,439
is your courage

192
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,879
to do what you know is impossible.

193
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,639
You once said

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,240
that state pillars
are not divided by gender.

195
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
This

196
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,039
is also my long-cherished wish.

197
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Therefore,

198
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,399
by helping you today,

199
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,558
I was also helping myself.

200
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,480
I still need more people like you

201
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,399
to help me cleanse the corruption.

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,159
Together,

203
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,720
we can bring light back
to this chaotic world.

204
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,240
I will go all out

205
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,360
for this matter.

206
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,158
This is the mark of innovation,

207
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,679
the Bloom Order.

208
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,480
I hereby appoint you as a special envoy.

209
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,960
You shall secretly

210
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,720
and gradually

211
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,919
pass the secret order on my behalf.

212
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,840
From the nobles, officials,
generals, and soldiers

213
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
to peddlers, menial servants,

214
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,919
butchers, and farmers,

215
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,359
all who will obey this order

216
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,600
and side with me

217
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
are welcomed

218
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,439
by me with open arms

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
and sincere gratitude

220
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,279
to create a bright future
together with me.

221
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,159
Well done.

223
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,000
I heard it was quite a scene
in the court.

224
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
What are you thinking?

225
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,559
Last night, I led people
to Zhuo's Mansion to find Auntie.

226
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,519
We searched all over
but couldn't find her.

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,039
Only a chess set

228
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,639
was left in Auntie's room.

229
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,519
(Auntie)

230
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,960
(is playing a game
called mutual destruction.)

231
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,639
But she solved the endgame long ago.

232
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,518
It needs no mutual destruction,

233
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,519
but

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
sacrificing the pawn to save the queen.

235
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,080
Auntie is telling me

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
to give up on her.

237
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,559
Zhuo Shangxian is using her
as a survival bargaining chip.

238
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,039
She should be safe.

239
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Jinyi,

240
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,360
I am now worried...

241
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Naturally,

242
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
a coup.

243
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
That he will rebel.

244
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,759
The imperial city
has 20,000 Huting soldiers.

245
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,559
How can he rebel?

246
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,200
As a long-time operator,

247
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,000
he must have hidden strength.

248
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,679
Pass my word.

249
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,440
Lying in wait for countless days,

250
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,360
you shall rise for one command.

251
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,879
Yes.

252
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,399
If he truly has hidden forces,

253
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,240
he will surely act in these few days.

254
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,720
If they move,

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,759
the road they'll take
to the imperial city

256
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,480
is right here.

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,159
Zhuo Shangxian is cunning.

258
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,840
What if they are not an army

259
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,399
but 3,000 diehards
who can scatter and go stealthy?

260
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,359
Such a troop need not be kept
outside the city.

261
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,879
They can be in the city.

262
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,240
Or what if

263
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,519
they're right in the palace?

264
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,679
What if I place my chess piece here?

265
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,840
When is the best time for you to attack?

266
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,279
Where have you hidden Auntie?

267
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,678
Honey, if you do not act,

268
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,878
I will start to doubt

269
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,600
my assumptions.

270
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,679
What assumptions?

271
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,398
A storm is coming.

272
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,440
Tension fills the air.

273
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,279
Something big
must have happened outside.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,159
I guessed it myself.

275
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,439
You suddenly locked me in this dungeon.

276
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,839
If it weren't for something big,

277
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,079
why would you move me,

278
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,240
a life-saving piece?

279
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,159
With someone like you teaching him,

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,559
no wonder he grew up to be like this.

281
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,159
I find this endgame quite interesting.

282
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,199
Why don't you tell me

283
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
how to solve it?

284
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,240
Your wisdom doesn't lose to mine.

285
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,519
Anyway, there is nothing to do.

286
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,758
Why not continue playing chess

287
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,759
with me?

288
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,879
