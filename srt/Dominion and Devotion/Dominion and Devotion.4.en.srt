00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,399
Guards!

4
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,640
Did anyone come in or out last night?

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,119
Madam Li said His Majesty wished
to bathe and pray.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,439
So she called over ten maids to serve.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,159
Over ten?

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,559
How many people went in?

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,799
And how many people came out?

10
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,119
Eh...

11
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,239
His Majesty is missing.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,679
Seal gates. Search secretly.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,799
Now.

14
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,799
Yes.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,679
How's it going?

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,320
Master Pei,

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,758
the gates have all been sealed.

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,920
No trace of His Majesty.

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,479
Register of those who left the city?

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,159
The register.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,319
This incense calms the mind.

22
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,680
You can use it

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
before sleep.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,879
(The Soul-Chasing Incense)

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,719
(still came in handy.)

26
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,319
(It seems)

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,120
(you have already left the city.)

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,719
(Do you think in this world,)

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,359
(there is still a place for you?)

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,799
Auntie,

31
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,518
everything seems fine for now.

32
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,239
Let's take a rest.

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,239
Come on.

34
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,359
Have some water.

35
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,439
Water.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
We left the city at Mou hour.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
We've been moving for more than
half a day.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,639
I think they

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,718
don't know which way we went.

40
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,599
Let's rest a bit.

41
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,599
Okay.

42
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,520
What are you thinking?

43
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,680
Nothing.

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,759
It's been 20 years.

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
We finally escaped.

46
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,159
Even if it's a cage,

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,719
it was still the home we lived in
for 20 years.

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Auntie,

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
anywhere you're at is home.

50
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,000
When we get to Lingchuan Town,

51
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
I must try the thing you mentioned,

52
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,199
Yulu Bun.

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,639
Okay.

54
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:01,056
(Junlai Village)

55
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,600
When I caught this sheep,

56
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,959
a wolf tried to steal my prey.

57
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,639
I imitated a tiger's roar.

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,040
Roar, roar!

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,439
I actually scared the wolf away.

60
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,639
Not bad.

61
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,240
Hey,

62
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,518
that young man,

63
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,120
are you looking at me?

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Who are you?

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Why're you in our village?

66
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,560
Ladies,

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,279
I am just passing through.

68
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,959
It is almost dusk.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,480
Is there a place nearby to stay?

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,999
There are no inns near here.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
You can only stay in our village.

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,438
Can my aunt and I

73
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,559
stay in the village?

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
My aunt is right there.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Your aunt can stay, but you cannot.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,399
Our village
does not accommodate male guests.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
Wait a moment.

78
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,439
I am a woman.

79
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,199
I am back.

80
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,720
Is the meal ready?

81
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:31,839
I am starving.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Welcome home.

83
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,079
Brought strangers back again?

84
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,079
Zhang Guifen,

85
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,279
I've been waiting for long.

86
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,199
You, go inside.

87
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,399
I have something to do.

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Take it.

89
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,688
(Sun Daqiang, Broker)

90
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,839
Take it.

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't touch her!

92
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,360
What kind of man are you?

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,959
How can you bully a little girl?

94
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
You...

95
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,839
Come on.

96
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,399
It's time to eat.

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,040
Come.

98
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Hurry, hand these out.

99
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,639
Eat more.

100
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,639
Come on.

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,439
Wu,

102
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
eat while it's hot.

103
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,838
Here.

104
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,759
Thank you.

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,040
Is this the wild goat Guifen hunted
on the mountain?

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
She is the bravest,

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,399
running up the mountain
with a bow and arrows.

108
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,759
All you are capable.

109
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,720
You can carry
such heavy charcoal and bamboo.

110
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,359
Indeed.

111
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,999
Today is our day to go up the mountain.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,040
We're no weaker than men.

113
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,680
It might be a bit presumptuous,

114
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,000
but just now,

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,279
I seem to find no men in the village.

116
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,519
Junlai Village

117
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,519
has no men.

118
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,959
All the men were taken to serve
in the army.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,879
Almost all of them died out there.

120
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
The government even occupied our land.

121
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,078
It's our own land,

122
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,039
but we have to pay rent to use it.

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,878
They also raise the rent arbitrarily!

124
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,318
(Zhaodi, Villager)
We have never seen

125
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,079
anything so absurd.

126
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,120
She is talkative.

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,319
Don't blame her.

128
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Now, in our village,

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,439
only Tudou's land is left.

130
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,319
Although he's young,

131
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,959
he is the only male.

132
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,480
He is the young village head!

133
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,759
I am the village head.

134
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,439
Ladies.

135
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,959
Sun Daqiang agreed
to intercede with the Local Gentry.

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,600
Our land rent can be postponed
for a few days.

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,399
You are amazing.

138
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,560
Indeed.

139
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,959
I can not only hunt goats,

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,480
but also drives away hooligans.

141
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,040
Alright, stop joking.

142
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Hurry up and eat.

143
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:11,839
(Zhang Guifen, Villager)

144
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,879
Where did you come from?

145
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,560
Let me guess.

146
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,318
You were ditched by husbands,

147
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,758
and met on the road.

148
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,560
As aunt and niece,

149
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,600
you came to Widow Village
because we're famous.

150
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,920
We are

151
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,079
not.

152
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,480
We misunderstood.

153
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Come on. Eat.

154
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Eat more.

155
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,559
Have some meat.

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Okay.

157
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
(She is a woman!)

158
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,759
Fortunately, she is a woman.

159
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,039
Bear with it a bit.

160
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,879
It will heal faster this way.

161
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Rulan,

162
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,039
why is Junlai Village

163
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,799
called Widow Village?

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,759
This all happened a long time ago.

165
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:59,759
I was not originally from here.

166
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,159
I was a young woman who loved medicine.

167
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,799
My maternal family
arranged a marriage for me.

168
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:06,399
(Zhao Rulan, Villager)

169
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,839
However, practicing medicine

170
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,600
involved making a public appearance.

171
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,159
As a result, it brought a lot of gossip.

172
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,558
My husband blamed me for lacking virtue

173
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,799
and divorced me.

174
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,159
My maternal family

175
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,320
wouldn't accept me either.

176
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,240
With nowhere to turn,
I tried to drown myself.

177
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,399
It was Guifen who pulled me back.

178
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Be careful.

179
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,279
What is so bad?

180
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,840
(What is so bad?)

181
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
(Silly girl.)

182
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,480
(Got bullied?)

183
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,279
(I'll help you.)

184
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,240
(No place to go.)

185
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
(Come to my village.)

186
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,960
(If anyone hurt you again,)

187
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,519
(I'll make them pay!)

188
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,959
She brought me back to Junlai Village,

189
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,440
and encouraged me to keep practicing.

190
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,279
Here,

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
everyone treats me as a real doctor.

192
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,799
Somehow, this matter was spread out.

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,960
And there was that military recruitment.

194
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
The women from all around

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,840
came one after another seeking refuge,

196
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,879
gradually forming the Widow Village.

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,519
We accompany and rely on each other

198
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,600
to spend the rest of our lives.

199
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,519
It's really quite good.

200
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,000
When I get old,

201
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,879
maybe I'll have a chance to join you.

202
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,360
Wu,

203
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,960
it's time to get up.

204
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,960
Auntie,

205
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,159
let me sleep a little longer.

206
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,240
I know you were exhausted yesterday.

207
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,000
But it's nearly noon.

208
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,279
Get up and eat something first.

209
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,159
Help!

210
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,960
The officials are killing people!

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,320
Is there any law left?

212
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,879
Let go.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Let go of me!

214
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,919
I'll bite.

215
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Don't go.

216
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,639
Why are you taking her?

217
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,240
Sun Daqiang,

218
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,359
you took my money yesterday.

219
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,200
And now you changed?

220
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:04,279
Are you still a man?

221
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,360
This has nothing to do with land rent.

222
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,519
I just brought Master Hu over.

223
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,832
(Hu Quan, Local Gentry)

224
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,519
You took this cloth
to the market to sell, right?

225
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,719
We wove this cloth.

226
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Is there a problem?

227
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
What are you looking at?

228
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,919
You bad guy!

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Slap her!

230
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,440
You'll regret it!

231
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,119
I'll beat you up!

232
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,399
Don't!

233
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,679
Don't go over.

234
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,679
How dare you hurt me?

235
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,519
We didn't.

236
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,919
And you started it.

237
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,158
How could you break in

238
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,279
and arrest people at will?

239
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,399
Is there any law left?

240
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll tell you now.

241
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,159
Qinnan County has issued a new decree.

242
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,399
No market tickets,

243
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,960
no sales of cloth.

244
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,720
Throughout Qinnan,

245
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,840
only the Hu family can sell.

246
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,120
What you did

247
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,360
was disturbing the market.

248
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,119
Arresting you is right.

249
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,519
Now you tried to hurt me.

250
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,159
Your crime is increased.

251
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Take them away!

252
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Who is it?

253
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,879
It's the middle of the day.

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,039
It's the Buddha!

255
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,519
There really is a Buddha.

256
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,559
Could it be

257
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,119
something evil?

258
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,359
You've done all the bad things.

259
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,759
The heavens are watching.

260
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
Sir,

261
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,960
I think we should call it a day.

262
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,039
But the people of Junlai Village

263
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
illegally sell cloth.

264
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,679
We have to

265
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,919
make them pay for this!

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
I don't care if it's a God or a ghost.

267
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,840
It can't protect them forever!

268
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
