=Episode 24=

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,759
That's right.

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,719
I am a prince of the former dynasty.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,480
This is the longevity lock
passed down during the former reign.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,039
It is enough to prove my identity.

7
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,880
Pei Shenzhi,

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,159
release Your Majesty.

9
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,600
Pei Shenzhi,

10
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,279
you can't get away with it.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,479
Release His Majesty.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
I'm not going to run.

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,640
Ning Weishan usurped power

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,240
and slaughtered my family.

15
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,478
How could I not avenge

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,600
such a blood feud?

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Why?

18
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,480
Why?

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,239
Take Pei Shenzhi to the prison.

20
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,159
Wait for further orders.

21
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,719
Pei Shenzhi.

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,840
Why do you dare not look at me?

23
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,039
It's not that

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,840
I dare not look at you.

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Stop crying.

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,879
Why?

27
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,039
Because Zhuo Shangxian
killed too many people.

28
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,800
I worked for him

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
over the years.

30
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,639
People have long seen us as accomplices.

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,439
Whether his words are true or not,

32
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,639
the moment he spoke,

33
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,800
my fate

34
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,879
was determined.

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
You lied to me.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,680
No, I didn't.

37
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, you did.

38
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,719
You promised me

39
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,280
you'd hang in there.

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,039
Why did you change your mind in court?

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,400
What was the midwife trying to say?

42
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,680
Why did you kill her?

43
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,759
Pei Shenzhi.

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Look at me.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,439
I don't know what she wanted to say.

46
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Your Majesty,

47
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,759
I'm tired.

48
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,439
I don't want to persist any longer.

49
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,280
I've always hoped

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
to find a wise ruler

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
who cares for the world

52
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,879
and brings peace

53
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,639
to the people.

54
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm lucky

55
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:19,519
to have met you.

56
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,000
I have no regrets.

57
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,240
What about me?

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,839
What should I do?

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,639
I have been

60
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,959
pushed forward my entire life.

61
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,680
I was forced

62
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,680
to ascend the throne,

63
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,000
protect myself, and fight back.

64
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,438
But when I had expectations

65
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,439
and wanted to achieve something,

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I always ended up disappointed.

67
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,878
I want to protect Madam Li

68
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,879
and you.

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,079
But now, I have nothing and no one.

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Kill me.

71
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,000
It's time for Pei Shenzhi

72
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,079
to perish.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,399
Please grant my wish.

74
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,600
Pei Shenzhi.

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,480
This is the second time
you've given up on me.

Pei Shenzhi,
the remnant of the former dynasty,

77
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,639
colluded with Zhuo Shangxian

78

to murder late emperor

79
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,120

149
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,720
have you heard about the rumors?

150
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,719
Rumors are saying

that Your Majesty is actually a woman.

152
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,440
They speak so seriously.

153
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,799
Master Zhou,

154
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,879
women can serve as ministers now.

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,240
Why can't one sit on the throne?

156
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,639
It might be inappropriate if His Majesty

157
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,559
hears what you say.

158
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,279

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000

Master Zheng,

161
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,320
aren't you a bit talkative today?

162
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,799

163
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,159

164
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,319

166
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,600
Your Majesty is a woman.

167
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,879
This is ridiculous.

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,080
