=Episode 2=

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,679
Master.

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,399
Why are we still not
mobilizing the troops?

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,399
Don't be so impulsive.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,160
We need

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
to plan carefully.

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,239
Master.

9
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,759
Master, why didn't you take action?

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,399
What you intend
is what the people desire.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,199
The Huting Army is scattered.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,559
It's our rare chance to sever ties
with Zhuo Shangxian.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,798
Everyone in the Shenxing Camp

14
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,560
is ready to die for the great cause.

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,399
Honestly,

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,159
I'm very disappointed with your choice.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,280
Ze.

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,599
Do you know how many people died
in this suppression?

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,279
1,631 people.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,319
It was 4,368 people.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,760
No one cares about these numbers.

22
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,438
The so-called troops and rebels

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
are just numbers in the history books
written by the winners.

24
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,159
The late emperor of Great Ning
has killed countless people

25
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,280
ever since he established the empire.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,159
Ze.

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,959
I have killed many people.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,598
I've killed those who resented me

29
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,760
and tried to stop me,
along with innocent people.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,959
I'm long tired of killing.

31
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,120
Pass on my word.

32
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,878
The Yilin Army is temporarily

33
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,640
stationed at the north of the city.

34
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,799
Yes.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,840
The palace is such a treacherous place.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
Let's see if you can survive this

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
as an insignificant weed.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
I wonder

39
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,479
whether you will bloom into a flower

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,599
or bear bitter fruit.

41
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:44,832
(Pei Shenzhi, Junior Eunuch)

42
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,776
(Liu Fangtong, Junior Eunuch)

43
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,319
Master Pei.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
It's time for the enthronement.

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
I see.

46
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:12,080
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,984
It's time for the court meeting.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm aware of that.

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,919
Your Majesty.

50
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,079
Let me assist you with dressing.

51
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
No need.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes.

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,918
Auntie is still ill.

54
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,120
Am I binding it well?

55
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,960
Forget it. Let's get through
the court meeting first.

56
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,319
The new emperor ascends the throne.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
Let's wait and see.

58
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,239
As the Emperor of the Great Ning,

59
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,360
I announce to Heaven and Earth
that I shall ascend the throne today.

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,040
Entrusted to rule the empire
by the late emperor,

61
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,319
I will strive
to bring about good governance

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,519
by adopting reforms.

63
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,398
I shall do my best
to ensure peace, tranquility,

64
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,878
and the people's well-being

65
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,559
to grant the Great Ning

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
everlasting prosperity.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,559
The other princes

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,078
(Imperial Edict)
shall immediately set out to the fief

69
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,878
and not return without permission.

70
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,879
In need of benevolent and wise advisors,

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,904
(Zhuo Shangxian, G rand Secretariat)
I appoint Zhuo Shangxian

72
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,999
(of the Inner Court, Imperial Advisor)
to Imperial Advisor

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,318
(Pei Shenzhi, Directorate-Supervising Eunuch)
and Pei Shenzhi to Seal-Holding Eunuch

74
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,680
(Grand Secretariat of the Inner Court)
to assist me in handling daily affairs.

75
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,480
Respect this.

76
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:11,078
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

77
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
Rise.

78
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,919
The Imperial Advisor's loyalty
is commendable.

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,239
I hereby make an exception

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,359
and set up a seat for him
beside the throne

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,638
to demonstrate his significance.

82
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,999
This is inappropriate.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,239
This is way too unconventional.

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,838
Be quiet.

85
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,679
He's in charge of the Huting Army

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
and can kill anyone at will.

87
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,079
Your Majesty.

88
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,480
The officials have not yet
congratulated Master Zhuo.

89
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,720
My ministers, congratulate
the Imperial Advisor accordingly.

90
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,432
- Congratulations, Master Zhuo.
- Congratulations, Master Zhuo.

91
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,935
(Zheng Wuyou, Minister of Justice)
Congratulations, Master Zhuo.

92
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:11,136
(Gu Xingzhi, Yilin Army Adjutant)
Congratulations, Master Zhuo.

93
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,352
(He Yanbai, Head of Imperial Censors)
Congratulations, Master Zhuo.

94
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,679
As the Head of Imperial Censors,

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,800
I, He Yanbai, refuse to kneel.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,759
Why won't you kneel?

97
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,680
Why should I kneel
to someone about to die?

98
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,959
None of the eunuchs who intervened

99
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,680
in court affairs met good ends
throughout history.

100
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,318
You ministers

101
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,279
chose to kneel to such a eunuch.

102
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,078
What a huge disgrace.

103
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,878
Everyone in the world
will look down on you.

104
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,719
I, He Yanbai,

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,160
will not kneel.

106
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,839
Master He,
your courage is truly admirable.

107
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,199
My position as Imperial Advisor
was conferred by His Majesty.

108
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,638
By refusing to kneel,

109
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
you're showing contempt and disrespect

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
for His Majesty.

111
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,040
Are you not afraid of death?

112
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,120
Everyone will die eventually.

113
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,839
Some deaths are significant,

114
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,879
while some deaths bear no value.

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,878
If I were killed
for not kneeling to a eunuch,

116
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,719
then I would die for a just cause.

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,519
I'm more than happy to die.

118
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,079
If you're a wise ruler,

119
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,679
you should expel these eunuchs
who take over the court

120
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,040
and cause disturbances

121
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
and do them justice by killing them.

122
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,959
Your Majesty,

123
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,399
he harbors evil intentions

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,519
by implying
that you're not a wise ruler.

125
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,560
He should be executed right away

126
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,319
as a warning to others.

127
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,439
Your Majesty.

128
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,199
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,639
Please think twice.

130
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,679
My mentor is deeply concerned

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,199
and dares not disrespect you.

132
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,600
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

133
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,360
You, a mere Hanlin Academy editor,

134
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,879
have no authority to speak here.

135
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,160
(Huo Zheng, Hanlin Academy editor)
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,600
Please show mercy.

137
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Spare Master He.

138
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,759
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Huo Zheng,

140
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
step back.

141
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,079
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

142
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,559
Your Majesty, please take into account

143
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,879
his contribution to the empire

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,240
and spare his life.

145
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:40,416
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,320
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

147
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,399
Why do I feel

148
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,159
that you've fallen into a trap?

149
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,079
Master He is a great scholar,

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,799
known throughout the nation.

151
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,079
If he were killed

152
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,279
for his righteous advice,

153
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,480
I fear that all the scholars

154
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,120
would blame it on you and attack you.

155
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,918
If you're taken down

156
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,840
as the Imperial Advisor,

157
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,960
then I can't remain as the emperor.

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,279
Isn't this exactly what he wanted?

159
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,279
Guards!

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,239
Take He Yanbai away.

161
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,720
Administer ten hard blows.

162
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,279
He shall be removed
from his position as Censor.

163
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,679
Master He.

164
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,159
From now on,

165
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
retire to your hometown.

166
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,919
Thank you, Your Majesty.

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
What do you think, Master Zhuo?

168
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
Is it an appropriate

169
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
approach?

170
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,158
Your Majesty has given the order.

171
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,679
Why bother asking my opinion?

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I hereby

173
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,360
bid farewell to Your Majesty.

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,239
I'll buy a tawny ox
to learn to sow and reap.

175
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,038
Thatch a humble hut
where woods and springs abide.

176
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,359
Knowing life's last years are few,
I'll simply keep.

177
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
To these mountain days
before my time has died.

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,959
He Yanbai is such a hardheaded fool.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,919
So stubborn.

180
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,319
We can't keep him around.

181
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,799
So annoying.

182
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,919
I totally agree.

183
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,639
Now,

184
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,759
it's time to meet our emperor.

185
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,240
The Imperial Advisor has arrived.

186
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,840
What brings you here,

187
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,159
Imperial Advisor?

188
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,000
You knew I wanted He Yanbai dead.

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,038
How dare you go against my will?

190
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,840
Master Zhuo.

191
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:22,999
I spoke sincerely in the court.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Moreover,

193
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,999
how does it do me good

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to go against you?

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,799
You think I dare not kill you
just because you became the emperor?

196
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
There is no such thing.

197
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
Master Zhuo.

198
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
He is still useful to us.

199
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,080
Of course, I know that.

200
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,239
But I have to show him

201
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,959
who is truly in charge

202
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,279
in this palace.

203
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,919
Master Zhuo.

204
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,600
I've learned the lesson.

205
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
You picked him.

206
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,799
Train him well.

207
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Yes.

208
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,000
To deceive others, one must

209
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,240
deceive himself first.

210
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,599
If you show your claws and fangs,

211
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,320
aren't you telling others

212
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,399
that you are not a docile house cat

213
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,000
but a ferocious beast?

214
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,918
Master Pei,

215
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,559
is it a reminder

216
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,240
or a warning?

217
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:16,704
You shouldn't have saved He Yanbai.

218
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
I know I shouldn't have.

219
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,200
However,

220
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,159
we can't do everything

221
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,039
by weighing the pros and cons.

222
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Am I not right?

223
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,840
Fortunately,
it's just some physical pain.

224
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,360
It's worth it.

225
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,179
All right.

226
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,279
If I hadn't saved you,

227
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,200
you would have been strangled

228
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,440
by Master Zhuo.

229
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,320
You and your father are both eunuchs.

230
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,679
You would certainly
need a puppet emperor.

231
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,440
Now it's just me and the Third Prince.

232
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,759
If you kill me

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
on the day of ascension,

234
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,959
even if you hide the truth flawlessly,

235
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,759
I think

236
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,600
my third brother won't dare take over.

237
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
So

238
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,360
you can't kill me just yet.

239
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,679
You were not really

240
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,519
pleading for me, Master Pei.

241
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,759
I'd say that

242
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,840
you were offering Master Zhuo
a way out of this situation.

243
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,840
Your Majesty.

244
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,360
