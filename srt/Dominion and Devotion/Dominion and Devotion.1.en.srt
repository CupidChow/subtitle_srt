1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,560
Master Pei.

2
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,319
His Majesty has issued so many decrees.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,600
You're finally back.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
How is His Majesty?

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,480
The physicians said
he wouldn't hold out any longer.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,559
The noble consort and the others
are awaiting permission to see him.

7
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,856
(Pei Shenzhi,
Directorate-Supervising Eunuch)

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,959
By your decree, I headed south
to exterminate

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
the rebels.

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,520
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,399
I've fulfilled the mission.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,799
Shenzhi.

13
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,280
You're finally back.
I have been waiting for you.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,879
The medicine has gone cold.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,719
Is this how you serve His Majesty?

16
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:09,959
Get out.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,040
Yes.

18
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,879
Now that you're back,

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,079
(Ning Weishan, Emperor of Ning)
I finally

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,439
feel reassured enough
to issue the decree of succession.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,439
Pass on

22
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,000
my decree.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,279
I assumed the throne

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,999
(Imperial Edict)
by the mandate of Heaven.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,839
Due to my severe illness,
I shall select a capable successor.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,039
The Crown Prince is benevolent, filial,
and wise, possessing inherent virtue.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,359
Therefore, I shall pass the throne
to the Crown Prince.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,279
The Crown Prince is morally unfit

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,759
to be my successor

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,119
and shall be deposed from his position.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,079
Shenzhi, you...

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Write it down.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Yes.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,159
You...

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
You...

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,199
Do you still remember the massacre

38
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,000
in the imperial palace 20 years ago?

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
Who are you?

40
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:40,800
(Twenty years ago, Former Reign, Xia)

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,279
By His Majesty's decree,

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,239
the enthronement
will take place tomorrow.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,120
All the remnants of the former reign
shall be exterminated.

44
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,839
The deposed empress can't run far

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,279
with her newborn child. Find them!

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,240
Yes.

47
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,319
(Lyu Fengning, Empress of Xia)
Check over there.

48
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,960
Hurry up.

49
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,199
This way.

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,520
My child, don't cry.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
Why is there a baby crying?

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Split up.

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Search.

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,840
Don't leave anyone alive.

55
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,319
Over there. Get her.

56
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:44,256
(Zhuo Shangxian, Eunuch of Xia)

57
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,799
Zhuo Shangxian.

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,080
You've submitted to His Majesty.

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,560
So why are you protecting
the deposed empress?

60
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,639
By His Majesty's decree,

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,839
all the remnants are to be executed.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
How dare you defy him?

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
I defied him?

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,879
Who saw it?

65
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,720
Your Majesty.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,240
Shangxian.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,199
I don't blame you
for submitting to another master.

68
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,959
But I hope you can spare this child,
considering that I once

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,720
saved your life.

70
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Fengning.

71
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,759
Who are you really?

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,198
The person

73
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,000
you killed on the throne back then

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,120
was Father.

75
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
You...

76
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,839
Traitor...

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,399
You seized this empire

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,680
and started on the wrong foot.

79
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,040
Now, this empire is in chaos.

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,319
What a joke.

81
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,959
Spare my life, Master.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,518
I saw nothing.

83
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,318
I will write whatever you tell me

84
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,399
to write.

85
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,519
What a loyal scribe.

86
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,680
(Now,)

87
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,359
(who can rule this empire?)

88
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
(Imperial Edict)
(Who deserves to rule this empire?)

89
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,047
(Ning)

90
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:30,528
(Ning Jinyi, Fifth Prince)

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,160
(Could it be...)

92
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,176
=Dominion and Devotion=

93
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,416
=Episode 1=

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Foster father.

95
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,040
The Crown Prince knows
he lacks talent and virtue

96
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,680
and has voluntarily left the palace.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,879
Have you obtained the will?

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Yes.

99
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,120
No successor has been appointed.

100
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:09,184
(Zhuo Shangxian, Seal-Holding Eunuch)

101
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,040
What are your plans?

102
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
With all the turmoil
in the Imperial Court,

103
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,920
we naturally need to select
a new emperor to restore order.

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,479
Pass down the order.

105
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,759
Summon all princes to the main hall
to await the decree.

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,600
I thought you would

107
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,639
appoint me as the emperor.

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,639
Shenzhi.

109
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,920
As a prince of the former reign,

110
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,679
you will surely cause unrest

111
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,600
by rushing to proclaim yourself emperor.

112
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,279
Of course, I know that.

113
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,720
Everyone knows that I am a eunuch.

114
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,600
Naturally, I can't take the throne.

115
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,759
It's just that

116
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,759
I can't help
but feel somewhat disappointed.

117
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,160
I know you've been upset.

118
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,279
How about

119
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,600
you handpick the new emperor?

120
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Will this

121
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,199
alleviate your distress?

122
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,040
Sounds good.

123
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,560
Wait.

124
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Now that the rebels in the north
have been wiped out,

125
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,039
have you forgotten to return
the tally of the Yilin Army?

126
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,399
I was summoned back urgently.

127
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,559
The rebel remnants
are still lurking around.

128
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
I will definitely return the tally

129
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,519
once I get rid of the rebels.

130
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,519
Traitorous child.

131
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,440
So annoying.

132
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,882
(Li Jingxian, Chief Palace Maid)

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Auntie.

134
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,679
Why did you get up?

135
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,840
I just caught a cold.

136
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,159
I can't stay in bed

137
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,720
while thinking about this game.

138
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,919
I'll play against you.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All right.

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,960
You said you'd pay respects
to His Majesty with the other princes.

141
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,879
Why did you come back so early?

142
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,679
Father is gravely ill.

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,919
The ladies and I were kept outside.

144
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,559
But

145
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,840
things were somewhat strange.

146
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,399
I didn't see a single guard

147
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,398
on my way back.

148
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
But the main halls in the palace
were heavily guarded.

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,320
I suspect...

150
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,399
What do you suspect?

151
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,919
I suspect

152
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,720
that Father has already passed away.

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
Your Highness.

154
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,639
Have you told anyone else about this?

155
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
I wouldn't do that.

156
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:09,360
I remember your teachings.

157
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,878
Always be cautious.

158
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,200
Do not attract attention.

159
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,159
We've been hiding the fact

160
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,120
that you're a girl for about 20 years.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,559
We finally have a chance to escape.

162
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,960
Once we are out,
we will no longer have to live in fear.

163
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,600
I'll get a physician.

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,759
- What's going on?
- Take him.

165
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
Auntie.

166
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,519
Wu.

167
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Auntie.

168
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,159
Shenxing Camp of Yilin Army

169
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,518
can reach the east
of the capital in four hours

170
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,840
for a surprise attack
on Zhuo Shangxian's Huting Army.

171
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,159
(Zhao Ze,
Deputy General of Shenxing Camp)

172
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,336
Shush.

173
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,399
Master Pei.
The princes will arrive shortly.

174
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,039
Please wait in the conference hall.

175
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,199
How much longer do we have to wait?

176
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,159
Pei Shenzhi.

177
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,039
Why did you call us here?

178
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,480
His Majesty passed away.

179
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,878
The Crown Prince

180
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,559
was incompetent and left voluntarily.

181
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,559
Nonsense.

182
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,960
(Father passed away?)

183
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,399
The Crown Prince left?

184
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,720
His Majesty said

185
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,638
that the empire needed a ruler

186
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,719
and commanded me

187
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,599
to select a wise sovereign

188
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
among the princes.

189
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,919
How dare you eunuch

190
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,039
assess the royal descendants?

191
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,638
Seeing the imperial seal
is like seeing His Majesty.

192
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,679
Speak cautiously.

193
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,840
His Majesty
established himself through war.

194
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,720
Therefore,

195
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:06,879
the way to get this seal is simple.

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,159
(Why am I feeling so hot?)

197
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
It seems that you are all quite modest.

198
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,080
But this seal can't remain ownerless.

199
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,439
I shall not fail the task

200
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,399
and let His Majesty down.

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
In that case,

202
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,559
why don't we let

203
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,240
the Third Prince inherit the throne?

204
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,559
(Oh no.)

205
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
What... what are you doing?

206
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
(If they make a move
against Third Brother,)

207
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,240
(then they might just kill me as well.)

208
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,480
(I was hoping
to leave the palace with Auntie.)

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,759
Fourth Brother.

210
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,759
You're the best martial artist among us.

211
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,319
But based on seniority,

212
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,080
our Second Brother

213
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,000
should be the one to inherit the throne.

214
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,278
Third Brother and I don't even

215
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,360
qualify as candidates.

216
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Why don't you

217
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,519
talk it over?

218
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,519
We are brothers.

219
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,759
Let's not fight each other.

220
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,519
Fifth Brother is right.

221
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,240
Second Brother.

222
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,879
I support you in inheriting the throne.

223
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
That's my brother.

224
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,559
Ask my sword if it agrees.

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,759
Second Brother, be careful.

226
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,039
How dare you block me?

227
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,864
You overestimate yourself!

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,279
You rascal.

229
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,519
Father?

230
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,720
Father?

231
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,919
You bear evil intentions

232
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,919
and have lost all conscience.

233
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,799
How dare you kill your own brothers?

234
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,759
I will kill anyone

235
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
who dares to stop me
from ascending the throne.

236
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,440
Including you.

237
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
I will kill you all.

238
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,639
Die!

239
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,279
Die!

240
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,878
(He noticed the Mind-Clouding Incense.)

241
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,039
(The Fifth Prince
seems a bit more interesting.)

242
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,240
Are you crazy?

243
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,799
Crazy?

244
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,080
My longing for the throne
has driven me crazy.

245
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,159
They can fight for it.

246
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,600
Why can't I?

247
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,799
Fifth Brother.

248
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,039
You are so naive.

249
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,240
You really think he'd
let us inherit the throne?

250
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,639
Master Pei.

251
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,479
Father entrusted
the imperial seal to you.

252
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,199
If the seal is damaged,

253
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,360
how are you going to

254
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,120
appease all the court officials?

255
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,759
What are you suggesting, Fifth Prince?

256
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,639
I don't want to take the throne.

257
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
Just let me leave the palace

258
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
with my auntie.

259
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,759
As long as you let us leave,

260
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,519
we will never come back.

261
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,759
What I hate most

262
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,440
is such heart-warming
mutual dependency in the palace.

263
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,759
How about this?

264
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,639
Since you want to leave,

265
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
kill your auntie.

266
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,279
I'll let you go.

267
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,960
Or

268
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,879
I'll kill you

269
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,240
and let her go.

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,759

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,360
I choose neither?
