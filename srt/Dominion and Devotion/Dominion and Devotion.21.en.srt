00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,879
Put out the candle.

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,200
Quick.

5
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,718
Capture the Emperor alive.

6
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,719
(Yes!)

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,719
Help!

8
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Don't let any get away.

9
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Yes.

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

11
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,959
Don't kill me.

12
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,599
Fake?

13
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,719
Don't kill me.

14
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
What if I place my chess piece here?

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,640
Empty city strategy.

16
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,120
Surround them.

17
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,199
Yilin Army.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,400
You rebellious scoundrel!

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,439
Breaking in here?

20
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,879
Surrender now!

21
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,599
(Will it work?)

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,520
Report!

23
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,680
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,280
it worked!

25
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,080
Zhuo Shangxian's diehards were all dead.

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,919
Give the order.

27
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,680
Break camp

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,319
to box them in.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Got it.

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,039
Master,

31
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,039
the weather is changing.

32
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,479
Change to what?

33
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,800
Any change will benefit me.

34
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,519
Trouble! There's an ambush
in the imperial city.

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,960
Our men can't hold out much longer.

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
The Emperor hasn't sent the troop.

37
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,000
That shows he's cautious
because I've got Jingxian.

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,639
Doesn't dare act rashly.

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,919
Bad news,

40
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,759
Master!

41
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,000
The Yilin army outside is

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,360
heading for the imperial city.

43
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,439
What?

44
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,718
We still control the city gate.

45
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,719
So we can still get out.

46
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,239
Once the Yilin Army's here,

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
we're totally trapped.

48
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,280
(Don't you care about her at all?)

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,599
Husband.

50
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,879
You two put on such a show
of being motherly and loving.

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,319
I thought you were super close.

52
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,759
Turns out,

53
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,400
it was all an act.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
Looks like Your Majesty

55
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,080
hit you hard, huh?

56
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,080
All these years,

57
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,479
you've just been raising a viper.

58
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,400
If he cared about you at all,

59
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,199
he wouldn't be going

60
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,800
for the kill right now.

61
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,080
In his eyes,

62
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,039
the empire is everything.

63
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,679
My life

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
means nothing.

65
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,599
You are acting all righteous.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,480
I bet

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
if I stuck the knife into you,

68
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,719
ripped you open,

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,959
and gutted you,

70
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
you wouldn't be so tough.

71
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,040
Because I found out

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,439
your secret.

73
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,079
Turns out Pei Shenzhi

74
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,199
is the son of the former Empress.

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
I knew I was right.

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,160
You're unworthy to mention her.

77
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,078
I wondered where you, a eunuch,

78
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,439
even got a son.

79
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,759
Asking for a death?

80
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,480
Go ahead.

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,920
Just couldn't do it,

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
huh?

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,560
Think you can get me to kill you?

84
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,639
Keep dreaming.

85
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,399
Hurry up!

86
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,879
Turns out I've been hidden
under the stables of Zhuo's Mansion.

87
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:30,880
Husband,

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,398
you've got major trust issues.

89
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,600
Don't believe anyone.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,639
Shut up.

91
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Master.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,439
Master,

93
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,639
we must leave now.

94
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:47,424
(Chensha Bridge)

95
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,800
Chensha Bridge is the only way
out of the city.

96
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,560
We've been waiting for you.

97
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,518
If you've stashed Jingxian

98
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,519
outside the city,

99
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,759
there might've been

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
a sliver of hope today.

101
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Too bad.

102
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,959
You're cornered.

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,399
No way out.

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,318
I don't trust sayings much.

105
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,878
But there's one I believe.

106
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,319
Do you know it?

107
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,560
There's always a way out.

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,720
People can

109
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,120
change their own destiny.

110
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,959
Go around it.

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,959
Giddyap!

112
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,240
Giddyap!

113
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,560
Whoa!

114
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,119
You lost.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Just give up.

116
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,319
Maybe I'll let you live.

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,079
Today, I'll see

118
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,040
if you care more about that throne

119
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,600
or about your Auntie.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
These days,

121
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,319
I've been doing some thinking.

122
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,240
A competent emperor has to be ruthless.

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,959
Some things have to be sacrificed.

124
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,879
After all,

125
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,319
nothing's more captivating than power,

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,720
right?

127
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,759
Your Majesty.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,638
Letting him go is asking for trouble.

129
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,040
Kill him.

130
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,240
So your deep affection for me

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
was all an act.

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,480
Someone like you

133
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,519
even expects to be loved?

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,639
How ridiculous.

135
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,559
We two are really a perfect match.

136
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,799
Your Majesty!

137
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,039
Why wait?

138
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,399
Madam Li.

139
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,879
I promise a proper burial.

140
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,679
Don't...

141
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Auntie.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I was so scared.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,759
I thought I'd never see you again.

144
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,759
Auntie.

145
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,679
Let's go back.

146
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,679
I've got a ton to tell you.

147
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,919
Auntie!

148
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,399
So, are you happy
with the Seven-Day Agony Powder?

149
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
She's mine,

150
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,360
both now and forever.

151
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,480
Betray me, and you're as good as dead.

152
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,558
Even if you beat me,

153
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,360
I'll make you wish you were dead.

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
And you,

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Pei Shenzhi.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Did you forget

157
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,240
you're a prince of the former dynasty?

158
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Listen up, everyone.

159
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,559
I personally took Master Pei

160
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,240
straight from the former Empress.

161
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,199
I raised him!

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,399
I even

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,638
taught him how to disguise himself
as a eunuch and infiltrate the palace.

164
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,600
All so he could one day

165
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,799
snatch the throne.

166
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,039
The Emperor right in front of you

167
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,080
knows all about this.

168
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,240
He's even in on it with us!

169
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Stop!

170
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,159
What?

171
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,000
Want to kill your foster father?

172
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,000
That's complete nonsense!

173
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Guards.

174
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,320
Take Zhuo Shangxian into custody.

175
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,239
We'll question him first.

176
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Go!

177
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,240
Your Majesty.

178
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,720
Take me back to the palace.

179
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,399
I want to go home.

180
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,320
Okay.

181
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,878
Auntie, hang in there.

182
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,879
The physician is coming.

183
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,399
I know.

184
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,039
Look at you.

185
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,279
Still crying like when you were a kid.

186
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,320
How did such a tiny thing

187
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,919
get

188
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,720
so tall?

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Auntie,

190
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,320
we won.

191
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,399
We will have the good life.

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,759
You can't leave.

193
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
I won't let you.

194
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
What's taking the physician so long?

195
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Go check it yourself,

196
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,519
will you?

197
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,559
I'm not going.

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,399
Just go.

199
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,360
Please.

200
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,480
Go.

201
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,679
I'll be right here waiting for you.

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,039
Alright.

203
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,840
Take good care of Auntie.

204
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,559
I'll call her back.

205
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,600
Where does this come from?

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,919
Y-You are

207
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,039
a prince of the previous dynasty?

208
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,639
Yes.

209
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,320
I am.

210
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,519
Y-You are

211
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,319
a prince of the previous dynasty.

212
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,399
I never intended to harm her.

213
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,919
Only if you are,

214
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,479
will

215
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
she

216
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
be able to

217
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,159
survive...

218
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,159
What did you say?

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
K...

220
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Kid.

221
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,120
