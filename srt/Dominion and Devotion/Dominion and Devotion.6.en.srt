00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
Master Pei,

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,000
will you spare my life?

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,239
I have changed my mind.

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,800
I can keep your secret of being a woman.

7
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,239
Moreover,

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,279
a female emperor

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,640
is unprecedented.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,560
A female emperor?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,840
The world is vast.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,359
Who says a woman can't be emperor?

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,799
For emperors,

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,039
there are only bad and good ones.

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,479
It depends on which path

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,359
Your Majesty decides to take.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,280
Before going back,

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,280
I would like to ask you for a person.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,519
Whoever Your Majesty wants,

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I will give them to you.

21
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,359
Thank you, Master Pei.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm helping you

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
for my own purposes.

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,079
Even if you have other purposes,

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,879
I still want to thank you

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,680
for sparing me and Auntie's lives

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,000
and for giving me

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,599
a viable option.

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I want

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,040
to give it a try.

31
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,439
Let's go.

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,680
Walking with a limp harms

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
the imperial dignity.

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,359
Get on.

35
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,599
I'll carry you.

36
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,400
No need.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,879
I can walk by myself.

38
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,319
Use this as a support.

39
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,680
You look terrible.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
Walking in front of me,

41
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,000
aren't you afraid I'll stab you?

42
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,439
Don't overestimate yourself.

43
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,319
With your skills,

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,879
I can beat you with only one hand.

45
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,719
Master Pei,

46
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,680
our horses?

47
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,240
No horses.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,879
I thought we should hurry back.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Speak.

50
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,759
Master Zhuo,

51
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,560
I was scared by the sudden change
in the palace a few days ago,

52
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,318
so I sneaked out to relax.

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I accept the punishment.

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,719
Just to relax outside the palace?

55
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,879
Yes.

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,199
You're a scoundrel too!

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,438
They sneaked out of the palace.

58
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,918
You not only didn't stop them

59
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,719
but also helped them deceive me,

60
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,800
allowing him to make a big splash
in Qinnan County.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,318
It's just a coincidence.

62
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,280
If you're really upset,

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
just kill him.

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Spare me, Master Zhuo.

65
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,080
I won't dare again.

66
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,279
I encouraged His Majesty

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,319
to leave the palace.

68
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,439
Punish me if you must, Master Zhuo.

69
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,120
Raise your head and speak.

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,400
Master Zhuo, the truth is,

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,199
a few days ago,

72
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,520
I saw His Majesty
feeling depressed in the palace.

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,878
So I took him
out of the palace for relaxation.

74
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,879
(Her visage)

75
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,599
All of this...

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,158
(somehow resembles hers...)

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,280
is all my fault.

78
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,199
Master Zhuo,

79
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,360
please don't blame His Majesty.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,319
You do have some nerve.

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
She was coerced by me.

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,719
Please have mercy.

83
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,280
What a touching scene
of master-servant loyalty!

84
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,719
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

85
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Kill him

86
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,839
and let me be emperor.

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
How about that?

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Nonsense.

89
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,879
You really wish for chaos in the world.

90
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Forget it.

91
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,000
For Shenzhi's sake,

92
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,039
I'll not pursue this matter further.

93
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,599
But Your Majesty must be punished

94
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
for absurd deeds.

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,318
You're confined for five days.

96
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,519
No visitors allowed.

97
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,600
Master Pei.

98
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,439
Master Pei,

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,759
you're injured.

100
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,680
So I took him
out of the palace for relaxation.

101
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,240
(Fengning?)

102
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:04,288
(Fengning)

103
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,160
(We are either widows
or abandoned women.)

104
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,319
Junlai Village.

105
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,319
(Accompanying and relying on each other)

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,879
(to spend the rest of our lives)

107
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,839
(is pretty good.)

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
(We won't even
get to keep Tudou's field.)

109
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,680
(I'll fight with you.)

110
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,279
(But we still)

111
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,319
(have to get by.)

112
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,279
(Am I right?)

113
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,439
Who is it?

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
It's me.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come in.

116
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,959
Yes.

117
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Master Pei,

118
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,759
you look different today.

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Eat.

120
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,319
No one will know.

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Slow down.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,519
You have no imperial demeanor at all.

123
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,559
The medicine in the water
will soothe your pain.

124
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,599
I got it from the Imperial Hospital.

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,399
It helps in wound recovery.

126
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
What are you waiting for?

127
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,040
Do you want me to help you?

128
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Thank you, Master Pei.

129
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,318
I just don't want you to be lame.

130
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,720
It'd harm the nation's prestige.

131
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,440
Master Pei,

132
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,039
I have a question for you.

133
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,919
What?

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,080
Due to
the household registration policies,

135
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,720
fields can only be inherited by males,

136
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,840
leading to the women of Junlai Village
having no land to farm.

137
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,519
In your view,

138
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,080
can women

139
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,039
have their own lands?

140
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Does Your Majesty want
to issue a new policy?

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,279
Yes.

142
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,799
Issuing a new policy is not difficult.

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,279
The difficult part

144
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,039
is to change the prejudice
of the people.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,039
Prejudice exists

146
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,000
because people have no chance

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,799
or intention to understand.

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,798
For example, everyone says
you're decisive in killing

149
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,279
and cold-hearted.

150
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,080
But in my heart,

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,559
you're careful and gentle

152
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,960
and act with your own laws.

153
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,479
Underneath your seemingly cold exterior

154
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
lies a burning heart of innocence.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,399
Your Majesty
should not easily trust people.

156
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,918
I am merely a puppet emperor
without any foundation.

157
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,839
Your being willing to look
after Auntie and me at this time

158
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,599
is a godsend.

159
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,159
To me,

160
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,279
you're not just anybody.

161
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,399
You're someone trustworthy.

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Your Majesty,

163
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,840
are you winning me over?

164
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,879
Yes.

165
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,759
I'm sincere.

166
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,320
Then let's see
how sincere Your Majesty is.

167
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
Master Pei,

168
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,159
what kind of sincerity do you want?

169
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,278
Your Majesty

170
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,559
cannot give me what I want now.

171
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,919
Your Majesty,

172
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,559
rest early.

173
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,519
(Waiting quietly)

174
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,559
(for a tree to bloom)

175
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,039
(and the seeds)

176
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
(to be blown off.)

177
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,279
Father,

178
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
seedlings are fragile.

179
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,960
It's better not to touch them.

180
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,879
This scene

181
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,559
reminds me of a young eunuch
from a long time ago.

182
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,000
He also liked to play with plants.

183
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,159
We eunuchs

184
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,960
have damaged bodies.

185
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,159
And we tend

186
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,879
to have unpleasant smells on us.

187
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,399
His planting plants

188
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,559
actually seemed like
a vain attempt to conceal the smells.

189
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,559
In the blink of an eye,

190
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,600
he has been dead
for seven or eight years.

191
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,320
Why do you suddenly bring him up?

192
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,960
Are you still hating me for killing him?

193
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
(Of course I hate you.)

194
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,559
(I hate your cruelty.)

195
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,399
The first person you made me kill
was my best friend.

196
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,279
But I'm

197
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,919
in the same boat with you.

198
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,759
What's the point

199
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
to hate or not to hate?

200
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,120
I just have to stay by your side

201
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,559
and ensure this boat doesn't sink.

202
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,840
It's good

203
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,480
that you can think this way.

204
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,199
After all, you've been fighting battles
for the past two years.

205
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,079
I couldn't help but worry

206
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,759
that our hearts

207
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,879
are apart

208
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,679
and our bond fades.

209
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,039
How could it be?

210
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,879
I will never forget

211
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,039
your grace of raising me.

212
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,960
That's good.

213
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,278
By the way,

214
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,639
that young emperor is really annoying.

215
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,960
The current situation is unstable.

216
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,799
You must keep a close eye on him.

217
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,799
Yes.

218
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Madam Li.

219
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,720
Master Pei.

220
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,679
Is there something you need, Master Pei?

221
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,759
The late emperor's concubine mistook
a baby girl for a boy due to madness.

222
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,919
Apart from you,

223
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,279
who else knows about this?

224
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,440
Only I know.

225
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,639
How much kindness did Lady Liu show you

226
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
to make you willingly take the risk

227
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,919
of committing the crime
of deceiving an emperor?

228
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,200
I am just a palace maid.

229
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,080
I must listen to my mistress.

230
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,159
There are rules in the palace.

231
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,679
When a lady gives birth,

232
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,799
there must be a record.

233
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,959
Although the late Emperor
hadn't ascended the throne back then,

234
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,719
he had moved into the palace
for almost a month.

235
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,320
Even if he didn't know,

236
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,679
the physician who registered the birth
must know it.

237
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,000
Perhaps

238
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,720
Lady Liu was too insane

239
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,600
for others to approach,

240
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,918
so they just bought her nonsense

241
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,240
and carelessly reported it
without scrutiny.

242
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,919
Really?

243
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,679
It seems I have to personally look for

244
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,079
that physician from back then.

245
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,279
Master Pei, you must not.

246
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,360
Master Pei,

247
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,519
if you do this,

248
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,399
it will arouse suspicion

249
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,080
and bring unnecessary trouble
for Her Majesty.

250
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,158
Since you've chosen to keep the secret,

251
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,360
please

252
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,080
do not let Her Majesty fall into danger.

253
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,320
Madam Li.

254
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,399
Yes?

255
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,440
I will trust you only once.

256
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,679
If you dare to deceive me,

257
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
I will definitely kill you.
