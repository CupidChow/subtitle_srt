00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,928
=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,079
Master Zhuo puts a lot
in his private treasury.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,518
You're plotting behind his back.

5
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,199
If Master Zhuo discovers it,

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,440
he will definitely kill you.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,600
Master Pei,

8
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,719
please show some respect.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,920
I also wish this matter was my plan.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,398
If it succeeds,

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,679
it'll relieve the bitterness
in my heart.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
However,

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,479
Master Zhuo's private treasury
must be heavily guarded.

14
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,520
I assume it's safe and sound now.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,479
Indeed, it is unharmed.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
But the rumors about the treasury

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,719
have spread across the world.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
The purpose behind this
is not hard to guess.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,798
Since it is a secret treasury,

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,239
it will no longer be safe,

21
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,959
if the secret is exposed.

22
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,319
It can only be moved.

23
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,318
And during the transfer,

24
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,919
accidents are unavoidable.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,879
Am I right?

26
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,680
I see.

27
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,119
Though even during the transfer,

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,840
the treasury is still hard to plunder.

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Why?

30
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,000
Since it's a private treasury,

31
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,840
it's guarded by private soldiers.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,078
If it is to be moved,

33
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,759
Master Pei, think about it.

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,399
Due to its importance,

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,719
if Master Zhuo
deploys Huting Army to escort it,

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
who'd dare to attack then?

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,359
It'd be going
against the entire Great Ning.

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,079
I'm glad Your Majesty knows.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,760
Don't act rashly

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,959
to seek self-destruction.

41
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,478
I wouldn't dare.

42
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,280
After all, I only have my life left now.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,800
Master Pei, as you know,

44
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,159
I

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
cherish life.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
That's true.

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,479
Master Pei, please halt.

48
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm wondering,

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,479
for such an important task,

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
who the person in charge of escorting

51
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,199
would be.

52
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,400
(But this time,)

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
I don't trust anyone else.

54
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,240
Why don't you personally
lead Huting Army to escort?

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
How about it?

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,878
You're such a sweet talker.

57
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,719
Just say you don't trust me.

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
After all, within this capital city,

59
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,279
the only force
that can rival Huting Army

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,800
is your Yilin Army.

61
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,478
My action

62
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,199
is merely for precaution,

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,439
in case your men

64
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,439
also covet the small fortune of mine.

65
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,000
You are joking.

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,239
Yilin Army's duty
is to protect the imperial city.

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,879
It would never do despicable things

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,680
like robbing private property.

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Alright.

70
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,520
Then it's decided.

71
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,158
You will

72
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,198
personally escort

73
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,919
the transfer of my private treasury.

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,599
Of course, it's me.

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
But this matter is of great importance.

76
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,520
So I won't hold back.

77
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,479
Otherwise,

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,919
it will implicate me.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,878
Then I wish you all the best

80
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,400
and a safe return.

81
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,759
Thank you, Your Majesty.

82
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,560
If it's you,

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,280
it will be easier to handle.

84
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,720
(The auspicious hour has come.)

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,999
(The universe revolves,)

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,958
(and Yin and Yang harmonize).

87
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,000
(This is the prime time for the ritual.)

88
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,479
(Your Majesty, please move
to the Fasting Palace)

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,159
(and worship reverently)

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,399
(to pray for the country's peace
and people's safety.)

91
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,959
Master Pei.

92
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,759
It's been two days.

93
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,040
Has His Majesty eaten?

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,759
No.

95
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,239
His Majesty's pious heart

96
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
is witnessed by heaven.

97
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,879
At midnight,

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
secretly get him some food.

99
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Being so pious,

100
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,600
he seems suspicious.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,319
I will test him for Master Zhuo.

102
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,639
Understood.

103
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
Wait.

104
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,638
If he won't eat,

105
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,600
force him if necessary.

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,199
Master Pei,

107
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
why is that?

108
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
It has its own meaning.

109
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,384
(Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si,
Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai)

110
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,040
(The emperor is quite devout.)

111
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
Please eat.

113
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,480
No one will know.

114
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,839
It has its own meaning.

115
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,439
Eat up.

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,439
No one will know.

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
(Is it you?)

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,838
"It has its own meaning"?

119
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,160
Fortunately, His Majesty ate it.

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,519
Me forcing His Majesty to eat?

121
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,119
Even if Master Pei is not afraid,

122
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I'd be scared to death.

123
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:17,152
(Fasting Palace)

124
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,519
(It has been almost three days.)

125
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,920
(Why is there no movement?)

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,639
(If there truly are deities above,)

127
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,279
(I beg you for a favorable outcome)

128
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,199
(and bless us to eradicate
the country's enemy soon.)

129
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,839
Finally, there is movement.

130
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,920
Who is it?

131
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,720
By Master Zhuo's order,

132
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,959
I've come
to collect the disaster relief money.

133
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,920
Falsely claiming
the order of Master Zhuo,

134
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,279
you deserve to die.

135
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,679
Master Pei,

136
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,319
everything I said is the truth.

137
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,879
Just take a look.

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,360
Buddies,

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,800
get them if you want to live.

140
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,639
With this money,

141
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,440
we will have a chance to live.

142
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,960
The relief money is all here.

143
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,600
Whoever grabs it first, it's theirs.

144
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,000
Why are there so many people?

145
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Buddies,

146
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,039
it's real fortune!

147
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,039
Hurry up!

148
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,159
I want to see who dares.

149
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,879
Why are they refugees?

150
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,759
Master Pei,

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,479
they are all unarmed refugees.

152
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,639
Should we kill them all?

153
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,559
All Huting soldiers, heed my order!

154
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,279
Stop now!

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,120
Master Pei,

156
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,119
Master Zhuo will definitely blame us.

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
What should we do now?

158
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
I see...

159
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,407
(Fasting Palace)

160
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,639
Your Majesty,

161
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,879
the praying is complete.

162
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,159
(Losing years of accumulated wealth,)

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,440
(Master Zhuo must
have been greatly weakened.)

164
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,398
(At this moment,)

165
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,440
(he's probably raging fiercely.)

166
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,919
Farewell, Your Majesty.

167
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,159
We'll take Your Majesty
back to the palace.

168
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,000
Who said I want to return to the palace?

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,639
They are not at fault.

170
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,240
Although soldiers act by order,

171
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,758
they should not act
against unarmed civilians.

172
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,440
Also, I ordered them not to fight back.

173
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,159
If you must punish,

174
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,159
punish me alone.

175
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,558
I'm disciplining my own Huting Army.

176
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not your place to intervene.

177
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,639
That's the wealth I have painstakingly
accumulated over 20 years.

178
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,200
How could you let refugees plunder it?

179
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,558
Today, I'll kill whoever

180
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,679
I want to kill.

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,278
No one can stop me.

182
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,039
Why are you so angry, Master Zhuo?

183
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,759
Why are you here?

184
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,279
I

185
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,759
just finished praying for you.

186
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,558
I heard you were here,

187
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,600
so I came uninvited.

188
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,239
I deeply appreciate

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
Your Majesty's concern.

190
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,879
Why do you punish these soldiers?

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,879
The gold and silver for the gold statue

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,559
were stolen due to their malpractice.

193
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
They should be punished.

194
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,399
What?

195
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,359
But

196
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,278
I did not use the Tiger Tally.

197
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,240
Whose orders
were these Huting soldiers following?

198
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,159
So it was you who gave the orders.

199
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
Then it's not a problem.

200
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,359
However,
privately mobilizing Huting Army

201
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,839
is against the rules.

202
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,960
If you make a scene further,

203
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,720
news of it
will likely harm your reputation.

204
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,759
Step aside.

205
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,720
Forgive me, Master Zhuo.

206
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,679
I am the monarch of this country.

207
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,878
Now my innocent subjects are punished.

208
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,879
I

209
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,519
cannot step aside.

210
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,000
I am going to kill today.

211
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,159
No one can stop me.

212
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,239
I hope this slash

213
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,960
can ease your anger.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,759
Fetch the imperial physician.

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Master Zhuo,

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,398
I'm doing this for your sake.

217
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,799
I don't intend to disobey you.

218
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Master Zhuo,

219
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,079
(People's Letter)
refugees gathering outside the palace

220
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,120
sent a People's Letter.

221
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,039
What People's Letter?

222
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,000
They want to thank you
for the relief money you donated.

223
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,200
I see.

224
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,679
I feel deeply ashamed.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
I am narrow-minded

226
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,398
and misunderstood you.

227
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,518
I never thought

228
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,879
that you'd have such a caring heart
for the people.

229
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,919
You gave away
all your wealth for refugees,

230
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,440
relieving the capital's predicament.

231
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,320
When our national power is stronger,

232
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,639
I'll definitely

233
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,000
restart building the gold statue
for you.

234
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,399
I hope that can ease your anger.

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,399
Take care, Master Zhuo.
