2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,518
M-Master Pei,

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,799
you're finally back.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,920
Something happened.

6
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,679
Yilin Army's garrison was burned.

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,560
Were there any casualties?

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
You'd better worry about yourself.

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Master Gu,

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
continue.

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,239
Hadn't I happened to patrol
Yilin Army's garrison last night

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,878
and found the fire in time,

14
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,200
I'm afraid the entire Yilin Army
would have been reduced to ashes.

15
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,560
Master Pei is the leader of Yilin Army.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,599
Now that such a big incident happened,

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,959
I believe

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,799
he should be punished
for neglect of duties.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,799
Your Majesty,

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,840
please remove Pei Shenzhi
from the position of Yilin Army leader

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,679
and punish him by military law

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,920
as a deterrent to others.

24
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,919
Then, Master Zheng, in your opinion,

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
which article should be applied?

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,199
You should take 80 lashes

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,079
and a five-year imprisonment.

28
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,598
Your Majesty, I wonder

29
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,719
how you wish to deal with me.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,319
I think

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,079
since Yilin Army suffered heavy losses,

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
and Master Pei cannot escape the blame.

33
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,599
But

34
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,718
80 lashes

35
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,640
and a five-year imprisonment
are too heavy.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,679
How about compromising a bit?

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,519
We can remove Master Pei's duty
as Yilin Army leader.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Three years without pay.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,280
What do you think?

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,599
I will

41
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,360
obey the orders of Your Majesty.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,198
I didn't expect Your Majesty
to be so capable.

43
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,038
When did you
win over the Yilin Army adjutant,

44
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,280
Master Gu,

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,560
and Minister of Justice, Master Zheng?

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,840
You cooperated so harmoniously.

47
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,158
One with a tainted heart

48
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,719
sees everything as dirty.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,719
I act openly and frankly.

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Loyalty to His Majesty is our duty.

51
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,639
But in Eunuch Zhuo's words,

52
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,959
it turned into something deceitful.

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,439
You were simply spouting nonsense.

54
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,919
Guards.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,038
Take this man out

56
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,520
and give him 40 strokes.

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,639
Yes.

58
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,719
Stop.

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,719
No one may enter the grand hall
with a blade unless ordered by me.

60
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,039
Are you trying to rebel?

61
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,639
We dare not.

62
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,800
Where is the Yilin Army?

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
How can he mobilize the Yilin Army?

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
Where is the Tiger Tally?

65
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,639
Your Majesty,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,719
you are really capable.

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Fine.

68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,078
Yilin Army

69
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,600
is at Your Majesty's command.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,159
Master Gu,

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,039
you disrespected Master Zhuo.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,279
Take 30 strokes.

73
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,319
I accept the punishment.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,239
The Huting soldiers barged
into the grand hall without permission.

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,399
They'll take 30 strokes.

76
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,600
We accept the punishment.

77
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,839
Master Pei,

78
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,759
you neglected your duty.

79
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,920
Your position as Yilin Army leader
will be removed,

80
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,479
and you'll take 30 strokes.

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,079
Do you accept the punishment?

82
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,360
I accept the punishment.

83
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,079
Good. Very good.

84
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,759
Go on.

85
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,720
It's not 30 yet.

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Yes.

87
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,120
It seems Your Majesty
thinks that your throne is secured

88
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,120
and you no longer need
to care about me and my son.

89
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,800
Master Zhuo, you've misunderstood.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,199
We must obey the national law.

91
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,279
Seeing Master Pei getting beaten

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,639
pains me too.

93
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,759
Since you're worried about your son,

94
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,439
I will show mercy.

95
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,639
The remaining strokes can be spared.

96
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,560
Look at him.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,720
You chose him as emperor.

98
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Having gained power,

99
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,759
now he dares to trample on our dignity!

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,519
You're right.

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Just now,

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
thank you

103
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,199
for pleading for me.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,958
You didn't conspire with His Majesty

105
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,319
to stage a self-injury trick
for me, did you?

106
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,040
Foster father,

107
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,639
you are overthinking.

108
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,680
I guess you wouldn't dare.

109
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,279
Otherwise, I'm afraid
I can't keep your status

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,160
as a former dynasty prince
secret for you.

111
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
Wretch.

112
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,560
You wretch.

113
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,000
That emperor is just like you.

114
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,279
He is a wretch too.

115
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,480
I must kill him.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Honey,

117
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
anger is bad for your health.

118
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,120
Stop pretending.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
You must hate me to death now.

120
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,920
You are so fake that you disgust me.

121
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,319
I do hate you.

122
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,879
But what I hate more

123
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,120
is that I fell in love with you.

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
What trick are you playing now?

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,120
If I didn't love you,

126
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,800
how would I be willing
to serve you, a eunuch?

127
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
After all,

128
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,759
you can't give me real happiness.

129
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,160
But being with you,

130
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,480
I feel happy inside.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
Even if you torture me

132
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,279
until I have bruises all over my body,

133
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,639
I still want to be with you.

134
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,279
So,

135
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,279
I also want to make you happy.

136
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
Master Pei,

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
are you so eager to serve me?

138
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,519
Won't you recuperate properly?

139
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,919
Your Majesty,

140
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
is there nothing you want to say?

141
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,519
What do you want to hear?

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,759
How come I did not know

143
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,559
you were actually

144
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,440
a dog that bites?

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,440
Did my act

146
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,559
satisfy you?

147
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,360
This is the birthday gift
I prepared for you.

148
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,120
From now on,

149
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,360
no one in this world can stop you.

150
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
The handing over of Tiger Tally

151
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,240
went fairly smoothly.

152
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,679
However,

153
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,360
you had to suffer.

154
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,840
Take off your clothes and show me.

155
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,799
What?

156
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,039
Are you shy?

157
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,678
Didn't you take off your clothes

158
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,878
quite quickly last night?

159
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,759
Hurry up.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,919
This is an imperial order.

161
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,799
Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,360
Does it still hurt?

163
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,639
No.

164
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,480
This is the punishment

165
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,799
for leaving me
when I needed you the most.

166
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,399
Then I deserved

167
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,000
the punishment.

168
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,879
But now,

169
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,559
Pei Shenzhi,

170
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,519
I've forgiven you.

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,399
Thank you, Your Majesty.

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,799
Thank you, Master Pei,

173
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
for supporting me all the way.

174
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,919
Master Pei,

175
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,519
Deputy General Zhao has waited long.

176
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
How have the buddies
of Shenxing Camp been lately?

177
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Thanks to your blessings.

178
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,200
They're all fine.

179
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,120
They learned
your military power was seized.

180
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,558
They are very worried about you.

181
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,559
They want me to see you.

182
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I am fine.

183
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,759
No need to worry.

184
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
I know your retreat

185
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,840
was for the greater good of the nation.

186
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,079
To establish a new emperor,
you have worked tirelessly

187
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
and made many sacrifices.

188
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,120
But now you've ended up like this.

189
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,679
If

190
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,480
you had not retreated back then...

191
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,639
I chose a very risky path.

192
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,639
Fortunately,

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
I bet right.

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Ze,

195
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,719
whether it is Shenxing Camp
or Yilin Army,

196
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,759
they must follow His Majesty's orders
from now on.

197
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,000
His Majesty is benevolent and wise

198
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,080
and will surely lead our country
out of the dark night

199
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,720
and into the light.

200
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,799
Understood.

201
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,799
We believe in your choice.

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,399
We swear loyalty to His Majesty.

203
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,919
You may leave.

204
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Fengning.

205
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,759
Fengning.

206
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,960
Fengning.

207
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,559
(Why is this name so familiar?)

208
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,000
(This fabric)

209
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,279
(is the brocade
for the former dynasty's palace.)

210
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,679
(Former dynasty.)

211
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
(In the palace.)

212
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,319
(Fengning seems to be
the former dynasty's)

213
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,519
(empress's maiden name.)

214
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,960
(I heard she died tragically
in the palace that night,)

215
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,799
(and her newborn child disappeared.)

216
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,000
(If Your Majesty is the child
of the former dynasty's Empress)

217
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,440
(and Zhuo Shangxian is somehow
connected to her,)

218
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,360
(then the Fifth Prince
who was taken away...)

219
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:46,464
(Memorial)

220
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,928
(Memorial)

221
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:13,617
(Memorial)

222
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,360
Here is an impeachment memorial
against you.

223
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,440
It says you're cunning and fawning

224
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,759
and urges me to demote you far away.

225
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,759
Good impeachment.

226
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,759
It seems the writer
is a straightforward official.

227
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,158
Here is another one.

228
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:41,720
It says

229
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:42,918
you have a mansion

230
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,918
full of beautiful maidservants,

231
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,399
and there are often sounds
of debauchery coming from inside it.

232
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,480
Nonsense.

233
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:53,199
I am so busy every day.

234
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Your Majesty,

235
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,240
I am wronged.

236
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,399
Your Majesty,

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,120
Master Huo, Left Chief Censor,
requests an audience.

238
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,039
(Huo Zheng, Left Chief Censor)
I, Huo Zheng,

239
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,200
wish Your Majesty a good day.

240
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,919
Master Huo,

241
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,759
after

242
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,639
a half-month break,

243
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,639
how is it being back?

244
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,840
Thanks to Your Majesty.

245
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
Everything is well.

246
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,159
What important matter

247
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,879
made you request an audience

248
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,039
even on your day off?

249
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,759
Speak freely.

250
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,678
Today's the autumn festival.

251
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,679
It is lively in the city.

252
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,519
The people set up an altar

253
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,120
to pray for good weather.

254
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,720
I hope Your Majesty can attend
and offer prayers

255
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,240
to bring good fortune.

256
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Offering prayers?

257
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,960
Okay.

258
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,840
Then let the Astronomical Bureau
choose an auspicious date.

259
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:43,840
Your Majesty,

260
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,120
today is an auspicious day.

261
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,679
Everything is already set.

262
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,879
All that is needed
is Your Majesty's presence.
