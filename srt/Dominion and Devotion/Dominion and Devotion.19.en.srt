00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,928
=Dominion and Devotion=

2
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,328
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,239
Stop.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,519
Now scared, huh?

5
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,199
Bet you didn't think about this when

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,359
torturing those scholars.

7
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,679
Spill everything

8
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,719
you know about the imperial exam leaks.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Or

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
you'll be wishing you'd never been born.

11
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,840
Since I'm screwed either way,

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,040
whether I talk or stay silent,

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,439
I'll just shut my mouth then.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Fine.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Then I'll just beat you to death.

16
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,040
Ding Shanwen.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Present.

18
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,319
Master Zhuo.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,519
Why'd you bring him here?

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Foster father,

21
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,159
the exam cheating thing is blowing up.

22
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,919
I'm worried Huo Zheng will
track it back to this idiot eventually.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,319
So I moved him out of the way

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,000
before he gets picked up.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Really?

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,719
But I think

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,960
you're up to something else.

28
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:35,560
(Huting Army Wing Captain,
Middle Captain, Front Captain)

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,639
I'm absolutely loyal to you.

30
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,400
I think so too.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,680
Why so complicated?

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
This way,

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,639
nobody can prove anything, right?

34
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,999
Life's been

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
a real drag lately.

36
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,639
But,

37
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,800
I've got the ultimate fix.

38
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,439
What's the plan?

39
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,919
Naturally,

40
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,919
a coup.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
When?

42
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,919
That's not your concern.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,959
Shouldn't you be worried that

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,560
what if Huo Zheng grills Li Changjia,

45
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,000
and he spills the beans about the leaks?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,639
Li Changjia wouldn't dare say anything.

47
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,520
Even if he did talk,

48
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,599
Huo Zheng wouldn't be able
to leave the Censorate.

49
00:03:53,555 --> 00:04:00,480
(Censorate)

50
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,359
You still haven't told me.

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,719
You deliberately lured me here

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,080
for what?

53
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,280
Planning an ambush here

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
to capture and kill me?

55
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,400
You still don't trust me.

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Like I said,

57
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,759
in this world,

58
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,319
you can't trust anyone

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
but yourself.

60
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,160
Then, have you ever thought

61
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,318
that maybe that's why

62
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,920
you've got nobody

63
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,959
to confide in.

64
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,199
Confide?

65
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,199
I've got a really bad feeling now.

66
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,319
My gut's telling me

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,000
that I'm now

68
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,439
in deep trouble.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,279
Since Ding Shanwen's dead,

70
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,879
I'm out.

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Chase.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Stop. Stop.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
I'll confess.

74
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,079
Good.

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm listening.

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
If I find even one lie in this,

77
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,879
you're dead.

78
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,360
This imperial exam leak thing

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,439
has been going on for years.

80
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,920
It started with

81
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,240
Zhuo Shangxian.

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,399
He then

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
roped Qian Ming in.

84
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,480
Did Li Changjia confess?

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Where are you going?

86
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,040
The palace.

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,199
To see Your Majesty.

88
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,719
You're coming down hard on Li Changjia.

89
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,879
What if you get impeached?

90
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Doesn't matter.

91
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,279
Master Zhuo

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
is finished this time.

93
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,839
Give me the testimony.

94
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,600
Master Pei, are you joking?

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
You're Zhuo Shangxian's adopted son.

96
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,999
We're surrounded by the Huting Army.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're not getting

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,279
that testimony out of here.

99
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,959
Master Pei,

100
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,600
I've always wondered

101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,399
who are you really loyal to?

102
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,879
Your Majesty

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,599
or Zhuo Shangxian?

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,759
Your Majesty, of course.

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,600
Do you even believe that?

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
You

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,959
murdered my mentor!

108
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,758
You've been a villain's pawn for years.

109
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
You're just plain evil.

110
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,600
Your Majesty

111
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,199
trusts you. But I don't.

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,278
I hate Zhuo Shangxian.

113
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,759
But I hate you even more.

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,959
I'll

115
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,839
hand the testimony
to Your Majesty myself.

116
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
I want you and Zhuo Shangxian

117
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,599
to die a slow death

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,480
and turn to dust,

119
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,040
to honor my mentor's spirit.

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,399
He Yanbai is still alive.

121
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,079
What?

122
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,800
I said

123
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,040
that your mentor is not dead.

124
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,439
No time

125
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,800
for explanations right now.

126
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,439
Once things calm down,

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,560
I'll take you to him.

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,920
May my child be dumb and boorish,

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
and without calamity reach high office.

130
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,399
Master He told me

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,838
this poem

132
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,600
would make you trust me.

133
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,839
Your Majesty trusts me.

134
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,079
Even if you don't trust me,

135
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,359
at least trust Your Majesty's judgment,

136
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
right?

137
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,240
(Testimony)
I distract them.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,079
You be careful, okay?

139
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,440
How can you let him leave like that?

140
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,519
Huo Zheng.

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,679
Pei Shenzhi,

142
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,960
just give me one honest answer.

143
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,159
You weren't just lying to me, were you?

144
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,159
No.

145
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,679
Great.

146
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,159
May my child be dumb and boorish,

147
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,600
and without calamity reach

148
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,919
high office.

149
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,120
He'll be proud of you.

150
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,320
From that moment on,

151
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,480
you've been betraying me.

152
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,279
Betray?

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,759
No.

154
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,840
We were never on the same side.

155
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,080
Now my hands are covered in blood.

156
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Might as well

157
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,080
go to hell together.

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,200
At least,

159
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,000
we can have a blast

160
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
while being deep-fried.

161
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,360
You lost.

162
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah, I lost.

163
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,678
But the time

164
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,679
is almost up.

165
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,320
What?

166
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Surround them.

167
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,558
Follow Your Majesty

168
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,960
is chosen by destiny.

169
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,559
Your Majesty made a call.

170
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,039
Those who used to back Zhuo Shangxian,

171
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,558
if coming back to the fold...

172
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,638
If coming back to the fold,

173
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,480
are off the hook.

174
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,879
Once I've restored order to the court,

175
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,239
you'll all be back in the inner circle,

176
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
chasing your ambitions.

177
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,159
But if

178
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,758
anyone decides to fight against

179
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,519
what's clearly meant to be,

180
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
they're

181
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,799
going to be crushed.

182
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,759
Your Majesty loves the people.

183
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm with Your Majesty all the way.

184
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,480
If you're thinking about...

185
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,519
No submission...

186
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,398
don't blame me
for ditching old friendships.

187
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,759
means rebellion.

188
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,000
All clans will be exterminated.

189
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,039
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

190
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,200
Okay, that explains it all.

191
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,200
Turns out my son lured me to Yunqi Villa

192
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
as a decoy,

193
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,320
so that Your Majesty could stage a coup.

194
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,679
I

195
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,638
came here in the middle of the night

196
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,559
to get back the Tiger Tally
of the Huting Army.

197
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,639
What do you think, Master Zhuo?

198
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,759
Frankly, what use is this Tiger Tally
to me now?

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
Since you want it,

200
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,039
how could I possibly refuse?

201
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,079
I just want to know,

202
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,200
is this truly your wish,

203
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,519
or is it you, Master Pei, who wants it?

204
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,919
It's you,

205
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,159
right?

206
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,959
You chose him as a puppet emperor
from the start

207
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,319
just to one day

208
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,159
bring me down

209
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,279
and grab power for yourself.

210
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,279
I was so blind.

211
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,120
I raised a freaking tiger.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,919
You're just hopeless.

213
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,679
Your Majesty was never a puppet.

214
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,080
He's the rightful ruler.

215
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,678
I, Pei Shenzhi,

216
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,639
willingly

217
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,039
follow him.

218
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,879
Very well.

219
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,119
Master Zhuo.

220
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
Stop fighting it.

221
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,720
Does Your Majesty want me dead?

222
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,079
Or are you just worried about

223
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,799
my concubine, your Auntie,

224
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,120
being buried with me?

225
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,559
So, things have come to a head.

226
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,240
Zhuo Shangxian,

227
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,279
you didn't really think
you'd walk away unscathed, did you?

228
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,919
What does Your Majesty want?

229
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,879
I can spare your life,

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
if you release my Auntie,

231
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
and hand over the Tiger Tally.

232
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,278
Something that could save my life,

233
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,399
I dare not give it up.

234
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,479
But happy to give you

235
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
the Tiger Tally.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,840
I'm getting old anyway.

237
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,559
Time to retire and go home.

238
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Your Majesty,

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,519
you can't just let him go!

240
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,919
Huo Zheng left behind

241
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,320
this testimony before he died.

242
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,480
Huo Zheng.

243
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,799
You never listened.

244
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,879
I will

245
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,440
punish you

246
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,960
to turn into a star in the sky earlier

247
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,919
to protect the people of the Great Ning.

248
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,919
I know what you wanted.

249
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,719
I'll

250
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,519
take care of it.

251
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,279
