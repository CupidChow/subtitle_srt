00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 50

3
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,900
You're awake?

4
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,780
Who are you?

5
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,300
You don't remember me?

6
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,660
Do you know who you are?

7
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,140
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

8
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,220
So,

9
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,300
you just forget about me.

10
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,780
Take a good look at me. Who am I?

11
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,460
Are you a little fox from Qingqiu?

12
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,260
Are you my classmate?

13
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,420
Or,

14
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,980
did you have a blind date with me?

15
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,220
It seems that

16
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,660
you've really lost your memories.

17
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,580
What a pity!

18
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,740
For what?

19
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,460
I originally planned to go to Qingqiu

20
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,940
with you to meet your family

21
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,420
and discuss how to hold our delayed wedding banquet

22
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,380
to make you my Empress.

23
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,340
Now that you've lost your memories,

24
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,340
it has to be postponed indefinitely.

25
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,500
What?

26
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,980
What?

27
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,180
Will you marry me?

28
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,900
I didn't expect that

29
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,980
you had forgotten it all.

30
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:30,980
Wait!

31
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,340
Where are you going?

32
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,660
I'm going to find Lian Song

33
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,740
and ask him to send you back to Qingqiu.

34
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,500
Then, won't you marry me?

35
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,380
Now that you don't remember me,

36
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,460
I have to let it go.

37
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,700
Actually...

38
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,140
Actually, I kind of recall something.

39
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,860
In the Dream of Aranya,

40
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,540
we were a couple, right?

41
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,780
I was Aranya, and you were Xi Ze.

42
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,140
What happened in the Dream of Aranya doesn't count.

43
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,020
Since you can't remember me,

44
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,060
don't force yourself.

45
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,620
I kind of recall it.

46
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,340
What do you recall?

47
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,300
You seem to be Emperor Dong Hua.

48
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,220
Seem?

49
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,620
You are Emperor Dong Hua!

50
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,620
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

51
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,740
I'm your girl, Xiaobai.

52
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,740
Ouch!

53
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,700
I dare not trick you next time.

54
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,180
Next time?

55
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,700
No. Never.

56
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,700
What you just said,

57
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,980
does it still count?

58
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,580
What did I say?

59
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,180
You said you would marry me.

60
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,220
Take a bath in hot spring first to recover from fatigue.

61
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,780
We're leaving the valley.

62
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,460
I'll have Chong Lin get everything ready.

63
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,580
After we get out,

64
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,900
I'll marry you.

65
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,580
OK.

66
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Aren't you coming?

67
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,540
We haven't got married yet.

68
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,500
I didn't mean that.

69
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,580
The royal family of the inseparable king birds

70
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,180
and the royal family of the night owls

71
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,460
would like to guard the valley.

72
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,660
Your Majesty, please approve.

73
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,020
Do you know

74
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,060
what will happen to you

75
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,780
if the Miaoyi Chasm is broken?

76
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,340
Your Majesty,

77
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,220
having sealed Miao Luo for tens of thousands of years,

78
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,100
the Miaoyi Chasm has been filled with her dark energy.

79
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,140
If Miao Luo breaks out of the seal this time,

80
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,820
the entire Fanyin Valley

81
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,100
will be filled with dark energy.

82
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,340
By then, all the living things
will surely be plunged into an abyss of misery.

83
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,460
Wherever the dark energy reaches,

84
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,020
it will become barren

85
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,500
and lifeless.

86
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,940
Are you all clear?

87
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,980
Your Majesty, please approve.

88
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,940
We're willing to perish with the Fanyin Valley.

89
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,580
Your Majesty,

90
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,540
though we're not so competent as gods from the Sky Kingdom,

91
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,940
we're honored as royals by our clans

92
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,420
and have enjoyed high positions and great wealth.

93
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,540
If we don't stay now, we'll be too ashamed

94
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,420
to see our people in future.

95
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,220
Exactly!

96
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,500
Though the gods from the Sky Kingdom have great magic power,

97
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,980
their magic power will be removed after entering the valley.

98
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,220
Also, the magic tricks they learned
are not as pure as those learned in the valley.

99
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,340
In the Fanyin Valley,

100
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,860
it's nice to have some help.

101
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,660
I've arranged for the clansmen

102
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,340
to evacuate from the valley.

103
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,620
The gods from the Sky Kingdom are also ready for assistance.

104
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,940
We're willing to guard the valley.

105
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,580
Your Majesty, please approve!

106
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,380
Your Majesty, please approve!

107
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,980
Then please join me

108
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,020
in guarding the Miaoyi Chasm.

109
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
Thank you, Your Majesty!

110
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,620
This is the Lianxin Mirror
specifically used for purifying the dark energy.

111
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,500
It can help you confine Miao Luo.

112
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,900
Thank you, Your Majesty!

113
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,860
Elder brother!

114
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,860
Jielu,

115
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,460
why are you here?

116
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,260
Why do you all stay

117
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,860
but me?

118
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,700
I also want to stay and guard the valley with you.

119
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,140
I'm also a royal.

120
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,540
You're still a kid!

121
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,420
I go to school with you now.

122
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,500
You can all stay.

123
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,820
Why can't I?

124
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,740
Jielu,

125
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,420
if we all stay here,

126
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,300
who can our people rely on?

127
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,460
For this trip to the Sky Kingdom,

128
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,100
they need someone to make decisions

129
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,100
and lead them.

130
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,860
Do you want our people to seek living

131
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,380
in the Sky Kingdom on their own?

132
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,420
Can you leave instead?

133
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,540
Elder brother,

134
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,780
you're the future king of the inseparable king birds.

135
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,820
You should take our people to the Sky Kingdom,
and I'll stay here instead.

136
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Silly girl,

137
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,140
you're the only daughter of uncle and aunt.

138
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,700
I promised them

139
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
to take good care of you

140
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,380
and keep you safe and sound.

141
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,300
Then,

142
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,900
you'll all be back, right?

143
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,340
Well,

144
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,660
we're preparing for the worst.

145
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,300
But with His Majesty on our side,

146
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,260
we won't end up like that.

147
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,980
But I can't!

148
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,260
Elder brother,

149
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,220
I can't do it on my own!

150
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,500
You like Her Highness Fengjiu so much.

151
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,460
Are you willing to never see her again?

152
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,460
I have no one to care about outside the valley.

153
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,500
I grew up here as a child.

154
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,060
Just let me stay.

155
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,780
I...

156
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,740
I do like Her Highness Fengjiu.

157
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,820
I'll miss her in my heart.

158
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,340
But I'm also the prince of the inseparable king birds.

159
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,340
It's my inescapable duty to guard the valley.

160
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,860
I won't leave,

161
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,340
and I can't leave.

162
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,780
Jielu,

163
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,820
we decided together that

164
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,060
you should leave with our people.

165
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,660
Mother,

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,860
uncle, aunt,

167
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,940
and me.

168
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,380
Why?

169
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,420
Jielu,

170
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,620
though you've never experienced the outside world,

171
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,820
you've always been our hope.

172
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,100
If one day,

173
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,660
we are really at the critical juncture of life and death,

174
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,500
as long as we know

175
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,260
we've still got you to lead our people,

176
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,540
we can feel relieved

177
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,020
and spare no efforts in dealing with the situation.

178
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,500
Elder brother!

179
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,460
Mother asked me to send you a message.

180
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,740
Let the tragedy of the Fanyin Valley

181
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,060
stay in the Fanyin Valley.

182
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,900
She said you would understand it.

183
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,100
But why do you have to stay?

184
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,420
You haven't fulfilled your wish yet!

185
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,660
Mother is old.

186
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,540
They need me.

187
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,140
Moreover,

188
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,500
Jielu,

189
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,780
do you really have no one to care about?

190
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,100
Who are you thinking of right now?

191
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,900
Elder brother,

192
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,540
you're making fun of me.

193
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,180
I still expect you to grow up and get married.

194
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,700
Don't panic.

195
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,780
It's just a temporary separation.

196
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,420
Then

197
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,620
you must all be safe and sound!

198
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,140
I will guard this place well

199
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,340
and wait for you to return.

200
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,660
Magnificent and unhurried,

201
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,500
yet filled with deep emotions.

202
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,420
Terrific!

203
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,220
I was playing randomly.

204
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,340
Sorry for my poor skills.

205
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,540
You helped Xiaobai and me

206
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,020
out of righteousness this time.

207
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,900
I haven't thanked you yet.

208
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm so flattered.

209
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,220
Your Majesty, it's the honor of a lifetime

210
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,540
to be able to serve you.

211
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,380
Also, you know that

212
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,140
I have my selfish motive.

213
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,060
That's hardly a selfish motive.

214
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,620
You just want to know the truth.

215
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,740
Right.

216
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,300
For all these years,

217
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,460
I just couldn't get over Aranya's death.

218
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,740
After entering the dream world this time,

219
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,100
I finally

220
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,820
have taken a load off my mind.

221
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,180
Such a result

222
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,060
may not be the one you wanted.

223
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,260
To me,

224
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,100
I certainly don't want to see that

225
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,220
Aranya was deeply in love with Shen Ye.

226
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,700
Nor do I want to believe that
Shen Ye was also deeply in love with Aranya.

227
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,860
But after brooding it over here for days,

228
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
I've gradually realized that

229
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,860
such a result,

230
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,980
the truth,

231
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,660
was actually better than I speculated.

232
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,660
I feel relieved for Aranya.

233
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,940
She didn't love

234
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,100
the wrong guy after all.

235
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,980
It's rare to think like that.

236
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,180
Something strange has happened inside the valley.

237
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,740
His Highness Lian Song didn't tell me the details,

238
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,700
but I can guess a thing or two.

239
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,100
Your Majesty,

240
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,140
anything you ask,

241
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,460
the people of West Sea will surely help you.

242
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,260
It's too early to ask for help.

243
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
I know how to deal with it.

244
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,740
Jiuge,

245
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,740
this is a letter from Yan to you.

246
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,860
Yan?

247
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,540
When did he become so genteel?

248
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,460
See you.

249
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,580
Xiaojiu, I'm so glad that you're back!

250
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,180
Can you drink wine or eat meat now?

251
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,460
If you can,

252
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,580
meet us in private in the Zuilixian Restaurant right away.

253
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,980
Meng wants to give you a farewell dinner in private.

254
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,220
Since you fell into the Dream of Aranya,

255
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,340
the inseparable king birds

256
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,420
have known that we lied about who we were.

257
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,780
But due to the ice face and Lian Song,

258
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,220
they dared not inquire about our true identities.

259
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,100
Meng asked me in private several times.

260
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,060
Given that he's a friend,

261
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,300
I told him who I was honestly.

262
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,940
Though I said nothing about your identity,

263
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,580
he mistakenly thought that you were also a demon.

264
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,140
Yan was quite smart this time.

265
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,140
He actually remembered to hide my identity.

266
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,940
Actually,

267
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,820
whom Meng loves is the legendary Fengjiu.

268
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
It's not you.

269
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,820
We're friends.

270
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,980
Even if he knows who you are,

271
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,780
he stands no chance against the ice face.

272
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,220
Whether to keep hiding your identity

273
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,980
or to tell him who you are,

274
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,340
it's up to you.

275
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,220
It seems that back with four seasons,

276
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,260
the Fanyin Valley is picturesque.

277
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,260
It's really a reclusive land of peace and happiness.

278
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,620
The Fanyin Valley was originally built outside the mortal realm.

279
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,700
Back then, I chose this place

280
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,900
to suppress the Miaoyi Chasm

281
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,580
and neutralize the dark energy in the world.

282
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,940
It costs more than half of your cultivation

283
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,700
to suppress the Miaoyi Chasm once.

284
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,180
To completely purify it,

285
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,740
I'm afraid you'll have to use all of your cultivation

286
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,780
and end up falling into a deep slumber
for tens of thousands of years.

287
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,100
Moreover, Miao Luo also needs to be handled.

288
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,100
Now we can only stabilize the Miaoyi Chasm

289
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,420
to confine Miao Luo.

290
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,620
After figuring out the way
to get rid of Miao Luo once and for all,

291
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,420
we can make further plans.

292
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,740
Though you're the most powerful
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

293
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,340
there're still several powerful gods

294
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,340
in the Sky Kingdom.

295
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,140
You shouldn't be the only one to carry the burden.

296
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,380
Moreover, now that heaven and earth have settled

297
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,060
and the conflicts within the demons

298
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,620
have been eased due to the whole thing concerning Miao Luo,

299
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,540
you should go back to rest and recuperate in Tai Chen Palace.

300
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,860
A wedding will be held in Tai Chen Palace.

301
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,660
You're going to have an Empress?

302
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,900
I promised to marry her after getting out of the valley.

303
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,060
You're actually the last to taste love,

304
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,940
but you're going to get married before me.

305
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,620
Well,

306
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,780
now that your marriage is settled,

307
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,340
you can set your mind at rest.

308
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,540
Well,

309
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,340
as to the pimpon fruit you gave me,

310
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,980
I've given it to Lord Xie.

311
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,580
Feel relieved.

312
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,500
Yan,

313
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,020
why did you waste magic power

314
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,060
to come to the Fanyin Valley?

315
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,820
I thought you wouldn't come back after leaving in a hurry.

316
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,140
I'm here to pick up Ji Heng.

317
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,260
The musician.

318
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,820
Right,

319
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,940
you've liked her all the time.

320
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,220
His Majesty really loves Xiaojiu?

321
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,980
Dignified and majestic as His Majesty is,

322
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,100
he actually ordered to hide the truth

323
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,340
from her for her sake.

324
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,900
Unbelievable!

325
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,620
He's just too naïve!

326
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,140
You can both be with your lovers.

327
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,620
Lucky you!

328
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,420
I wonder whether I can see Her Highness Fengjiu again

329
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,340
the rest of my life.

330
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,540
Her Highness Fengjiu doesn't even know I like her.

331
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,140
Meng,

332
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,540
in your mind,

333
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,580
what is Fengjiu like?

334
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,140
A first-class noble lady as she is,

335
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,020
she must be pure and kind.

336
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,140
She likes animals

337
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,580
and never touches mundane things such as wine and meat.

338
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,220
Moreover...

339
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,620
Who is he talking about?

340
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,580
So strange!

341
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,300
Another dancing girl?

342
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,420
I think...

343
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,020
He's talking about Her Highness Fengjiu
from Qingqiu in his imagination.

344
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,780
...she likes animals and insects.

345
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,380
She won't even

346
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,460
kill a fly.

347
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,580
Meng,

348
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,220
has it ever occurred to you that

349
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,780
if Fengjiu is not the person you've imagined her to be,

350
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,660
will you still like her?

351
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,340
What do you mean?

352
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,700
If Fengjiu is the same as her,

353
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,620
will you still like her?

354
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,060
How is that possible?

355
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,060
If Her Highness Fengjiu is the same as her,

356
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,060
I might as well knock into a piece of bean curd and kill myself.

357
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,620
I am Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

358
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,980
I gave you the Ever-victorious General as a gift.

359
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,740
I also gave you the colored glaze jar.

360
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,060
When I saved you,

361
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,940
I didn't tell you who I was.

362
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,980
And I've kept it from you for so long.

363
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,700
Meng, I'm really sorry.

364
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,260
You're really Her Highness Fengjiu?

365
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,500
Yes, I am.

366
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,380
Her Highness Fengjiu who doesn't touch wine or meat

367
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,300
and who loves insects and animals?

368
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,540
Meng,

369
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,620
you might have misunderstood me.

370
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,620
Actually,

371
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,140
I...

372
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,460
What did you just drink?

373
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,540
Wine.

374
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,500
What did you eat?

375
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,700
Rabbit meat.

376
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,580
What's nailed on that bamboo chopstick?

377
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,980
A fly.

378
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,820
Meng!

379
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,500
Meng!

380
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,340
Meng!

381
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,860
Second Prince!

382
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,860
Second Prince!

383
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,340
What's wrong with him?

384
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,140
Well,

385
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,500
the dream he's had for several decades was just shattered.

386
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,420
He passed out because he couldn't bear it.

387
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,900
Second Prince!

388
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,060
Women!

389
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,220
I'll never believe women!

390
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,340
The woman I worship the most turns out to be no difference.

391
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,780
Which woman can I count on around the world?

392
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,140
What happened to him?

393
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,260
Given the way he behaves,

394
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,100
will he do anything silly?

395
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,740
I didn't expect to drive him mad.

396
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,060
Shall I follow him?

397
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,860
What if he takes it too hard?

398
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,180
Just leave him alone.

399
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,900
If you comfort him,

400
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,260
I'm afraid he won't just have a broken heart.

401
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,500
It's good for him to cry.

402
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,460
He might come round after crying.

403
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,420
In my opinion,

404
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
you shouldn't follow him.

405
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,580
For his safety,

406
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,940
we'd better go and check him out.

407
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,860
When did they become so close?

408
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,700
Only they think the meat here is delicious.

409
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,780
It's tasteless actually.

410
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,860
I'll cook something delicious for you when we're back.

411
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,140
OK.

412
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,020
Actually, the refreshing soup is my signature dish.

413
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,940
When we're back in Tai Chen Palace,

414
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,300
I'll make it for you to build up your health.

415
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,580
Good.

416
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,380
We're about to leave here.

417
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,780
I actually feel a bit sad.

418
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,140
Before we go,

419
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,380
I'll take you somewhere else.

420
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,660
I didn't expect that you gods

421
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,940
would care about people living under the Sky Kingdom.

422
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,620
Xiangli Meng is affectionate and loyal to friends.

423
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,860
You've tricked him for so long.

424
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,060
He waited outside the Dream of Aranya on his own,

425
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,620
ready to sacrifice his life

426
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,460
to save His Majesty and Fengjiu at any time.

427
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,060
Nor did he blame you for not telling him you're a demon,

428
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,340
and he still remains to be your friend.

429
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,780
Xiaojiu is to blame for breaking his heart.

430
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,460
Meng

431
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,180
is pure and honest.

432
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,740
I'm afraid he may seem fine,

433
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,220
but he would actually hide somewhere to cry secretly.

434
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,300
Meng!

435
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,780
Silly you. Are you too sad?

436
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,740
There's sand

437
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,260
in my eyes.

438
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,900
I fell accidentally.

439
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,100
Are you really sad?

440
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,220
Do you really like Xiaojiu?

441
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,940
She takes you as a sincere friend.

442
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,140
Her friendship for you is real.

443
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,300
But the woman you love

444
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,500
is a completely different person imagined by you

445
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,460
who meets all your requirements,

446
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,700
but that woman is not her.

447
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,180
Exactly.

448
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,620
After all these troublesome matters are handled,

449
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,940
I'll take you outside the valley

450
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,820
to have a good trip around the Four Seas and Eight Deserts

451
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,340
and the mortal realm.

452
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,700
Then you can find a real girl to love.

453
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,300
OK?

454
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,220
Actually, I'm not sad.

455
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,140
I just...

456
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,660
I just feel embarrassed

457
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,460
after calming down.

458
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,860
Embarrassed?

459
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,740
You mean you passed out after she told you the truth?

460
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,020
I was always wondering

461
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,780
if I met Her Highness Fengjiu,

462
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,660
what I should tell her first,

463
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,740
and how I should express my love to her.

464
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,140
I was so embarrassed just now.

465
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,780
A long-time friend suddenly became

466
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,820
the woman I loved for so long.

467
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,060
Also, I told her

468
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,900
I loved her many times shamelessly,

469
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,660
but I couldn't even recognize her.

470
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,020
How embarrassed I was!

471
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,300
I even made you worry.

472
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,700
I'm so sorry.

473
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,780
Then just tell her you love her.

474
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,660
Since you feel regretful in your heart,

475
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,340
you should let her know how much you love her.

476
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,220
Whom she loves is her own business,

477
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,500
but no one in the entire world

478
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,380
can stop you from loving her.

479
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,540
But

480
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,620
she and His Majesty love each other.

481
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,100
Why should I bring contempt upon myself

482
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,740
and add trouble to her.

483
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,220
She and the ice face love each other. That's their own business.

484
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,300
What does it have to do with you?

485
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,860
Cheng Yu calls me shameless all the time.

486
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,300
I should ask her over to see

487
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,860
there's actually someone

488
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,980
more shameless than I am.

489
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,220
Don't interrupt!

490
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,300
Meng,

491
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,580
you're smarter than I am.

492
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,660
You should consider it yourself.

493
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,420
Who sets the rule that in the world,

494
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,780
only mutual love is allowed to exist

495
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,180
while unrequited love is inferior to that?

496
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,780
If you love someone who can't love you back,

497
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
isn't it also love?

498
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,860
You love her openly and sincerely.

499
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
You never force her to respond to your love.

500
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,460
If you want to let her know you love her, just go and tell her.

501
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,260
If you don't, just keep it in your heart the rest of your life.

502
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,780
Anyway, I'm your friend.

503
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,180
Whatever you want to do,

504
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,700
as long as Xiaojiu won't get hurt,

505
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,740
I will always support you.

506
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Does it make any sense?

507
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,180
I...

508
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,820
I want to express my love to Her Highness Fengjiu.

509
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,220
I haven't told Her Highness Fengjiu

510
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,700
I love her in the right way.

511
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,340
Then just go.

512
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,020
Let her know how much you love her.

513
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,140
I support you.

514
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,540
After you tell her, if you need,

515
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,540
I can drink with you.

516
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,940
Let's get drunk!

517
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,540
I'll go with you.

518
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,100
They're over there.

519
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,100
We can only accompany you here.

520
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,420
The rest is up to you.

521
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,100
Yan! Your Highness!

522
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,700
Thank you!

523
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,580
Every time I look at Meng,

524
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,180
I find myself extremely vicious and wicked.

525
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,580
Indeed you are.

526
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,220
But compared to him, we both are.

527
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,860
Where are you taking me?

528
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,820
Your Highness Fengjiu!

529
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,500
Your Highness!

530
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,900
Your Majesty, I want to

531
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,540
talk with Her Highness Fengjiu in private.

532
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,220
Fine.

533
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,260
Your Highness,

534
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,500
I was so rude just now because I was drunk.

535
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,300
Please forgive me.

536
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,780
Meng,

537
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,420
in my heart, you've always been a good friend.

538
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,340
Though I didn't tell you the truth,

539
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,140
you don't have to be so polite.

540
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,380
So are we still good friends?

541
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,340
Of course!

542
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,180
Jiuge is a good friend to you,

543
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,740
and you're also a good friend to Jiuge.

544
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,940
In future, just treat me

545
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,580
as Jiuge.

546
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,580
Because that's the real me.

547
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,740
Actually, I'm very happy that

548
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,620
I can...

549
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,780
I can

550
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,260
let the woman I love know that

551
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,620
I love her.

552
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,140
Your Highness,

553
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,100
I've got

554
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,140
no regrets.

555
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,940
How come you've got no regrets?

556
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,780
Only when the woman you love loves you back

557
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
can you say that you've got no regrets.

558
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,620
In the future, you're bound to meet someone

559
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,660
who truly loves you.

560
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,340
By then, you must spare no efforts.

561
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,860
Just learn from Yan

562
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,820
and make her love you

563
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,780
as deeply as you love her.

564
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,500
Do you understand?

565
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,300
Yes!

566
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,780
Shall we leave and give them some space?

567
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,540
It's an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for fun.

568
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,860
Someone is actually trying to win over Emperor Dong Hua's woman.

569
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,460
How I wish I could watch closer!

570
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,580
Why should I leave?

571
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,700
I knew it! No one from the Sky Kingdom is good.

572
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
You should leave actually.

573
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,780
By watching them,

574
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,540
I can step in if anything unpleasant happens.

575
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,380
Why do you look at me like that?

576
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,860
You just want to watch the drama, right?

577
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,620
You're too straight-forward.

578
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,100
I guessed right, didn't I? Asshole from the Sky Kingdom.

579
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,100
The one you called asshole

580
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,500
actually taught you how to play the game of go

581
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,500
and how to win Princess Ji Heng's heart.

582
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,620
Is this how you treat your master?

583
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,820
What master?

584
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,260
I hate playing the game of go the most.

585
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,500
You're burning the bridge after crossing the river, right?

586
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,140
I...

587
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,020
So fast?

588
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,420
Have you told her?

589
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,220
Yes.

590
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,540
What did Xiaojiu say?

591
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,820
She said we were still good friends,

592
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,820
and she asked me to learn more from you.

593
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:44,740
Learn from

594
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,900
me?

595
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,180
Learn from your shamelessness for sure!

596
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,140
She also said that

597
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,740
next time I loved someone,

598
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,220
I should make her love me

599
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,260
as deeply as I love her.

600
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,580
Then you should live up to her blessing.

601
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,100
Actually, I knew it from the start.

602
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,140
When I first met Her Highness Fengjiu,

603
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,380
I knew she would never love me.

604
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,700
She was so gorgeous,

605
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,700
special, charming,

606
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,900
and distinguished.

607
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,140
I knew it all.

608
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,220
Even if I were not from the Fanyin Valley,

609
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,340
even if I were from the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

610
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,100
I would still be the most unimpressive one

611
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
among tens of thousands of people

612
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,580
pursuing Her Highness Fengjiu.

613
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,860
You both said that

614
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,460
the woman I loved was an imaginary figure,

615
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,820
not the real Fengjiu,

616
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,980
but Yan,

617
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,020
do you know?

618
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,420
I always wanted to leave the Fanyin Valley

619
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,980
not because I felt lonely in the Fanyin Valley

620
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,700
for it was winter all the year round,

621
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,340
but that

622
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,980
I met Her Highness Fengjiu.

623
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,780
I wanted to see her again.

624
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,220
Even if we couldn't talk,

625
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
it's fine.

626
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,180
I started longing for the outside world

627
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,540
after meeting Her Highness Fengjiu.

628
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,620
To get closer to her,

629
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,500
I collected all the information about her,

630
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,540
even the fake one.

631
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,900
As long as the information was about her,

632
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,620
I just couldn't let it go.

633
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,940
I knew the unrequited love wouldn't work,

634
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,780
but I just couldn't give up.

635
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,580
It's not because

636
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm silly,

637
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,540
but that

638
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
she's Her Highness Fengjiu.

639
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,420
I had never felt the warmth of spring, summer and autumn,

640
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,260
but Her Highness Fengjiu

641
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,740
made me feel warm

642
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,460
and made me realize the way to get warm.

643
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,300
I'm really happy

644
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,660
to know you

645
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,980
and become good friends with you.

646
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,220
I can talk to you freely and frankly,

647
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,100
but when I saw Her Highness Fengjiu,

648
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,740
I was speechless.

649
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,820
I could only wish her the very best.

650
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,900
Don't turn around.

651
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,740
Don't turn around.

652
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,020
You're sure to meet someone

653
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,300
who matches you

654
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,980
and loves you deeply.

655
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,500
Now she's found her happiness.

656
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,740
Stop looking at her.

657
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,500
Just walk straight ahead.

658
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,260
Right!

659
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,260
Don't turn around.

660
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,380
The road is ahead of you.

661
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Just go your way.

662
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,820
What's this?

663
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,140
I've sealed the primordial spirits of Shen Ye and Aranya

664
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,620
into this tree.

665
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,380
As shadows,

666
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,020
they still have primordial spirits?

667
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:00,940
Right.

668
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,660
They should have vanished into the universe

669
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
after they died,

670
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,980
but if everything in the world is inferred with common sense,

671
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,740
then many feelings will be wasted.

672
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,220
Now that I've sealed them here,

673
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,380
it's up to the will of Heaven

674
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,820
whether their fates can change millions of years later.

675
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,740
Though they're shadows of us,

676
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,820
their feelings for each other are deep and sincere.

677
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,780
Your Majesty, by choosing such a good place

678
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,700
to settle them down,

679
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,020
you've sort of made up for their regrets when they were alive.

680
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,500
We should go back now.

681
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,580
Why are you smiling?

682
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,660
I suddenly remembered that

683
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,020
when I worked as a fairy maid in Tai Chen Palace,

684
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,580
you never paid attention to me.

685
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Now you've actually asked me to go back with you.

686
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,900
It feels like a dream.

687
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,740
I didn't know it was you.

688
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,060
What if you had known?

689
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,580
If I had known,

690
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,460
we wouldn't have wasted so much time.

691
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,660
Ignorant youngsters,

692
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,780
you actually want to confine me?

693
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,340
Lianxin Mirror?

694
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,820
It's actually the Lianxin Mirror
which can purify the dark energy!

695
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,860
Dong Hua,

696
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,380
you really gave me no chance.

697
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,140
You forced me!

698
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,740
Nie Chuyin,

699
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,180
come to me now!

700
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,620
Your Majesty,

701
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,100
Xu Yang has set the ward with his life.

702
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,260
To enter the Forbidden Land

703
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,700
and take out the blood tear now,

704
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,500
Xu Yang must die.

705
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,740
But with my current power,

706
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,820
I can't kill Xu Yang and others all at once.

707
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,540
Try everything.

708
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,860
Kill him!

709
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,300
Yes!

710
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,100
Dong Hua has sealed part of my power.

711
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,580
If I want to break out of the ward,

712
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,980
I have to obtain the last blood tear.

713
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,180
Take it to me

714
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,820
as soon as possible.

715
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,900
Yes!

716
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,860
What're you doing?

717
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,780
Demon Lord Xu Yang,

718
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,540
I just saw you reinforcing the ward.

719
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,940
I was intended to help you.

720
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,700
Is there anything wrong with the ward?

721
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,220
I feel that something is wrong,

722
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,380
but I can't figure out why.

723
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,180
Let me help you reinforce the ward.

724
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,780
I'll help you, too.

725
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,420
Demon Lord Nie,

726
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,340
please tell the other demon lords that

727
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,540
the ward needs to be reinforced.

728
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,660
Make sure that they come with you.

729
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:52,980
OK.

730
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,380
Xie Guchou,

731
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,220
haven't you made a body for him

732
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,700
with the pimpon fruit,

733
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,420
why isn't he awake?

734
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,380
I just finished the body three days ago.

735
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,780
Moreover, buried under the imperial palace back then,
he had no bones left

736
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,540
but a tiny bit of primordial spirit sealed in the Nether World.

737
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,020
Unfortunately, after sleeping for a hundred years,

738
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,420
his primordial spirit has fallen into quietus.

739
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,820
If we resurrect him hurriedly,

740
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,060
I'm afraid the dark energy
inside his primordial spirit won't be removed.

741
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
So what?

742
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,020
Even if he's awake,

743
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,340
he'll be muddleheaded

744
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,340
and intellectually reduced to an infant.

745
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,980
What can we do

746
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,540
to make him stay clear and bright?

747
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,660
I do have a way,

748
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,260
but...

749
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,420
Please tell me.

750
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,460
If an immortal

751
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,420
is willing to give him half of his or her cultivation,

752
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,700
maybe he can remain clear and bright when he's resurrected.

753
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,860
Just take my cultivation.

754
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,460
Don't you want to think it over?

755
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,260
Qingti sacrificed his life to save me.

756
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,300
I just need to give him some cultivation.

757
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,060
No need to think about that.

758
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,020
One more thing.

759
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,460
According to the rules of the Immortal Record Book,

760
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,260
Ye Qingti has become an immortal by a rare chance,

761
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,740
so the person who bestowed him with an immortal body
should go to the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool

762
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,100
to help him wash away his mortal dust

763
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,740
for him to become a real immortal.

764
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,740
OK.

765
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,700
When he wants to start his cultivation,

766
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,940
I'll help him.

767
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,060
Take it easy.

768
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,860
The immortal body was just formed.

769
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,940
Haste does not bring success.

770
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
When the immortal body can take it,

771
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,740
I'll inform you for sure.

772
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,500
OK.
