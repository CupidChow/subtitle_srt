00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 45

3
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,980
Put them all inside.

4
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,260
Chacha!

5
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,220
Your Highness!

6
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
What are you doing?

7
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,900
Your Excellency.

8
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,060
Why are you here?

9
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,300
I want to live with you.

10
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,660
Anything wrong?

11
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,100
Live here?

12
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,540
What about at night?

13
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,300
Of course, we will sleep together

14
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,340
as husband and wife.

15
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,740
No!

16
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,340
Why not?

17
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,500
Why didn't you consult with me

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,620
on such an important matter?

19
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,300
I said no and I meant it!

20
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,820
Chacha!

21
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,540
You wait here!

22
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,580
Ask them to take Lord Xi Ze's stuff

23
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,740
to the east side room.

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,020
That's where he's going to stay in future.

25
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,060
But what His Excellency said makes sense!

26
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,020
I also think

27
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,460
a couple should live in the same room.

28
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,140
- This is... - Well said!

29
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,900
However,

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,620
she is reserved.

31
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,740
Chacha,

32
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,260
go get a new bed and put it beside hers.

33
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,660
We will sleep in the same room but on separate beds.

34
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,340
That will do, won't it?

35
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,940
Yes!

36
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,940
Yes for what? Cha...

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,260
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,620
how can you be so unreasonable!

39
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,180
Am I?

40
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,780
The door is open!

41
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,860
Didn't you say

42
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,500
you just liked the feeling of falling in love with me

43
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,780
in the dream?

44
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,580
Your Excellency!

45
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,060
Your Excellency, are you going to visit Her Highness?

46
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,620
I want to apologize to her.

47
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,420
Follow me please!

48
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,660
Your Excellency!

49
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,620
Your Excellency, look!

50
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,980
What a coincidence!

51
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,540
Lord Xi Ze just moved in Her Highness's bedroom.

52
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,620
It's not convenient now.

53
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,620
Please come some other day!

54
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,340
Why do you look extraordinarily beautiful today?

55
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,780
Are you not going back to the Qi Nan Palace?

56
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,980
Since Su Moye is there, I'm pretty assured.

57
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,220
I haven't seen him for ages.

58
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,540
How is he now?

59
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,380
You worried about me

60
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,220
and Shen Ye.

61
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,740
Now you're even worried about Su Moye.

62
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,860
Aren't you afraid that I'll become jea...

63
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,580
Fine! Fine!

64
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,180
I'll stop it!

65
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,380
The water lily in the yard looks pretty good today.

66
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,780
Would you come with me to enjoy it, honey?

67
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
Don't call me that!

68
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,260
Anything wrong?

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,420
Honey!

70
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,580
Honey!

71
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,020
Honey!

72
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,100
Honey! Honey! Honey!

73
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,740
Enough of that!

74
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,460
OK. I'll go with you!

75
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,420
Let's go!

76
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,820
I've never seen such exuberant lotuses

77
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,340
in the Sky Kingdom or Qingqiu.

78
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,620
How about asking Chacha

79
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,580
to pick some for us?

80
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,460
No need to bother her!

81
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,180
Which one do you like?

82
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,860
That one!

83
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,340
You are so...

84
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,620
Wow! Water lily can be enjoyed like this?

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,940
This is awesome!

86
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,900
You abused your magic power again.

87
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,500
Do you like it?

88
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,460
The little fish are adorable!

89
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,500
Lord Shen Ye.

90
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,460
I'm here to apologize to Your Highness Aranya.

91
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,540
I'm sorry that

92
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,460
I offended you verbally

93
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,780
because I drank too much the other day.

94
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,740
Never mind!

95
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,300
He came to you so late in the night.

96
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,060
He is really careless about avoiding any suspicion.

97
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,940
When you were painting

98
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
with Ji Heng in the room so late in the night,

99
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,500
did I say anything

100
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,540
while I curled up in the doorway?

101
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm so sleepy.

102
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,100
I'm going to sleep now!

103
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,740
Please enjoy the fish yourself.

104
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,940
Why are there so many changes in it?

105
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,740
Why is Xi Ze in the same room with her?

106
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,300
If she's not Aranya,

107
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,340
who on earth is she?

108
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,260
Are you going out?

109
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,220
I've stayed here for so many days.

110
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,180
I have to get back to the palace to check

111
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,420
how the magic instrument is now.

112
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,980
What magic instrument are you making?

113
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,820
One that can help us break this dream.

114
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,780
Will it really help?

115
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,820
You'll see when it's finished.

116
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,940
Fine!

117
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,980
What's in your hand?

118
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,460
It smells so good.

119
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,220
I made this soup for you in my spare time.

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,860
Delicious!

121
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,980
So delicious!

122
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,380
Best delicacy in this world!

123
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,900
You are perfunctory. And you didn't even try it.

124
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,820
Take it after you finish the magic instrument.

125
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,460
This soup is so good.

126
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,060
I cherish it.

127
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,900
Then finish it now before you leave.

128
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,740
I will!

129
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,460
Try it!

130
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,660
It must be good!

131
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,820
Here you are!

132
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,780
How is it?

133
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,060
Your Majesty,

134
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,340
you're finally back!

135
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,780
It's smooth

136
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,980
in general.

137
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,380
Now the base is done.

138
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,540
Thank you for staying here alone

139
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
to finish the mirror!

140
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,060
Not at all!

141
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,780
I shall try my best to fulfill your order.

142
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,260
Go back for a rest.

143
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,580
Leave the rest to me.

144
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,140
No, Your Majesty!

145
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,380
I will stay here with you.

146
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,580
The making of a magic instrument allows no carelessness.

147
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,820
Take a rest for some days and then come back.

148
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,260
What's wrong with you?

149
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,740
Are you still the most elegant

150
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,620
Second Prince Su of the West Sea?

151
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,300
Mr. Su,

152
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,220
did you break into any girl's room

153
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,780
last night

154
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,100
and get beaten out by her dad?

155
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,860
I've been making the magic instrument for His Majesty

156
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,140
day and night all these days.

157
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,740
What is this magic instrument

158
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,980
that has tortured you so badly?

159
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,940
It's nothing difficult

160
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,620
but just a bit tiring for me

161
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,220
to work on it alone.

162
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,700
I got it.

163
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,660
His Majesty has lived in my residence in the past few days.

164
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,020
He must have entrusted all the work to you,

165
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,540
hasn't he?

166
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,260
It's fine that you know it!

167
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,020
You know,

168
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,820
you let Chacha send

169
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,940
the so-called sugar foxes

170
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,260
at the most critical moment.

171
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,380
His Majesty left all the remaining work to me

172
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,020
without saying a word

173
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,540
as soon as he got that damn thing

174
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,060
and went straight off the mountain.

175
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,220
I didn't mean to blame you for it,

176
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,540
but you have to understand

177
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,540
that I become like this

178
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,500
all because I've been working around the clock

179
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,820
for seven to eight days,

180
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,500
which greatly depleted my magic power.

181
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,980
I can still stand here now

182
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,620
talking to you

183
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,420
because I've got a strong life.

184
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,500
Alright!

185
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,580
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

186
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,860
When he finishes the magic instrument,

187
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,180
he will surely repay you.

188
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,900
Repay me?

189
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:46,860
How?

190
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,820
Let me see!

191
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,380
Firstly,

192
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,140
you aren't short of jewelries.

193
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,780
Secondly, you don't like beauties.

194
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,500
I guess His Majesty will choose

195
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,700
a more friendly

196
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,220
and more precious way to repay you.

197
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,100
For example,

198
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,740
he may prepare a table of dishes in person

199
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,900
to entertain you.

200
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,180
He will cook for me in person?

201
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,020
Oh no!

202
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
If he can't think of repaying me,

203
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,380
do not remind him of it, alright?

204
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,820
Fine! Fine! Fine!

205
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,460
Let's keep it aside for now.

206
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,180
I came back today

207
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,140
to ask you something.

208
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,260
How is Shen Ye now?

209
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,500
Is there anything inappropriate

210
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,100
these days?

211
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,140
He didn't offend me

212
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,820
which should be considered appropriate.

213
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,380
Originally, he won't offend you in the first place.

214
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
That's how he treated Aranya before

215
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,860
and that's how he should treat you now.

216
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,980
However, he was drunk the other day

217
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,940
and talked to me deliriously.

218
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
Deliriously?

219
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,020
What did he say?

220
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
He said to me that...

221
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,020
we could have any type of relationship,

222
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,540
such as passerby,

223
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,700
personal enemy,

224
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
sworn enemy,

225
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,140
but just not possible for that.

226
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,220
Then he fell asleep as he talked.

227
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,780
I didn't get the answer from him.

228
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,700
He is supposed to remember it

229
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
and abide by it throughout his life.

230
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,140
This would be a blessing for Aranya.

231
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,140
However,

232
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,860
I heard Shen Ye took away three seasons

233
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,460
after Aranya died.

234
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,220
He surely loved her very much.

235
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,340
Everything happens for a reason.

236
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,820
His love

237
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
didn't just come out of nothing

238
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,460
after Aranya passed away.

239
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,740
You told me about the story

240
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,060
between them last time.

241
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,980
And it was half finished.

242
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,340
Could you finish the other half today?

243
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,620
I don't know much

244
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,180
about the other half.

245
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,820
I could recall only two of them.

246
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,220
After that,

247
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,700
Aranya led

248
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,780
quite an idle life.

249
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,660
Apart from practicing calligraphy and going to the opera,

250
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,060
she also taught archery for the masters on leave.

251
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,260
She came across Wen Tian once in a while

252
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,700
and would bring her back

253
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,100
to dine together.

254
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,300
I remember

255
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,140
she once brought Wen Tian back.

256
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,700
Wen Tian meticulously asked her

257
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,860
if she could meet Shen Ye in the Mengchun Courtyard

258
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,140
as she wanted to ask Shen Ye for a few chess techniques.

259
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,700
Aranya was so unrestrained.

260
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,300
She must have approved it.

261
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,460
Yes!

262
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,340
Her tolerance was the best

263
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,660
and she was the most unrestrained

264
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
that I've seen in my life.

265
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,380
Wen Tian came in and went out
of the Mengchun Courtyard very often since then

266
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,180
to play chess with Shen Ye.

267
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,980
It seemed that Wen Tian fell in love with Shen Ye,

268
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,460
while Shen Ye

269
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,980
also admired her.

270
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,220
Soon they lived in peace with each other,

271
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,780
but an accident happened right after that.

272
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,860
What was it?

273
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,620
It was related to Lord Xi Ze.

274
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,300
Your Highness!

275
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,780
Don't stand on ceremony.

276
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,340
The chief steward said

277
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,220
you needed a secret material for the sword.

278
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,460
It is the stone from the Qi Nan Mountain.

279
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,780
They didn't get the stone you need,

280
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,580
so you have to pick them in person.

281
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,300
I'll visit Xi Ze tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

282
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,340
Shall we go together?

283
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,740
Do you consider me as a bird

284
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,780
caged here and invite me out

285
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,860
out of mercy?

286
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,220
If you say so,

287
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,940
so be it!

288
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,460
Nobody is allowed to enter the Qi Nan Mountain
without His Majesty's consent,

289
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,900
but I'd love to have a look.

290
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,700
Could I come with you by then?

291
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,700
Sure you will go with me.

292
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,460
Not bad!

293
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,300
Wen Tian should come along,

294
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,860
in case we end up fighting with each other.

295
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,700
Let's go!

296
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,540
Your Highness, off we go for quarrying.

297
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,140
Sure!

298
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,940
There you came so quickly

299
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,460
and you have even brought me the cakes.

300
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,420
I heard you captured a Quanyin Beast.

301
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,260
Yes!

302
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,780
So I wrote you a letter

303
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,180
to ask you to come here to practice martial arts.

304
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,100
However, the Quanyin beast is very dangerous.

305
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,220
So

306
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,780
where is it now?

307
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,060
Follow me!

308
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,420
This Quanyin beast has been a disaster over the years.

309
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,380
I captured it with great efforts.

310
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,300
Among all the beasts,

311
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,100
it is the most agile.

312
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,380
It has no sense of physical pain,

313
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,060
which makes it most suitable for practicing martial arts.

314
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,740
If you could shoot it successfully,

315
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,980
there would be nothing you can't shoot in the Fanyin Valley.

316
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,740
I'd love to have a try.

317
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,020
You can't shoot it by aiming at it.

318
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,620
What you shot before were all slower than your arrows.

319
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
But the Quanyin beast

320
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,460
is always a few times faster than your arrow.

321
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,340
You'd better calculate the speed of your arrow

322
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,820
and that of its movement

323
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,380
to decide the deviation angle
that you need to consider while aiming.

324
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,380
Aranya, it's time for you to come out.

325
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,180
Not being able to shoot it in a short time is quite normal.

326
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,220
Don't get yourself swallowed by it because of fatigue.

327
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,940
Give me fifteen minutes.

328
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,700
I'll come out if I can't shoot it successfully.

329
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,260
Aranya!

330
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,900
Aranya!

331
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,420
Shen Ye.

332
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,900
You're more composed now in face of battles.

333
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,460
The Quanyin Beast is extremely fierce.

334
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,900
Why do you let Aranya

335
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,980
fight against it, master?

336
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,340
She shot it, didn't she?

337
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,860
Where were you when she was in danger?

338
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,420
She is your wife!

339
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,620
I was having cakes

340
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,100
and wasn't paying much attention.

341
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,340
Besides,

342
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,060
we just have a paper of marriage
but we are actually not a couple?

343
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,340
Neither me nor Aranya thought about it that way.

344
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,580
And you lent her a hand just now, right?

345
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,180
Wouldn't it be unnecessary

346
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,180
for me to have a hand in it?

347
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,540
If I hadn't helped her immediately,

348
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,620
her arm would have been bitten off by the Quanyin Beast.

349
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,500
It's alright

350
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,140
as she is safe now.

351
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,260
Take her off for some rest.

352
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,260
I'm going to prepare some food.

353
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,100
Don't you think my blood is dirty?

354
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,700
Why would you allow it to smudge your hand?

355
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,300
Behave yourself!

356
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,940
You have fallen in love with me, Shen Ye!

357
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,060
You fall in love with me!

358
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,620
Shen Ye!

359
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,020
Stay still!

360
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,620
I'm having a headache!

361
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,900
Give me a smile!

362
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,180
How presumptuous!

363
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,500
I guess nobody ever teased you

364
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,580
by pinching your chin like I did.

365
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,860
As Aranya was in danger in the Quanyin Beast's stone formation,

366
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,780
for the first time Shen Ye

367
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,860
revealed his affection to Aranya.

368
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,780
While you were narrating the first half,

369
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,900
I was really worried

370
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,580
whether Shen Ye really liked Aranya.

371
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,140
Now it came to the latter half,

372
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,500
I think

373
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
it's a pretty good ending.

374
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,420
It's not the ending yet.

375
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,820
A lot of things happened afterwards.

376
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,580
This was the only thing which could be considered good.

377
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,260
Well,

378
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,060
were Xi Ze and Aranya a couple at the time?

379
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,340
Yes!

380
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,300
But Lord Xi Ze wasn't so interested in love affairs.

381
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,940
The marriage was meaningless

382
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
to him.

383
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,860
Then why wouldn't Lord Xi Ze

384
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,420
let Aranya and Shen Ye be together?

385
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,300
Lord Xi Ze never proposed to divorce

386
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,060
over all those years

387
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,980
because he took pity on Aranya

388
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,260
for her identity as the princess.

389
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,060
She would lead a better life anyhow

390
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,620
in the name of his wife.

391
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,780
Besides,

392
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,980
even if they got divorced,

393
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,780
Shen Ye and Aranya

394
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,740
couldn't be together publicly.

395
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,900
In that sense,

396
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,780
Lord Xi Ze was really

397
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,340
a caring person of great loyalty.

398
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,540
What happened next?

399
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,220
What happened to Shen Ye and Aranya in the end?

400
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,300
After the day on the Qi Nan Mountain,

401
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,460
Shen Ye was trapped
in Aranya's residence for another two years.

402
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,340
But I have no idea about

403
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
what happened to them.

404
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,380
The West Sea happened to be in trouble,

405
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
so I had to get back.

406
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,940
I don't think it was a big deal.

407
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,060
You just didn't want to stay in the Fanyin Valley

408
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,900
and see Aranya and Shen Ye

409
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,500
be together every day.

410
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,100
You have seen that?

411
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,420
You can't forget about Aranya's death

412
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,260
and you sound very caring

413
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,260
when speaking of her affairs.

414
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,020
Moye,

415
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,300
I'm not an idiot.

416
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,140
Aranya and Shen Ye

417
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,860
confessed to each other at the time.

418
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,060
Even if you had any feelings for Aranya,

419
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,620
you couldn't say anything

420
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,500
or do anything.

421
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,140
I just didn't expect

422
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,940
so many things happened afterwards.

423
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,020
What happened after that?

424
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,500
Two years later,

425
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,580
His Majesty Xiangli Que passed away because of illness.

426
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,260
Prince Xiangli He took the throne.

427
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,060
However,

428
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,060
in less than seven days,

429
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,700
the neighboring night owl clan

430
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,580
initiated attacks to them with the reason that

431
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,740
the inseparable king bird clan connived
with its people to hunt cross border.

432
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,220
Xiangli He led his soldiers to defend

433
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,700
and stopped the night owl clan by the Sixing River.

434
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,420
Xiangli He died in the battle

435
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,900
on August 17th.

436
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,140
Xiangli He didn't have any heir.

437
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,660
According to the succeeding sequence,

438
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,260
Aranya should take it over

439
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,460
as Junuo had been deprived of her titles at the time.

440
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,860
However, on August 19th,

441
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,820
Junuo in exile was taken back to succeed to the throne.

442
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,260
The next day,

443
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,180
Aranya hanged herself.

444
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,700
Hanged herself?

445
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,420
How was that possible?

446
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,460
I didn't know the details in it.

447
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,180
When I came back to the Fanyin Valley again,

448
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,180
many years had gone by.

449
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,220
Aranya's primordial spirit

450
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,060
had dissipated.

451
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,420
The royals claimed that she hanged herself.

452
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,380
Didn't anyone give you a reason

453
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,820
why she hanged herself?

454
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,220
I also heard

455
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,220
ever since Aranya passed away,

456
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,460
Junuo listed her name

457
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,380
as a taboo.

458
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,900
Do you know why?

459
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,140
It's true.

460
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,820
And I heard a kind of saying

461
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,420
that His Majesty was poisoned by Aranya

462
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,100
rather than dying of illness.

463
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,700
Do you believe it?

464
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,140
Why would Aranya poison His Majesty?

465
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,940
Even if it was true,

466
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,300
why wasn't she convicted

467
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,260
above board?

468
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,940
As an outsider,

469
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,460
you even have found out a lot of oddity in it,

470
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,580
haven't you?

471
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,740
But,

472
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,860
to the inseparable king bird clan,

473
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,900
hanging is indeed a good way

474
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,460
to dissipate one's primordial spirit.

475
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,620
That's why they dared to cheat me with it.

476
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,660
How about Shen Ye?

477
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,180
Shen Ye?

478
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,820
After the death of His Majesty,

479
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,220
he was taken back to the Qi Nan Palace again.

480
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,460
He didn't give a hand

481
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,860
while Aranya got arrested.

482
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,180
Instead, he submitted a memorial,

483
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,860
in which he pleaded to

484
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,380
hand over Aranya's case to the palace,

485
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,020
claiming that if Aranya committed a serious crime,

486
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,580
she should be reasonably executed by the palace.

487
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,860
That was impossible!

488
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,660
Didn't Shen Ye have feelings for Aranya?

489
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,500
Obviously, Shen Ye

490
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,780
should go to save Aranya against all odds.

491
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
Judging from that,

492
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
he was not sincere to Aranya.

493
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,220
I'm afraid his real purpose was to get back to the Qi Nan Palace.

494
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,980
Aranya's sincerity to Shen Ye

495
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,020
ended in vain after all.

496
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,540
It didn't make sense.

497
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,060
Didn't you say

498
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,140
Shen Ye lived in Aranya's residence for two more years?

499
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,660
It's easy to cheat a person for some time,

500
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,460
but not possible

501
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,740
for such a long time.

502
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
Do you think he could do that

503
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,660
given his personality?

504
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,860
If he really wanted to,

505
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,900
there was a chance.

506
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,260
But anyway,

507
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,420
Shen Ye didn't save Aranya.

508
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,500
On the contrary, he hit her when she was down.

509
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,860
That's outrageous

510
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,420
and so disappointing!

511
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Rumor has it that

512
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,820
Aranya hanged herself

513
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,500
on the day after

514
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,980
Shen Ye submitted the memorial.

515
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,540
Your Excellency!

516
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,860
Come in!

517
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,100
Eh...

518
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,980
Your Excellency, Her Majesty will arrive soon.

519
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,140
OK!

520
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,140
You go and inform Aranya of it!

521
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,420
Her Majesty said

522
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,100
she was coming to check out

523
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,060
Your Excellency's progress of sword forging.

524
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,300
How come?

525
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,500
It should have happened after half a year.

526
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,460
What did you say?

527
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,660
Nothing!

528
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,060
Guide Her Majesty to the sword forging room.

529
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,180
I'll be waiting there.

530
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,260
Yes!

531
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,380
Archmage,

532
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,700
how is it going with the sword?

533
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,780
I guessed Your Majesty came here

534
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,460
not just to check out

535
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,060
on the progress.

536
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,100
Surely nothing can be held back

537
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,500
from your eyes.

538
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,540
I haven't thanked you in person

539
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,340
when you saved Junuo

540
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,940
from the Lingshu Stage.

541
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,340
You don't need to thank me.

542
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,540
I knew

543
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,620
you did it not because

544
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,700
I am your auntie,

545
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,540
but that Junuo is the only offspring

546
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,540
from late emperor!

547
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,740
That's why you saved her.

548
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,380
Now that you knew it,

549
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,060
it becomes less necessary for you to thank me.

550
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,700
It's getting late. Please go back, Your Majesty!

551
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,460
Your Majesty!

552
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,140
Rise!

553
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,020
What do you want to know?

554
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,060
Who on earth is Aranya?

555
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,940
Why would she create this dream?

556
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,620
What is her purpose?

557
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,980
Why couldn't even the Emperor Dong Hua break it?

558
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,860
Aranya is my younger sister.

559
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,220
I remember she was soft and cute

560
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,300
when she was born.

561
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,420
I really liked her when I was young.

562
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,180
But...

563
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,860
she gradually became my nightmare.

564
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,180
Was she anybody bad?

565
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,660
No!

566
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
She was the one I'm envious of.

567
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,420
She lived carefreely

568
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,500
and died with vitality.

569
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,780
It was only because

570
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,780
she stood in my way to succeed to the throne!

571
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,300
Our mother thought of ways

572
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,140
to twist our destinies.

573
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,540
In the end,

574
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,060
we all got our retribution.

575
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,460
The Dream of Aranya is the retribution

576
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,500
for the inseparable king bird clan.

577
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,860
Retribution?

578
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,300
Jielu, you have never fallen in love,

579
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,580
so you won't understand the bitterness in it

580
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,460
or what one could sacrifice

581
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,140
for their love.

582
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,300
It all should have ended

583
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,500
in our generation.

584
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,060
But someone unexpectedly

585
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,300
sacrificed his lifetime of cultivation for Aranya.

586
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,980
I didn't get the love in my heart.

587
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,020
Neither did Aranya

588
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
nor did that man!

589
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,820
We searched back and forth for a whole life,

590
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,860
and ended up living in the dream.

591
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,380
Your Majesty, I don't understand it.

592
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,500
You don't need to.

593
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,100
In fact, the real Aranya

594
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,460
has dissipated long time ago.

595
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,900
What is left of her

596
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,180
is just our obsessiveness.

597
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,260
This man's cultivation is nowhere near

598
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,140
that of Emperor Dong Hua.

599
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,340
Emperor Dong Hua stayed in the dream

600
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,140
for the sake of the girl in there.

601
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,020
When the time comes,

602
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,220
nobody can stop him.

603
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,460
Spread my word now!

604
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,540
Summon your brother back!

605
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,420
My brother...

606
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,660
He also likes the girl?

607
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,660
How does he dare to compete against Emperor Dong Hua?

608
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,340
He just takes Xiaojiu as a real friend

609
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,940
and worries about her safety.

610
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Kid,

611
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,500
I really hope

612
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,140
the tragedy of the inseparable king bird clan

613
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,580
can be ended in our generation.

614
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,500
Your generation can have the happiness you want

615
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,820
and don't ruin the clan's future

616
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,220
for illusioned love.

617
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,060
I didn't make it.

618
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
Neither did Aranya.

619
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,220
Hope you can make it.

620
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,140
Your Majesty!

621
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,820
Off you go!

622
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,860
Summon your brother back!

623
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,300
Yes!

624
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,900
Your Majesty,

625
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,700
what happened to your mother in the end?

626
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,500
Did she regret?

627
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,340
Mother always left the best to me.

628
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,740
But she never knew

629
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,460
what I really wanted.

630
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,340
After knowing

631
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
the life-and-death romance of Aranya,

632
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,940
I decided to marry

633
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,100
an ordinary man.

634
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,620
We joined hands

635
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,340
to imprison my mother in the palace.

636
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,700
Right at the 20th year of her imprisonment,

637
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,940
she became mad.

638
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,580
Seldom did she speak.

639
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,340
Most of the time, she spoke of Aranya.

640
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,460
Now when I look back

641
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,740
after knowing all the truth,

642
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,180
I just think we were quite pathetic

643
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,140
as we were all manipulated

644
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,540
in the palace over those years.

645
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,340
I was pathetically in love.

646
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,580
Aranya was pathetically out of love.

647
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,220
But that man was still the most pathetic

648
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,780
as he loved Aranya so much

649
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,020
and did so much to stay with her.

650
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,860
In the end,

651
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,260
they were forever torn apart.

652
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,980
Do you regret, mother?

653
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,580
Emperor Dong Hua can surely

654
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,020
end the ward created by Shen Ye in the dream.

655
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,220
When he comes out,

656
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,580
the Fanyin Valley will come back to normal by itself.

657
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,620
The tragedy you created

658
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,540
can finally be brought to an end.

659
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,380
Junuo really said that

660
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,220
His Majesty was waiting for a chance?

661
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,340
I don't dare to cheat Your Highness.

662
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,820
There is less likely to be any issues in that case.

663
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,260
Take her back!

664
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,460
I'll stay here.

665
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,260
I will summon you if I need.

666
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,220
Yes!

667
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,700
The smart work and the wise worry.

668
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,180
When you act helplessly,

669
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,940
you'll be free from the burden of the worldly affairs.

670
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,140
You know I like to live freely,

671
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,740
but you left me here to keep up the situation.

672
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,020
Dong Hua, if you can feel it,

673
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,620
just stop indulging yourself in the romance.

674
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,780
Get out of the dream now, please!
