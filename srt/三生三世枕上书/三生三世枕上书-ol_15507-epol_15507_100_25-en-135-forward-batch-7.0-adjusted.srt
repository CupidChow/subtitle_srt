1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 25

3
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,820
What's the tea

4
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,540
that Su Moye made recently called?

5
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,020
Bifuchun tea.

6
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,580
Taste is good.

7
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,340
Would you like to taste it?

8
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,420
The tea...

9
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,060
I don't know Your Majesty is here.

10
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,180
Sorry for my impoliteness.

11
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,500
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

12
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,500
Have a seat.

13
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,580
Are you surprised at meeting me here?

14
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,380
No, I'm not.

15
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,980
This is the first time that I meet Your Majesty.

16
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,100
I couldn't help being delightful.

17
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,540
Please excuse me, Your Majesty.

18
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,220
I'm sorry for the slip of hand,

19
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,020
and losing manners in front of Your Majesty.

20
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,340
Excuse Fengjiu for leaving first and

21
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,620
allow me to learn from

22
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,420
Buddhist Theories and Taoist Principles
with Your Majesty another day.

23
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,860
The slip of a cup of tea can't be regarded as losing manners.

24
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,780
Try this one.

25
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,940
The water is cooled when I took the pot just now.

26
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,380
If you spill the water out again,

27
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,700
I may consider it as losing manners.

28
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,220
It's so humorous of you, Your Majesty.

29
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,100
It's so unbelievable.

30
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,780
When I invited His Majesty to see the Haotian Tower,

31
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,060
he refused me.

32
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,020
But now he is entangling with some fairy.

33
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,780
Does he have a thing for that fairy?

34
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,900
Does that mean

35
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,100
if I have a walk around the Lotus Pond

36
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,660
and happen to meet Your Highness,

37
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
there's a thing between us?

38
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,340
Of course not.

39
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,100
Si Ming,

40
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,700
the ordinary live in the mortal realm

41
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,100
while our immortals live in the Sanqing Fairyland.

42
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,700
His Majesty

43
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,860
can really be regarded as

44
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,020
being indifferent to everything all over the universe.

45
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,580
Have you ever seen him

46
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,420
show any interest in anyone else?

47
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,460
During the alteration of times,

48
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,380
the Sky Kingdom also witnesses some changes.

49
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,060
The Heavenly Kings from generation to generation come back
but go cultivate powerful spiritual strength again,

50
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,740
then they come back with more powerful strength.

51
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,540
Only His Majesty sticks to the

52
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,540
place over the Three-thousand Fairy Lands

53
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
in a consistent way.

54
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,860
Then do you know

55
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,500
why he hasn't acted as

56
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,460
indifferent as he used to be to that lady?

57
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,780
Aren't you curious about what's behind it?

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,220
Your Highness,

59
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,980
do you know the reason why no one believes

60
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,020
the gossip of Lord Cheng Yu and you,

61
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,020
although you've been trying that hard to spread it?

62
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,100
There's not a single piece of gossip conjecturing

63
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,940
about the relationship between you two in the Sky Kingdom.

64
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,780
What are you talking about, Si Ming?

65
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,580
I don't know it at all.

66
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,300
But keep saying.

67
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,260
A relationship that is conjectured and reproached about

68
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,900
won't be that straight forward,

69
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,300
will it?

70
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,780
Isn't the act of being straight forward

71
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,980
the right thing to do?

72
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,180
You aren't the god to govern the waters in the Four Seas,

73
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,100
why should you be straight forward?

74
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,740
There must be someone who has something to hide
and doesn't want to be straight forward first.

75
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,580
Only concealment can catch someone's eye

76
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,740
and cause others' conjecture.

77
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,100
Then the gossip can be spread further and further.

78
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,300
It's so well-planned.

79
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,500
I have to comprehend seriously.

80
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,020
Something

81
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,180
that is as concrete as it is

82
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,060
won't be worth curiosity,

83
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,780
while something is ambiguous,

84
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,100
you tell the truth,

85
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,860
won't you be curious to dig deep into something behind?

86
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,460
It makes sense.

87
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,500
But does it have anything to do with

88
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,340
what I have asked you

89
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,740
about His Majesty just now?

90
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
Have a look at the two persons.

91
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
Could the two afford the fame of being straight forward

92
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
and having a clear conscience respectively?

93
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,460
Of course, they could.

94
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,380
The fairies

95
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,940
that His Majesty once met

96
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
either worship him secretly

97
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,420
or chase after him agitato.

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,540
So it won't be a big deal that

99
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,820
His Majesty feels a little curious when he seldom

100
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,220
meets someone who doesn't want to have a connection with him

101
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,420
with an ambiguous attitude, will it?

102
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,180
Si Ming,

103
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,820
you really are the mobile gossip encyclopedia in the Sky Kingdom.

104
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,460
I do acknowledge your superiority in this aspect.

105
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,180
You're flattering me, Your Highness.

106
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,380
If I were not aware of

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,220
your great talent for the gossip thing,

108
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,540
I would consider that

109
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,460
you're changing the subject on purpose

110
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,580
to protect that fairy.

111
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,020
What's in your hand?

112
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,460
The Thirty-six Stratagems to help you
nail the victory in the battle all over the Four Seas.

113
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
Isn't it the play you write when you're at your leisure?

114
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,460
I suddenly came up with some muse days ago,

115
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,340
so I intend to write a continuation.

116
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,020
You've never won a single time in a fight since you were a kid.

117
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,500
In case someone believes in what the play you write says,

118
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,580
and follows it,

119
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,460
won't it mislead him?

120
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,220
Won't those who are willing to believe in what a play says

121
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,860
be absent both in heaven or on earth?

122
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,100
That makes sense.

123
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,700
I heard the two immortal lords were too scared,

124
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,180
when they came back to their own fairy mountain.

125
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,820
I haven't punched them.

126
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,980
Mi Gu can prove it for me.

127
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,860
I know you don't like them from the bottom of your heart.

128
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I certainly won't force you.

129
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,340
But since you don't have the obsessiveness anymore,

130
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,540
why don't you give yourself a chance

131
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,380
to experience the happiness that a young girl can have?

132
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,780
His Majesty is coming.

133
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,060
Welcome you, Your Majesty.

134
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,620
Rise.

135
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,900
Thanks, Your Majesty.

136
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,300
Today Emperor Dong Hua should have admired
the flowers with me today.

137
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Hasn't he come yet?

138
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,980
Report to you, father.

139
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,420
Chief Immortal Messenger Chong Lin,
who is subordinate to Emperor Dong Hua,

140
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,780
came to notice that

141
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,780
His Majesty has been studying etiquette and law these days,

142
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,980
and he won't attend the ceremony.

143
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,220
As far as I'm concerned,

144
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,380
His Majesty is clement.

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,300
How come we start the ceremony first to

146
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,220
accept His Majesty's clemency?

147
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,820
Deliver the dishes.

148
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,020
Start the ceremony.

149
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,580
Hurry up, Sister Fengjiu.

150
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,060
Li, come here.

151
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,580
Don't be hurt by the spiritual power

152
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,700
of the Miaohua Mirror.

153
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,540
The Miaohua Mirror?

154
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,620
Sister Fengjiu,

155
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,780
isn't it a waterfall?

156
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,060
Don't you know that

157
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,060
the waterfall

158
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,260
is where the Miaohua Mirror is located?

159
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,540
If your magic power is strong enough,

160
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,140
you can drive the Miaohua Mirror with your power.

161
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,060
Then you'll be able to see how any generation rises and falls

162
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,660
among billions of generations of the mortal realm.

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,020
Sister Fengjiu, you mean

164
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,860
we can see any place in the mortal realm through this waterfall.

165
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Then let's have a try.

166
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,140
The immortal waterfalls surrounding
the Miaohua Mirror are powerful.

167
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,780
Only immortals with strong magic power

168
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,660
can overwhelm the immortal waterfalls without being hurt.

169
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,620
Who can own this kind of magic power?

170
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,460
Can my father own it?

171
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,100
Among the gods, only Emperor Dong Hua can make it.

172
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,300
You can't make it.

173
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Stay away from it.

174
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,060
My father is the craftiest.

175
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,180
I do remember that

176
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,740
I slept in my mother's Changsheng Hall at night yesterday,

177
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,420
but when I woke up this morning in my Qingyun Hall.

178
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,540
Father lied to me that

179
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,300
it was because I sleepwalked back,

180
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,580
but the truth was that he wanted to be with mother alone,

181
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,380
and he embraced me back to my place after I was asleep.

182
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,260
It's so crafty of him

183
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,940
to lie to his own son.

184
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,620
Then why don't you

185
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,940
knock the door of the Changsheng Hall

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,300
and cry out loud as soon as you wake up?

187
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,780
How impolitic you are!

188
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,540
I heard that only women can badger someone

189
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,780
by means of crying, making troubles and committing suicide.

190
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,780
Can a boy do this either?

191
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,940
Certainly.

192
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
It's the most effective method

193
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,580
all over the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

194
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,180
As long as you master it,

195
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,580
there won't be anything that you can't achieve on earth.

196
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,780
Let's go.

197
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,700
Sister Fengjiu,

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,780
how long will it take to go to the Chengtian Stage for a play?

199
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
It's there, the one ahead of us.

200
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,500
Shall we have a rest here first

201
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,780
and take some snacks?

202
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,020
Then we walk faster after eating them up.

203
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,700
Have a seat.

204
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,900
You guess, what's delicious in it?

205
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,300
Smell it.

206
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,540
Father,

207
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,700
the flower spirit in the Jade Pool has been well cultivated.

208
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,300
I sincerely invite you to have a look at them.

209
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,100
I haven't seen the flower spirit in the Jade Pool
in a hundred and twenty years.

210
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,660
Let's admire them together.

211
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,780
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

212
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,220
What... What's up?

213
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,060
Something's wrong.

214
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,700
Watch out.

215
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:28,820
Watch out.

216
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,060
Are you fine?

217
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,860
Why are you coming here?

218
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,140
I'm coming to check on you.

219
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,540
Go away.

220
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,740
It's my fault to fail to cultivate flower spirit

221
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,860
and disturb Your Majesty.

222
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,820
Even death cannot atone for the offence.

223
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,940
You can't even perform well on the post of

224
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,940
the Jade Pool Fairy which has little to do.

225
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,780
I can hardly absolve myself from the blame.

226
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,100
Please judge it cautiously, father.

227
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,700
It's me who force Lord Cheng Yu

228
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,980
to cultivate the flower spirit for me

229
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,060
regardless of the flowering phase.

230
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,580
Please punish me together.

231
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,020
Don't talk nonsense, Your Highness.

232
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm the one who takes care of the flower spirit.

233
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,580
I'm the one who should take the responsibility.

234
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,900
And there's nothing to do with Third Prince.

235
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,380
The flower spirit was cultivated in the Yuan Ji Palace.

236
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,700
How could it have nothing to do with me?

237
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,300
It's fine. It's fine.

238
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,620
Hundreds of flowers are in bloom,

239
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,140
and immortal fellows are gathering together to celebrate

240
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,820
in the Mile-fleurs Ceremony this time,

241
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,300
which is the contribution of you two.

242
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,900
But there's something wrong with the flower spirit,

243
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,460
you two also should take the responsibility.

244
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,380
Merits equal demerits.

245
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,500
It'll be fine, if you two behave well next time.

246
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,220
- Thanks for your forgiveness, father.
- Thanks for your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

247
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,700
Why is it on fire?

248
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,420
Li, go find your mother

249
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,380
to carry out rescue right now.

250
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,660
Zhihe,

251
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,940
why don't you conjure up rain?

252
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,780
The gods entitles you to the Water God.

253
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,340
What's it from,

254
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,020
and what's it for?

255
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,340
It would be fine,

256
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,340
if the fierce beast is killed directly by the pottery-made sword.

257
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,300
But the process of killing it to death

258
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,340
will take long.

259
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,260
I'm afraid Mi Gu wouldn't be able to hang in there for so long.

260
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,660
What I can do is lure the beast out of its place.

261
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,180
Your Highness.

262
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,340
Move, move, move.

263
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,260
Leave here now.

264
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,740
Move. Move. Move.

265
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,860
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

266
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,500
Your Highness.

267
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,020
Mi Gu, give me your clothes.

268
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,340
Hurry up.

269
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,660
Your Highness, well... I...

270
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,220
Do you get a problem with

271
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,020
my clothes?

272
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,180
How dare I?

273
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,700
It's just if I lend the gown this time,

274
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,020
I'll have to clean it when I return it later on.

275
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,540
And I'll have to meet Your Majesty again.

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,460
Thus, I'll bother Your Majesty once more, won't I?

277
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,660
I'm

278
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,340
afraid to disturb Your Majesty.

279
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,340
Don't get it wrong, Your Majesty.

280
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,580
It isn't because Her Highness doesn't want to meet Your Majesty.

281
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,020
Your Majesty is so distinguished

282
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,620
that Her Highness even wants to meet you every day.

283
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,260
Since then,

284
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,060
leave it to you as a souvenir.

285
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,740
Don't turn it back.

286
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,740
I don't mean it.

287
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,740
Then give it back to me

288
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,700
after cleaning it.

289
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,460
I don't want to borrow your gown, do I?

290
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,900
It's warm today.

291
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,300
It isn't cold at all.

292
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,900
I could not like to borrow the gown, could I?

293
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,020
No, you couldn't.

294
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,660
Why?

295
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,700
I've saved you.

296
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,660
A kindness of saving a life can be requited by sacrificing one.

297
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,780
Not to mention cleaning a piece of clothing.

298
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,300
Why does Your Majesty force me?

299
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,340
Except it,

300
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,620
I don't have any other interest.

301
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,180
Your Majesty, you're so...

302
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,380
What's wrong with me?

303
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,340
Why do you save them?

304
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,100
When my aunt taught me, she once said that

305
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,940
the Princess of Qingqiu doesn't need to strive
for the first for everything.

306
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,260
What Qingqiu wants from me is not the honor I can get,

307
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,740
but to step forward bravely when something happens.

308
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,700
If I left them in the lurch this time,

309
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
how would I make my subjects

310
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,060
believe in me continuously?

311
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,420
Your Highness has been working so hard to hold the ceremony.

312
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,900
You can finally take a rest now.

313
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,660
Your Highness.

314
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,060
Cheng Yu.

315
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,460
There's nothing special.

316
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,060
I just come to express my gratitude.

317
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,980
It's not easy to cultivate flower spirit.

318
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,500
You don't have to blame yourself.

319
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,100
It's the matter within my duties.

320
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,900
I owe you a debt of gratitude

321
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,060
no matter what's happened.

322
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,620
I'll pay you back later on.

323
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,860
How do you intend to pay me back?

324
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,340
Let me ponder over it.

325
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,340
You have to pay me back.

326
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,660
I'll go ask whether Si Ming has found the reason.

327
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,700
Then I'll show you my gratitude later.

328
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,460
Sister Fengjiu,

329
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,420
you've been absent-minded since you came back,

330
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,620
which is the same as my mother used to act.

331
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,660
Do you have your sweetheart?

332
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
Isn't it the token of love?

333
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Don't talk nonsense.

334
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,740
Bow to you, Your Highness Fengjiu,
Your Highness Heavenly Grandson.

335
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,140
Has aunt ordered anything?

336
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Her Majesty has asked me

337
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,860
to send the books to Your Highness.

338
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,380
Have you said something to your mother?

339
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,140
I haven't mentioned anything.

340
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,420
You've taught me to be thick-skinned.

341
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,100
So I ask my mother what it means,

342
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,820
and how to be more thick-skinned than my father.

343
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,220
Her Majesty has ordered

344
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,380
if Your Highness doesn't finish copying the books,

345
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,980
she will arrange a blind-date banquet

346
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,700
lasting from evening to dawn for you.

347
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,740
What?

348
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,740
A blind date will be enough.

349
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,300
Why should it be a blind-date banquet?

350
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,220
Sister Fengjiu,

351
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,340
what's a blind-date banquet?

352
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,980
There are different public opinions

353
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,820
on the fire on the Chengtian Stage in the immortal realm today.

354
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,900
Some say that you are trapped

355
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,180
in the mortal realm

356
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,940
from the Sanqing Fairyland.

357
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,860
One mentions

358
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,820
the fire set by the Red-fire Beast on the Chengtian Stage.

359
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,900
When Prince Zhihe,
Your Majesty's foster sister, was stuck in the fire,

360
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,300
you came to

361
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,540
help her out in time,

362
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,020
which showed how differently

363
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,460
you treated your foster sister.

364
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,780
Another one says that

365
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,260
when the Chengtian Stage was on fire,

366
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,860
His Majesty passed by

367
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,060
and saw an extremely beautiful fairy

368
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,740
fighting fiercely with the Red-fire Beast,

369
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,220
but she was the underdog.

370
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,420
His Majesty can't bear not

371
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,420
to help her out.

372
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,020
Someone said that you felt urgent to

373
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,100
help the beauty out.

374
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,620
I don't believe it.

375
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,420
But if

376
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,980
you change your mind

377
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,540
and decide to marry an empress,

378
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,860
Zhihe will be a great option.

379
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,580
How about

380
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,540
me mentioning it to my father

381
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,900
to pardon Zhihe's crime of degradation

382
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,100
and allow her to go back to the Tai Chen Palace,

383
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,460
when she comes back.

384
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,300
A beauty?

385
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,060
They think she looks pretty.

386
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,660
Then they really have good taste.

387
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,660
You do meet a beauty on the Chengtian Stage.

388
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,220
Do you come to play the game of go with me?

389
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,780
Let's play the game of go. Let's do it. Do it.

390
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,700
Your Highness.

391
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,700
Your Highness.

392
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,140
Your Highness,

393
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,420
haven't you dressed up?

394
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,140
What's the time?

395
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,980
Why are you all here?

396
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,060
Her Majesty has ordered

397
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,820
to let us dress you up

398
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,580
and escort you to the Baoyueguang Garden hurriedly.

399
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,220
Young talents all over the Eight Deserts and Six Directions

400
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,020
are waiting for Your Highness.

401
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,340
Aunt,

402
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
how cruelhearted you are!

403
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,260
Why do you save them?

404
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,860
When my aunt taught me, she once said that

405
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,780
the Princess of Qingqiu doesn't need to strive
for the first for everything.

406
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,220
What Qingqiu wants from me is not the honor I can get,

407
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,020
but to step forward bravely when something happens.

408
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,580
If I left them in the lurch,

409
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,020
how would I make my subjects

410
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,260
believe in me continuously?

411
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,660
Report to Your Majesty, Zhihe...

412
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,460
Bow to you, foster brother.

413
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,940
What's up?

414
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,220
I've realized that

415
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,980
I'm too young and obtrusive since I pleaded guilty.

416
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,580
Thanks to the nursing from foster brother

417
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,860
as well as the clemency from His Majesty,

418
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,380
I can get the chance to return to the Sky Kingdom.

419
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,860
I've been missing you up to this day,

420
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,860
foster brother.

421
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,940
Have you...

422
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,940
The Heavenly King is clement,

423
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
so you should go visit him in person.

424
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,220
Father has entrusted me to you,

425
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,940
but I should have been an apprentice to Lord Doumu.

426
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,220
Now I've been degraded

427
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,580
and my academic career is left uncultivated,

428
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,860
I can't help feeling ashamed.

429
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,900
What I'm requesting you now is to help me
return to the heavenly palace

430
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,860
and continue to the cultivation

431
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,380
according to my late father's unfulfilled wish.

432
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,340
I think I, Bai Fengjiu,

433
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,260
can be counted as a veteran to blind dates.

434
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,780
See how I deal with the situation.

435
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:46,980
See.

436
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,500
She's coming.

437
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,620
Is she Her Highness Fengjiu?

438
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,060
She is.

439
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,140
She is. She is Her Highness Fengjiu.

440
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,820
I'm done.

441
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,740
Your Highness Fengjiu,

442
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,060
where are you going?

443
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,740
Your Highness Fengjiu.

444
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,420
Wait for me, Your Highness Fengjiu.

445
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,780
Your Highness Fengjiu, wait for me.

446
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,820
Your Highness Fengjiu.

447
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,300
Wait for me.

448
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,140
Your Highness,

449
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,020
stop running.

450
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,780
Your Highness Fengjiu.

451
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Your Highness Fengjiu,

452
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,460
wait for me.

453
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,100
I'll be able to elude three or five persons,

454
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,020
but a group of people,

455
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:29,900
over ten persons,

456
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,540
how could I make it?

457
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,700
Excuse me. Excuse me.

458
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm leaving.

459
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,700
What are you doing here?

460
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,820
Your...

461
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,980
Your... Your... Your... Your Majesty.

462
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,140
Why is he here?

463
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,820
Have a shower.

464
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,020
Don't stare at me.

465
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,180
Turn around.

466
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,940
Stop staring. Turn around. Come on.

467
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:16,860
Wait.

468
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,100
You've left something else.

469
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,500
Well...

470
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,460
two more.

471
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,100
I've left my fan here.

472
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,300
If I disturb you,

473
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,060
I'll come to make an apology some other day.

474
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,100
I'm leaving.

475
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,180
Bai Fengjiu,

476
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,540
you're the one who's going to succeed to the throne of Qingqiu.

477
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,540
You're no longer the little fox in the Tai Chen Palace.

478
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,660
You have to calm down.

479
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,300
Calm down.

480
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,500
To calm down.

481
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,420
Bow to you, Your Highness.

482
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,620
Chong Lin,

483
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,540
don't go find His Majesty,

484
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,540
since it's late.

485
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,140
But, I...

486
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,580
Listen to me. Go back first.

487
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,180
Yes.

488
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,700
Where is she?

489
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,340
She climbed over the wall and left.

490
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Don't you chase after her, do you?

491
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,420
The beauty you met on the Chengtian Stage

492
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,540
is Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

493
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,900
You have to ponder it over that

494
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,980
if you marry her as your empress,

495
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,060
you'll have to call Ye Hua uncle.

496
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,300
I intend to accept Cheng Yu as my nominal daughter later.

497
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,580
What do you think?

498
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,140
The most miserable thing in the world

499
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,980
is to make friends carelessly.

500
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,220
Is he turning aside from the topic we're talking about?

501
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,180
Li,

502
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,660
if you once fall for a girl

503
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,860
and you meet each other again many years after,

504
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,940
however, you let her know that

505
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,420
you're wearing diapers,

506
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,020
what will you do?

507
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,540
I haven't worn diapers long before.

508
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,100
I mean if it happens.

509
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,140
If it happens...

510
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,580
It will be too humiliating.

511
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,700
Only the situation where

512
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,580
your bellyband

513
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,980
drops in front of your ex-sweetheart

514
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,620
when you meet him

515
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,060
can roughly compare with

516
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,380
this humiliating thing.

517
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,420
If that happens,

518
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,540
I would find a chunk of tofu to hit myself

519
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,260
to death.

520
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,620
Sister, where're you going?

521
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,540
Go find a chunk of tofu.

522
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,860
Mother was finding you the whole night yesterday.

523
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,740
Has your mother looked for me?

524
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,580
Yes.

525
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,220
Do you want to know what she has said?

526
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,380
Spill it out.

527
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,340
Xiaojiu is so capricious,

528
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,020
then where can I find someone to marry her?

529
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,140
Even Lord Cheng Yu has found her a good match.

530
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,540
Cheng Yu?

531
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,820
What happens to Cheng Yu?

532
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,180
It's what my mother has said.

533
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,380
Lord Cheng Yu offended His Majesty

534
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,540
in the Mile-fleurs Ceremony.

535
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,100
Thanks to Third Prince, she's well protected.

536
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,180
I haven't expected that
some part of Third Prince is so sentimental,

537
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,220
since he used to be philandering.

538
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,260
How come I don't know what happens to Cheng Yu?

539
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,900
I'll go check on her.

540
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,620
Xiaojiu is so capricious,

541
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,180
then where can I find someone to marry her?

542
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,140
Cheng Yu.

543
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,020
Cheng Yu,

544
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,140
are you OK?

545
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,860
I'm fine.

546
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
Absolutely fine.

547
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,780
Have a seat.

548
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,220
I was escaping from the blind date

549
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,780
my aunt arranged for me yesterday.

550
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,420
I've just heard what happened to you

551
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,300
in the Mille-fleurs Ceremony.

552
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,500
Are you OK?

553
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,900
It's great you're OK.

554
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,180
Since you're OK with it now,

555
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,580
have you

556
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,500
fallen for Third Prince,

557
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,740
since he rescued you?

558
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,020
Don't talk nonsense.

559
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,060
You mentioned the blind date,

560
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,100
so have you met anyone who you have a thing for these days?

561
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,420
How could I meet my sweetheart?

562
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,580
I just feel worn out

563
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,900
for the escape these days.

564
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,460
When mentioning the escape thing,

565
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,380
no one can outweigh you.

566
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,780
Wait a second.

567
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,820
Where is my bracelet?

568
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,100
- Where is my bracelet? - Don't be too worried.

569
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,180
Ponder it over.

570
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,820
Did you lose it somewhere yesterday?

571
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,220
Yesterday...

572
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,780
I know where I lost it.

573
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,660
Screwed up.
