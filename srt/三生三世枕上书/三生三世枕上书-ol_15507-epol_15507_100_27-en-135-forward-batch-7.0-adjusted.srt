00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 27

3
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,700
Where is this place?

4
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,020
I heard that Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu

5
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,900
offended you in the past days.

6
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,340
Bai Fengjiu is the most beautiful lady
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions

7
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,820
second only to the God Bai Qian.

8
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,700
She became the female monarch of Qingqiu at such a young age.

9
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,340
It's so lucky of you to have her.

10
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,660
She surely deserves the title as a beauty.

11
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,780
I surely am!

12
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,660
So men do gossip as well?

13
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,620
She is indeed beautiful,

14
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,220
but not so clever.

15
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Why am I not clever?

16
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,260
It was you who teased me again and again!

17
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,980
Now Bai Fengjiu is famous

18
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,980
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

19
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,660
Why?

20
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,740
She rejected to marry to the Immortal Lord Cang Yi,

21
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,940
created a tremendous uproar in the palace on Mount Zhiyue,

22
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,900
and destroyed the statue of Cang Yi,

23
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,260
which greatly humiliated Bai Yi from Qingqiu.

24
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,940
This female monarch is too bold.

25
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,300
Who knows what things she will do

26
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,460
against the rules in future.

27
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,580
Like you said,

28
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,500
Bai Fengjiu is indeed good at

29
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,700
losing the face for the Qingqiu clan.

30
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,580
You dare to speak ill of me now.

31
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,260
If I show my original form as the female monarch of Qingqiu

32
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,100
in front of you,

33
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,900
you'll spread such awkward things

34
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,420
across the Four Seas and Eight Deserts

35
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,260
which will lose all the face of Qingqiu!

36
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,700
My father will never forgive me for that.

37
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,780
Thanks for

38
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,820
letting me win.

39
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,940
It's undetermined yet

40
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,420
who will win.

41
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,420
Enough of this!

42
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,580
I lose to you every time.

43
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,940
This is so boring!

44
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,580
It's so chilly!

45
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,220
Ever since the Haotian Tower was rebuilt,

46
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,420
I've never practiced yet.

47
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,180
Today looks like a good day.

48
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,220
How about...

49
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,900
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

50
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,420
I gotta go now

51
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,180
for something else.

52
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,420
One is willing to fight and the other one is willing to suffer.

53
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,780
They are a good match!

54
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,700
It's so hot!

55
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Why is my life so hard!

56
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,660
Why do I need to suffer from the ice and fire!

57
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,140
What kind of strange smell is it?

58
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,100
Your Majesty,

59
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,620
it's very humid these days.

60
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,860
It happens that there is Hengwu incense on the fairy mountain.

61
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,740
I switched with it.

62
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,580
Are you used to the smell?

63
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,700
Hengwu incense can eliminate the humidity

64
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,860
and help one to tranquilize and fall asleep.

65
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,100
It's a good spice.

66
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,140
I don't like the smell,

67
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,820
but it's good for her.

68
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,300
God! God!

69
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,540
God! God!

70
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,180
Bad news! Bad news!

71
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,340
God!

72
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,580
God Zhe Yan!

73
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,940
God! God!

74
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,620
Bad news! Bad news!

75
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,260
Go away!

76
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,140
How impolite you are!

77
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,780
I'll tell your mother about that!

78
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,460
God Zhe Yan! God Zhe Yan!

79
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,380
Bad news!

80
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,420
Something very bad happened!

81
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,140
- Come with me! - Enough! Enough!

82
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,380
Don't pull me!

83
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,420
What happened?

84
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,740
Sister Fengjiu turned into a piece of silk handkerchief.

85
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,620
That's not a big deal!

86
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,700
It's nothing but a kid's magic art.

87
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Sister Fengjiu turned into a silk handkerchief

88
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,220
and was taken away by His Majesty!

89
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,580
Please help me get Sister Fengjiu back

90
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,220
from His Majesty!

91
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,500
That's really naughty plot for a story.

92
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,540
Don't laugh at her.

93
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,900
His Majesty doesn't know

94
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,300
Sister Fengjiu is that silk handkerchief.

95
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,980
Stop it!

96
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,420
Stop shaking! I got it now.

97
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,500
I'll get Fengjiu out tomorrow.

98
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,820
Get her out now.

99
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,100
Do you think

100
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,380
His Majesty will give it to us

101
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,180
if we go for a silk handkerchief in the middle of the night?

102
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,940
Besides, after all your crying,

103
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,820
everyone will know the whereabouts

104
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,180
of Sister Fengjiu.

105
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,620
That makes sense!

106
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,780
Then we'll do it tomorrow!

107
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,260
I'm worried that

108
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,580
Sister Fengjiu will suffer with His Majesty!

109
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm so hungry!

110
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,620
Where is this place?

111
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,780
What a narrow escape!

112
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,380
I almost lose my life under the chopping knife of His Majesty!

113
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,860
Thanks to my good luck!

114
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,340
Neither threats nor forces can subdue me.
Neither wealth nor honor can corrupt me.

115
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,820
No sweet and sour fish.

116
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,380
Refrain from it!

117
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,740
I cannot take it!

118
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,500
Your Majesty, the Third Prince wants to meet you.

119
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,060
OK. Got it!

120
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,940
Yes!

121
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,420
There you come finally!

122
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,380
We have the deal that you come with me
to practice the manipulation of the Haotian Tower.

123
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,780
I would not come out if I wasn't hungry!

124
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,900
Let me fill my stomach first.

125
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,900
It's been so long.

126
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,940
Why are your cooking skills not improved at all?

127
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,580
I've got a new feature!

128
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,060
This time, I must be able to beat God Zhe Yan's Jiuli Pot!

129
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,020
Keep your eyes open!

130
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Chong... Chong Lin!

131
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,340
Chong Lin!

132
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,140
Chong Lin!

133
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,700
I've rearranged the mechanisms

134
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,140
at the top of the tower.

135
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,620
Try it again!

136
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,180
Thank Your Majesty for saving me!

137
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,980
What is it that smells so good?

138
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,420
I made sweet and sour fish.

139
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,780
Let's try it together.

140
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,860
You made sweet and sour fish?

141
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,020
I know your cooking very well.

142
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,820
Besides, you are not in the Imperial Kitchen.

143
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,060
I can make her show herself.

144
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
It smells so good!

145
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,900
Perfect combination of color, aroma, and taste.

146
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,860
Your cooking skill has improved.

147
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,300
This taste is...

148
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:10,900
Not bad.

149
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,620
If Lord Cheng Yu has the luck

150
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,220
to have this dish,

151
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,660
she will surely recover soon.

152
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,180
What happened to her?

153
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,580
She is not herself these days.

154
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,180
At first, she just had a minor headache,

155
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,220
but it gets a lot worse these days.

156
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,820
She can barely get out of bed and stand

157
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,420
and usually falls into coma.

158
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,940
I had wanted to invite Fengjiu, the Princess of Qingqiu,

159
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,860
to accompany her,

160
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,780
but I just couldn't find her anywhere.

161
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
How come Cheng Yu gets so sick?

162
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,940
It's getting late now.

163
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,820
I've gotta send the medicines for Cheng Yu!

164
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,820
Hope she is fine today.

165
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,100
Bye for now!

166
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,260
Third Prince,

167
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
make it clear before you leave.

168
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,660
What happened to Cheng Yu?

169
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,620
Your Majesty, God Zhe Yan wants to meet you.

170
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,580
Let him in!

171
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,340
This way please!

172
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,540
How cozy this is!

173
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,020
This pavilion is elegant and interesting.

174
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
This auspicious beast censer is exquisite and extraordinary!

175
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,900
I suppose this is made by...

176
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,300
God Zhe Yan! God Zhe Yan!

177
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,820
Get down to the point!

178
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,820
I don't mean to cheat you,

179
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,940
but I come for a trivial matter.

180
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,980
What is it?

181
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,620
This little naughty boy stole the silk handkerchief

182
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,300
I brought for her mother yesterday afternoon

183
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,860
while I was taking the afternoon nap.

184
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,980
He came back quite pleased with himself

185
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
and realized the loss of it

186
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,020
only after he was asked.

187
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,380
It's said

188
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,060
you've taken it!

189
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,460
It doesn't matter if it's a normal handkerchief,

190
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,340
but it's made by his grandma

191
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,260
who is the Fox Queen of Qingqiu.

192
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,980
It means a lot to him.

193
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,700
So I'm here

194
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,740
to retrieve the handkerchief.

195
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,220
Zhe Yan is so good at making up fantastic stories.

196
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,500
What a spicy ginger he is!

197
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,780
Now His Majesty has to release me.

198
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,660
Li  really has great comprehension.

199
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,660
He asked the most powerful

200
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,620
and merciful god to help me.

201
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,940
I underestimated the friendship

202
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,700
between him and me as an elder sister.

203
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,380
This is the handkerchief I took at the Ninety Heaven.

204
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,420
Is this yours?

205
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,980
No, it's not!

206
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,860
Is it not this one?

207
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,460
If not,

208
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,780
you could find it out at Yuan Ji Palace.

209
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,780
Maybe Lian Song took it.

210
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,780
It's just a handkerchief.

211
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
I don't think you'd lie to me and keep it.

212
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,420
You won't do something

213
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,860
as disgraceful as that.

214
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,420
This handkerchief is real.

215
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,100
If so,

216
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,300
I'll need to give this handkerchief

217
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,540
to Bai Qian.

218
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,700
Bye for now.

219
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,940
Take care!

220
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,900
Come on! Let's go!

221
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,380
This is not the one!

222
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,780
This is not the one!

223
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,180
His Majesty won't lie to us.

224
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,300
Come on! Let's go!

225
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,420
- It's not! - Let's go!

226
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
Come on! Let's go!

227
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,660
- Bye for now! - This is not the one!

228
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,100
Don't go!

229
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,140
- Not this one! - Alright! Alright!

230
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,940
God Zhe Yan, why do you lose

231
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,220
and fail to get Sister Fengjiu out?

232
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,420
You didn't do your best.

233
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,620
I'm breaking up with you today.

234
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,220
So be it!

235
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,020
It isn't your uncle that he kidnapped.

236
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,660
Why do I need to offend him openly?

237
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,980
Don't worry!

238
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,620
I've deduced Fengjiu's fate last year.

239
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,780
The fate plate shows she'll survive.

240
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,100
Let's wait and see how she goes.

241
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,340
Maybe it will turn out the other way around.

242
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,980
You can deduce fate

243
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,380
just like Si Ming?

244
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,260
Certainly!

245
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,860
But I haven't done it for several thousand years.

246
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,580
It's another thing as to its accuracy.

247
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,340
Deduce my fate.

248
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,660
I'll see if it's accurate or not.

249
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,100
Li!

250
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,180
Are you in the snares of love recently?

251
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,980
What are the snares of love?

252
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,900
It's...

253
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,500
Didn't you break up with me just now?

254
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,740
Time has changed.

255
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,020
Tell me now!

256
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,780
No!

257
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,700
Say it!

258
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,420
Till when do you plan to hide yourself?

259
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,980
So,

260
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,500
turning into a handkerchief is your hobby!

261
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,620
Your Majesty, your deduction is ridiculous!

262
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,420
Fortunately, I'm calm enough

263
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,860
not to be taken in.

264
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,460
Good!

265
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,620
I'm right in need of a handkerchief to clean my sword.

266
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,740
I'll use you for that.

267
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,220
To clean a sword?

268
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,980
To clean the well-known legendary weapon

269
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,740
which ranks among the top 10 of the ancient weapons

270
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,900
and can cut iron like sapropel,

271
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,500
the Legendary Sword Canghe!

272
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,740
What to do now?

273
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,180
I had planned it for the long term.

274
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,460
I thought

275
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,180
as long as I stay patient,

276
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,660
His Majesty will sooner or later set me free

277
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,780
if he gets bored of me one day.

278
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,260
That's the softest and most stable way

279
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,940
which hurts my face least.

280
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,940
Why would he use me to clean the sword?

281
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,620
His Majesty usually does as he says.

282
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,740
Besides,

283
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,220
he accepted the invitation of fight from Demon Lord Yan.

284
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,940
It looks like

285
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,380
he's gonna use Canghe for a good killing.

286
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,660
This is not good!

287
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,060
I have to get out tonight.

288
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,300
What has become of Cheng Yu now with her illness?

289
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,340
I have to get out for Cheng Yu anyway!

290
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,700
How can I stare at him

291
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,940
like this

292
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,180
without getting ashamed?

293
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,740
Luckily, he didn't recognize me.

294
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,460
Damn!

295
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,820
I didn't learn the lethargy formula well

296
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,700
when I attended school.

297
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,460
I've gotta

298
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,300
to cast it for a few more times.

299
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,500
Let me bury you here first.

300
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,540
It won't matter anymore wherever I am

301
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,220
if I stay together with His Majesty!

302
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,540
This is a precious Hanshi grass.

303
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,620
Its root is good for forgetting sorrows.

304
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,860
Its flower is premium seasoning for cold dishes.

305
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,740
Si Ming brought that particularly for me.

306
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,380
What a sad day that was

307
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,620
that I forgot to bring back this babe!

308
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,060
It's so heart-breaking!

309
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,420
It's not too late now

310
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,540
to make up for it.

311
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,820
The garden in the eyes of fox

312
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,900
is indeed different from that

313
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,340
in the eyes of mankind.

314
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,020
And it's different in the past

315
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,580
from it is now.

316
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,740
The unhappy things I had

317
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,180
in the Tai Chen Palace

318
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,860
is more than the happy things.

319
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,060
But all that I have in mind now

320
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,020
are all good things.

321
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,740
In that case,

322
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,580
I don't need to mind that much.

323
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,540
When I can speak,

324
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,900
I'd persuade Dong Hua into coming to Qingqiu.

325
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,900
By then, I'd say to His Majesty that

326
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,060
by when

327
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,460
I'll bring you to Qingqiu to watch the stars.

328
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,660
One! Two! Three!

329
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,940
You're still so ignorant

330
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,860
even though you're entangled by your own magic art.

331
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,420
You're one of a kind under this world.

332
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,100
No wonder God Bai Yi thinks about

333
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,900
finding a really good man for you every day.

334
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,340
Dong Hua,

335
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,140
you tore me and Ji Heng apart

336
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,860
which resulted in her suffering in the mortal realm.

337
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,300
Now she is so sad that

338
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,700
she left me without saying goodbye.

339
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,180
It's all your fault!

340
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,380
I must make you pay for it.

341
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,700
I don't believe you won't come.

342
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,620
Where am I?

343
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,540
Why am I here?

344
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,540
Oh no!

345
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,740
I clearly got out yesterday.

346
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,180
Why am I here again?

347
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,780
Am I caught and taken back again?

348
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,900
But I don't remember that at all.

349
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,060
Did I fall asleep

350
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,060
so what happened thereafter

351
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,100
is just my dream?

352
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,260
I'm even thinking of escaping

353
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,500
in my dream

354
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
and I dreamed in such a detailed way.

355
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,220
Let me do it all over again tonight

356
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,700
as it is in my dream.

357
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,460
How good will it be if it's all true!

358
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,340
It will save so much trouble for me.

359
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,420
There you are finally.

360
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,100
You dilly-dallying

361
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,220
ice face!

362
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,260
I've been waiting for you here for so many days!

363
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,060
Show your weapon!

364
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,660
Let's finish the fight as soon as possible!

365
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,380
If I don't beat the crap out of you today

366
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,460
to revenge previous humiliation,

367
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,580
I'll write my name upside down!

368
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,420
This is Yan Chiwu, one of the seven demon lords

369
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,180
with the title as a demon barbarian.

370
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
Are all demon barbarians

371
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,460
white-skinned Adonis?

372
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,660
Please!

373
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,020
Damn you!

374
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,020
Enough talking!

375
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,860
Let's fight the crap out!

376
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,260
Check it out!

377
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,140
This is my newly developed Yanmo Formation!

378
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,340
It took 7,000 lives from the mortal realm.

379
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,060
Even though they are all evil lives,

380
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,060
it took me great efforts.

381
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,380
If you dare to hurt them,

382
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,700
it's a cutoff to their six-realm encounters

383
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,460
to return to good.

384
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,380
Gods like you praise yourselves as kind-hearted people.

385
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,860
Show me how

386
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,220
you're going to break my Yanmo Formation.

387
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,460
Done!

388
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,380
My taking of 7,000 lives might be a breach of the sky moral

389
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,140
and deserves to be punished,

390
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,180
but the punishment should be the thunder

391
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,060
from the sky.

392
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,460
Shouldn't the gods like you

393
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,780
do your best to help them through?

394
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,620
If your sword gets stained by their blood,

395
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,580
you'll be convicted with killing.

396
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,060
You killed without any hesitation.

397
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,940
Don't you feel afraid of the sky's punishment

398
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,140
for your charge of killing?

399
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,980
Charge of killing?

400
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,500
I haven't handled any war affairs
in the past several hundred thousand years.

401
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,340
You have forgotten my style

402
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,100
when I was in charge of the life and death

403
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,780
in the six realms.

404
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,860
Damn!

405
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,260
Your Majesty!

406
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,380
Your Majesty!

407
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,700
Your Majesty!

408
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,820
Your Majesty!

409
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,060
Your Majesty!

410
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,620
Stay in there! Don't come out!

411
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,740
Your back!

412
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,340
Ice face, you despise me, don't you?

413
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,780
Fighting with families aside.

414
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,500
Watch out, Your Majesty!

415
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,260
Xiaobai!

416
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,500
Damn Yan Chiwu!

417
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,500
If it's not because of you fighting with His Majesty,

418
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,780
how could I get blown to this damn place?

419
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,660
In spite that His Majesty teased me so awfully,

420
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,620
he is good too

421
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,020
as he gave me the Tiangang Shield

422
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,860
to protect me.

423
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,300
I'll forget about all the past grudges.

424
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,460
But how does His Majesty know

425
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,380
my personal thoughts?

426
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,940
He called me Xiaobai in a great rush

427
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,900
just a few minutes before.

428
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,020
Why was he nowhere to be found

429
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,340
at the time when I fell off the cliff?

430
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,380
Xiaobai.

431
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,620
His Majesty calls me Xiaobai!

432
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,700
I like that!

433
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,540
Just think from his perspective.

434
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,980
If I were His Majesty,

435
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,380
I protected someone with Tiangang Shield,

436
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,460
but this person does not help in the fight

437
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,780
and she just witnessed me dragged off the cliff

438
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,380
by my enemy hand in hand.

439
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,380
I would not just watch,

440
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,980
but also stab him with another two strokes to vent my anger.

441
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,900
Two strokes to vent my anger.

442
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,180
The ice face really sucks.

443
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,100
Fighting with him will bring nothing good.

444
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,860
We even ran into the opening of the Fanyin Valley

445
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,300
at the top of Mount Fuyu

446
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,780
and fell onto the steep cliff.

447
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,020
Where is the Fanyin Valley?

448
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,220
You're intimate to the ice face.

449
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,540
How can you not know that?

450
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,420
Haven't you heard of the inseparable king birds clan?

451
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Inseparable king birds?

452
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,620
The Fanyin Valley that inseparable king birds inhabit?

453
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,380
That's right!

454
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,580
It opens once in a cycle of sixty years.

455
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,500
And it shows one tiny crack every time

456
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,980
which is called the Fanyin Valley.

457
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,660
What a coincidence it is

458
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,900
that you came in at the time it was opened!

459
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,940
The wind under the feet

460
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,540
right blew us in at this time

461
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,900
as there is nothing left to blow.

462
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,660
And that crack

463
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,860
is right in the size

464
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,780
that allows two of us to come in at a time.

465
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,500
What luck is that?

466
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,580
What did you say?

467
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,900
Do you think I...

468
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,820
That hurts!

469
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,580
Did you

470
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,940
beat me up just now

471
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,620
while I was in coma?

472
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,300
That's impossible!

473
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,060
Qingqiu people are well-behaved.

474
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,420
We will never do something like that.

475
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,020
Yan, you've thought too much!

476
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,300
OK!

477
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,700
If you call me Yan again,

478
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,380
I'll cut off your tongue.

479
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,860
Then how should I address you?

480
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,420
Address me in the way

481
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,380
strong people are addressed

482
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,900
in the mortal realm.

483
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,460
Warrior Yan?

484
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,300
Warrior Yan!

485
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,220
That's more like it!

486
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Warrior Yan,

487
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,140
why do you want to fight with His Majesty again and again?

488
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,020
Why do you dislike His Majesty so much?

489
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,020
As the Green Demon Lord,

490
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,420
of course, I need to protect the woman I love.

491
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,780
It's wide-spread in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts

492
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,020
that Dong Hua is a god without any desires,

493
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,740
but I know

494
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,380
there is someone he truly loves.

495
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,260
Do you want know who it is?

496
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,860
Ji Heng!

497
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,100
How do you know?

498
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,900
It is indeed Ji Heng?

499
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
His Majesty doesn't necessarily like Ji Heng!

500
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,580
Ji Heng is as clean as ice and as pure as jade.
She is innocent and elegant.

501
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,380
Her beauty makes the fish sink, wild geese fall and flower blush,
and obscures the moon. It's beyond words of description.

502
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,580
A man

503
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,340
whose heart doesn't throb

504
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,180
for a beauty like Ji Heng

505
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,900
doesn't deserve to be a man.

506
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,180
You think her good

507
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,940
because you like her.

508
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,500
You're intimate to the ice face.

509
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,780
How do you not know who he really likes?

510
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,140
What's your name?

511
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,420
You look kind of familiar.

512
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,540
Are you the immortal from Tai Chen Palace?

513
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,180
I have absolutely nothing to do with Tai Chen Palace.

514
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,740
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu!

515
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,420
Bai Fengjiu?

516
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,780
What a poor taste!

517
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,620
Ji Heng is the best in the world!
