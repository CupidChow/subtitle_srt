00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 18

3
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
Your Majesty.

4
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
What's going on?

5
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,480
Your Majesty, something bad happened.

6
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Imperial Concubine Wan...

7
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,600
What happened to her?

8
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,080
She vanished!

9
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
What?

10
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,520
So her whereabouts

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
is unknown.

12
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,840
She literally vanished

13
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
in front of us.

14
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,000
I swear I'm telling the truth.

15
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,040
Enough. You good-for-nothing!

16
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,400
Go out now.

17
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,760
Yes.

18
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,880
Your Highness,

19
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
people in the palace have known about it.

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,600
But it hasn't been spread.

21
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,360
Keep at it. Send more men.

22
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Yes.

23
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
How could something so weird happen?

24
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,160
No traces of kidnapping

25
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
or fighting?

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,320
No, Your Highness.

27
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Absolutely no.

28
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
How is that possible?

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,440
Madam Jiu,

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
only you can talk His Majesty through now.

31
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,360
Or His Majesty will have

32
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,920
all the imperial bodyguards in prison suffer.

33
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,120
And even General Ye will be implicated.

34
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,800
Ji Heng can't use magic arts.

35
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,600
But someone might rescue her with magic arts.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Even my concubines can come and go

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
as they like.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,240
Does it mean Empress Dowager

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
may also vanish someday?

40
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,800
This is how you protect me?

41
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,280
This is how you protect the whole palace?

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,760
Your Majesty, Madam Jiu is here to see you.

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,830
Send her in.

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Yes.

45
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
Summon Madam Jiu.

46
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,480
What's the matter?

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Your Majesty,

48
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,160
do you remember what the imperial physician said?

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
The imperial physician?

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,440
Leave us.

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Yes.

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,760
Your Majesty, don't you think

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,400
what the imperial physician said is suspicious?

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,960
The pulse beats arrhythmically.

55
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
It's beating sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly,

56
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,920
which is very unstable.

57
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,600
And there's a sign of heavy intoxication.

58
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,440
But Imperial Concubine Wan
showed no symptoms of intoxication at all.

59
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,240
In that way, she's not poisoned.

60
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,560
At first, I felt so strange

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
when the imperial physician was diagnosing.

62
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,920
Perhaps Imperial Concubine Wan is not a mortal.

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
What?

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,800
Imperial Concubine Wan.

65
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Maybe she really isn't a mortal.

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
Maybe she had her reasons

67
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
coming here.

68
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Now it's all over.

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,520
So she should probably leave.

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,800
If she's not a mortal,

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
why did she come to the palace?

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,200
For you, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,120
For me?

74
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,920
Then why did she disappear

75
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,560
when you refuse to see her?

76
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,640
Is it for me or for Lingbi Stone?

77
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,040
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
I think

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Imperial Concubine Wan holds feelings for you.

80
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
That's enough, Xiaojiu.

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
I know what you've been trying to get to.

82
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,240
You want me to forgive

83
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,520
the imperial bodyguards for their dereliction of duty.

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,000
Your Majesty, what I want

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,560
is making you to truly let it go.

86
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,320
Fine, I will listen to you.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
No matter what she was here for,

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
it's all over.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,760
She's gone,

90
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,960
and I'm fine.

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,240
Lingbi Stone is in one piece as well.

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
Don't mention about

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,960
Imperial Concubine Wan anymore.

94
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,780
Yes.

95
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,480
Where am I?

96
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,040
You're awake.

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Great. Great.

98
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,280
I made porridge for you.

99
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Have some before it gets cold.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,040
Come and have some.

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,960
Sir, thank you for saving my life.

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,600
Sir, may I know your name?

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Nice try.

104
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,880
You learn how to play act in the mortal realm.

105
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
Fine, then I'll go along with you.

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm Yan Chiwu,

107
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640
Green Demon Lord.

108
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
Now eat the porridge.

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,760
You mentioned mortal realm?

110
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Oh, sir,

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,160
can you tell me

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,640
what

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,960
this place is?

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
This is Qingxuan Hall of the demons.

115
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,320
I invited you here before. You don't remember it?

116
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
Qingxuan Hall?

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,800
The... the demons?

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Don't you remember who I am?

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
Look carefully.

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,920
So...

122
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,360
do you remember who you are?

123
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm Chu Wan.

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
No,

125
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,560
you are the Princess Ji Heng of the demons.

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,560
You even forget this?

127
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,280
Ji Heng.

128
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
You don't remember anything?

129
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
Ji... Ji Heng.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,280
Do you know me?

131
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,550
More than that!

132
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,440
We are close to each other.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,150
Do you remember something else?

134
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,080
Like...

135
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
Danling Palace.

136
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,670
Xu Yang.

137
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,960
Ice.

138
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,840
Dong Hua.

139
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
I... I...

140
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,040
I...

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
I don't recall anything.

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,520
Nie Chuyin! You are a bastard!

143
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,440
I will skin him!

144
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560
Nie Chuyin!

145
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Are you talking about

146
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
Mr. Nie?

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
I think you got it wrong.

148
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
He is the man who saved my life.

149
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Nonsense!

150
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,680
He's the one who made you to lose your memory.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
What?

152
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,520
He must have been using you,

153
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,000
so he sealed your memory.

154
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
He used to be a fraud.

155
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
He's so good at it.

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,680
Sir, you must get it wrong.

157
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,000
I remember I fell

158
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
from somewhere high

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,240
and nearly died.

160
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
And it was then that Mr. Nie came out and helped me.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,080
You mean...

162
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,960
you lost your memory

163
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,800
because of falling from a cliff?

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Falling from a cliff?

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,720
I looked for you everywhere.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Then Xu Yang told me you fell from a cliff.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
You said you fell from somewhere high.

168
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,120
That makes sense.

169
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,680
Who's Xu Yang?

170
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,040
Sir,

171
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,680
why were you looking for me everywhere?

172
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Xu Yang is your brother.

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
I...

174
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,120
I'm your good friend,

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
and I cared about you.

176
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,880
That's why I looked for you everywhere.

177
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,880
Then...

178
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,040
how did you find me?

179
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,880
I went to the cliff, but I didn't find you there.

180
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
So I enlarged the search range.

181
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
I almost looked every place of the demons

182
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
and finally found a lead on you

183
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,920
from Nie Chuyin.

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,440
Then I knew that you went to the mortal realm.

185
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,440
So I immediately went to
the mortal realm to feel your breath.

186
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,360
But the minute I found you

187
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,240
you were almost killed in prison.

188
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,280
Then...

189
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,600
it's hard to explain.

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,040
Okay, here's how it goes.

191
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
Come.

192
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,120
You take a good rest in my place.

193
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
I'll try some magic arts

194
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,760
and see if I can bring your memory back.

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
Eat it before it gets cold.

196
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,360
Thank you, sir.

197
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,160
It's getting cold.

198
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
Your Highness, you should stop drinking.
It's time for bed.

199
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,080
What time is it?

200
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
9 p.m. to 11 p.m.

201
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,520
It's still early.

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
You should stop, Your Highness.

203
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
Since you came to the palace,

204
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
you've grown to love drinking
liquor and enjoying the moon.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,960
You've had too much.

206
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,560
What if

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,640
your health is harmed?

208
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,160
Don't worry.

209
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm a good drinker.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,560
It's time for reunion

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
when the moon is full.

212
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,600
But I've been here for so long.

213
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,160
When do I get to reunite with my old friends?

214
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,200
Your Highness.

215
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,840
You've had too much.

216
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,640
You begin to talk like a book.

217
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,760
Where is the cloak from?

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,440
It's His Majesty's reward for you.

219
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,080
Again?

220
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,240
Yes.

221
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,360
You found out secret of Imperial Concubine Wan,

222
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,920
which is a great job.

223
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,800
His Majesty rewarded about five times in total.

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
I think,

225
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,720
His Majesty is really attentive with you.

226
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,120
Buy why don't you...

227
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
Stop.

228
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,000
Mind your words.

229
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,160
Is Xiaojiu being sentimental under the moon?

230
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,240
Your Majesty.

231
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,680
What's wrong?

232
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

233
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
You are drinking again.

234
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,600
Just a little bit.

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,040
The cloak is nice.

236
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,680
You look so different with it.

237
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,320
It's just...

238
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,880
What?

239
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,760
An accessory is lacked to match it.

240
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,720
Your Majesty.

241
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,640
This is Gilded Nine Phoenixes Hairpin

242
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
I had craftsman make for you in particular.

243
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,840
Do you like it?

244
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,040
Have a look.

245
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,760
This is too,

246
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
too expensive for me.

247
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
I can't take it.

248
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,920
The cloak and the hairpin are great match.

249
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,080
Listen to me.

250
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,840
You can take it.

251
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,720
Thanks.

252
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Don't follow us.

253
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
No,

254
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,720
what is His Majesty doing?

255
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,240
Were you missing someone

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,160
when I just walked in?

257
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
I've been wondering

258
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
who had been

259
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
in your mind?

260
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,240
No matter who had been in your mind,

261
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,600
you are not allowed to have

262
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,240
anyone in your mind now, except me.

263
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,320
Can I

264
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,760
stay for tonight?

265
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:16,960
Xiao...

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,000
Xiaojiu.

267
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960
Are you coming or not?

268
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,840
Do you want to stay here tonight?

269
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,920
Go back to Muning Hall.

270
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,840
Yes.

271
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Oh no.

272
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,320
Did I and His Majesty...

273
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,680
Muyun.

274
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Muyun.

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Your Highness.

276
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,080
You are finally awake.

277
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,840
It's 9 a.m. to 11 a.m now.

278
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Muyun, tell me.

279
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Did His Majesty stay here last night?

280
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,880
Come on, Your Highness.

281
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,360
I really don't understand you.

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,200
His Majesty rewarded you
so many good stuffs last night.

283
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,640
And finally he decided to stay.

284
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,760
But in the end...

285
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,320
In the end?

286
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,240
He got out very soon.

287
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,560
Instead,

288
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,320
you drank a lot and just went straight to bed.

289
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,080
I fell asleep?

290
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,600
Really?

291
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes.

292
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,240
His Majesty looked so angry

293
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,120
when he got out last night.

294
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,960
It was me who waited upon you
while you're sleeping.

295
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Thank God.

296
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,040
Nothing has happened.

297
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,840
God is helping me.

298
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,200
Your Highness.

299
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,440
Why are you...

300
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,160
Why are you so happy about it?

301
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,120
Don't you know

302
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
how His Majesty feels for you?

303
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,360
Your Majesty.

304
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,320
Of course I know

305
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,520
how much you like me.

306
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
But you will never know my feelings for you

307
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,640
for your whole life.

308
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,280
Don't put it on.

309
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,400
I think it's better this way.

310
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,480
Your Highness, you seldom dress up.

311
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,320
His Majesty was nice

312
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,400
to send you the phoenix hairpin.

313
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,240
You are Madam Jiu now.

314
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,000
You should look differently.

315
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,800
Your Highness, look.

316
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,240
The phoenix hairpin really goes with your beauty.

317
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,840
It reminds me of a poem.

318
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
You can recite poems?

319
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,080
Your smile looks so beautiful,

320
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,000
Your eyes look so cheerful.

321
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,800
I think the poem just portrays you, Your Highness.

322
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,600
You just say those nice words

323
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,920
to please me.

324
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,000
Empress Dowager is here.

325
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
Your Majesty, Madam Jiu is here.

326
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,360
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

327
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,880
Raise your head.

328
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,160
The phoenix hairpin is so delicate.

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Rise.

330
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

331
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Madam Jiu.

332
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
It took me too long

333
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,480
to come visit you.

334
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,160
I should have come earlier.

335
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,600
I was being naughty

336
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,040
and didn't show enough courtesy.

337
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,640
It was my bad not visiting you, Your Majesty.

338
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,480
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

339
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,400
You seem smart.

340
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,160
I was wondering where you're from.

341
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,760
I was born in an ordinary family in

342
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
a border town

343
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,000
of Chengyu.

344
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,920
An ordinary family?

345
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,040
Where are your parents?

346
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,680
They went traveling around the world.

347
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
I don't know any more about it.

348
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,520
Really?

349
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,080
How strange!

350
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,880
So you mean

351
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
you don't even have your old family?

352
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
No wonder

353
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,240
your behaviors and manners look so different

354
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,640
from other concubines in the palace.

355
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,880
You win favor with your humble background,

356
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,400
which makes other concubines envy you.

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
Madam Jiu.

358
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
You are not a vulgar girl

359
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,200
from a small village anymore.

360
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
You are the concubine of State of Chengyu.

361
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,200
You should be more gentle, modest and courteous.

362
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,120
And be more diligent and harmonious.

363
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,200
Don't try any underhanded tricks

364
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,720
to win emperor's favor.

365
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Do you understand?

366
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes, I do.

367
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,760
That's good then.

368
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
So long, Your Majesty.

369
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,440
Who's there?

370
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,120
How dare you break into Prince Ying's Mansion!

371
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,920
Who are you?

372
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
Take it easy, Prince Ying.

373
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,080
You can take your time and drink the tea first.

374
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Don't worry, Prince Ying.

375
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
People from State of Chong'an

376
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,680
don't do poisoning

377
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,600
in tea and cakes.

378
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,520
What exactly do you want from me?

379
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
I'm here to help Prince Ying.

380
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,160
Prince Ying.

381
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
I know everything you did.

382
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,120
It's impossible.

383
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,600
How do you know?

384
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,960
I'll kill you.

385
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,080
Prince Ying.

386
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,400
Do you forget what happened

387
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
when you tried

388
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,720
to kill Chu Wan?

389
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,400
Prince Ying, don't get panic.

390
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
I'm the Imperial Tutor of State of Chong'an.

391
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,240
I know everything you've been doing

392
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
is for the throne of State of Chengyu.

393
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,280
You want to take the throne.

394
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,520
If I tell you that I can help you with that,

395
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,160
would you like to cooperate with me?

396
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,200
You want to cooperate with me?

397
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,280
Yes.

398
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,000
With the power of State of Chong'an,

399
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,000
it's not a difficult thing

400
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,360
to help you

401
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
take back the throne.

402
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,320
You can be so kind-hearted?

403
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,480
Of course,

404
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
I need you to do

405
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,160
something for us.

406
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,480
What is it?

407
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,800
It's just a way too easy thing for you,

408
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,560
Prince Ying.

409
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,760
As long as you give me Lingbi Stone,

410
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,320
all our future cooperation

411
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
is negotiable.

412
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,600
You want Lingbi Stone?

413
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,680
Why?

414
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,640
That's not your concern, Prince Ying.

415
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,240
Lingbi Stone is the treasure of my country.

416
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,280
Only the emperor can get access to it.

417
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,400
Prince Ying.

418
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,640
You are the second most powerful man in the nation.

419
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,440
I don't believe that

420
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,680
you know nothing of Lingbi Stone.

421
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,640
Unless I come to power,

422
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,480
I will have no way of knowing it

423
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
for my whole life.

424
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,200
Okay.

425
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Then I can tell you.

426
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,920
Lingbi Stone is in the Emperor's Tomb.

427
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,680
Prince Ying.

428
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,600
Now you have to think it through.

429
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,440
The stone matters more

430
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,160
or your secret matters more?

431
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,600
There's a map of the Emperor's Tomb.

432
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,920
There is?

433
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,280
It's in Song Xuanren's study.

434
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,840
I have no access to it.

435
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,640
Prince Ying.

436
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,760
You are his brother.

437
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
It's not difficult for you

438
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
to go into his study.

439
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,280
I can try my luck, though.

440
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,680
Good.

441
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,000
I believe nothing is impossible

442
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,040
as long as you are cooperating fully.

443
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,680
I guess I'll wait and see.

444
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,240
I said I can try. I can't guarantee anything.

445
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,960
But when it's done,

446
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
I hope you don't bother me anymore.

447
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,040
By the way, Prince Ying.

448
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
This thing

449
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,600
stays between us.

450
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,640
If anyone else knows about it,

451
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
you know what consequences there will be.

452
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,280
Qingti.

453
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
You suggested to add
reinforcements in the Emperor's Tomb,

454
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,520
and change the way of guarding.

455
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,200
I think the suggestions are very good.

456
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,160
You're allowed to do them.

457
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

458
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,120
The smell...

459
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,880
Your wound?

460
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
I happened to get

461
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,720
an effective ointment for curing scars.

462
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,480
This is cotton rose ointment

463
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,640
I specially made for you, Your Majesty.

464
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,160
It's so nice of you.

465
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm really happy.

466
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Let my apply it for you, Your Majesty.

467
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,560
I saw you were being melancholy in the Heaven.

468
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
Do you get into any troubles?

469
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,120
I don't want to carry on anymore.

470
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,800
It's too hard.

471
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,640
I told you not to come.

472
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,160
You didn't believe me.
Instead, you insisted.

473
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,880
Now you've experienced
all the hardships in the mortal realm.

474
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,400
It sucks, right?

475
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,000
Now I understand the lovey-dovey

476
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,680
in the books.

477
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,000
Sorrow and bitterness are what hidden behind.

478
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,200
Your Highness, you are getting in deeper and deeper.

479
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,800
It's better sooner than later with the pain.

480
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,520
You are too kind to Song Xuanren.

481
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,640
If you don't hurt him soon,

482
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,800
when will His Majesty

483
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,240
finish his love misfortune?

484
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,240
But it's killing me

485
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
to see him experience love in vain.

486
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,960
Only after he goes through love misfortune,

487
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,000
can you be freed.

488
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
The extraordinary place you were talking about is here?

489
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,120
Yes.

490
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,480
It's so beautiful.

491
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,840
I thought the scenery on earth was just so so.

492
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,960
But the beautiful scenery I'm looking at right now

493
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,960
is nothing less than that in Sky Kingdom.

494
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,840
I used to come here

495
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,000
when I was upset.

496
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,240
Looking at the setting sun,

497
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,920
feeling the breeze,

498
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,320
and you feel like

499
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,320
all the things that have
been upsetting you are gone.

500
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,440
How did you find

501
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,320
such an extraordinary place?

502
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,440
Once I went for a war with my father.

503
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,240
But I got blamed by my father

504
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,160
for being too aggressive in the war.

505
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,400
I was young back then.

506
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,200
And I rode my horse here.

507
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
At that time,

508
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,280
I wanted to be alone,

509
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,680
just like how you're feeling now.

510
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,280
Qingti, the scar on your face is fading away.

511
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
Thank you for giving me cotton rose ointment.

512
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,960
You're welcome.

513
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,920
Xiaojiu.

514
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Is he not being nice to you?

515
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,120
He's very nice to me.

516
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,360
Maybe I just don't belong to

517
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,640
that palace.

518
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,600
What's wrong?

519
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,000
What are you hiding?

520
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,120
Nothing.

521
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,920
Just a little something

522
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
I wanted to give you.

523
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,880
But I haven't got the chance.

524
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,760
You can't take back what you sent out.

525
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,000
It's beautiful.

526
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,480
Really?

527
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,560
I thought you got tired of the delicate articles in the palace,

528
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,920
and don't fancy something like it.

529
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,520
No, it's not true.

530
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,230
Does it look nice?

531
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,920
You like it?

532
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,480
I'm glad you like it.

533
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,630
Xiaojiu.

534
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,960
Come find me anytime

535
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,560
if you don't want to be

536
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,280
in the palace anymore.

537
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
The sun is setting.

538
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,080
I guess it will turn cold

539
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,640
in the evening here.

540
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,960
You want to go back?

541
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,960
No.

542
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I want to stay here looking at the stars.

543
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,280
In the palace,

544
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,160
you can see just a few of them.

545
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,120
Can I stay here and look at the sky

546
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,000
some more?

547
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,280
Sure.

548
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,360
Your Majesty, time to sleep.

549
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,680
I'll go to Yue Hua Palace tonight.

550
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,840
Yes.

551
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,520
Arrange carriage to Yue Hua Palace.

552
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,720
Your Highness is finally back.

553
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,160
Your Majesty!

554
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,680
Are you mimes?

555
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,840
His Majesty is asking you a question!

556
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,760
Where is Madam Jiu?

557
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,000
Chief Eunuch,

558
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,520
I met Madam Jiu and greeted her

559
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,840
when she went out this morning.

560
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
Did she say anything?

561
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,240
Madam Jiu said

562
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,440
she wanted to go out of palace
for some peace and quiet.

563
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,560
She said...

564
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,840
She said she was meeting someone,

565
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,240
whose name was Ye...

566
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,840
Okay, I'll see myself off from here.

567
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,240
I'm worried to let you go back alone.

568
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,840
And it is my responsibility to

569
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,360
keep you safe.

570
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm really grateful for you today.

571
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,240
This is the happiest day
I've ever had since I came to the palace.

572
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,400
And thank you for your present.

573
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,720
Xiaojiu.

574
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,760
Keep in mind what I said.

575
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,040
Come find me

576
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
if you ever feel unhappy.

577
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Your Majesty.

578
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,480
You're back.

579
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,640
Where have you been?

580
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,640
I felt cooped up in the palace.

581
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,280
So I went out for some fun.

582
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,560
By yourself?

583
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,040
Yes, by myself.

584
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,880
How could you be out there so late by yourself?

585
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,960
There's story-telling in a tavern.

586
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,600
I guess I must have been fascinated by it,

587
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
and forgot about time.
That's why I came back late.

588
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,560
What's the story

589
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,840
that made you so fascinated?

590
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,800
It was a love story about an emperor and a beauty.

591
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,880
An emperor and a beauty?

592
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,360
Yes.

593
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,320
I got so fascinated that I...

594
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,160
And you bought a bracelet.

595
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,880
I saw it in a store and thought it was beautiful,

596
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,040
so I bought it.

597
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,880
I thought you didn't fancy

598
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,600
these vulgar jewels.

599
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,760
Now I get it.

600
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,840
You just don't like what I sent you.

601
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,440
Your Majesty.

602
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,080
Never mind.

603
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,240
Take some rest.

604
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,080
I should head back.
