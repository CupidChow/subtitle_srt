1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 39

3
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,300
I was thinking about Aranya

4
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,700
when going through those tortures

5
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,300
in serpentine cage.

6
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,780
She has never been treated well

7
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,940
through her whole life.

8
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,140
If there's someone who loves her and is really nice to her,

9
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,380
she will definitely treat him way better
than anyone could have imagined.

10
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,460
Right?

11
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,540
Yes.

12
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,220
That's what Aranya would do.

13
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,940
Oh,

14
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,700
in the hall today,

15
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,420
there's someone else pleading for me

16
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,420
besides you.

17
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,660
Who was that?

18
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,220
I didn't recognize him.

19
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,700
He's Prince Xiangli He.

20
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,620
He seems to be nice to Aranya.

21
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,460
Yeah.

22
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,700
He is the only royal

23
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,220
who actually cares about Aranya.

24
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,700
He's the son of His Majesty and other concubine.

25
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,020
His Majesty's eldest son.

26
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,660
Why does he live here,

27
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,580
instead of in the royal palace?

28
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,860
His Majesty used to treat him well.

29
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
But later, His Majesty married Madam Qing Hua.

30
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,060
And then he was given the cold shoulder.

31
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,540
So later on, he's been living in Guan Chen Palace.

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,780
Poor Aranya.

33
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,540
The only one being nice to her among brothers and sisters

34
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,940
should be so far away from her.

35
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,340
Today in serpentine cage,

36
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,300
the beam burned in the massive fire

37
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,260
suddenly fell down.

38
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,780
In that moment,

39
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,140
I thought I was gonna die there.

40
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,660
But at that instant,

41
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,140
something struck me.

42
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,940
What did you remember?

43
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,260
I saw a man

44
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,020
in purple gown with silver hair.

45
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,860
I couldn't see his face clearly at all.

46
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,100
But when I saw his back view,

47
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,020
my heart hurt.

48
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,020
Maybe I have to wait

49
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,940
until I get all my memories back

50
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,340
to remember him.

51
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,100
But I'm afraid I will get myself killed by them

52
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,380
before my memories are back.

53
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,900
Your Highness.

54
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,060
You are physically stronger than I thought.

55
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,580
Serpentine cage is such a horrible place

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,180
that even ordinary people can't stand for hours.

57
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,340
But you managed to make it through the whole night.

58
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,420
You should go back now.

59
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,580
I want to go enjoy the moon.

60
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
Then what I should do is

61
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,700
to be your accompany.

62
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,260
Come.

63
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,140
Slowly.

64
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,580
Right.

65
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,020
What's Lord Xi Ze's relationship

66
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,860
with the two princesses?

67
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,820
Why do you ask this out of a sudden?

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,660
I mean, Lord Xi Ze is Aranya's husband,

69
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,900
but Lord Xi Ze seems to like Junuo much more

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,940
while Changdi has a crush on him.

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,020
When I saw Lord Xi Ze

72
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,700
worrying about Junuo's injury,

73
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,700
I felt somewhat strange,

74
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,660
yet envious of Junuo.

75
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,540
You envy Junuo?

76
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,500
In my blurred memory,

77
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,260
for quite a few times, my loved one

78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
was never around

79
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,860
when I needed him the most.

80
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,780
Bai Zhen used to talk about your temper a lot.

81
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,300
You are the type of person who can't keep things to yourself.

82
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,500
It's more worrying

83
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,900
if I leave you alone here.

84
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,660
You can talk to me if you're upset.

85
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,100
Although

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,140
I am only your nominal master,

87
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,780
I'm still your senior.

88
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,860
I was thinking when I was in serpentine cage.

89
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,260
Why am I the one confronted with such things every time?

90
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,740
And why am I alone every time?

91
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,380
Every time?

92
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,540
There were a few times

93
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,140
when my life was on the line.

94
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,940
But I managed to survive by myself every time.

95
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,460
If it weren't for those experiences,

96
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,020
perhaps I wouldn't have survived

97
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,620
in serpentine cage.

98
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,980
And then?

99
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,180
Then?

100
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,620
Then...

101
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,180
I kind of envy Junuo.

102
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,540
Lord Xi Ze must

103
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,500
like her a lot,

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,340
and care about her a lot.

105
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,260
There are so many people loving

106
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,580
and protecting Junuo.

107
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
Even if there's no Lord Xi Ze,

108
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,300
she will be safe and sound.

109
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,020
But Aranya has

110
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,940
only one husband.

111
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,420
Speaking of that,

112
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,500
I feel sad for her.

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
As a girl,

114
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,980
Aranya has never been treated with love,

115
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,340
or taken good care of.

116
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,900
I feel so sad thinking of that.

117
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,420
But on second thought,

118
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,180
am I any better than her?

119
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,660
So...

120
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,460
do you hate him?

121
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,020
I guess not.

122
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,380
I just feel a bit tired.

123
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,020
He's a very good person.

124
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,340
It's just that we're not meant to be together.

125
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,260
You're still young.

126
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,660
You will meet a better man.

127
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,060
I will meet a better man.

128
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,660
Have you ever thought about

129
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,700
what kind of man you want to meet?

130
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,300
To be honest,

131
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm not that delicate.

132
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,140
I'm not the type

133
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,300
who can't survive

134
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,860
if nobody comes to rescue me.

135
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,900
But I hope that

136
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,900
I can meet someone

137
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,460
who will show up

138
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,300
and save me

139
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,060
whenever I'm in danger,

140
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,180
instead of leaving me behind,

141
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,300
and who will comfort me when I'm in pain.

142
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,020
Don't you want to meet someone

143
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,340
who will not have you suffer

144
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,620
nor put you in danger?

145
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,820
I knew long ago that luck was not on my side.

146
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,020
I just

147
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,420
felt a sudden sorrow,

148
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,900
and I couldn't stop crying.

149
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,420
Hey.

150
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,380
It's alright.

151
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,460
Are we going to pack up

152
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,900
and head back to the kingdom tonight?

153
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,340
But Her Highness is injured.

154
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,340
Can't she take a rest at least?

155
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,500
Do you think His Majesty

156
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,860
will stay for Aranya?

157
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,420
Fine.

158
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,780
Due to the sudden fire in the temporary imperial palace,

159
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,980
we will head back to the kingdom tonight.

160
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,900
I will send Aranya back to painted pleasure boat.

161
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,860
You go pack up her belongings.

162
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,620
Got it.

163
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,940
Su Moye.

164
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,900
I will come for you later.

165
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,140
You...

166
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,220
What's wrong?

167
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,220
You look surprised.

168
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,180
Lord Xi Ze, I think you are in the wrong room.

169
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,100
Is there anything wrong?

170
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,780
I think it's improper for you

171
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,540
to come here in the middle of the night.

172
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,260
You don't want me

173
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,180
to be here with you?

174
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,340
Well...

175
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,660
Here's...

176
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,060
Here's your painted pleasure boat.

177
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,980
The temporary imperial palace caught fire tonight.

178
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,020
So everyone is back on board.

179
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,620
Lord, if you are too tired

180
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,180
to look for a room,

181
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,100
you can have a rest in my place.

182
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,500
I'll go out for some air.

183
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,660
Please keep the door unlocked when you leave.

184
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,740
Let me check on your wound.

185
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,300
Lord,

186
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
I'm Aranya,

187
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,140
not Junuo.

188
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,460
It doesn't hurt any more, does it?

189
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,260
Drink the hot sweet water.

190
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,740
Lord, you must be mistaking me

191
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,340
for Junuo.

192
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,180
I am Aranya, for real.

193
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
If you mistake me for Junuo,

194
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,180
you must be bewitched!

195
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm not bewitched.

196
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,860
But aren't you supposed to

197
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,540
be taking care of Junuo at this time?

198
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,700
Don't you want me

199
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,740
to take care of you?

200
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,180
I get it.

201
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,700
You came to take care of me

202
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,780
because Junuo wants to make up for

203
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,860
Changdi's putting me in serpentine cage.

204
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,540
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

205
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,180
I'm not intended to tell His Majesty about it.

206
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,900
Besides, I can help myself

207
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,540
to water and tea.

208
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,300
I don't need to be served on that.

209
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,220
Although we are a married couple in name only,

210
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,860
I still think it's improper for you

211
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,260
to help them

212
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
every time.

213
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,020
Aranya is so poor.

214
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,980
I mean

215
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,860
you are not in the position

216
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,460
to help Junuo and Changdi.

217
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,700
It's too...

218
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,900
It has nothing to do with them.

219
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,700
Now

220
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,500
you're reluctant to

221
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,740
take a cup of water from me.

222
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,380
Well, I'm feeling a bit thirsty now.

223
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,420
I'll drink it.

224
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Why does it taste like blood?

225
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,860
Are you feeling any better?

226
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah, better.

227
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,700
I feel like I'm lighter.

228
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,700
There are a few hours before the day breaks.

229
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,220
You can get some more sleep.

230
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,980
The night when we were enjoying Yueling flowers,

231
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,140
you said you had liked someone before.

232
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,500
I mistook you as

233
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,740
my master that day.

234
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,100
So I talked a lot to you.

235
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,260
You don't have to take it to heart.

236
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,300
I was just kidding.

237
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,580
Yeah, kidding.

238
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,500
That man.

239
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,420
He disappointed you.

240
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,300
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

241
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,620
It's just that we're not meant to be together.

242
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,140
And my memory about him is vague.

243
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,020
Only until recently

244
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,780
have I realized how tragic it is to force things.

245
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,300
So I've moved on.

246
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,380
If you have anything that you can't get over,

247
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,300
you can talk to me.

248
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,020
If

249
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,340
this man is right in front of you now,

250
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,740
you still don't believe

251
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,260
that you are meant to be?

252
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,100
Actually if both are not meant to be,

253
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,220
it's time to let go of it.

254
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,420
So it doesn't matter

255
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,900
if he's here or not.

256
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Let alone...

257
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,580
I think it's better if he's not here,

258
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,420
because I don't really want to see him.

259
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,620
Is that so?

260
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,420
He indeed disappointed you greatly.

261
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,260
Lord, I know why

262
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,460
you are talking so much to me tonight.

263
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,180
Although we are married,

264
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,300
I know it has never been what you want.

265
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,780
You are afraid that I get obsessed.

266
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,140
So

267
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,660
you hope I can meet the right guy.

268
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,980
Well...

269
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,060
you don't need to worry about that.

270
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,100
Everyone has his own fate.

271
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,180
I'm well aware of that now.

272
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,140
I'm getting sleepy.

273
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,860
Lord,

274
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,060
please close the door for me when you leave.

275
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,740
What's got into Xi Ze?

276
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,540
He said so much that he was not supposed to say to me.

277
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,340
When he came near me,

278
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,980
I smelled a scent of sandal.

279
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,540
I think I know that scent somewhere.

280
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,060
It smelled so familiar.

281
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,740
Your Excellency.

282
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,100
What's the matter?

283
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,220
Prince Qing won't sleep if Her Highness is not around.

284
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,140
I was about to find her.

285
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,340
Aranya is sleeping now.

286
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,660
I'll go check on him.

287
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,820
Okay.

288
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,820
Done.

289
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,100
Falling into sleep so soon?

290
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,300
Lord Xi Ze is so awesome.

291
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm Su Moye.

292
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

293
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,140
I couldn't confirm that

294
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,820
you are Emperor Dong Hua.

295
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,940
Forgive me if I ever acted offensively.

296
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,140
Tell me.

297
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,180
How did you get in here?

298
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,420
It was Third Prince who authorized me

299
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,620
to get into the Dream of Aranya.

300
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,380
He wanted me to help

301
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,180
Your Majesty and Fengjiu.

302
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,860
It was Lian Song who called you.

303
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,140
So you knew where Xiaobai was long ago?

304
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,460
After I got into the Dream of Aranya,

305
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,740
I found that other's primordial spirit

306
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,140
was taking over her body.

307
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,780
Undoubtedly, it's Fengjiu's primordial spirit.

308
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,180
But what's surprising is that

309
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,620
she doesn't have Aranya's memory,

310
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,580
nor her own memory.

311
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
I know about Xiaobai's situation.

312
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,060
That's not what I asked about.

313
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,860
You were Aranya's master,

314
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,900
but you are not the Su Moye from this world.

315
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,940
You came from Fanyin Valley,

316
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,700
and you took place of the original you. Is that true?

317
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,620
You're right.

318
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,100
But why did you

319
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,420
become Lord Xi Ze?

320
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,260
I have my own reason.

321
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,500
You've witnessed what had happened here.

322
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
Do you know who created this dream?

323
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,900
I don't know.

324
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,380
Then do you know what will happen to Aranya

325
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,300
and how are we going to get out?

326
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,700
Well...

327
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,540
I'm not sure, either.

328
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,380
Your Majesty, you must know Aranya's fate

329
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,580
from history book.

330
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,740
So even though Fengjiu will encounter the same thing,

331
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,540
her different personality from Aranya

332
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
will lead to a different choice,

333
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,180
thus,

334
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,140
resulting in a different outcome.

335
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,860
It's like last time

336
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,620
when she's trapped in serpentine cage.

337
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,100
Except that...

338
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Except what?

339
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,300
Fengjiu is much more

340
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,460
stubborn than Aranya.

341
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,820
Detours are inevitable for her.

342
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,300
Speaking of getting out of the dream,

343
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,540
since Aranya's life was limited,

344
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,660
I'm thinking about

345
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,780
whether or not to have Fengjiu

346
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,140
live to the end of Aranya's life.

347
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,580
In this way, her chance to get out safely is higher.

348
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,060
Don't tell her who I am for now.

349
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,820
Although there's not much spirit,

350
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,500
it's cleaner than the outside.

351
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,420
A good place to rest and recuperate.

352
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,860
You can stay here for now.

353
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,660
Help me take care of her when I'm not around.

354
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,340
Your Majesty, are you going somewhere?

355
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,060
I've got things to do.

356
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:56,860
Of course.

357
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,660
There are some things that I need you to do.

358
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,140
At your command.

359
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,060
Stop peeking.

360
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,980
It's no use trying.

361
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,820
I won't let you get into the dream.

362
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,780
Maybe I'm not so capable,

363
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,300
but at least I grew up in Fanyin Valley.

364
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,380
So I may stand more chances than those outsiders

365
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,780
in the dream.

366
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,940
Third Prince.

367
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,300
The longer we wait,

368
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,340
the more dangerous Xiaojiu and His Majesty will be.

369
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,380
Dong Hua has not been dealing with things seriously
in recent years.

370
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,540
But as long as he stays in Bihai Cangling

371
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,020
and Tai Chen Palace,

372
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,060
he will still pose a great threat

373
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,780
to the rebelling demons.

374
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,340
What's more.

375
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,740
These ancient legends from chaotic era

376
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,220
have so many unspoken secrets about the creation of world.

377
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,140
This trip is a dangerous one for Dong Hua.

378
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Once the word spreads out,

379
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,500
it will cause a great shock
among the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

380
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm more aware of the influence than you are.

381
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
But I'm still sitting here

382
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,260
keeping things in control.

383
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,180
You have nothing to be worried about.

384
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,020
I've been running about

385
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,940
for the sake of Xiaojiu and the ice face.

386
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,700
How could you two have the mood to play the game of go?

387
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,220
So did your running about pay off?

388
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,740
By the way, you are one of the earth immortals.

389
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,660
You must have read at least one
or two of the history books of the heaven

390
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,660
when you were young.

391
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,540
Do you remember the 72 gods and generals under Emperor Dong Hua

392
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,220
at the end of chaotic era?

393
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,620
I know that too.

394
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,540
It is said that the famous 72 gods and generals

395
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,860
took orders from the ice face only.

396
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,300
Either one of them

397
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,460
can equal several.

398
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,900
Lump General of the gods

399
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,700
is quite something.

400
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,500
The gods and generals are tamed under His Majesty,

401
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,580
not just because he is good at fighting.

402
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,140
It takes more than just magic powers for him

403
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,700
to get to the position that controls heaven and earth.

404
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,220
Wisdom is what it takes too.

405
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,220
Let's have a bet.

406
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,060
I have faith in Dong Hua,

407
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,980
unlike you who are so pessimistic.

408
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,220
Third Prince.

409
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,460
Just like you said,

410
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,700
His Majesty matters greatly to the universe.

411
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,300
But what if there's an accident

412
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,740
happening to him?

413
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,540
Right. To ordinary men,

414
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,300
one of his tiny fingers is worth more than

415
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,780
hundreds of Jiuge.

416
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,300
But he didn't even hesitate to leave his last words.

417
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,380
He didn't seem to realize that

418
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,740
it's a losing business

419
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,460
to the human race.

420
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,340
His Majesty and I go way back.

421
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,860
But to be honest,

422
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,300
he's much elder than me.

423
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,420
So I didn't get to see

424
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,900
how he fought at the battlefield.

425
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,500
But I was told by Mo Yuan days ago that

426
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,220
the battlefields in chaotic era

427
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,140
were the real ones.

428
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,940
The battles back then

429
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,540
were quite bloody.

430
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,740
The battles later, however,

431
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,100
were just child's play.

432
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,820
So Emperor Dong Hua was

433
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,900
the toughest one at the battlefields.

434
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,340
He often came back from the battlefields,

435
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,940
covered by blood all over,

436
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,860
with countless wounds.

437
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,940
But he didn't even move his eyebrows.

438
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,620
He was so brave and strong that

439
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,620
few could compare with him back then.

440
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,260
So I don't believe that

441
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,860
he can be trapped in such a dream

442
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,540
in Fanyin Valley.

443
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,580
But His Majesty has

444
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,620
only 10% of magic power left.

445
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,060
The God of war, Mo Yuan

446
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,540
and the reputed warfighter, Prince Ye Hua.

447
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,700
The former was brought up by God Father
who created heaven and earth.

448
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,620
The latter

449
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,380
was instructed by the God of the Original Beginning

450
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,660
from the highest heaven

451
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,020
and Guanyin from Sukhavati.

452
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
This is how kids are brought up in noble families.

453
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,980
But what does it have to do

454
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,860
with Xiaojiu and the goddamn dream?

455
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,020
You said a bunch of stuff.

456
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,660
But I'm just getting more confused.

457
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,020
You were all brought up in noble families,

458
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,540
so you know about it.

459
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,740
But Emperor Dong Hua got

460
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,020
to where he is now

461
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,540
all by himself.

462
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,060
He fought his way out.

463
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,860
Things in the ancient chaotic time were different from today.

464
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,420
If you want to learn something today,
you can just find a master.

465
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,820
But Dong Hua gained his cultivations and achievements

466
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,100
by fighting literally battle after battle

467
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,900
on his own.

468
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,500
Do you know how he grew up?

469
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,940
I only know what's recorded in history book that

470
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,940
His Majesty absorbed essence from heaven

471
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
and earth

472
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,980
with all the goodness gathered in him,

473
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,420
and he formed into a spiritual being.

474
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,420
Dong Hua shouldered heavy responsibility since he was little.

475
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,860
So he had quite a rough childhood.

476
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,300
Growing up alone in Bihai Cangling

477
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,540
without the protection of relatives,

478
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,020
he was often bullied by neighboring immortal demons.

479
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,660
The spiritual spring in Bihai Cangling that never dries

480
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,460
had been dyed red for countless times

481
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,900
before the purple-gowned boy

482
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,580
came out.

483
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,300
He stepped over numerous bones along the way

484
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,500
and finally fought his way to the top,

485
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,540
conquering the Four Seas and Six Directions,

486
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,260
protecting everyone within Eight Deserts.

487
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,020
He achieved those

488
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,660
all by himself.

489
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,940
Comparing his previous glories

490
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,900
with the misfortune in Fanyin Valley,

491
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,540
you think

492
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,420
His Majesty's power would fail

493
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,100
in the Dream of Aranya,

494
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,980
and he has no other ways out?

495
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,980
I don't think so.

496
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,300
As long as he wants to come out,

497
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,060
he will definitely make it out.

498
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,740
It's indeed impressive of him

499
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,020
to end the chaotic era and control the worlds

500
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,700
on his own.

501
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,660
It's not easy at all

502
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,220
to dominate the universe

503
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,580
in the bloody chaotic era.

504
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
If he ever resorted to a softer way,

505
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,340
it would have been a huge mess.

506
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,860
Only the tough way worked.

507
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,540
So according to what you said,

508
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,900
the ice face can fight and he's so clever.

509
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,420
He can break the Dream of Aranya easily

510
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,340
if he wants to.

511
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,180
But why haven't they come out?

512
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,340
I think it has something to do with the secrets in Fanyin Valley.

513
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,820
Why don't we be patient and wait

514
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,100
until they get out.

515
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,180
Then we can ask them about it.

516
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,620
Your turn.

517
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,780
What are you doing here?

518
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:51,860
Yan.

519
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,300
I heard you came to the valley.

520
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
So I came here to expect you.

521
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,460
How's my brother now?

522
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,380
Since you are worried about him,

523
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,060
why don't you go to Jieyou Spring yourself?

524
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,860
Lian Song gave the order.

525
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,700
We dare not interrupt.

526
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,140
It's okay. Lian Song actually likes Meng.

527
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,580
They even played the game of go together.

528
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,940
Go back to the palace now.

529
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,220
I don't trust those gods,

530
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,580
but Lian Song seems to be so certain.

531
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,300
He said the ice face would come out with Xiaojiu.

532
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,820
Let's just wait it out.

533
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,420
If you really want to...

534
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,740
What can I do to help?

535
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,700
You can ask the elders or check the ancient books.

536
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,260
Anyway, do all you can think of

537
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,580
to find out the secret about the Dream of Aranya.

538
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,900
There are so many weird things about Fanyin Valley.

539
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
Lian Song can't even figure out

540
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,860
what traps the ice face.

541
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,260
So he dare not act rashly.

542
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,940
Okay. I will try my best.

543
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,380
Good.

544
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,420
Keep me updated.

545
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,300
I will be here taking care of Ji Heng.

546
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,380
And if I'm not here, you can find me in Jieyou Spring.

547
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,020
Okay.

548
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,220
Mr. Su.

549
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,700
Mr. Su.

550
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,420
Mr. Su.

551
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,460
Coming.

552
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,140
What's going on?

553
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,940
What's the hurry?

554
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,620
Is something wrong with Her Highness?

555
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,700
Her Highness has been sleeping.

556
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,780
Actually there's something I don't know

557
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
how to explain to Her Highness.

558
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,100
The night when the temporary imperial palace caught fire,

559
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,820
Prince Qing wouldn't go to sleep.

560
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,220
Luckily, Lord Xi Ze came to visit,

561
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,660
and Prince Qing finally went to sleep.

562
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,140
And Prince Qing has been sleeping deeply up to now,

563
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,220
having no sign of waking up.

564
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,820
His Majesty was so thoughtful

565
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,980
and so nice to Her Highness.

566
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,980
He took care of the snake before he left

567
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,620
knowing that she's scared of snakes.

568
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,660
I'm afraid Prince Qing will sleep for a very long time.

569
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:58,940
By the way,

570
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,180
has Aranya ever brought it up?

571
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,980
No.

572
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,460
I think Her Highness didn't ask

573
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,500
about Prince Qing's situation
because she didn't want me to feel guilty.

574
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,740
Since you've known it so well,

575
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,780
just keep it that way.

576
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,020
If she asks you about it, you can pass the buck to me.

577
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,140
I'll explain it to her.

578
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,140
That's great.

579
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,580
Thank you, Mr. Su.

580
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,820
Now excuse me.

581
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,580
Oh.

582
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,020
When Her Highness wakes up,

583
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,860
tell her to meet me at the bow of the boat.

584
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,980
I'm going to roast fish for her.

585
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,340
Yes.

586
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,940
Roast fish?

587
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,940
Your Highness.

588
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,020
How's the pain?

589
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,500
It's not hurting any more.

590
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,740
I feel much better after a good sleep.

591
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,060
Oh, His Majesty punished me to do meditation.

592
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,540
Do I still have to do that?

593
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,620
The temporary imperial palace caught fire.
His Majesty ordered to head back to kingdom immediately.

594
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,620
So he will not go after your punishment anymore.

595
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:07,860
That's good.

596
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,860
But the wounds, Your Highness...

597
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,580
I'm sorry that I couldn't suffer for you

598
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,140
in serpentine cage.

599
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,060
How could Third Princess be so cruel?

600
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
Changdi was right.

601
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,860
Given my situation in the palace,

602
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,660
if I tell His Majesty about it,

603
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,260
she may just end up

604
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,220
getting a mild punishment.

605
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,180
Your Highness, you are too kind.

606
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,100
I feel so bad for you.

607
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,540
It's okay. Don't get upset.

608
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,180
Let's see who has the last laugh.

609
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,260
Oh, Your Highness.

610
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,180
Mr. Su invited you to eat roast fish at the bow.

611
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,140
Roast fish?

612
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

613
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,300
I am about to discuss something with him.

614
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,780
Keep on with your own business. I'll go by myself.

615
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,820
Let me.

616
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,420
- Your Highness. - Watch closely.

617
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,540
Give it to me.

618
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,740
It's very easy.

619
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,900
I didn't know it could be roasted this way.

620
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,940
Your Highness.

621
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,420
Done.

622
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,820
You are so good at it!

623
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,100
Of course.

624
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,340
I know you are good at making tea.

625
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,380
But look at what you did.

626
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,820
Making tea and roasting fish

627
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,860
are not the same, okay?

628
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
Well, forgive me.

629
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,900
It's my first time.

630
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,180
They're not the same thing.

631
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,540
Although they all need fire to cook,

632
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,460
the difference is huge.

633
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,380
I guess

634
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,100
you are not roasting fish for me.

635
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,540
You are hoping me to fix it

636
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,420
and roast fish for you.

637
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,700
That's not true.

638
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,740
The fish is not ready yet.

639
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,500
I prepared a bowl of porridge for you.

640
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,100
Wow, porridge?

641
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,500
Your Highness, please enjoy.

642
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,700
Fine, at least your conscience is not dead.

643
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,740
It's so strange.

644
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,740
Why does everything I eat

645
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,980
taste like blood lately?

646
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,700
It's probably

647
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,460
because you haven't fully

648
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,260
recovered yet.

649
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,220
You're right.

650
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,180
What a pity!

651
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,460
The porridge would taste good if there's no blood taste.

652
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,420
Great.

653
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,340
You ate it all.

654
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,380
So can you teach me how to roast a fish now?

655
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,340
The fish doesn't come easy.

656
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,460
Lord Xi Ze specifically told me that

657
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,300
the fish could be effective to you only if it's roasted.

658
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,220
I excel in

659
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,020
both the pen and the sword.

660
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,300
But roasting fish is really not my thing.

661
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,740
Your Highness.

662
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,340
Here.

663
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,340
Your Highness, here.

664
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,860
Have some sweet water.

665
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,820
You said it was Xi Ze?

666
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,500
He brought the fish?

667
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,140
Yeah.

668
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,700
And he asked me to take good care of you.

669
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,060
That's strange.

670
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,300
I felt something wrong about him last night.

671
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,460
And I thought he was bewitched.

672
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,620
He hasn't come to his sense today?

673
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,260
Didn't he say anything to you

674
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,340
after he took you back to the boat?

675
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,540
He did say something.

676
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,660
But he was acting weirdly.

677
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,820
And you told me that

678
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,140
as a husband, he didn't feel the way he should to Aranya.

679
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,340
But why do I feel like

680
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,340
he kind of cared about me?

681
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,540
Hold on.

682
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,180
I thought you were the one with me.

683
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,980
But why was it him who took me back?

684
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,620
You...

685
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,900
You don't know anything, do you?

686
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,300
The fish is burnt! The fish is burnt!

687
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,140
What do I do? What do I do?

688
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,060
Just flip it over.

689
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,580
Shen Ye.

690
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,620
Your Majesty.

691
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,940
It's really not worth it.

692
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,660
I was having a great time with my empress.

693
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,060
But the big fire ruined it for me.

694
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,460
It's been so boring sailing the boat these days.

695
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,900
Do you know any ways to have fun?

696
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,100
I observed the heaven at night

697
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,180
and I figured there will be meteors tonight.

698
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,900
It could be an astronomical phenomenon!

699
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,420
It's rare

700
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,980
even in Fanyin Valley.

701
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
You mean

702
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,780
meteors?

703
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,740
Your Majesty, you can invite Her Majesty and princesses

704
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,860
to enjoy the scene together

705
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,140
if you like.

706
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,140
That's a great idea.

707
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,460
Okay.

708
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,580
Tell your men to set up a place.

709
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,100
I will hold a banquet tonight,

710
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,220
inviting everyone

711
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,220
to enjoy the moon and view the stars.

712
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,060
As you wish, Your Majesty.

713
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,700
Your Highness.

714
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,540
Chacha came to me early in the morning,

715
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,660
asking for advice.

716
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,380
She's afraid that you asked about Prince Qing.

717
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,900
But I figure

718
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,140
you already forget about Prince Qing.

719
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,700
Right, I didn't see it yesterday.

720
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,580
Where is it?

721
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,260
Stop it.

722
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,820
It's too obvious.

723
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,980
Your Highness,

724
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,660
you should try not to sit in the cold wind.

725
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,860
You haven't recovered yet.

726
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,140
It feels good to be here.

727
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,660
The breeze and the view.

728
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,500
I feel much better.

729
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,660
Right,

730
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,780
have you found Emperor Dong Hua?

731
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,860
No.

732
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,500
Not...

733
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,180
Not yet.

734
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,420
I'm wondering how he's doing?

735
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,020
This is delicious.

736
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,900
Have a bite.

737
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,980
It's too sweet. No.

738
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,900
This is really good. Trust me. Take one bite.

739
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,020
Just one bite, okay?

740
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,260
How is it?

741
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,300
Good, right?

742
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,940
Watch me.

743
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,660
Does it taste good?

744
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,580
Lord Shen Ye.

745
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Lord Shen Ye.

746
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,460
Why are you here?

747
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
I took His Majesty's order to

748
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,660
prepare for tonight's banquet.

749
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,500
There's a banquet tonight?

750
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,220
Yes.

751
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,340
What about me?

752
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,620
Can I go?

753
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:09,780
Of course.
