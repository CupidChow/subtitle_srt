1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 40

3
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,940
They really dance well.

4
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,460
Right.

5
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,180
Would you like to have a taste of anything beside you?

6
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,260
No.

7
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,500
I've had too many walnuts.

8
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,820
Shen Ye,

9
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,060
shall not we have a drink

10
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,020
at such a good night?

11
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,300
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

12
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,860
Let's have it.

13
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,340
Why isn't Lord Xi Ze here tonight?

14
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,260
And Changdi isn't here, either.

15
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,620
Is it because she doesn't dare to see me?

16
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,940
Lord Xi Ze has something important to do,

17
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,900
so he is out for one day.

18
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,060
As for Changdi...

19
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,020
She's coming while we're talking about her.

20
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,220
Father. Mother.

21
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,740
Since we're admiring the moon and stars,

22
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,420
I'd like to play a song.

23
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,740
I wish father and mother

24
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,660
can live a happy life ever after.

25
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,540
Third Princess's filial piety is rare and commendable.

26
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,980
How sweet she is!

27
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,340
Shen Ye,

28
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,180
it's the Yueling-flower-made cake
especially baked by the imperial cook.

29
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,500
Have a taste.

30
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,860
No need.

31
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,460
You don't like it?

32
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,700
Then try this one.

33
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,220
Plum-made cake.

34
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,620
No need.

35
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,820
It's so boring here.

36
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,060
It occurred to me that I have something else to deal with.

37
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm leaving first.

38
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,700
Take a message to His Majesty for me.

39
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,740
Shen Ye.

40
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,980
Shen Ye.

41
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,340
What's wrong with Lord Shen Ye tonight?

42
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,620
He may have something to brood over.

43
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,540
Changdi played the Guqin very well.

44
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,540
Aranya,

45
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,780
come here.

46
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,020
Mother.

47
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,460
Why isn't Lord Xi Ze here?

48
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,260
I have no idea

49
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,620
where Lord Xi Ze is going.

50
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,900
Maybe he's delayed

51
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,220
by something on his way,

52
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,140
which happens all the time.

53
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,780
You don't have to worry about him, mother.

54
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,660
Mother,

55
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,060
I know where Lord Xi Ze is going.

56
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,020
Lord Xi Ze is going to the Mount Shikong
to take Herb of Michel Galingale.

57
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,860
Aranya has no idea about where Lord Xi Ze is going,

58
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,380
while you know it clearer than she does.

59
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,300
Mother,

60
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm worrying that Junuo hasn't yet been cured,

61
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,300
so I asked Lord Xi Ze

62
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,180
to go to the Mount Shikong for Herb of Michel Galingale.

63
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,180
Lord Xi Ze said I rarely asked him for something,

64
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,700
so he would go there to fulfill my wish.

65
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,340
Maybe he's gone there in a hurry,

66
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,820
so he forgot to say goodbye to Aranya.

67
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,340
That's the reason why Aranya doesn't know.

68
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,100
Since it's for taking the medicine for Junuo,

69
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
it doesn't matter whether or not I know it.

70
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,180
It's so rare for you to be so generous for once.

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,940
But the Mount Shikong is steep,

72
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,100
and the spiritual beasts
that guard Herb of Michel Galingale are extremely fierce.

73
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,020
If Lord Xi Ze got hurt,

74
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,980
I would feel sorry for you.

75
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,300
Lord Xi Ze always has strong magic power,

76
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,460
so he shouldn't be hurt by one or two spiritual beasts.

77
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,060
You've worried too much.

78
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:40,940
You...

79
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,700
It's fine.

80
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,260
It'll be enough for us to wait for Lord Xi Ze to come back.

81
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,140
I've heard that pharmacist seems to

82
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,940
have some treasure to present.

83
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,340
Report to you, Your Majesty.

84
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,740
I've heard from Your Majesty that

85
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,020
the three princesses' constitution is cold and cool.

86
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,700
I've got some Jibai fruits recently,

87
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,940
and requested medical apprentices to make congee with them.

88
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,180
I intend to present the congee to princesses
to help condition their cold and cool constitution.

89
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,220
Please make the decision

90
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,380
whether to present it right now or not, Your Majesty.

91
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,460
Jibai fruits?

92
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,060
Aranya can't eat them these days.

93
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,260
It's windy at night.

94
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,580
You didn't even wear a coat.

95
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,340
Your Majesty, I come back late.

96
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,420
Lord Xi Ze,

97
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,940
is everything okay all along the way?

98
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,140
It's fine.

99
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,940
Then my wife and I will be relieved.

100
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,140
Aranya's just been hurt in the serpentine cage,

101
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,980
so she can't be on her knees for too long.

102
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,940
Well,

103
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,940
you help Aranya back to her seat.

104
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,140
Changdi, go back to your seat.

105
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,540
This is my tea cup.

106
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,140
Yours is also mine.

107
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,860
I see no difference.

108
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,660
Come on.

109
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,500
Drink it off.

110
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,500
What's it?

111
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,620
You made it?

112
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,100
You can really cook, can't you?

113
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,500
I watched Chacha

114
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,460
cooking it in the kitchen.

115
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,540
Lord Xi Ze, you've said just now that

116
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,620
Aranya can't eat Jibai fruits recently.

117
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,020
Why is it?

118
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,060
Aranya's been using Herb of Michel Galingale

119
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,220
whose effect exactly goes against that of Jibai fruits.

120
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,060
She can't bear it.

121
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,540
Why don't I know that I'm using Herb of Michel Galingale?

122
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,980
It's in your bowl.

123
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,620
Isn't it the fish soup with ginger slices?

124
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,660
Herb of Michel Galingale is located
where Yin Qi is extremely prime,

125
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
and it's fishy.

126
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,860
So you use the fishy smell of fishes

127
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,740
to cover the smell of Herb of Michel Galingale.

128
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,260
And then you use ginger slices
to counteract the fishy smell of fishes.

129
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,780
Almost.

130
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,460
But I think if you want to

131
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,460
cover the fishy smell of Herb of Michel Galingale,

132
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,300
you can also use the smell of mutton.

133
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,180
Fine,

134
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
I'll try next time.

135
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,340
Your Highness,

136
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,820
it's not merely a cuisine

137
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,620
but an extremely valuable medicine.

138
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,940
Then it means you didn't

139
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,020
get Herb of Michel Galingale for Junuo,

140
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,500
did you?

141
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,580
If it weren't for Aranya,

142
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,460
why should I go all the way to the Mount Shikong

143
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,620
that is precipitous

144
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,620
and far away from here?

145
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,300
I've checked on Elder Princess.

146
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,340
She's almost cured.

147
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,460
It's Aranya whom

148
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,940
I'm worried too much about.

149
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,060
So that's it.

150
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,460
Are you out of your mind?

151
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,900
We were almost strangers to each other days ago.

152
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,020
Have you really lost your mind?

153
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,940
It's because

154
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,980
I tried that hard to go down the mountain

155
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,220
while you didn't come to me.

156
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,220
It's you who didn't come to me.

157
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,500
You were accompanying Junuo.

158
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,500
I did come to you,

159
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,980
but you seemed as if

160
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,300
you hadn't noticed me at all.

161
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,100
You were always by the side of your master, Su Moye,

162
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,220
so I ignored you on purpose.

163
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,660
Aren't you...

164
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
I'm jealous.

165
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,500
Lord Xi Ze,

166
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,180
you can't blacken my name.

167
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,500
Meteors. There're meteors.

168
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,340
See.

169
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,220
Meteors!

170
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,100
Meteors?

171
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,460
Meteors!

172
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,060
It's a good omen.

173
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,780
It's so beautiful.

174
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,380
Aranya,

175
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,660
I want to see meteors like this with you so much.

176
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,700
But

177
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,700
I always think she's not you.

178
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,460
Now,

179
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,380
both Xi Ze and Su Moye care so much for her.

180
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,140
She doesn't even notice me.

181
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,260
Moye,

182
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,180
do you find

183
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,020
there's anything wrong with several persons today?

184
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,300
What do you mean?

185
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,740
Such as Changdi,

186
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,500
who always values her fame so much,

187
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,580
why did she blacken her name on her own

188
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,980
in front of all?

189
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,540
If she does love Lord Xi Ze,

190
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,300
won't it be better that

191
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,580
she says it out to His Majesty directly?

192
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,780
I'm afraid Changdi had already mentioned it to His Majesty,

193
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,380
but she didn't make it.

194
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,340
Either

195
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,620
His Majesty didn't mention it to Xi Ze,

196
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,580
or His Majesty mentioned,

197
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,300
but Xi Ze refused.

198
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,500
What happened today

199
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,660
might be the scam Changdi made,

200
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,660
since she is so eager to get married.

201
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,420
How hard she schemed!

202
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,420
However,

203
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,100
she dishonored me in front of everyone,

204
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,620
which exactly solved the problem for me.

205
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,980
What do you mean?

206
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,940
I'm worrying

207
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,900
if there's one day

208
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,740
when Lord Xi Ze requests to sleep with me,

209
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,060
how can I refuse him?

210
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,180
But now, I won't need to

211
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,020
worry about it anymore,

212
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,580
if Lord Xi Ze marries Changdi.

213
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,380
Don't you think

214
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,820
Lord Xi Ze treats you with all his heart,

215
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,060
since he ventured into taking Herb of Michel Galingale for you?

216
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,900
It's true.

217
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,900
I've never imagined

218
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,180
that he treated Aranya so well.

219
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,260
It seemed how you thought of him before

220
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,740
isn't all right.

221
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,180
But I'm wondering

222
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,340
why Lord Xi Ze left so fast

223
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,540
when the banquet was over.

224
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,500
He's

225
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,860
going to learn to cook congee for someone.

226
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,620
It's so strange of him!

227
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,180
Let it go. Leave him alone.

228
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,060
Let's go.

229
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,100
Please go to the painted pleasure boat
between seven to nine o'clock in the morning.

230
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,180
I have something to talk with you.

231
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,740
From Aranya.

232
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,900
Between seven to nine o'clock in the morning?

233
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,620
How does it go?

234
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,940
Her Highness Aranya and Su Moye

235
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,180
have returned to their places respectively.

236
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,780
That's great.

237
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,060
Are you clear what I've asked you to do?

238
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,940
Yes, I am.

239
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,500
Then take action separately.

240
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,700
Yes.

241
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,860
You don't have to keep watching tonight.

242
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,300
Have a good sleep.

243
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,580
Your Highness,

244
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,740
you can finally get what you want.

245
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,380
Have a sleep,

246
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,260
Xiaobai.

247
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,380
Lord Xi Ze.

248
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,700
It's strange.

249
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,660
Why do I smell the fragrance of sandalwood incense?

250
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,700
Chacha.

251
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Chacha.

252
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,580
You Highness, you wake up.

253
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,860
You Highness, have a cup of tea to rinse your mouth.

254
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,260
Your Highness,

255
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,100
where is Lord Xi Ze?

256
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,540
Lord Xi Ze?

257
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,580
He's in his room.

258
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,900
No. No. No.

259
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,740
Lord Xi Ze did come here yesterday night,

260
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,260
and accompanied Your Highness to sleep.

261
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,260
It's I who welcomed him.

262
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,020
What?

263
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,660
He stayed here last night?

264
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,380
Of course, he did.

265
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,260
Wasn't there anything

266
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,300
happening to you?

267
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,060
What should happen?

268
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,500
It's just...

269
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,060
when I looked at Lord Xi Ze,

270
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,460
I thought

271
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,820
he'd like to

272
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,340
sleep...

273
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,420
sleep with Your Highness.

274
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,940
What?

275
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,740
Wasn't there anything happening to you indeed?

276
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,060
What's wrong with you, Your Highness?

277
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,940
How come I feel dizzy in a sudden?

278
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,620
Are you okay?

279
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,180
Junuo, time's up.

280
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,300
Be patient.

281
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,100
It's like brewing tea,

282
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,860
which needs perfect duration and degree of heating,

283
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,660
and right timing.

284
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,300
It won't work either too early or late.

285
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,060
What I need is to make everything perfect.

286
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,260
I worked so hard to make her poisoned
with the acacia-made liquid.

287
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,780
Why shouldn't I be in a hurry?

288
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,620
I truly don't understand

289
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,220
why Lord Xi Ze treats Aranya so specially.

290
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,300
Isn't she a dirty pussy

291
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,660
born in the snake pit?

292
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,820
If he were to see

293
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,860
Aranya hook up with someone else,

294
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,700
do you think he would still
give the special treatment to her anymore?

295
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
You're right.

296
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,980
As long as Aranya is convicted of the crime of adultery,

297
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,420
I will wait and see how she'll defend herself

298
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,580
under such a great sin.

299
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,660
If we want to beat her down,

300
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,300
and give her no chance

301
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,740
to turn the table but die forever,

302
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,140
it'll be the best move.

303
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,780
Your Highness.

304
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,620
Chacha.

305
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,180
Mr. Su.

306
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,060
Is Her Highness all right?

307
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,500
I don't know.

308
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,540
Her Highness fell in a faint in a sudden.

309
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,660
It's almost the time.

310
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,780
You leave first.

311
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,540
It's in public

312
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,940
that she humiliated us yesterday night.

313
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,820
How is it enough that just two of us go there?

314
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,100
Someone, come here.

315
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,980
You guys, follow me.

316
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,500
Yes.

317
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,580
What are you coming for?

318
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,940
Someone, come here.

319
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,580
Take the maid down.

320
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,780
Seal her mouth. Don't let her shout.

321
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,660
Yes.

322
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,500
You.

323
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,380
Your Highness.

324
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,980
It seems it's the right timing you have mentioned.

325
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,940
Aranya, Aranya,

326
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,820
you won't expect that you can have the ending like today.

327
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,060
Aranya.

328
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,900
Aranya.

329
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,660
Junuo,

330
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,980
isn't this the outfit of Mr. Su?

331
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,020
It looks like his.

332
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,900
Is Mr. Su

333
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,940
behind the bed curtain?

334
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,820
Aranya, come out.

335
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,700
How dare you hook up

336
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
with your master in broad daylight?

337
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,780
Even nonentities know better to protect their name than you do.

338
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,380
Don't you know how much your acts
will disgrace the name of the imperial family?

339
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,060
Junuo, what should we do?

340
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,660
Someone, come here.

341
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,660
Go invite His Majesty and Lord Xi Ze here.

342
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,100
You should say that something important is happening,

343
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,100
so you go invite them.

344
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,100
Yes.

345
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,180
You surround the boat,

346
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,820
and don't allow anyone to leave.

347
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,740
Yes.

348
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,460
How dare they!

349
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,780
Father.

350
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,500
- What's up? - Father,

351
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,100
I don't want to bother you indeed,

352
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,100
but Aranya and Mr. Su have a secret affair

353
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,380
and illicit intercourse

354
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,660
regardless of the master-apprentice ethic.

355
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,140
They're on the bed now.

356
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,180
Father,

357
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,780
it's the first time Junuo and I
come across the situation like this.

358
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,900
We're too scared

359
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,020
to do anything.

360
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:01,980
What's happening?

361
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,460
Why are you all

362
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,380
gathering in the our room so early in the morning?

363
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,620
I...

364
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
It's too noisy.

365
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,460
Aranya hasn't woken up.

366
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,260
I'll take her away first.

367
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,020
I'll give you a detailed result

368
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,340
after I fully investigate the whole thing.

369
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,900
He's not Xi Ze.

370
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,140
He's definitely Su Moye.

371
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,740
Su Moye's transformation skill is so excellent

372
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,620
that even you may not be able to recognize him.

373
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,900
You have to trust me.

374
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,900
Stop saying.

375
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,060
Lord Xi Ze,

376
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,860
what's wrong with Her Highness Aranya?

377
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,420
There may be

378
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,580
some misunderstanding.

379
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,060
I'll take Aranya to my place first.

380
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,100
Your Majesty,

381
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,420
I haven't expected

382
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
you're also here.

383
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,860
Mr. Su,

384
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,780
why do you come here?

385
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,940
Here is the thing.

386
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,940
I received a letter yesterday,

387
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,980
the signature of which is Aranya.

388
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,820
It says I'm invited to the painted pleasure boat
between seven to nine o'clock in the morning.

389
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,380
But it's I who taught Aranya to write.

390
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,900
Others may not be able to

391
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,020
recognize whether it's her handwriting,

392
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,980
but I can definitely distinguish the difference.

393
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,340
So I intend to inquire Aranya

394
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,900
when it's proper.

395
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
I didn't expect that Your Majesty

396
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,860
has come to visit her with the two princesses.

397
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,260
It's I who didn't come at the right timing.

398
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,220
Father, don't trust him.

399
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,340
He's talking nonsense.

400
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,860
On this kind of thing...

401
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,660
Your Highness, you... you can't treat me unjustly.

402
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,660
I have another letter

403
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,500
written by you.

404
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,380
Go back.

405
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,900
You wake up so soon.

406
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,820
Do you feel well?

407
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,020
Why do you ask me like this, Moye?

408
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,580
What happened?

409
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,380
Changdi and Junuo

410
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,780
wrote a letter to me in your handwriting.

411
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,580
It says to invite me to your painted pleasure boat.

412
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,780
But I found the truth later.

413
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,380
What do you mean?

414
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,100
Although they tried so hard to imitate Aranya's handwriting,

415
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,060
I can still identify

416
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,820
the extremely subtle difference.

417
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,300
Later Chacha came to me,

418
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,420
and she said there's something wrong with you.

419
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,180
Then I finally knew that you were poisoned
with the acacia-made liquid.

420
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,380
The acacia-made liquid?

421
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,780
Exactly.

422
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,460
I didn't expect they'd have played

423
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,940
such a dirty trick.

424
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,500
What happened later?

425
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,100
Later,

426
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,940
I went to Lord Xi Ze's place.

427
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,260
Since it happened,

428
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,820
we should just countermine it.

429
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,180
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

430
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,140
What they want to see is that you and Aranya stay together,

431
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,860
but what if the one they see is me?

432
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,180
So,

433
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,420
you mean that

434
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,380
we should exchange

435
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,260
to make their scheme fail,

436
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,340
which can be counted as a punishment.

437
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,620
We should exchange,

438
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,380
but it's not enough.

439
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,820
Do you know how to act perfect?

440
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,260
So...

441
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,780
when Changdi and Junuo came to catch us

442
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,380
with His Majesty,

443
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,220
they found the one in your room

444
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,820
was Lord Xi Ze.

445
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,820
This is the whole story.

446
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,700
You mean, you went to find Xi Ze for help,

447
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,140
and told him the whole story.

448
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,060
Then he countermined to pretend to be you

449
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,540
and played along with them.

450
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,140
Exactly.

451
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,740
And he also

452
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,420
decocted a dose of medicinal herbs for you

453
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,740
to steady your soul,

454
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,020
which can help you defend the poison of the acacia-made liquid.

455
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,940
But how can Xi Ze

456
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,220
fight against Junuo and Changdi for me?

457
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,740
It's too perplexing.

458
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,260
But

459
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,100
it's the first time

460
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,300
I've been wronged over and over since I grew up.

461
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,220
Everything is fine.

462
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,900
I heard that Changdi and Junuo

463
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,220
were grounded by His Majesty,

464
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,500
which is what they deserve.

465
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,620
But why am I in the room of Xi Ze?

466
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,060
The situation was too complicated at that time,

467
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
and your poison hadn't been detoxicated.

468
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,180
So he hugged you to his place for a rest.

469
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
That's it.

470
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,260
We finally return to the capital city.

471
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,780
I'm going to my mansion first to deal with some business.

472
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,340
Tell me

473
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,260
if you don't feel well. Understand?

474
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,700
Sure.

475
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,660
Don't worry too much about me.

476
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Well, I'm leaving first.

477
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,060
Let's go.

478
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,340
Excuse me. Excuse me.

479
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,980
Lord Shen Ye.

480
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,100
Your Highness, are you okay?

481
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,860
I'm fine.

482
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,500
They deserve the punishment.

483
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,980
His Majesty should punish them severely,

484
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,500
since they bullied us.

485
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,820
It will be the same whether
they make mistakes or not.

486
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,980
There won't be severe results for them this time,

487
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,260
since they are beloved daughters of His Majesty.

488
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:00,740
Forget it.

489
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,380
Let's go.

490
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,380
Certainly

491
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,060
it's the most comfortable place for me.

492
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,540
It's so lucky that Lord Xi Ze has dealt with Qing.

493
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,060
I have nothing else to worry about.

494
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,140
Your Highness.

495
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,180
Your Highness.

496
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,660
Have you bought plum wine that I asked for?

497
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,700
Your Highness,

498
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,100
there's something wrong in the imperial palace.

499
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,980
What's going on?

500
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,420
Princess Junuo was sentenced to a penalty of decapitation.

501
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,660
while Princess Changdi was condemned to exile.

502
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,100
How...

503
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,980
How could it happen?

504
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,180
Haven't they just been grounded?

505
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,780
His Majesty and Her Majesty favor them so much.

506
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,260
Your Highness,

507
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,460
they're not sentenced because of the acacia-made liquid thing.

508
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
So what's for?

509
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,140
Rumor from the imperial palace has it that

510
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,900
Princess Junuo broke the code of conduct that
women should abide by,

511
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,380
and she had an affair with the master who taught her to write.

512
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,100
She concealed the fact of her pregnancy until now.

513
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,820
His Majesty was furious

514
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
so that Princess Junuo was sentenced
to a penalty of decapitation,

515
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,420
and she was also eliminated from the book of merits.

516
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,900
She will be executed soon.

517
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,420
Commit adultery?

518
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,580
But Princess Junuo had been engaged

519
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,540
with Shen Ye long before, hadn't she?

520
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,260
Why did she have an affair with her master?

521
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,660
It's no longer a secret

522
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,060
that Princess Junuo has been pregnant,
although she isn't married.

523
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,100
That's the reason why Immortal Lord Xi Ze was invited
to go downhill to take care of her in person,

524
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,020
when Princess Junuo was hurt earlier.

525
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,340
I haven't figured it out

526
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,300
why they say her pregnancy is due to committing adultery,

527
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,420
and the infant to-be-born isn't the next archmage.

528
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,620
What about Changdi?

529
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Princess Changdi

530
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,740
was exiled to a wasteland

531
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,340
to ponder upon her faults by His Majesty,

532
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,620
because she broke one of His Majesty's favorite lamps days ago.

533
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,220
But His Majesty favors Changdi so much,

534
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,420
how could he exile her

535
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,660
just because she broke a lamp?

536
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,020
It's too weird.

537
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,820
It happened in a sudden,

538
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
so the situation wouldn't be so simple.

539
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,940
Chacha, go investigate it deeper.

540
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,900
Yes.

541
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,940
The adultery thing of Junuo

542
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,580
was exposed on 17th, April earlier.

543
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,660
But it's 27th, March,

544
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,180
which is twenty days sharp earlier than before.

545
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,660
Isn't it...

546
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,220
Your Majesty,

547
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,620
you come in time.

548
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,420
The news from the imperial palace

549
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,820
is too surprising.

550
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,700
I dare guess that

551
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,740
what happened to Junuo

552
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,180
is because you want to take advantage of Xiangli Que

553
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,020
to punish Junuo severely.

554
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,460
You're right.

555
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,100
So it's the perfect action

556
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,260
that Your Majesty mentioned earlier.

557
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,660
Your Majesty, I mean, you've already known

558
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,060
the secret of the imperial family

559
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,620
of the inseparable king birds of this generation.

560
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,140
The secret of the imperial family,

561
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,140
does it matter

562
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,940
whether I know it or not?

563
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,420
I need to return to the immortal palace
to deal with some business.

564
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,700
Please take care of Xiaobai for me

565
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,060
during the days when I'm not here.

566
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,420
Add these to her daily diet

567
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,180
and nurse her carefully.

568
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,260
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

569
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,140
I don't deserve the name

570
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,820
of being the most brilliant one all over the West Sea,

571
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,660
since I failed to take Emperor Dong Hua into account,

572
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,100
though I have pondered it over and over.

573
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,020
No,

574
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,580
Junuo can't die.

575
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,660
I can only

576
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,380
count on Fengjiu.

577
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,340
Your Highness,

578
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,220
have the congee.

579
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,940
Your Highness.

580
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,660
Moye,

581
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,420
you come in time. Let's have the meal together.

582
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,260
Mr. Su.

583
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,660
No, thanks.

584
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,620
I have something important

585
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,140
to discuss with you.

586
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,500
Chacha,

587
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,460
you leave first.

588
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
What are you doing?

589
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,260
What's it?

590
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,580
Lord Xi Ze asked me

591
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,060
to make you have it.

592
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,340
It's Xi Ze again.

593
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,620
Have you told me that

594
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,260
he and Aranya were a couple in name only, haven't you?

595
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,220
They were less a couple

596
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,660
than friends between generations.

597
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,100
Lord Xi Ze desired nothing,

598
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,620
but how he treated Aranya

599
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,540
better deserved the name of a master

600
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,620
than how I did.

601
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,260
Are you sure?

602
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,980
Is the one you mentioned

603
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
the same Xi Ze who had entangled relationships with

604
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,860
both Changdi and Junuo,

605
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,700
but acted nice to me recently?

606
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,820
Now that the place is the rebuilt one,

607
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,700
there may occur some problems during the process.

608
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,980
It's possible that there may exist some problems

609
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,500
that lead to some changes

610
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,700
in the personality of Xi Ze.

611
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,980
But the previous Xi Ze

612
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,940
did desire nothing.

613
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,860
Then do you have some methods

614
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,660
to make him be whom he used to?

615
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,980
I really don't like how he acts now.

616
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,140
No, I don't.

617
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,420
Well,

618
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,180
come on. Eat up the congee.

619
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,260
I have something important to tell you.

620
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,060
Why can I taste the smell of blood again?

621
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,700
Let it go.

622
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,020
I feel better

623
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,580
after I have the congee for days.

624
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,580
Well,

625
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,220
what do you want to tell me?

626
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,660
You've heard that

627
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,700
Junuo will be sentenced to a penalty of decapitation,
haven't you?

628
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,540
Yes, I have.

629
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,060
No matter what mistakes Junuo has made,

630
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,900
as her parents,

631
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,980
shouldn't His Majesty and Her Majesty cover up for her?

632
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,900
Why does His Majesty

633
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,420
guillotine her directly?

634
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,380
In fact,

635
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,060
Junuo isn't His Majesty Xiangli Que's biological daughter.

636
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,540
Don't you always want to know the story

637
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,780
of the siblings?

638
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,940
I can tell you now.

639
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,940
It's said that

640
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,940
Xiangli Que got the throne by killing his brother.

641
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,780
His beloved Madam Qing Hua

642
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,300
was originally the wife of his brother, Xiangli Yin.

643
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,380
Madam Qing Hua was supposed to suicide after her husband died,

644
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,220
but she had already conceived Junuo.
She couldn't bear to do that.

645
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,580
Besides, Xiangli Que worshiped Qing Hua so much

646
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,820
that he spared Junuo.

647
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,140
Then Madam Qing Hua remarried Xiangli Que.

648
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,860
So Junuo's biological father is Xiangli Yin?

649
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:32,900
Exactly.

650
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,020
Sparing Junuo

651
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,060
was the last thing

652
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,300
that Xiangli Que expected to do that very year.

653
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,020
Xiangli Que wanted to kill Junuo long before.

654
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,140
It's disappointing that Junuo unexpectedly

655
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,780
had illicit intercourse with her master.

656
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,060
Although Madam Qing Hua had tried her best

657
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,100
to cover up for Junuo

658
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,580
and schemed to make the baby she was conceiving

659
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,620
pretend to be the next archmage.

660
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,020
But what happened between

661
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,500
you and Xi Ze this time

662
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,500
hindered the plan of Junuo and Madam Qing Hua,

663
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,180
which gave the chance to Xiangli Que

664
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,500
to find the proof.
