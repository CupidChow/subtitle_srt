00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 5

3
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
Min Su!

4
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,440
Min Su.

5
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,640
Min Su.

6
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,810
Min Su!

7
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,760
Your Highness!

8
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,560
It's dangerous. Don't come over.

9
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,440
Leave here now!

10
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,040
Min Su!

11
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,760
Go!

12
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,080
Watch out!

13
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
Min Su!

14
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,680
Are you okay?

15
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,760
Why did you save me at the risk of your life?

16
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
You really

17
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,680
look like your mom.

18
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,520
My mom?

19
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
Do you know her?

20
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Do you have a dragon scale on you?

21
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,800
How...

22
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
How did you know that?

23
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
That year,

24
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,280
you were just six.

25
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,720
You were almost burnt

26
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
by a fire monster.

27
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,960
It was me that saved you

28
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
and gave you the dragon scale.

29
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,680
Since then,

30
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,400
whenever I got into trouble,

31
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
I felt like someone was there helping me

32
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,240
and the scale would respond.

33
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,240
It's you.

34
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
It's you that have been protecting me in secret

35
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,880
and keeping me safe.

36
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
So...

37
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,760
So...

38
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,680
Who on earth are you?

39
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm your father.

40
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

41
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,280
Fath...

42
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,520
No.

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,640
No.

44
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,560
Impossible.

45
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,800
Nobody has ever told me about that.

46
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,160
You and my mom...

47
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,000
You've never...

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,680
Heng,

49
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
in those years,

50
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,960
unable to bear Demon Lord Chi 's torture anymore,

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,240
your mom ran away from the demons and then met me.

52
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
We concealed our true names and came to the south desert.

53
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,800
Then you were born.

54
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Are...

55
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
Are you really...

56
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
...my father?

57
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,120
Your Majesty.

58
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,360
I'm so glad to see you again before I die.

59
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,120
Don't do that.

60
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
Why are you so badly injured?

61
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,560
It's okay.

62
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,200
Your Majesty, don't worry.

63
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,040
Your Majesty,

64
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,960
she's my daughter

65
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Ji Heng.

66
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
You insisted on staying here

67
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
just because of her, right?

68
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,200
It's all my fault.

69
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,400
I wanted to save Min Su,

70
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,480
so he was severely injured.

71
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,640
He was injured to save me.

72
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,910
Your Majesty,

73
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,400
please save him.

74
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
You can save him, right?

75
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,150
It's too late.

76
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
No.

77
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
No.

78
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,160
It's not true.

79
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,920
Your Majesty,

80
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,400
can you do me a favor?

81
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,000
Go ahead.

82
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
Ji Heng

83
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,600
is poisoned with Qiushui Cold Toxin.

84
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,800
and I can't take care of her anymore.

85
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Can you take care of her

86
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,600
and keep her safe?

87
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,880
Trust me. I will take care of her

88
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,640
and try to detoxify the poison.

89
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,880
No.

90
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,480
I'll hate you.

91
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Stay.

92
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,680
I'll hate you if you leave.

93
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,760
I'll hate you all my life.

94
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,720
No.

95
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,720
No.

96
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,640
Dad.

97
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,920
Dad.

98
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
Dad.

99
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,320
Dad.

100
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,960
Dad.

101
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,560
Where are you from, little fox?

102
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Where are you from?

103
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,200
Jiu.

104
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,560
Your Highness?

105
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,600
Why did you become a common spiritual fox?

106
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,920
How about your magic arts?

107
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,160
Did you lose them?

108
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,280
I'm pregnant with His Majesty's baby.

109
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,400
What has happened?

110
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,960
You're fooled, Your Highness.

111
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,680
If you got pregnant

112
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
from just kissing him,

113
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,920
I'd give birth to two sons.

114
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,360
Come on.

115
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Now that you're here, just stay.

116
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Write down

117
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,600
everything about how you become

118
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
what you are.

119
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,240
Write it down.

120
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,360
Dad.

121
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,280
Your Majesty, thank you for saving me.

122
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
The poison hasn't been removed completely.

123
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
You still need a good rest.

124
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,640
Min Su.

125
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,840
Your Majesty, how is Min Su doing?

126
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
He'll survive.

127
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,760
Your Majesty,

128
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
can I beg you for something?

129
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,040
My elder brother

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Xu Yang

131
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
wouldn't spare Min Su.

132
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
Your Majesty,

133
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
can you help us?

134
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,680
The two of you...

135
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,400
We've known each other since childhood.

136
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,440
When I was young,

137
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,360
my brother wouldn't let me talk to anyone else.

138
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,120
Only Min Su stayed with me

139
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,800
and took care of me.

140
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't want to marry the guy chosen by my brother.

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
But he...

142
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Your Majesty,

143
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,800
I'll marry nobody

144
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,920
but Min Su.

145
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,760
I hope you can help me.

146
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,120
Your Majesty, you've underestimated me.

147
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,280
How could you trap me in such a small ward?

148
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,840
Demon Lord,

149
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,760
Her Highness is back.

150
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,240
Where is she?

151
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,240
Just outside the palace.

152
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,360
She's with Emperor Dong Hua.

153
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Dong Hua?

154
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,800
Dong Hua,

155
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
why is my sister injured?

156
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,360
She's poisoned with Qiushui Cold Toxin.

157
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,840
Qiushui?

158
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,440
Dong Hua,

159
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,920
you saved her life.

160
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,440
We're deeply grateful.

161
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,200
The poison hasn't been removed completely.

162
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,080
She still needs a good rest.

163
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
Thank you for your advice.

164
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,720
Dong Hua,

165
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
can you tell me

166
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,080
what on earth has happened between
you and Heng on Baishui Mountain?

167
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,720
Nothing special.

168
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,920
I just met her by chance.

169
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,120
By chance?

170
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,080
Dong Hua, do you still remember

171
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,240
what you promised us at the Forbidden Land?

172
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,600
Go ahead.

173
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
I hope

174
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,440
you can marry Ji Heng.

175
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
I'm afraid I can't.

176
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,480
You made a promise.

177
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,840
Do you want to go back on it?

178
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,640
It has nothing to do with my promise.

179
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,720
It's just I've never planned

180
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,800
to get married.

181
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,000
You once promised

182
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,640
you'd say yes to my request

183
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,120
as long as it's not morally wrong

184
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,360
and it doesn't hurt anyone.

185
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,000
Why are you making excuses?

186
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,760
So what?

187
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,360
Dong Hua,

188
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
your marriage matters a lot.

189
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,320
It's not something just between you and me.

190
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,200
I actually put it forward for the sake of the gods, the demons

191
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,680
and even the whole world.

192
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,720
The gods and the demons will live together in peace

193
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,960
and there won't be wars anymore.

194
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
Isn't lasting peace

195
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,480
what you wish for?

196
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
So, you want your sister to marry me

197
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
for lasting peace of the six worlds.

198
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,240
Exactly.

199
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,560
What else do you think?

200
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In this case,

201
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
you can send Ji Heng

202
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
to Tai Chen Palace in three months.

203
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,520
You agreed?

204
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,560
You have lofty ideals,

205
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
but you should also remember

206
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Ji Heng will be one of the gods

207
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,480
after she marries into our clan

208
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,160
and then won't have to follow the rules of the demons.

209
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,120
Besides,

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,000
in case anything happens to your clan in the future,

211
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm sure you'll keep sparing no effort

212
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,600
for the peace of the universe

213
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,840
and won't leave your clan members acting against the law.

214
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
For this purpose,

215
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,160
I have to fulfill your wish.

216
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,400
You have a great deal of foresight.

217
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,600
I admire you.

218
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,160
I've said yes to your request.

219
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,830
As for Ji Heng's guard,

220
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,110
how about forgiving him?

221
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,160
Now that she's going to marry you,

222
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,350
I'll spare him.

223
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,560
His Majesty often makes an inspection tour like this.

224
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,240
It's not been a long time since he left.

225
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,640
Why do you miss him so much?

226
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,840
I'm really worried about you.

227
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,600
His Majesty couldn't stay with you every day.

228
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,720
Well. Don't cry.

229
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,560
His Majesty asked me to take good care of you.

230
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,600
How about this?

231
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,320
I'll open the ward

232
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,960
so that you can play around in the palace.

233
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,720
Okay?

234
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,080
Little fox, how can you lie to me?

235
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,720
I want to stay with His Majesty every now and then.

236
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm going to meet him!

237
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,080
You little fox.

238
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,160
You deceived him into opening the ward.

239
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,380
Your Majesty.

240
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,920
Foster brother, you're back.

241
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,440
Your Majesty.

242
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,610
Your Majesty,

243
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,040
it turns out the little fox went to meet you.

244
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
Aren't they resin of cinnamomum camphora

245
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,640
and stamens of green lotuses from Baishui Mountain?

246
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,120
It turns out he went to collect medicine for me.

247
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,880
These are the two kinds of effective medicine

248
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,920
to cure wounds, right?

249
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,440
Get the gallipot here.

250
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,880
His hand is injured.

251
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
It must've happened

252
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,120
when he got medicine for me.

253
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,080
I'll also make

254
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,440
a great healing ointment for him.

255
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,000
Jiu from the Imperial Kitchen is good at cooking.

256
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,760
Ask her to prepare food for the fox.

257
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,040
There is one thing I have to report to you.

258
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,800
Jiu disappeared.

259
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,480
I think she has something to do with the demon

260
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,720
who came here disguised as you.

261
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,840
You liar.

262
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm open and aboveboard.

263
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,520
How could I be a spy of the demons?

264
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,080
I'm from Qingqiu.

265
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,880
You framed me up

266
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,160
just to stop me from coming back again.

267
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,160
Now that you care about the fox,

268
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,680
how about letting my subordinate Yu Ru take care of it?

269
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
It's better to leave me alone.

270
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,600
I may live a longer life

271
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
without your subordinate.

272
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,680
Don't bother.

273
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,640
Now that there is no suitable person,

274
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,680
I'll take care of it myself.

275
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,840
Foster brother,

276
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,560
we know nothing about the little fox's background.

277
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,040
I'm afraid it is transformed by some demon with magic arts.

278
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,560
You have to be careful.

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,800
You're thinking too much.

280
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,040
You can even cry.

281
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,760
Why can't you jump on me?

282
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,200
He sent me a piece of jade.

283
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,720
Is it the so-called token of affection?

284
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,520
You're so lively.

285
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,800
I'm sorry that you got trapped in the soul-locking jade

286
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
and almost lost your life.

287
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
It's nothing.

288
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,280
I'm willing to do anything

289
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,920
as long as I can stay by your side.

290
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,320
He used to be one of my generals.

291
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,080
He was bold and powerful at that time

292
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,080
and got me out of trouble several times.

293
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,320
Today,

294
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,760
I could do nothing but watch him die.

295
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,920
OMG.

296
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,040
I thought

297
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,720
he's the most resolute and ruthless god
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

298
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
but he also feels sad sometimes.

299
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,920
What's so special

300
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,840
about love?

301
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,800
Why did a brave general like him choose to do that?

302
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,680
He could've survived.

303
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,240
Your Majesty,

304
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
I'm willing to do anything for you,

305
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,680
but,

306
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,120
I don't want to die for you.

307
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
It's not that I'm not sincere enough,

308
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,000
It's just

309
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,600
I prefer to live with you.

310
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,720
I have a great yearning to stay with you,

311
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,160
so I can't die.

312
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
I hate to part with you.

313
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,640
Your Highness,

314
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,480
you made trouble again.

315
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,560
Do you know your fur is...

316
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,600
Did you draw it?

317
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,480
Flowers bloom and fade and turn into mud.

318
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,520
Safe and peaceful, we stay with each other forever.

319
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,040
Si Ming, you're impolite.

320
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,880
How can read my poem without my permission?

321
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,520
Just so so. It's a tongue twister at most.

322
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,720
You bad guy.

323
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,400
But I think

324
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,480
this painting is not bad.

325
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,800
Speaking of Technique of the Buddha's Seal Wheel,

326
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
only three people have grasped it.

327
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,600
The first is Mo Yuan from the Kunlun Mountain.

328
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,640
The second is the Buddha from Sukhavati.

329
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,600
The third is His Majesty.

330
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
You're most fortunate

331
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,800
to have a chance to see it.

332
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,920
That's for sure.

333
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,840
His Majesty is so powerful.

334
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,600
I'm bound to spread it

335
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,640
and let more people

336
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,200
know about the heroic epic.

337
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,160
Si Ming, where is that thing?

338
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
This is what you want.

339
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Don't open it completely.

340
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,880
Take out as much as you need.

341
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,640
What is it?

342
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,120
Cotton rose ointment.

343
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,800
Did you make it?

344
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Wait a second.

345
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,040

on the Winter Solstice.

369
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,080
By then,

370
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,840
I'll get your paws red

371
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,040
and paint with them.

372
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,520
What do you think?

373
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,920
His Majesty is also thinking about the future.

We'll spend a lot of time with each other in the future.

375
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,000
Alright.

376
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
From now on,

377
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,200
I'll stop eating my head off.

I'll be a useful fox

00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,000
to bring glory to him.

380
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:09,840
♪ They remember each other no matter how the world is changing. ♪

381
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:17,320
♪ I'll never give up unless the earth and heaven get old. ♪

382
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:24,400
♪ I hope destiny will bring us together. ♪

383
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,280
♪ It's melancholy and sorrowful. ♪

384
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,600
♪ It's miserable to part with who you love. ♪

385
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,960
I'll be a useful fox.

386
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,800
Well. I'll try to do that when summer is over.

387
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,080
You really love the little fox.

388
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,280
To let it enjoy the shade,

389
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,600
you've got two sandalwood trees cut

390
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,120
and rock crystal has been used to avoid water.

391
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,240
In this way

392
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,360
can it relax in the cool pavilion in midsummer.

393
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm even inferior to a fox.

394
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,280
Your Highness, please don't say that.

395
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,880
It's just a pet.

396
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,320
I've done so many things

397
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
for the sake of him.

398
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,280
But in the end,

399
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,480
it's a pet that has benefited from this.

400
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,400
Your Majesty,

401
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,400
have you always been reading Buddhist scriptures alone

402
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,800
in the daytime

403
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,440
and at night?

404
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,800
As long as I'm here,

405
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,600
he won't feel lonely again.

406
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,560
I'll give all best things in the world

407
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
to him.

408
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
When I'm able to speak,

409
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll deceive him into going to Qingqiu.

410
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,760
By then, I'll say this to him.

411
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,640
Look.

412
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Stars here are so big.

413
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,420
They're not cute.

414
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,940
I can take you to Qingqiu

415
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,700
and watch stars there.

416
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,800
Okay.

417
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,880
Has His Majesty seen you

418
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,320
behave like this?

419
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,920
You won't listen to me unless I mention His Majesty.

420
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,360
Are you angry?

421
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,840
How about shaking hands?

422
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,640
Anger makes you age more quickly.

423
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,000
Look. I'm old enough.

424
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,840
I can't remember anything.

425
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
I can't remember who said

426
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,480
the root of Hanshi grass

427
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,160
is effective in helping people forget sorrow

428
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
and its flowers are top seasoning.

429
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,600
And I can't remember who wants the seed.

430
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,760
It's you.

431
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,200
I looked for it on purpose

432
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,200
when I went to Sukhavati for the Buddha's lectures.

433
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,420
It's said it's the last seed on Ling Mountain

434
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,160
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

435
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,480
The last one.

436
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,680
You're happy now.

437
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,560
I'll give it to you

438
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,400
when you leave the Sky Kingdom.

439
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,840
Your scared me.

440
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,640
Don't eat it!

441
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,400
I'll bury it here.

442
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,560
The location won't matter

443
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,240
if I can stay with His Majesty in the future.

444
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,920
It's just cooked.

445
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,960
By me.

446
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,600
Your Majesty.

447
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,840
I've been thinking about it.

448
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,880
His Majesty and I don't share the same hobbies.

449
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,120
I'm not good at anything he can do.

450
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,080
But unexpectedly,

451
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,280
he's also good at cooking, the only thing I'm expert at.

452
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,600
I finally found something

453
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,670
we're both good at.

454
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,190
I'm much relieved.

455
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
Is it good?

456
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,440
For real,

457
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,280
it's so...

458
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,230
...so awful.

459
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,280
What should be the look on my face when I talk to him?

460
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,400
My auntie once told me

461
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,670
a story about a bride.

462
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,360
She was not good at cooking.

463
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,800
One day, she was seized by a whim

464
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,040
and decided to cook soup.

465
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
She won high praise from her husband.

466
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,800
Later, the bride tasted the soup

467
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
when she did the dishes,

468
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,320
only to find

469
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,800
her husband said those words

470
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,520
to make her happy.

471
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,040
So...

472
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
Then the couple loved each other more.

473
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,160
It became an interesting story

474
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,200
on everybody's lips.

475
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,320
I can't tell him it's awful.

476
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
Your Majesty,

477
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,920
please observe carefully

478
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,000
and realize I'm smiling with a little reluctance.

479
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,120
It'd be best

480
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,120
if you taste it yourself.

481
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Do you mean...

482
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,400
You want to have some more?

483
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
There is no more for today.

484
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,080
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

485
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,320
Don't bother.

486
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
I've tasted it.

487
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,920
It's awful.

488
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,680
But I think

489
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,040
it may be to your taste now that you're a different species.

490
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,040
So I took it to you.

491
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,440
As expected,

492
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,040
you foxes really have a different taste.

493
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,280
I've eaten so much food prepared by His Majesty

494
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,040
that I've lost lots of fur.

495
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,720
If it goes on like this,

496
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,360
I'd become bald.

497
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
It seems I have no other choice

498
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,880
but to tell him the truth.

499
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,760
Alright.

500
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,040
I'll use body language to tell him

501
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,040
I don't like the carp.

502
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,840
Good tea.

503
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,000
There is a guest.

504
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,520
I can't eavesdrop on them.

505
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
It's impolite.

506
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,720
Your Majesty,

507
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,800
I haven't heard that

508
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,120
you're interested in pets.

509
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,880
Why did you suddenly raise a spiritual fox?

510
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's special.

511
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,680
Maybe it's destiny.

512
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,280
Don't try to fool me.

513
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,760
I've seen spiritual foxes

514
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,800
better-looking than that.

515
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,960
The ladies in the Bai family of Qingqiu

516
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,760
are all gorgeous.

517
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,440
What's special

518
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,880
about your fox?

519
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,760
It likes the sweet and sour fish

520
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,240
made by me.

521
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,080
It's really special.

522
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,800
Such being the case,

523
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,000
if I tell him

524
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,440
I was lying,

525
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:12,960
then...

526
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,440
Anyway,

527
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
it's a white lie.

528
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,960
I'd better just let it continue.

529
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,320
If I keep eating the fish cooked by him,

530
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,880
all my fur would fall out,

531
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,160
but it doesn't matter.

532
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,240
I'll pretend

533
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,640
it's time to molt.

534
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,920
Did you just smile?

535
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,040
Do you like it?

536
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,320
Yes.

537
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,280
Have a look. Do you like it?

538
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
I like all your paintings.

539
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,760
Wait for me at the central yard if you wake up.

540
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,600
I'll feed you.

541
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
What's special about that little fox?

542
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
It's more important than me in your mind.

543
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,520
Why?

544
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,680
Anyway,

545
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,600
in this case, I can't go to the west desert

546
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,960
to do what you want me to.

547
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,040
I promised your father I'd look after you.

548
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,600
I mean what I say.

549
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,040
It's just a pet. Don't take it seriously.

550
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,360
See?

551
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,120
In his mind,

552
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
you're just a pet.

553
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,040
But you always dream of staying with him.

554
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,000
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

555
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,640
Now I can go to the west desert and give rain.

556
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,760
I wonder if he's still interested in you

557
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,480
when I come back.

558
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,680
I hope I can still see you in Tai Chen Palace.

559
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,600
His Majesty is so nice to me.

560
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,120
Am I really just a pet in his mind?

561
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,240
If he knows my true identity...

562
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,880
If I tell him

563
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,080
I'm Princess of Qingqiu,

564
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,560
will he blame me?

565
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,760
He drew paintings with me

566
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,480
and sent me such nice white jade.

567
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,720
He said so much to me with me in his arms.

568
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,320
Little thing,

569
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
you're so naughty,

570
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,760
but His Majesty just won't get mad at you.

571
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,440
That's because I'm important in his mind.

572
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,200
Go with me.

573
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,600
His Majesty is looking for you.

574
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,800
Your Majesty.

575
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,640
Your Majesty.

576
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,280
Little fox.

577
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,360
Little fox. Wait.

578
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,480
Wait.

579
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,040
Our honored guests will be here soon.

580
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,320
Don't make trouble

581
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,720
to let us lose face.
