00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 33

3
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,860
Why do you think he chose me?

4
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,060
That's strangely uncommon!

5
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,460
Probably because you're young
and naive without much experience.

6
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,940
Do you notice that two pairs of
eyes have been watching over me

7
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,380
ever since I came out of the Zuilixian Restaurant?

8
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,460
Yes, I surely do!

9
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,860
It's smiling at you

10
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,180
on your shoulder now.

11
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,260
I'm joking.

12
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,780
Where have you been yesterday night?

13
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,460
Your Majesty gets up really early.

14
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,980
Have you had breakfast?

15
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,460
Do you need me to prepare something for you?

16
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,060
One of my friends was in a bad mood yesterday night.

17
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,940
I brought him to his senses.

18
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,660
Is that so?

19
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,900
Did I tell you

20
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,660
we're having confined training in these 10 days.

21
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,380
You can't get in touch of the outside

22
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,060
without my permission.

23
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,620
It's Meng.

24
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,820
I can't leave him alone, can I?

25
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,460
It seems you have a lot of friends.

26
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,500
I...

27
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,660
Did you turn a deaf ear to my words?

28
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,340
I don't dare to.

29
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,340
But you breached the ward privately!

30
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,500
You're half-hearted and capricious.

31
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,740
How can you win

32
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,540
like that?

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,180
If you don't want to win,

34
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,740
just tell me

35
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,780
so that I can remove the ward

36
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,940
and stop wasting efforts in teaching you.

37
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,580
My apologies!

38
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,420
Do you mean it?

39
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,340
I should not have sneaked out

40
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,260
without your approval.

41
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,140
I promise

42
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,340
I'll surely train whole-heartedly

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,260
and more diligently.

44
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,620
Then why are you still standing here?

45
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,380
Where are you going?

46
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,540
For breakfast!

47
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,940
Not stable enough!

48
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,260
Too slow!

49
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,060
Faster!

50
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,940
Faster!

51
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,340
A sword propping up the sky!

52
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,500
Jump!

53
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Turn back!

54
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,220
A dragon dipping into the water!

55
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,780
Who told you to stop?

56
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,220
I've trained for a whole day!

57
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,420
His Majesty didn't say a word.

58
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,780
It looks like I really offended him yesterday night.

59
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,820
Now he's avenging his personal
grudge with his position.

60
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,100
However,

61
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,940
it's sort of productive

62
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,860
after a full day's training.

63
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,060
Your Majesty,

64
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,860
it's no longer a challenge to me

65
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,980
to walk on snowy stakes with eyes covered.

66
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,180
A real warrior can kill

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,060
on the snowy stakes with eyes open

68
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,500
and don't get trapped by it.

69
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,820
I think I need to train

70
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,460
on how to treat everything as nothing.

71
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,580
What are you doing?

72
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,980
You're yet to reach the state

73
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,220
of treating everything as nothing.

74
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,100
Whichever way works for a contest of martial art.

75
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,420
But what kind of contest it is for playing qin and flute.

76
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,500
I've tried to persuade Her Majesty,

77
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,260
but Her Majesty insisted on this.

78
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,100
You're the chief examiner.

79
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,940
Don't be too hard on me by then.

80
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,860
But I can't take sides with you too obviously.

81
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,540
Can't you play at all?

82
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,380
You said before

83
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,100
that you'll promise me something

84
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,660
as long as I learn the four arts.

85
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,260
So I studied them for some time,

86
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,740
but got only the surface of it rather than the gist.

87
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,900
Then it's fine!

88
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,140
I can teach you music.

89
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,980
You should be able to make it through

90
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,300
with a simple piece of music.

91
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,220
Great!

92
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,860
How do we contest this time?

93
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,220
This time is about the tutti of qin and flute.

94
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,060
I'll select a piece of qin music by then.

95
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,780
The contestant just needs to play flute along with me.

96
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,180
Do you mean we play together?

97
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,420
That's great!

98
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,020
By then, the acoustic resonance between us

99
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,660
will surely become a story
on everybody's lips in Fanyin Valley.

100
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,260
Try it now

101
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,100
and show me what you got.

102
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,300
Sure!

103
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,340
What about

104
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,500
a simpler one?

105
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,740
Listen up!

106
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,620
You're playing too fast. I can't catch up.

107
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,220
Maybe you should teach me qin first

108
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,100
so that I can find some inspiration.

109
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,500
Fine!

110
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,700
All music is interlinked.

111
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,540
Perhaps it'll be helpful to you.

112
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,220
How did you place your fingers just now?

113
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,060
Let's do it one finger at a time.

114
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,980
Watch carefully!

115
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,820
Sorry!

116
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,660
Did I hurt you?

117
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,140
I'm awake now.

118
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,100
Right on time!

119
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,700
Unlay your clothes.

120
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,700
The neckline is so tightly attached.

121
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,660
I can't daub any other parts.

122
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,580
I will go on with the sleep.

123
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,140
Are you afraid that I will do something to you?

124
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,300
You're so severely injured.

125
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,460
What can I do to you?

126
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,260
If you really care about me,

127
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,380
why don't you let me up in day time?

128
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,780
Considering the time when it's said,

129
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,820
who knows if it's true or false

130
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,900
and not a prank on me?

131
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,500
I won't be taken in.

132
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,500
Cultivation requires you

133
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,980
to fall down

134
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,300
and crawl up

135
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,460
before it works.

136
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,180
Xiaobai,

137
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,300
I can't stay with you forever

138
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,620
to help you out whenever you need.

139
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,540
That sounds like I'm a pustule.

140
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,860
I survived well enough without you

141
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,940
after I fell into the Fanyin Valley.

142
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,180
You can't talk to me like that.

143
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,380
Moreover,

144
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,340
I barely had any physical suffering

145
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,180
before I met you.

146
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,820
It's all because you tossed me around

147
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,700
that I had so much bruises after I came in here.

148
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,820
You would have been smashed into pieces

149
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,980
when you fell into the Fanyin Valley

150
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,820
if it hasn't been the protection of my Tiangang Shield.

151
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,340
It doesn't need me to toss you around.

152
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,420
That's because Yan is good enough

153
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,740
to have cushioned me...

154
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,980
So you haven't been indifferent to me.

155
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,740
I've long heard

156
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,500
how important Tiangang Shield is to the gods.

157
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,220
You've put it on me to protect me.

158
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,340
Where is it now?

159
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,260
I mean

160
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm very grateful

161
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,540
that it's protected me for so long,

162
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,980
but it's really improper

163
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,260
to put something as valuable as that on me.

164
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,700
It should be taken out and returned to you.

165
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,220
Why is that?

166
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,540
It's nothing but a ramification of my fairy power.

167
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,180
When my eclosion comes,

168
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,220
it'll naturally return to ashes.

169
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,660
Eclosion!

170
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,540
You also have eclosion?

171
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,220
Why do you have it?

172
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,780
If the eclosion

173
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,100
has to come,

174
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,100
when will it be?

175
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,100
Since the opening of the earth and sky,

176
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
no disaster could jeopardize the lives

177
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,180
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

178
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,620
If there is,

179
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,340
the day will be the time of my eclosion.

180
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,420
But it takes another hundreds of thousands of years

181
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,580
for something like that to happen again.

182
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,420
You don't need to worry about that into tears.

183
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,060
I do not worry.

184
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,420
Now that the back of your hand

185
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,100
doesn't have any cuts,

186
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,780
why do you still carry

187
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,060
the cotton rose ointment with you all the time?

188
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,020
How do you know

189
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I usually have cuts on my hands?

190
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,260
Crap!

191
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,260
His Majesty doesn't know I'm little fox.

192
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,020
Nobody else other than

193
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,180
the servants beside him

194
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,940
and the little fox should know about it.

195
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,060
The cotton rose ointment

196
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,460
cures only chaps, doesn't it?

197
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,340
Your cotton rose ointment is really well-made.

198
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
So even!

199
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,820
I raised a little fox in the past.

200
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,540
This is made by it.

201
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,980
That's a really nimble-clawed fox!

202
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,420
The cotton rose ointment is really fragrant.

203
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,140
Why do you dub it on my face?

204
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,620
It's said that this is good for keeping young.

205
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,140
Don't waste it!

206
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,700
Then let's share it.

207
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,700
You want to dub more on my face?

208
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,100
Let me see where I should dub it.

209
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,300
Don't move!

210
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,420
This is Emperor Dong Hua,

211
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,540
the most respected god in the world

212
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,340
whom I once admired the most.

213
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,300
Are we not sharing it?

214
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,500
Why do you stop dubbing?

215
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,980
I...

216
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,660
I need to go to bed.

217
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,700
Don't you get washed before that?

218
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,820
I'll wash the quilt directly tomorrow when I get up.

219
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,500
His Majesty is a bit different tonight.

220
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,580
He cleaned up for me before he left.

221
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,420
Why do you change all of a sudden?

222
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,020
The examiner plays qin according to his will
of speed with a lot of changes

223
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,940
to test the examinee's ability to keep in tune.

224
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,100
Examinees should pre-judge
the changes of the qin music.

225
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,620
How to pre-judge?

226
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,180
Knowing the player's heartfelt wishes

227
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,220
can help you better keep in tune with the qin music.

228
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,820
During the exam,

229
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,780
you must keep perceiving the
examiner's emotion and behavior

230
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,380
so as to pre-judge more accurately.

231
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,660
Do you really teach Fengjiu as an apprentice?

232
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,420
Have you asked Fengjiu

233
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,260
why she wants the pimpon fruit so much?

234
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,140
Demon Lord Yan from the demons

235
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
is very intimate to Fengjiu.

236
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,780
It makes sense anyway.

237
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,660
They lived together after they fell into the Fanyin Valley.

238
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,300
Perhaps...

239
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,900
That person has joined the contest on behalf of Ji Heng.

240
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,620
He has nothing to do with Xiaobai.

241
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,980
You lose again!

242
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,300
I really admire your composure

243
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,180
which justifies you as the common ruler
of the sky and earth in Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

244
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,180
I feel flattered!

245
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,740
Your Majesty!

246
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,500
I thought I'm on much better terms

247
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,460
with His Majesty.

248
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Why does he look at me so apathetically?

249
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,060
Were those happened in the past all my dreams?

250
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,500
Why do you want

251
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,980
the pimpon fruit so much?

252
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,220
Because I haven't had it before.

253
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,060
I want to try it.

254
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,100
To make pimpon cake?

255
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,060
Maybe!

256
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,780
Pimpon fruit is originally used

257
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,140
to bring the dying back to life.

258
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,620
But I haven't studied

259
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,500
if making pimpon fruit into cake

260
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,500
will impact its efficacy.

261
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,260
How to answer His Majesty's question?

262
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,540
Yan Chiwu wants to have pimpon cake lately?

263
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,700
Yan?

264
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,140
Perhaps!

265
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,300
Yan just doesn't like

266
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,180
red beans, green beans or ginger powder.

267
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,580
Everything else should be fine!

268
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,300
He joins the contest for Ji Heng!

269
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,580
What do you think of it?

270
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,260
What does that have to do with me?

271
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,340
Do you mean last time

272
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,500
he helped me stealing pimpon fruit?

273
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,020
It's fine!

274
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,620
We have the deal

275
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,540
to split the pimpon fruit half by half

276
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,860
once we get it.

277
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,740
You'd do it as well

278
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,380
that way?

279
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,260
Of course!

280
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,740
Because whoever wins, I can get the pimpon fruit.

281
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,860
Dividing half by half

282
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,620
is the best way.

283
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,780
What does His Majesty mean?

284
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,940
Why does he keep asking about Yan?

285
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,580
Does he...

286
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,620
I almost forget that

287
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,380
His Majesty and Yan moved to Jifeng Courtyard

288
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,180
to stimulate Ji Heng.

289
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,620
It's far from

290
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,140
what His Majesty wants,

291
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
so he became worried

292
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,420
and concerned about Yan.

293
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
It's so ridiculous that I thought

294
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,620
it's because of me.

295
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,860
Now that I know the cause,

296
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,620
I might as well be the good guy

297
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,660
to do His Majesty a favor.

298
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,420
His Majesty is so proud

299
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,700
that I can't unravel his concern.

300
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:16,980
Your Majesty,

301
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,860
the final is approaching anyway.

302
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,420
How about removing

303
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
the ward?

304
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,460
It will be convenient for friends to come by.

305
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,620
We'll be more at ease.

306
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,420
So will the visitors.

307
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,380
It's the best for both worlds.

308
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,100
What are you doing?

309
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,020
Why do you put up two more extra layers?

310
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,740
Is it because I unraveled his concern

311
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,100
which infuriated him?

312
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,700
Jiuge!

313
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,620
You look so great after a few days.

314
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,620
Certainly!

315
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,140
I've thought it over.

316
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
I must cheer up

317
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,900
and keep forging ahead,

318
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,260
otherwise I won't deserve Princess Fengjiu.

319
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,260
That's right!

320
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,540
I'm not late, am I?

321
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,540
No, right on time!

322
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,620
Xiaojiu, first things first.

323
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,020
Contest goes ahead of friendship today.

324
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,340
Whoever wins the pimpon fruit,

325
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,140
don't be difficult and sulky to the other, alright?

326
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,780
That sounds like you're winning it for sure.

327
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,860
Let's check it out.

328
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,060
Tournament for the inseparable king birds

329
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,180
starts now!

330
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,300
This tournament has two rounds.

331
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,940
Only those who pass the first round
are allowed to the second round.

332
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,940
First round is in the morning.

333
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,380
Second round is in the afternoon

334
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,180
and will be held at Green Plum Cove outside the castle.

335
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,020
In first round, musicians will play qin.

336
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,380
Contestants need to play flute in response.
Music must be in tune.

337
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,180
Those whose music has no distinct mistake

338
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,660
will pass.

339
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,540
The tournament starts now!

340
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,700
Musician, please!

341
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,820
First contestant,

342
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,180
be ready!

343
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,020
Princess Jielu passed!

344
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,860
She is awesome!

345
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,860
She deserves it.

346
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,260
She has the competitiveness.

347
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,780
Jiuge, be ready!

348
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,460
This... this is...

349
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,780
They are both...

350
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:48,940
Yeah!

351
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,580
Right!

352
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,060
It's pretty difficult!

353
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,580
Your Majesty,

354
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,420
as far as I see,

355
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,820
the difficulty of this music increases suddenly.

356
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,700
This student is hard to pass.

357
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Knowing the player's heartfelt wishes

358
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,500
can help you better keep in tune with the qin music.

359
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,780
During the exam,

360
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,980
you must keep perceiving
the examiner's emotion and behavior

361
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,260
so as to pre-judge more accurately.

362
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,940
The qin music and flute music are harmonious
but aggressive to one another.

363
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,860
It's really awesome!

364
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,780
No mistake for that sudden change.

365
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,500
It's really a surprise that

366
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,980
this student is so good.

367
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,540
Good!

368
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,980
Good!

369
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,260
Awesome!

370
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,660
That's awesome!

371
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,100
That's just great!

372
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,420
Jiuge passed!

373
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,260
Next contestant, be ready!

374
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,260
My turn so soon!

375
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,820
I think Yan

376
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,420
will be eliminated in the first round!

377
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,220
That's so careless!

378
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,300
Never mind!

379
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,300
What a contrast it is

380
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,100
that Yan is playing flute so attentively

381
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,780
while he is always care-free in usual.

382
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,100
He does look like

383
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,580
a gentleman now.

384
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,540
The musician trained him well.

385
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,100
He was trained by musician?

386
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,980
Yeah!

387
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,380
The musician has been training him for music.

388
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,100
But this piece of music is much simpler

389
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,060
compared with yours.

390
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,660
Alright!

391
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,540
Yan passed!

392
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,460
The sword contest on snowy
stakes starts in the afternoon.

393
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,580
Contestants can choose your opponent randomly.

394
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,740
Winner will be determined in the end.

395
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,460
The award is pimpon fruit.

396
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,060
Isn't this the Green Plum Cove?

397
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,900
Why is it all barren?

398
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,140
This place used to be planted with green plums

399
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,020
when Fanyin Valley had distinct four seasons,

400
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,500
so it's called Green Plum Cove.

401
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,020
But most of the green plums have been destroyed

402
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,740
by the snow and frost in recent century.

403
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,460
Then Her Majesty ordered to clean up this place

404
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,820
and use it as a competition terrain.

405
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,980
Understood now!

406
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,340
What time is it?

407
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,700
Your Majesty, it's a quarter to 1 pm.

408
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,220
Why is Ji Heng so strange lately?

409
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,460
She wasn't like this in the past.

410
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,100
The contest is about to start
but His Majesty hasn't come yet.

411
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,140
He is still coming, isn't he?

412
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,180
Your Majesty, Emperor Dong Hua has come!

413
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,020
And His Highness Lian Song has also arrived.

414
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,860
Welcome Your Highness!

415
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,700
It's such a surprise

416
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,140
that you're so interested

417
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,380
in the tournament of the inseparable king birds.

418
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,420
I'm here to yell for you in specific.

419
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,180
Don't you find it

420
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,740
a pleasant surprise?

421
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,220
Aren't you here for fun?

422
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,780
Welcome Emperor Dong Hua

423
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,260
and Third Prince's esteemed presence.

424
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,940
I'm a bit late.

425
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,300
When will the contest start?

426
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,860
The students are all ready.

427
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,540
It can start immediately.

428
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,420
Then let it start!

429
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,300
All contestants be ready!

430
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
Folks, please calm down!

431
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,100
For today's sword contest on snowy stakes,

432
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,100
all contestants can randomly

433
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,300
choose your opponent.

434
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,140
The last person left on the snowy stake is the winner.

435
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,100
The contest starts now.

436
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,860
I came because you said today's contest is fantastic,

437
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,740
but it's pretty boring so far as I see it.

438
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,620
How about

439
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,380
we play a round,

440
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,660
what do you say?

441
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,940
Sure!

442
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,500
But the contest has just started.

443
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,060
Stay patient!

444
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,420
Please!

445
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,900
Excuse me!

446
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,580
The swordsmanship of the inseparable king birds

447
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,660
is not as good as that of Fengjiu
which has dozens of thousands of years of practice.

448
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,980
As long as she stays careful

449
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,980
and doesn't fall from the snowy stake,

450
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,860
pimpon fruit will be hers to take.

451
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,980
Haven't you figured out why she needs the fruit?

452
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,260
Excuse me!

453
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,980
Excuse me!

454
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,220
Your Highness,

455
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,740
I'll give way to three moves.

456
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,620
Please!

457
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,020
I don't need that.

458
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,900
Jiuge,

459
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,060
your swordsmanship is much better than I expect.

460
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,900
This contest is related to the reputation
of the inseparable king birds.

461
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,100
Jiuge,

462
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,620
I'm not going to have mercy.

463
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,380
Please!

464
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,060
Do you want to move on?

465
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,620
I'm going to use the trump card now.

466
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,580
Alright!

467
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,780
I'd love to see that.

468
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,300
Excuse me!

469
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,020
Haven't you figured out why she needs the fruit?

470
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,300
Meng, excuse me!

471
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,980
My mind was drifting

472
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,460
which gives you the chance.

473
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,100
I candidly admit the defeat.

474
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,260
Excuse me, Your Highness!

475
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,460
The final match

476
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,500
will be

477
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,260
between Yan and Princess Jiuge.

478
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,380
It does become more interesting

479
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,980
to the end.

480
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,340
Xiaojiu,

481
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,780
just like I said,

482
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,260
if I win, you'll have half of the fruit.

483
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,780
It's not determined yet.

484
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,300
Jiuge!

485
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,540
Yan, are you crazy?

486
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,460
He is indeed the demons.

487
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,980
Only the demons will make such vicious moves.

488
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,980
It might be difficult for Fengjiu to beat him this time.

489
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,860
Musician!

490
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,100
Dong Hua!

491
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,220
You ruined my plan again.

492
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,180
Are you OK?

493
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,220
It shouldn't be to this extent

494
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,500
of making her pass out suddenly.

495
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,060
The winner of this tournament

496
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,980
is...

497
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,420
Jiuge!

498
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,420
The award is pimpon fruit!

499
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,460
Prior to the picking of pimpon fruit,

500
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,660
His Majesty's blood must be dropped
into the belly of the python.

501
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,740
After the python sleeps for one day and one night,

502
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,420
the fruit can be picked.

503
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,100
So the award will be presented after two days.

504
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,340
Folks, congratulations to Jiuge!

505
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,580
Congratulations!

506
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:46,940
Jiuge,

507
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,020
congratulations to you!

508
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,500
You were awesome just now.

509
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,780
Congratulations! You're great!

510
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,940
What a comeback that was!
Congratulations to you, Jiuge!

511
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,900
Good! Good! Good!
