00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 48

3
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,500
Your Excellency.

4
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,300
Here is a letter from Her Highness Aranya.

5
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,940
= Your Excellency,
Princess Aranya is accused of killing the Emperor, =

6
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,740
= but the truth is that she is framed up.
She has been put in prison now, =

7
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,580
= and will be beheaded before long.
I hope Your Excellency can save her. By Chacha =

8
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,620
Qing Hua.

9
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,980
Your Excellency.

10
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,380
Now everything in the palace is under the control of Her Majesty.

11
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,860
They also placed many of their people in the Qi Nan Palace.

12
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,060
You must be careful. Your Excellency!

13
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,340
It seems that I underestimated her.

14
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,300
Your Excellency. Her Majesty has come.

15
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,380
Your plan

16
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,900
is really brilliant.

17
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,980
The situation in the palace

18
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,820
is basically stabilized now.

19
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,740
You made the greatest contribution.

20
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm afraid you're not here to thank me.

21
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,900
I promised you that,

22
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,300
after we made it,

23
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,940
I would give you a respectable welcome back to the Qi Nan Palace.

24
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,540
I have kept my words.

25
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,340
You also promised me another thing.

26
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,540
Don't you remember it?

27
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,460
Of course I do.

28
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,540
Today I'm here

29
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,020
for that thing.

30
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,140
Perhaps you've known that

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,460
Aranya has been proved to commit the crime of regicide.

32
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
She is in prison at present

33
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,340
and will be beheaded another day.

34
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Didn't you promise me that

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,020
you would hand Aranya over to me?

36
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,620
I know

37
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,660
you resent Aranya very much.

38
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,340
Keeping you in her mansion,

39
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,180
she did make a big mistake.

40
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,580
After all, she is my own flesh and blood.

41
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,340
I can't bear to

42
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,780
make her have long sufferings.

43
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,820
Even if she made the biggest mistake,

44
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,220
can't I get rid of your resentment

45
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,700
by punishing her with death penalty?

46
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,020
If you do me this favor,

47
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,540
just tell me whatever you need me

48
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,820
in the future.

49
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,980
It occurs to me something.

50
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,060
Please help me.

51
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,700
What is it?

52
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,100
There is a female teacher in the Imperial College called Wen Tian

53
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,860
who was kind to me when I was in difficulty.

54
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,700
If you really feel sorry for me,

55
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,460
just regard her as your foster daughter

56
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,620
and betroth her to me as my wife.

57
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,780
Unexpectedly,

58
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,460
you have such a romance.

59
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,780
It's easy.

60
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,740
Choose a lucky day

61
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,900
and I will send people to escort Wen Tian to your palace.

62
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,820
That's done!

63
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

64
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,980
I know you marry me to repay my kindness.

65
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,420
But do you know

66
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,300
it was Her Highness Aranya

67
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,700
who treated you the best.

68
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,140
I saw her kindness to you

69
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,140
with my own eyes.

70
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,740
Now she is wronged,

71
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,540
but you just turn a blind eye to her.

72
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,580
It's true that I ever had a fancy for you.

73
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,180
But now I don't think

74
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
you deserve my love.

75
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,060
The master in the Imperial College

76
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,660
gave me several radix angelicae today.

77
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,620
It's said that the roots can be used as medicine,

78
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,420
for dispelling dampness and activating
the blood if you boil them with water.

79
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,740
It's better to

80
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,220
boil them in spring water.

81
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,460
Most of the time, you just sit, so I think it's useful...

82
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,980
Since you said I didn't deserve your love,

83
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
then what do you mean by doing this?

84
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,580
With me around you,

85
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,620
Her Majesty will be relieved

86
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,100
and relax her vigilance on you.

87
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
What else did Her Majesty tell you?

88
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,660
Just some polite words.

89
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,340
Generally speaking,

90
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,380
she wanted to use me

91
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
to guard you.

92
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,820
To me,

93
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,300
you don't hold back anything.

94
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,820
With a clear conscience,

95
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,460
I have nothing to hold back.

96
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,260
Her Majesty has just been worrying that you may go to save Aranya.

97
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
But I think

98
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,580
she has overestimated you.

99
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,060
Actually I hope you can go to save Aranya.

100
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:37,740
Do you know that

101
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,620
it's best to soak the radix angelicae
in the water of Heaven Spring.

102
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,180
I will take you to the Qi Nan Mountain

103
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,780
to fetch some spring water.

104
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,700
What do you mean?

105
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,980
Do you really give up Aranya?

106
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,740
You can leave now.

107
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,260
I have my own plan.

108
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,740
Wait.

109
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,780
The water in the Heaven Spring over there is better.

110
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,300
Take my advice.

111
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,020
If you believe me,

112
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,460
just put on a play with me.

113
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,220
You pretend to fall into the river carelessly,

114
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,860
and I will jump into the river to save you.

115
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,020
We can swim following the flow to the lower reaches

116
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,340
to avoid the guards for some time.

117
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,700
What are you going to do?

118
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,300
I want to save her.

119
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,220
This is the place where Xi Ze secludes himself.

120
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,060
You have the plan to send a letter to Xi Ze.

121
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,620
Why don't you tell me earlier?

122
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,980
I can't easily trust others now.

123
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,420
But what you said

124
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,860
is admirable!

125
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,940
This is about Aranya's life.

126
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,420
I was afraid

127
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,260
it was Qing Hua who asked you to sound out my intention,

128
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,500
so I must be very cautious.

129
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,500
The handwriting on the letter

130
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,060
is not yours?

131
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
When Xi Ze was in seclusion,

132
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,740
there were two archmages around to protect him.

133
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,300
Although I believe Xi Ze,

134
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,740
I can't trust them.

135
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,380
So I can only imitate someone else's handwriting.

136
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,100
You are so careful in thinking.

137
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,620
If it won't work,

138
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,700
what should we do?

139
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,740
Then there is only one way left.

140
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,740
That is to hand out the power
of executing Aranya to the Qi Nan Palace.

141
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,220
At that time I will help her escape.

142
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,380
Then you'll be risking your life.

143
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,140
So what?

144
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,420
Although I don't want to see such a result,

145
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,780
yet if so,

146
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,740
I can only support you.

147
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,740
It turns out that

148
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,340
I misunderstood Shen Ye all the time.

149
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,740
He still tried to save Aranya in the end.

150
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,060
Just his way

151
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,940
was different from what you thought.

152
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,580
Well, at last, didn't Xi Ze receive the letter?

153
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,940
Or had Aranya been killed

154
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,540
before Xi Ze came to save her?

155
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,700
Do you want to know what happened later?

156
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,780
Then let's watch them together.

157
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,020
You suffered!

158
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,260
It's you.

159
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,100
My son.

160
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,780
You must return in triumph.

161
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,820
Yes, mother.

162
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,420
Report.

163
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,580
Your Majesty.

164
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,460
Aranya.

165
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,180
Someone broke into the prison and rescued Aranya.

166
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,700
What did you say?

167
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,740
Aranya was rescued.

168
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
You rubbish!

169
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,660
With so many people there, you even lost her?

170
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,140
Gather the imperial guards to search for her.

171
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,380
Search every corner of the city.

172
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,100
Yes.

173
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,980
Your Excellency.

174
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,460
Aranya was missing.

175
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,700
Don't you feel it's strange?

176
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,580
What else can I do?

177
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,660
Should I blame you for your decision

178
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,820
which caused the result?

179
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,660
You!

180
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,140
Listen! Shen Ye!

181
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,260
As for Aranya's escape, I'm sure to look into it.

182
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,220
= Distinguished Master,
Qing Hua killed the Emperor and framed Aranya up. =

183
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,140
= Now Aranya is thrown into jail
and in deadly danger. =

184
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,900
= I hope you could rescue her.
By your unfilial disciple Shen Ye =

185
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,340
You have read the letter for tens of times.

186
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,380
Have you found anything strange?

187
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,660
According to the handwriting,

188
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,340
I can't recognize anything.

189
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,660
According to the content,

190
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,700
it must be someone who knows the fact.

191
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,540
I think

192
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,820
it should be Shen Ye.

193
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
It's not Shen Ye's handwriting.

194
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,140
He resents me so much.

195
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,260
How could he save me?

196
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,860
I want to go down the mountain.

197
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,380
I tried hard

198
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
to save you just now,

199
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,540
while you hasten to walk into the trap by yourself.

200
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,100
Is there anybody that you care there?

201
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,860
You used to say that

202
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,460
life is an experience.

203
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,980
I think it's reasonable.

204
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,020
The more you experience, the longer you live.

205
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,140
The less you experience, the shorter you live.

206
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,980
My life

207
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,580
seems very short.

208
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
Actually it's very long.

209
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,060
I have realized it recently.

210
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Just now you asked me

211
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,740
who I still care.

212
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,380
That's my brother Xiangli He.

213
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,620
He always treats me well.

214
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,580
Maybe it was he who sent this letter to you.

215
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,060
Xiangli He has got the reins

216
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,900
to the front line

217
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,100
to fight with the night owls clan.

218
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,340
My brother is kind.

219
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,340
Probably this fight with the night owls clan

220
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,300
is not accidental.

221
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,100
It must be Her Majesty's plan

222
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,660
to make use of someone else to get rid of my brother.

223
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,260
But my brother

224
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,940
is never a good general
who is skilled at fighting against the enemies.

225
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,500
Once he is in the battle,

226
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,300
he can't be back alive.

227
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,740
Even though Xiangli He is kind to you,

228
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,060
this is his fate.

229
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,820
Can you change his fate in defiance of nature?

230
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
You know my character.

231
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,220
So you can expect that I won't take a blind eye to him.

232
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll go to the battlefield

233
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,820
to take the place of my brother.

234
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,380
Don't worry.

235
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,860
Cherishing my life very much,

236
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,540
of course I will judge and weigh the importance.

237
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,380
In my life,

238
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,140
there aren't many people who are kind to me.

239
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,100
Neither you nor Master Mo

240
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,980
will be so unlucky like my brother.

241
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,620
So there is need for me to take risks to save you two.

242
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,100
Yeah.

243
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,660
I know your temper.

244
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,700
It's no use persuading you.

245
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,900
Then I want to ask you

246
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
what if you can't go back this time.

247
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,260
If I can't be back alive,

248
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,540
I will die on the battlefield in the name of my brother.

249
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,980
Compared with being forced to commit suicide by Her Majesty,

250
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,780
it's more meaningful.

251
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,260
At that time,

252
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,060
please help my brother change his whole name

253
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,340
and send him to a safe place

254
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,420
to live a common life.

255
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,100
One more thing.

256
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,460
I ever wrote 20 letters to Shen Ye.

257
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,460
Please help me take them back.

258
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,500
The sincerity in the letters

259
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,540
now

260
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,740
seems ridiculous!

261
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,060
OK.

262
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,460
I have kept your entrustments in my mind.

263
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,980
I hope I won't need to do these things.

264
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,260
When will you go down the mountain?

265
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,660
With gentle wind in the sunshine,

266
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,980
I'd like to have a rest with a fresh mind.

267
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,620
Brother.

268
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,380
Aranya.

269
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,500
Archmage.

270
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,300
Why are you here?

271
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:31,980
Brother.

272
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,020
I'm here to tell you something important.

273
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm listening.

274
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,740
Father's death has nothing to do with me.

275
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,620
It was mother who planned to frame me.

276
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,620
As for the fight between the night owls clan and our clan,

277
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,060
it's also her trick to get rid of you.

278
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,180
What did you say?

279
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,500
This fight

280
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
is mother's trick, right?

281
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,620
Yes.

282
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,140
In order to make Junuo ascend to throne,

283
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,620
she will get rid of you, me and Changdi.

284
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,900
Brother.

285
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,340
You must believe me.

286
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,300
I'm here

287
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,700
to save you.

288
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,620
No.

289
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,500
I don't believe it.

290
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,860
Sister.

291
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,900
Even if it's true,

292
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,660
I can't leave here.

293
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,540
Whatever

294
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,780
the cause of the battle is,

295
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,260
I will lead the troops to fight in the battle tomorrow.

296
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
I must protect the safety of the inseparable king bird clan.

297
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,940
Brother.

298
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,860
You must follow my words.

299
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,060
Don't be stubborn any more.

300
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,620
Guards.

301
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,580
Guards.

302
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,180
Today

303
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,700
I entrust my brother to you.

304
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,860
I'm sure to carry out your wishes.

305
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,380
Take care!

306
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,180
Remember!

307
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
You must be careful!

308
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,660
Aranya went to the battlefield instead of Xiangli He.

309
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,420
At that time,

310
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,180
what were you doing?

311
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,660
I knew nothing then.

312
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,420
Qing Hua was guarding me.

313
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,820
I thought

314
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Aranya lived a good life with Xi Ze.

315
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,820
I planted Solanum pseudocapsicum trees everywhere
in the garden of the Qi Nan Palace,

316
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,300
waiting her to come back.

317
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,980
But you didn't know

318
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,060
Aranya would die soon.

319
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,860
Your Majesty,

320
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,460
the situation in the battle is very bad.

321
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,100
Urgent military orders came one after another,

322
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,100
asking Your Majesty to send troops to support them.

323
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,100
Your Majesty.

324
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,300
I see.

325
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,420
Just leave.

326
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,300
Withdraw.

327
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:22,780
Withdraw.

328
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,580
Withdraw.

329
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,500
Withdraw.

330
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,020
Aranya.

331
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,900
You must look good wearing this flower.

332
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,500
Aranya.

333
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,660
Aranya.

334
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,580
Aranya.

335
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,980
Aranya.

336
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,100
Can you stand it?

337
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,340
Whether I can stand it

338
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,420
or not,

339
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,660
what difference will it make?

340
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,500
You can only stand it.

341
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,180
I have imagined

342
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,380
the scenes before Aranya's death for numerous times.

343
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,620
But I have never imagined anything

344
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,460
related to the truth.

345
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,660
Will you go on watching?

346
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,340
So many years has passed. Watching it,

347
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,740
I can still feel very miserable.

348
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,980
I can't imagine

349
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,020
how anguished Shen Ye was

350
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,660
when he heard Aranya's death.

351
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,100
I can't bear to go on watching.

352
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
But I still want to watch.

353
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,700
Why do you come?

354
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,020
Shen Ye.

355
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,260
Aranya ever wrote 20 letters to you.

356
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,420
I'm here to get them back for her.

357
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,060
Why did she suddenly want to get them back?

358
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,540
How could you ask me?

359
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,500
Aren't you clear in your mind?

360
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,780
As for love,

361
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,380
it's never aroused in my heart.

362
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,220
So I don't know what you are thinking

363
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,900
in your mind.

364
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,260
Since you give consideration to Aranya,

365
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,220
why do you force her into such a situation?

366
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,900
Both your choice

367
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,980
and her choice

368
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,940
are destined.

369
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,500
Well,

370
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,500
I'm here today

371
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,900
because I keep Aranya's wish made before she left in mind.

372
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
Give me the letters.

373
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,180
Before she left?

374
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,380
You saved her

375
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,140
but let her go?

376
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,900
How do you know that it was I who saved her?

377
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,220
You saved her

378
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,140
after receiving my letter to you, right?

379
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,380
It turns out that

380
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,820
it was you who wrote the letter.

381
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,340
I was afraid your archmages might recognize my handwriting.

382
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,540
So I imitated someone else's handwriting.

383
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,500
Unexpectedly, you didn't recognize it.

384
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,660
Neither did Aranya know it.

385
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,340
Where did she go?

386
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,620
Haven't you been told that

387
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,820
Aranya went to the battlefield?

388
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,100
Battlefield?

389
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Since you can come here,

390
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,420
I'm sure you can help me leave here.

391
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,900
Wherever she is,

392
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,780
let's go to take her back immediately.

393
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,740
By now,

394
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,100
Aranya and I only have each other.

395
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
If anything goes wrong in our fate,

396
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,060
I hope it can't be here.

397
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,740
If it goes wrong...

398
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,620
Shen Ye.

399
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,740
Aranya has died.

400
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,420
Dead?

401
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,740
Aranya is dead?

402
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,140
Impossible.

403
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,060
How could it be possible?

404
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,660
Unexpectedly, you know nothing.

405
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,260
As for the document that you presented,

406
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,740
Qing Hua had shown it to her.

407
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,820
She said

408
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,580
she couldn't have a marriage with you

409
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,100
until she tried hard to get you.

410
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,900
Even though she was broad-minded,

411
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,660
there was still something that she couldn't stand.

412
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,300
Before she went to the Sixing River,

413
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,620
she said she would return.

414
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,860
I didn't expect that

415
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,500
she intended to die by going there.

416
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,980
It can't be true!

417
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,220
Impossible!

418
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,740
How could Aranya die?

419
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,500
She couldn't be dead.

420
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,820
I don't believe anything

421
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,500
that you said.

422
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,100
She has been dead.

423
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,380
Aranya has been dead.

424
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,460
Shen Ye.

425
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,820
Believe it

426
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,020
or not,

427
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Aranya

428
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,060
has been dead.

429
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,100
It was after she died that

430
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,060
Qing Hua and Junuo knew it.

431
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,540
For the sake of the imperial power,

432
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,540
they hid it from me for a long time.

433
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,860
But I don't understand

434
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,100
why they hid it from you.

435
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,140
Tell me

436
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,460
where she is now.

437
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,980
On the battlefield,
Aranya placed all her efforts in a single thing,

438
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,540
setting the Phoenix-warbling Formation.

439
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,100
As a dangerous ancient formation,
it devoured her primordial spirit.

440
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,980
She has changed into dust,

441
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,580
vanishing in the Sixing River.

442
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,780
Arrows!

443
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,580
Yes.

444
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,500
Stop!

445
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,940
Mother.

446
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:45,900
No.

447
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,540
Shoot!

448
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,060
No.

449
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,540
Stop.

450
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,860
Stop.

451
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,580
Mother.

452
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,700
Shen Ye.

453
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,140
No.

454
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,300
Shen Ye.

455
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,780
Mother.

456
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,380
Junuo.

457
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,580
Shen Ye.

458
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,820
Aranya has died.

459
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,460
Why do you still bother to do this?

460
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,780
Shen Ye.

461
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,900
She has died.

462
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,260
She has died.

463
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,180
Wait for me.

464
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,780
I love you.

465
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,100
Even though you played tricks on me,

466
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,460
you shouldn't treat me so resolutely and desperately.

467
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,780
No matter what fate I will have

468
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,940
and who I will become,

469
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,340
I can't meet you anymore.

470
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,940
Aranya.

471
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,100
If I had known it,

472
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,780
why should I bear it patiently;

473
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
why should I fear

474
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,380
the mortal realm

475
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,460
and what do I live for?

476
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,900
With mountains, water,

477
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,340
flowers, birds, insects and fish here,

478
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,980
it's good for Aranya

479
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,380
to rest here.

480
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,340
Since Aranya can't be back,

481
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,060
it's my final ending

482
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,900
to be buried here with her.

483
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
It's also yours.

484
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,140
Shen Ye is just the archmage of the inseparable king bird clan.

485
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,820
How could he be so powerful to destroy everything?

486
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,740
Let's finish watching first.

487
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,100
Lord Xi Ze.

488
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,300
Why did you save them?

489
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,300
They killed Aranya!

490
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,780
Shen Ye.

491
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,260
Anyhow, I am the archmage of the inseparable king bird clan.

492
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,380
As for such a crisis of the extermination of the whole clan,

493
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,500
how could I stand by?

494
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,820
Besides,

495
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,780
it's possible for Aranya to come back to life again.

496
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,860
Have you heard that

497
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,820
there is a magic instrument in the Sky Kingdom

498
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,420
named Spirit-Forming Lantern?

499
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
It can only make people from the human realm come back to life.

500
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,260
It's useless to us earth immortals.

501
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,300
Everything has its rules.

502
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,100
As long as we follow the rules of the Spirit-Forming Lantern

503
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,660
to build a place to nourish her soul,

504
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,300
then it's possible for Aranya to come back to life.

505
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,180
Do you want to be buried here with her

506
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,940
with regret

507
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,900
or hope to see her again?

508
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,180
What should I do?

509
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,460
Would you like to

510
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,300
devote all your cultivation

511
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,860
to creating a new world for Aranya?

512
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,140
At first, Aranya will just have a body.

513
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,620
However, as long as you collect her lost primordial spirit,

514
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,860
she will come back to life.

515
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Are you serious?

516
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,180
Of course.

517
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,900
Whether you can make it or not,

518
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,100
it depends on your patience.

519
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,500
I have lost Aranya.

520
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,940
There's nothing that I can't sacrifice.

521
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,100
I'm going to create a world for her as soon as possible.

522
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,300
Shen Ye.

523
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,500
You don't need to hurry

524
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,500
to create a new world.

525
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,620
You must take it easy.

526
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,580
If you are in such a hurry,

527
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,380
your cultivation

528
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,980
will be exhausted very soon.

529
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,460
I have lost Aranya.

530
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,340
As long as she can come back to life,

531
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,700
it's nothing for me to exhaust all my cultivation.

532
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,740
This...

533
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
What's wrong?

534
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,620
Hmm.

535
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,300
Aranya has left.

536
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,860
So I took away three seasons for her.

537
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,020
From now on,

538
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,700
in the Fanyin Valley, there is only severe winter,

539
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,460
coldness

540
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,460
and fear.

541
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,260
I will make you remember that

542
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,820
her name

543
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,780
is Xiangli Aranya.

544
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,700
I thought

545
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,940
I played a miserable role

546
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,060
in Aranya's love life.

547
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,900
Unexpectedly,

548
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,900
when it comes to the bitter love,

549
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,580
Shen Ye is more miserable than me.

550
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,580
Knowing such a result,

551
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,940
I'm afraid it's not what you wish for.

552
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,980
I have looked into it for many years,

553
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,740
hoping to know the result.

554
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Anyhow,

555
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,980
it's just a result.

556
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,340
You asked me

557
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,380
why Shen Ye was so powerful to destroy the world.

558
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,500
I'm afraid

559
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,380
we have to go back to know his origin.

560
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,820
This is...

561
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,260
The period before he was born.

562
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,780
Going back to three hundred years ago,
