00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 37

3
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,780
Lord Xi Ze,

4
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,780
how is Junuo doing?

5
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,820
Her wounds have almost healed.

6
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,500
She'll be fully recovered in a few days.

7
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,980
That'd be great.

8
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,900
Your Highness, how are you feeling these days?

9
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,620
I've been staying in my palace,

10
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,420
so I'm a little bored.

11
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,820
Mother, it'll be

12
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,860
your birthday in a few days.

13
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,580
I should try my best

14
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,060
and prepare you a special gift,

15
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,860
but unexpectedly...

16
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,620
You silly girl.

17
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,180
Forget about the gift.

18
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,740
Let's go enjoy blooms in Guan Chen Palace.

19
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,740
It'll do good to your health.

20
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,420
Got it, mother.

21
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,380
Now that there is nothing else, I'm leaving.

22
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,940
Lord Xi Ze.

23
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,420
What's up?

24
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,860
Lord Xi Ze,

25
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,780
I hope you can

26
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,140
come to my mother's birthday banquet.

27
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,380
Shall I also go to the banquet?

28
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,500
Sure.

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,660
We've sent an invitation to your palace.

30
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,660
Besides, Junuo is still recovering.

31
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,860
You're worried about her, right?

32
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,300
I'll try my best to cure her.

33
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,500
Aranya will go there too.

34
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,580
Actually,

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,660
I'm envious that

36
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,220
she married you.

37
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,140
She is of humble origin

38
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,300
and you're noble.

39
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,540
She doesn't deserve you.

40
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,500
Your Highness,

41
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,380
it's improper for us to have a private talk here.

42
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,500
Please go back.

43
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,740
Chacha.

44
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,780
Your Highness.

45
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,820
Pack this up.

46
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,740
And this.

47
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,820
Oh. Go to the fair later

48
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,020
and get me some foundation makeup.

49
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,180
I prefer a light shade to a dark one.

50
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,300
Oh.

51
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,580
Also get me some cakes.

52
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,820
And...

53
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,820
Get me

54
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,100
some plain clothes.

55
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,980
These are all red.

56
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,300
It's too eye-catching.

57
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,340
But Your Highness,

58
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,060
red is your favorite color.

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,140
It used to,

60
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
but things have changed.

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,220
I liked red,

62
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,940
but I like other colors.

63
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,380
But Your Highness,

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,900
we'll have so much luggage.

65
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,380
Prince Qing will also occupy a lot of space.

66
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,100
I wonder if there is enough room for us

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,780
on the ship.

68
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,740
What did you say?

69
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,780
Qing will also go there?

70
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,580
Your Highness, don't you know that?

71
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,460
Someone was sent here in the afternoon

72
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,780
and told us His Majesty has showed mercy

73
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,180
and allowed you to take Prince Qing with you

74
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,220
now that the two of you have cared about each other so much

75
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,500
since your childhood,

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,260
which is quite moving.

77
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,420
A painted pleasure boat has been prepared for Prince Qing

78
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,180
so that you can eat and sleep with him.

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,380
Your Highness, what's up?

80
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,220
Are you too happy to speak?

81
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,700
Your Excellency, please follow me.

82
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,020
Let's drink more.

83
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,740
Okay.

84
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,220
Take a seat please.

85
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,740
What are you doing?

86
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,020
His Majesty just allowed

87
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,620
Prince Qing to come to the banquet.

88
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,780
I didn't have time to tell Her Highness about it.

89
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,500
And I can't find her at the moment,

90
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,660
so I have to take him here.

91
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,140
Aranya sits here?

92
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,220
Yes.

93
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,100
I see.

94
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,180
You can leave.

95
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,860
Got it, Your Excellency.

96
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,420
Xiaobai.

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,140
Xiaobai.

98
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,740
Look.

99
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,580
Those two girls are your sisters.

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,980
The first one is Junuo.

101
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,220
The girl in purple beside her is Changdi.

102
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,540
It's the first time I've seen them.

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,300
They're fair-skinned and good-looking.

104
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,260
Right ahead

105
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,460
are your father and mother.

106
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,420
Madame Qing Hua is pretty.

107
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,580
She's your natural mother,

108
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
but she abandoned you as soon as you were born.

109
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,820
In your mind,

110
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,340
she's the ugliest and scariest person.

111
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,340
Okay.

112
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,700
She's cruel to Aranya. I see.

113
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,460
Don't be angry.

114
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,060
Let's go.

115
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,820
Wait.

116
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,100
Why is he there?

117
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,900
This way please.

118
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,180
I don't know.

119
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,860
No way.

120
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,900
I won't stay wherever he is.

121
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,140
I won't go there. You go on behalf of me.

122
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,780
No way.

123
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,540
You can't be absent

124
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,580
from Aranya's mother's birthday banquet.

125
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,820
But I'll give the game away

126
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,940
if he is there.

127
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,060
Then everyone will know

128
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
I'm a fake.

129
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,980
How about me staying at your room?

130
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,820
You go on behalf of me.

131
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,900
Go. Hurry.

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:48,820
Xiaobai.

133
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,220
Your Excellency.

134
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,180
What's up?

135
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,620
Nothing. Go ahead.

136
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,340
Lord Xi Ze,

137
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,060
the banquet is going to start.

138
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,100
Let's go in.

139
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,340
Okay.

140
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Lord Xi Ze.

141
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,660
Do you know where Aranya is?

142
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,620
It's Moye that's sitting there.

143
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,260
Aranya doesn't feel well.

144
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,860
She must be too tired after the long journey by ship.

145
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,340
She'll be back soon.

146
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,020
It's unbelievable that Aranya would be seasick.

147
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,340
Lord Xi Ze,

148
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,380
I know

149
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,380
you came here to treat Junuo,

150
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,180
but as a couple,

151
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,220
you and Aranya should have a talk

152
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,940
now that you haven't seen each other for a long time.

153
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,780
Lord Xi Ze?

154
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm Su Moye.

155
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,860
It turns out you're Mr. Su.

156
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,340
How is it going? Anything went wrong?

157
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,340
Did anyone ask about me?

158
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,300
Yeah.

159
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,740
Everyone is asking about you.

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,980
Your sisters, your mother

161
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,740
and your husband.

162
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh.

163
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,900
There is something I don't understand.

164
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,060
Go ahead.

165
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,900
Aranya's just reached an adult age.

166
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,860
Why does she have a husband?

167
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,140
Do you mean Lord Xi Ze?

168
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,940
He can't be taken lightly.

169
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,380
Really? Give me more details.

170
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,940
In Fanyin Valley, there is Qi Nan Palace,

171
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,740
which is governed by the Archmage.

172
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,420
Anomalies would happen

173
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,260
when an archmage chosen by heaven is born.

174
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,380
Archmages don't intervene in political affairs at ordinary times,

175
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,780
but once the emperor misconducts himself,

176
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,420
they'll go to heaven

177
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
and suggest deposing him

178
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,860
to guarantee a long period of stability in Fanyin Valley.

179
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,500
In other words,

180
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,660
the Archmage acts

181
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,540
as a supervisor of the emperor in the valley

182
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,940
and reports to heaven.

183
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,700
All archmages

184
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,460
are the ones an emperor wants to rope in

185
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,460
after he succeeds the throne.

186
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,260
The current archmage is Shen Ye.

187
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,780
His predecessor is Xi Ze.

188
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,620
That's why Xiangli Que

189
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,660
let Aranya marry Xi Ze when she was very young.

190
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,420
What happened later?

191
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,380
Actually, Xiangli Que tried to use Aranya

192
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,820
as a pawn to control Xi Ze.

193
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,460
Luckily, she was too young at that time.

194
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,620
And they didn't live together although they got married.

195
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,740
Two years later,

196
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,100
Xi Ze quit as the archmage

197
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,020
and began to live in solitude in the Qi Nan Mountain

198
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,300
because of severe illness.

199
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,660
Shen Ye became his successor.

200
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,340
After getting retired,

201
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,100
Xi Ze didn't seem to be interested in Aranya,

202
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,420
and they didn't live together,

203
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,460
so nobody mentioned the marriage anymore

204
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,060
as if it had never happened.

205
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,820
Aranya was his wife,

206
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,420
but he had never come out of the mountain

207
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,340
for her till her death.

208
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,020
That's why

209
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,020
I didn't mention it.

210
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,460
I didn't expect it'd confuse you today.

211
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,860
I should've been more thoughtful.

212
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,300
It's just...

213
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,980
Just what?

214
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,300
Nothing.

215
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,180
But I wonder

216
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,100
why we had a chance to see Xi Ze

217
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,180
come out of the mountain in the dream world.

218
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,820
I've never seen him before.

219
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,860
It's the first time I saw him.

220
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
I think he came out of the mountain

221
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,420
to treat Junuo.

222
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,780
Yes.

223
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,180
I've heard

224
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,660
Junuo was injured

225
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
when she had a horse race with Aranya.

226
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,580
Alright.

227
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,620
Forget about that.

228
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,140
Go to bed early.

229
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,580
No. No.

230
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,740
I can't go back to that boat.

231
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,900
Qing will swallow me alive.

232
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,380
I...

233
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,060
I...

234
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,100
The moon is bright and the view is great.

235
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,540
Let me stay here

236
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,300
and enjoy it longer.

237
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,220
Alright.

238
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:35,980
You...

239
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,060
Emperor Dong Hua will protect Fengjiu,

240
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,380
but unexpected changes may happen anytime

241
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,020
now that they're in the Dream of Aranya.

242
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,940
Once you get there, the first thing is to find them.

243
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,340
Is it possible that Xi Ze is actually Emperor Dong Hua?

244
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,060
If Dong Hua aims to use Xi Ze's identity,

245
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,700
he just needs to practice Correction Magic

246
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,540
to change

247
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,740
the inseparable king birds' memories of Xi Ze.

248
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,700
It's just a piece of cake for him.

249
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,620
Correction Magic is a simple trick,

250
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,180
so it does no harm to the dream world.

251
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,860
To finish the play,

252
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,620
he'd rather use Correction Magic

253
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,820
than disguise himself as Xi Ze.

254
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,100
It's Dong Hua's style.

255
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,580
Fengjiu must have been seriously injured,

256
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,260
so he had to get her primordial spirit
out of her body to recuperate.

257
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,500
As for the recuperation of primordial spirit,

258
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,580
all deities with excellent magic arts

259
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
know that it'd better

260
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,940
put it in a pregnant woman's womb.

261
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,260
Does Dong Hua think

262
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,860
Fengjiu's primordial spirit entered Junuo's womb?

263
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,340
In this case, it explains

264
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,380
why Dong Hua

265
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,140
cared about Junuo so much.

266
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,980
He didn't expect an accident happened to Fengjiu.

267
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,180
Her primordial spirit

268
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,220
entered Aranya's body.

269
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,220
It's much fun.

270
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,140
Now that Fengjiu is the only one

271
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,420
that could help me solve the mystery of Aranya's death,

272
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
I have to hide their true identities

273
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,300
from each other for the time being.

274
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Bilianchun Tea

275
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,740
tastes best when it's heated up

276
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,300
till the fragrance of lotuses appears.

277
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,860
Aranya,

278
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,300
have a taste.

279
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,420
Is it familiar to you?

280
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,260
Nuo, you didn't eat much at the banquet

281
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,660
and you threw up.

282
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
Lord Xi Ze baked sweet potatoes for you.

283
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,340
Would you like to eat some?

284
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,940
I thought Lord Xi Ze

285
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,580
knew nothing about cooking

286
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,020
just like other noblemen.

287
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,540
I didn't expect he's good at baking sweet potatoes.

288
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,460
Lord Xi Ze has been living in solitude in the Qi Nan Mountain.

289
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,540
He hates to be bothered

290
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,060
and has never hired any servant.

291
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,420
Of course he's skilled at such things.

292
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,460
I'm afraid you're the only one

293
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,180
who knows such details about Lord Xi Ze.

294
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,540
As far as I know,

295
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,700
Lord Xi Ze has been here for ten days,

296
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,020
but he's never gone to see Aranya.

297
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,900
It means what people said is true.

298
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,940
He doesn't care about Aranya at all.

299
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,900
It's improper to say that.

300
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,860
Don't talk nonsense.

301
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,180
You may get into trouble if someone hears it.

302
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,580
Nuo,

303
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,460
Aranya thought

304
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,460
she became somebody

305
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,140
now that father allowed her to come here with us.

306
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,060
But she even didn't dare to come to the banquet.

307
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,180
She's really a dirty thing raised by a snake.

308
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,860
I don't understand

309
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,660
why Lord Xi Ze doesn't divorce her

310
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,860
now that he doesn't care about her.

311
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
Isn't he afraid of her demeaning himself?

312
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,020
Why are you here?

313
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,300
You eavesdropped on us.

314
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,540
What's wrong?

315
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,620
It's a nice evening.

316
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,140
I got some air in the stern

317
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,260
and encountered you by accident. Okay?

318
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:45,860
You...

319
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,300
Aranya,

320
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,540
I haven't seen you for a long time.

321
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,500
Yeah. It's been a long time.

322
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,860
As my sisters,

323
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,740
you thought of some evil plan about my husband,

324
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,340
saying something disgusting

325
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,740
and doing something shameless.

326
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,060
Aren't you afraid of being heard?

327
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,460
Aranya,

328
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,300
don't forget

329
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,260
you didn't deserve Lord Xi Ze in the beginning.

330
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,020
Seeing Lord Xi Ze cares about Junuo,

331
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,940
you're jealous.

332
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,420
But with your status and identity,

333
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,980
you don't have the right to envy her.

334
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,500
If I remember right,

335
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,060
it's the same case for us two.

336
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,780
We have the same father and mother.

337
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,820
There is no difference between us.

338
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,700
How could it be the same?

339
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
You're a bastard

340
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,660
raised in a snake pit.

341
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,180
With such words,

342
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,460
you showed no respect to father and mother.

343
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,340
I was brought up by a snake.

344
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,420
How about you?

345
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,260
Are you acting so shamelessly

346
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,340
just because you were raised by our parents?

347
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,620
Aranya, you...

348
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,300
As Lord Xi Ze said,

349
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,980
it's time to feel my pulse.

350
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,340
Let's go back.

351
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,580
There is no need to quarrel with her.

352
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,140
It'd just demean you.

353
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,940
The wind is strong here.

354
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,140
I have a headache.

355
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,060
Let's go.

356
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,060
The two of them are just so so.

357
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,180
Aranya,

358
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,660
I helped you take revenge.

359
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,860
Your Highness.

360
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,140
Your Highness.

361
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,740
Damn. I forgot.

362
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,300
Chacha must want me to stay with Qing.

363
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,140
I have to go to Moye.

364
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,300
Moye.

365
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,220
Moye.

366
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,420
Moye.

367
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,700
Moye.

368
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,180
A...

369
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,460
Aranya.

370
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,620
I'm not Aranya.

371
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,540
It's me, Fengjiu.

372
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,060
Aranya.

373
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,140
Wake up, Moye.

374
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,500
Fengjiu.

375
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,100
Princess Fengjiu.

376
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,580
Why are you here in my room?

377
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,380
What's the matter?

378
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,740
Did you forget?

379
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,940
I told you

380
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,500
I can't stay with Qing

381
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,060
in the same place.

382
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,540
How about me sleeping here?

383
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,140
I can make do with it.

384
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,380
No way.

385
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Stop kidding.

386
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,420
Absolutely no.

387
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,660
I don't care.

388
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,180
I have no choice. How about you going to keep Qing in company?

389
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,180
I'll sleep here.

390
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,420
Princess Fengjiu.

391
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,900
At this moment,

392
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,220
you're Aranya

393
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,700
and I'm your master.

394
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,620
Think about it.

395
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,980
Is it proper for you to do that?

396
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,860
What should I do?

397
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,180
I'm really scared at the mention of snakes.

398
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,220
I can't stay in the same room with him.

399
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,780
Do something about it.

400
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,180
Actually,

401
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,940
Qing is very gentle.

402
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,180
In his eyes,

403
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,620
you're his master

404
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,500
and his family.

405
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,140
He'll never hurt you.

406
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,380
Drop it.

407
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,460
I'm scared anyway.

408
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,100
I see!

409
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,580
Have you got an idea?

410
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Yes.

411
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,460
But

412
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,820
you need to suffer a little.

413
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,820
No problem.

414
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,260
Tell me about your idea.

415
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,180
Okay.

416
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,500
Turn around.

417
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,260
Junuo, look.

418
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,580
Look.

419
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,380
What's wrong, Your Highness?

420
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,220
Did you sleep well last night? Do you have a stiff neck?

421
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,420
Su Moye,

422
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,980
look at what you've done.

423
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,740
Prince Qing slithered around you

424
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,140
till midnight yesterday.

425
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,940
He didn't sleep

426
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,340
until the rooster crowed.

427
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,820
Anyway,

428
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,380
I've got through the first night.

429
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,060
But I can't let Moye do that again tonight.

430
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,780
He's skilled at doing that,

431
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,700
but I still feel dizzy and my neck hurts.

432
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,180
It's not a good idea in the long run.

433
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,020
His Majesty has been in your favor recently.

434
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,460
He even asked Lord Xi Ze

435
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,980
to spend more time with you last night.

436
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,740
All your sufferings will have their reward.

437
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,940
It's just...

438
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,060
Just what?

439
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,980
Lord Xi Ze didn't come over

440
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,300
to stay with you last night.

441
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,060
Your Highness, Her Highness Junuo asked you to go to her palace

442
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,020
for breakfast.

443
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,140
What? She invited Her Highness Aranya?

444
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,020
Is she so nice?

445
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,420
I see. You can leave.

446
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,260
Got it.

447
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,740
Your Highness,

448
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,060
Junuo and Changdi are always in the same camp.

449
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,940
They must be waiting to tease you.

450
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,020
Besides, her wounds haven't healed.

451
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,700
She must still be mad at you.

452
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,780
They just want to bully you.

453
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,260
Don't go there.

454
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,020
Don't worry.

455
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,940
I've been really bored these days.

456
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,380
Now that she invited me,

457
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,740
how could I refuse her?

458
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,180
Oh.

459
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,300
I asked you to get me some clothes the other day.

460
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,900
Take it to me.

461
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,340
I want to dress up.

462
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,980
Lord Xi Ze,

463
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,500
are her wounds healing properly?

464
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,940
Yeah.

465
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,020
She'll be fully recovered in a few days.

466
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,220
Lord Xi Ze,

467
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,860
did you see Aranya yesterday?

468
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,860
No.

469
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,060
She showed no respect to you.

470
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,820
We met her last night.

471
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,780
Really?

472
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,540
Where?

473
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,140
In the stern.

474
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,140
Well.

475
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,140
She's acting more and more boldly.

476
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:20,980
I...

477
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,380
Alright.

478
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,580
If there is nothing else,

479
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,740
I'm leaving.

480
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:27,940
Lord Xi Ze,

481
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,260
did you have breakfast?

482
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,620
It doesn't matter.

483
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,980
I'll go back for breakfast.

484
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
I've prepared some porridge.

485
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,340
If it's okay,

486
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,140
how about us having breakfast together?

487
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,620
Okay.

488
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,420
Her Highness Aranya arrives.

489
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,980
It turns out he's Lord Xi Ze.

490
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,580
He's really handsome

491
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,820
and dashing.

492
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,380
It's a pity

493
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,180
he didn't love Aranya.

494
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,140
Let me show my respect to you, Junuo.

495
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,620
You're finally here. We've been waiting for you.

496
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,820
Take a seat.

497
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,140
Nuo, it's spacious here.

498
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,980
It's much larger than my palace.

499
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,340
That's for sure.

500
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,820
She's the Elder Princess.

501
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,260
Of course she deserves the best.

502
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,140
See?

503
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,660
She injured her arm.

504
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,620
Even Lord Xi Ze is burning with anxiety.

505
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,460
Changdi is really noisy.

506
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,740
The two of them should be ashamed of themselves

507
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,700
for getting so close

508
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,020
to their sister's husband.

509
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,420
Fine. Whatever.

510
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,940
I'll go to my master after the meal.

511
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,620
I'm hungry. Let's get started.

512
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,780
Aranya,

513
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,140
where did you sleep last night?

514
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,700
Why don't you answer me?

515
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,420
Why do I have to do that?

516
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,180
You...

517
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Aranya,

518
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,740
are you feeling upset

519
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,140
because Lord Xi Ze is here

520
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,780
to treat me?

521
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,140
How could I?

522
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,900
Just do as you like.

523
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,380
But...

524
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,460
But what?

525
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,180
But now that Lord Xi Ze is here

526
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,020
to treat you,

527
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,940
I'm afraid he won't be here again

528
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,820
once you're recovered.

529
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,700
So I wonder if you want to

530
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,180
get better as soon as possible or not.

531
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,940
What are you talking about?

532
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,460
Alright. I'm full.

533
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,300
Thanks for treating me. Bye.

534
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,300
You...

535
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,620
Oh. I almost forgot

536
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
my appointment with Moye.

537
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,380
We'll go for a blow and enjoy the view.

538
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,780
I'm leaving.

539
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,140
See you next time.

540
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Lord Xi Ze.

541
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,940
See you.

542
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
What's going on?

543
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,220
Aranya looks exactly like Xiaobai.

544
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,580
Is it possible

545
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,980
Xiaobai's primordial spirit is in her body?

546
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,540
But why did she look at me

547
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,740
as if she didn't know me at all?

548
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,260
It's boring to read after a nap in spring.

549
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,420
Why not drink tea by the handrail?

550
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,700
You came here in great haste.

551
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,180
Do you want to share tea with me?

552
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,740
Moye,

553
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,700
luckily I'm strong-willed.

554
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,460
I'm sure any other girl

555
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,420
would think it's hard

556
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,620
to refuse such a handsome gentleman.

557
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,780
It's hot.

558
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,260
Forget about it.

559
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,180
You're a person

560
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,660
of no taste.

561
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,900
Generally, people would just say,

562
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,940
"would you like some tea?"

563
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,260
What you said

564
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
is really interesting.

565
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,300
Did you often say that to Aranya?

566
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,940
How did she respond?

567
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,620
Well.

568
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
She usually

569
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,900
played a joke on me

570
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,100
before she hid and saw how I'd respond.

571
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,940
Play a joke? How?

572
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,100
She'd...

573
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,340
Why do I have to tell you?

574
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,020
You don't have to,

575
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,260
but I have to ask you a favor.

576
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,020
It couldn't be anything good.

577
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,260
Tell me about it.

578
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,460
Here is the story.

579
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,140
I heard we'll pull in to shore at Duanchang Mountain tonight.

580
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,460
I want to enjoy

581
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,140
Yueling flowers there,

582
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,980
but Qing keeps bothering me.

583
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,700
He'll be furious

584
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,020
if he fails to see me at night.

585
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,300
So I've figured out a way

586
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,900
to avoid him.

587
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,780
It's about Qing again.

588
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,700
Well.

589
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,060
You slept with him last night.

590
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,060
Why are you still afraid of him?

591
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,900
Speaking of that,

592
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,380
I have to get even with you.

593
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,500
What a bad idea it was!

594
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,140
You're really cold blooded.

595
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,060
My neck still hurts.

596
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,780
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

597
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,860
Well.

598
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,940
To avoid Qing,

599
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,900
you've given much thought to it.

600
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,860
I really can't deal with Qing.

601
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,580
If I can't get this issue solved,

602
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,060
I couldn't keep disguising myself as Aranya.

603
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,300
I'll help you.

604
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,340
Your Excellency.

605
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Did you see Princess Aranya?

606
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,180
I just saw her

607
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
going to the stern with Mr. Su.

608
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,380
Mr. Su?

609
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,260
Yes.

610
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,260
Luckily, Qing has poor eyesight.

611
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,660
He sees me through scent.

612
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,620
So on my way here,

613
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,460
I've thought of a good idea.

614
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:35,980
Give me the details.

615
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,140
We just need to let someone

616
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,380
put on my clothes

617
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,660
so that she smells like me.

618
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,660
Qing couldn't tell it's a fake.

619
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,020
Will you let whom do it?

620
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,900
I didn't have the heart to let anyone do it

621
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,660
now that Qing is really fierce.

622
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,500
But I know who is suitable for it now.

623
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,100
Changdi appeared at the right time.

624
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,260
Changdi?

625
00:34:59,540 --> 00:34:59,980
Right.

626
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,060
Let me tell you something.

627
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,940
As far as I can see,

628
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,820
Changdi has a crush on Xi Ze.

629
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,980
Really?

630
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,220
Sure.

631
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,780
If I write her a letter

632
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,180
in the name of Xi Ze

633
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,580
and ask her to meet me by the riverside tonight,

634
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,140
do you think she'll come?

635
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,380
Fengjiu,

636
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,460
what can I do to help you?

637
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,540
Moye, you look like Xi Ze in body shape.

638
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,780
How about

639
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,940
you disguising yourself as him

640
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,620
by using magic arts?

641
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,300
It must be easy for you.

642
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,340
I knew it.

643
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,260
It couldn't be anything good.

644
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:42,740
Look.

645
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,020
We can dig a hole by the bank

646
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,660
and get some water in it

647
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,420
before camouflaging it.

648
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,380
You just need to stand by the hole.

649
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,380
When Changdi gets close to you,

650
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,500
you'll be the only thing in her eyes.

651
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,540
She'll fall into the hole

652
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,860
as long as you dodge.

653
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,300
What are you laughing at? I haven't finished.

654
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,780
I'll make the boat lie alongshore nearby

655
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,660
and get everything ready.

656
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,860
Then you get her out of the hole and take her to the boat

657
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,060
so that she can take off wet clothes

658
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,460
and put on mine.

659
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,620
I've heard many times

660
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,220
that you're famous

661
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,180
for being mischievous

662
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,580
and you're good at playing the woman.

663
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,340
So you dare to do anything as a spoiled child.

664
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,460
I had doubts about all this,

665
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,700
but today,

666
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,340
I find you deserve your reputation.

667
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,180
I dare to do anything

668
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,580
because someone is behind me.

669
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,180
I always think it over before I make trouble.

670
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,980
How about this?

671
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,380
If we make it tonight,

672
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,700
I'll consider you my savior

673
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,300
and take you to enjoy Yueling flowers. Okay?

674
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,860
You're resolute.

675
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,380
But

676
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,020
there is one problem.

677
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,820
We shouldn't get Lord Xi Ze involved.

678
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,860
In my humble opinion,

679
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,060
Lord Xi Ze is not someone to be trifled with.

680
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,780
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble

681
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,620
when he knows about it.

682
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,340
Forget about it. No big deal.

683
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,500
I had a crush on you at the first sight.

684
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:34,060
I want to stay by your side till old age.

685
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,660
Well.

686
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,540
It was a good poem,

687
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,500
but it's not anymore

688
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
when you read it.

689
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,620
As for literary grace,

690
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,420
this poem is

691
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,220
unparalleled.

692
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,100
But as for the effect,

693
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,980
I don't think it'll be good enough.

694
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,180
What?

695
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,380
How about this?

696
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,220
I'll say

697
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,420
and you write.

698
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,660
Do as I say.

699
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,380
Write it down the way Xi Ze would do.

700
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:08,980
Hurry.

701
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,100
Since I got to know you,

702
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,500
I've had a strong admiration for you.

703
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,100
Each time I thought of you,

704
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,460
I was sleepless in bed.

705
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,540
My continuous feelings for you

706
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,700
couldn't be separated

707
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,660
by Duanchang Mountain or Sixing River.

708
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,380
Now that I've been staying with you these days,

709
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,540
I couldn't control myself anymore.

710
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,460
But there are too many people during the day,

711
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,340
so I hope I can see you in the evening

712
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,540
to relieve the pain of missing you.

713
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,300
That's why I'm writing this letter.

714
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,740
Today,

715
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,580
let's meet up

716
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,340
by Sixing River.

717
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,580
...meet up by Sixing River.

718
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,980
Lord Xi Ze.

719
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,540
Your Majesties.

720
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,140
This guy bears a similarity to me.

721
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,940
He must've practiced

722
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,500
the same kind of magic arts as me.

723
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,580
Father. Mother.

724
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,540
Don't stand on ceremony.

725
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,540
I've got everything prepared.

726
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,100
Your Majesties, you must be tired after a long journey.

727
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,820
Please go have a good rest.

728
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,380
Shen Ye, thank you.

729
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,820
Your Majesty, please don't say that.

730
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,500
It's your birthday.

731
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,580
I should've kept you in company.

732
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,100
It's just I had a lot to deal with in Qi Nan Palace,

733
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,820
so I could only wait for you here with His Highness.

734
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Please forgive me.

735
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,860
Alright.

736
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,100
We're tired after the journey.

737
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,900
Let's have a good rest.

738
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,820
Shen Ye,

739
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,820
thanks for what you did.

740
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:33,980
It's okay.

741
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,700
I'm going in.

742
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,740
Let's go dig a hole.

743
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,260
Go.

744
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,300
Go.

745
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,900
How about here?

746
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Okay. You're good at it.

747
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,540
You do it.

748
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,500
Do what?

749
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,860
Dig a hole.

750
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,500
Do you want me to do that?

751
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,500
Okay.

752
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,180
Step aside.

753
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
Amazing.

754
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,940
Sure!

755
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,180
When it gets darker,

756
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,020
it'll be more inconspicuous.

757
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,700
That'd be great.

758
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,740
Remember where it is.

759
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,380
I don't want to see you fall into it.

760
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,380
Got it, Your Highness.
