00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 27

3
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,700
Where is this place?

4
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,020
I heard that Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu

5
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,900
offended you in the past days.

6
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,340
Bai Fengjiu is the most beautiful lady
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions

7
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,820
second only to the God Bai Qian.

8
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,700
She became the female monarch of Qingqiu at such a young age.

9
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,340
It's so lucky of you to have her.

10
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,660
She surely deserves the title as a beauty.

11
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,780
I surely am!

12
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,660
So men do gossip as well?

13
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,620
She is indeed beautiful,

14
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,220
but not so clever.

15
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,060
Why am I not clever?

16
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,260
It was you who teased me again and again!

17
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,980
Now Bai Fengjiu is famous

18
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,980
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

19
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,660
Why?

20
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,740
She rejected to marry to the Immortal Lord Cang Yi,

21
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,940
created a tremendous uproar in the palace on Mount Zhiyue,

22
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,900
and destroyed the statue of Cang Yi,

23
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,260
which greatly humiliated Bai Yi from Qingqiu.

24
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,940
This female monarch is too bold.

25
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,300
Who knows what things she will do

26
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,460
against the rules in future.

27
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,580
Like you said,

28
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,500
Bai Fengjiu is indeed good at

29
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,700
losing the face for the Qingqiu clan.

30
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,580
You dare to speak ill of me now.

31
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,260
If I show my original form as the female monarch of Qingqiu

32
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,100
in front of you,

33
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,900
you'll spread such awkward things

34
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,420
across the Four Seas and Eight Deserts

35
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,260
which will lose all the face of Qingqiu!

36
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,700
My father will never forgive me for that.

37
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,780
Thanks for

38
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,820
letting me win.

39
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,940
It's undetermined yet

40
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,420
who will win.

41
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,420
Enough of this!

42
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,580
I lose to you every time.

43
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,940
This is so boring!

44
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,580
It's so chilly!

45
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,220
Ever since the Haotian Tower was rebuilt,

46
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,420
I've never practiced yet.

47
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,180
Today looks like a good day.

48
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,220
How about...

49
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,900
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

50
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,420
I gotta go now

51
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,180
for something else.

52
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,420
One is willing to fight and the other one is willing to suffer.

53
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,780
They are a good match!

54
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,700
It's so hot!

55
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,060
Why is my life so hard!

56
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,660
Why do I need to suffer from the ice and fire!

57
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,140
What kind of strange smell is it?

58
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,100
Your Majesty,

59
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,620
it's very humid these days.

60
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,860
It happens that there is Hengwu incense on the fairy mountain.

61
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
I switched with it.

62
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,580
Are you used to the smell?

63
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,700
Hengwu incense can eliminate the humidity

64
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,860
and help one to tranquilize and fall asleep.

65
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,100
It's a good spice.

66
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,140
I don't like the smell,

67
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,820
but it's good for her.

68
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,300
God! God!

69
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,540
God! God!

70
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,180
Bad news! Bad news!

71
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,340
God!

72
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,580
God Zhe Yan!

73
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,940
God! God!

74
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,620
Bad news! Bad news!

75
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,260
Go away!

76
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,140
How impolite you are!

77
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,780
I'll tell your mother about that!

78
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,460
God Zhe Yan! God Zhe Yan!

79
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,380
Bad news!

80
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,420
Something very bad happened!

81
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,140
- Come with me! - Enough! Enough!

82
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,380
Don't pull me!

83
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,420
What happened?

84
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,740
Sister Fengjiu turned into a piece of silk handkerchief.

85
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,620
That's not a big deal!

86
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
It's nothing but a kid's magic art.

87
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Sister Fengjiu turned into a silk handkerchief

88
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,220
and was taken away by His Majesty!

89
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,580
Please help me get Sister Fengjiu back

90
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,220
from His Majesty!

91
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,500
That's really naughty plot for a story.

92
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,540
Don't laugh at her.

93
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,900
His Majesty doesn't know

94
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,300
Sister Fengjiu is that silk handkerchief.

95
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,980
Stop it!

96
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,420
Stop shaking! I got it now.

97
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,500
I'll get Fengjiu out tomorrow.

98
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,820
Get her out now.

99
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,100
Do you think

100
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,380
His Majesty will give it to us

101
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,180
if we go for a silk handkerchief in the middle of the night?

102
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,940
Besides, after all your crying,

103
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,820
everyone will know the whereabouts

104
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,180
of Sister Fengjiu.

105
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,620
That makes sense!

106
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,780
Then we'll do it tomorrow!

107
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,260
I'm worried that

108
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,580
Sister Fengjiu will suffer with His Majesty!

109
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,380
I'm so hungry!

110
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,620
Where is this place?

111
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,780
What a narrow escape!

112
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,380
I almost lose my life under the chopping knife of His Majesty!

113
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,860
Thanks to my good luck!

114
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,340
Neither threats nor forces can subdue me.
Neither wealth nor honor can corrupt me.

115
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,820
No sweet and sour fish.

116
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,380
Refrain from it!

117
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,740
I cannot take it!

118
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,500
Your Majesty, the Third Prince wants to meet you.

119
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,060
OK. Got it!

120
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,940
Yes!

121
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,420
There you come finally!

122
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,380
We have the deal that you come with me
to practice the manipulation of the Haotian Tower.

123
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,780
I would not come out if I wasn't hungry!

124
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,900
Let me fill my stomach first.

125
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,900
It's been so long.

126
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,940
Why are your cooking skills not improved at all?

127
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,580
I've got a new feature!

128
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,060
This time, I must be able to beat God Zhe Yan's Jiuli Pot!

129
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,020
Keep your eyes open!

130
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
Chong... Chong Lin!

131
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,340
Chong Lin!

132
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,140
Chong Lin!

133
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,700
I've rearranged the mechanisms

134
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,140
at the top of the tower.

135
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,620
Try it again!

136
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,180
Thank Your Majesty for saving me!

137
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,980
What is it that smells so good?

138
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,420
I made sweet and sour fish.

139
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,780
Let's try it together.

140
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,860
You made sweet and sour fish?

141
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,020
I know your cooking very well.

142
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,820
Besides, you are not in the Imperial Kitchen.

143
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,060
I can make her show herself.

144
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,020
It smells so good!

145
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,900
Perfect combination of color, aroma, and taste.

146
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,860
Your cooking skill has improved.

147
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,300
This taste is...

148
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,900
Not bad.

149
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,620
If Lord Cheng Yu has the luck

150
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,220
to have this dish,

151
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,660
she will surely recover soon.

152
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,180
What happened to her?

153
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,580
She is not herself these days.

154
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,180
At first, she just had a minor headache,

155
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,220
but it gets a lot worse these days.

156
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,820
She can barely get out of bed and stand

157
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,420
and usually falls into coma.

158
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,940
I had wanted to invite Fengjiu, the Princess of Qingqiu,

159
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,860
to accompany her,

160
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,780
but I just couldn't find her anywhere.

161
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
How come Cheng Yu gets so sick?

162
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,940
It's getting late now.

163
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,820
I've gotta send the medicines for Cheng Yu!

164
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,820
Hope she is fine today.

165
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,100
Bye for now!

166
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,260
Third Prince,

167
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,940
make it clear before you leave.

168
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,660
What happened to Cheng Yu?

169
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,620
Your Majesty, God Zhe Yan wants to meet you.

170
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,580
Let him in!

171
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,340
This way please!

172
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,540
How cozy this is!

173
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,020
This pavilion is elegant and interesting.

174
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,180
This auspicious beast censer is exquisite and extraordinary!

175
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,900
I suppose this is made by...

176
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,300
God Zhe Yan! God Zhe Yan!

177
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,820
Get down to the point!

178
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,820
I don't mean to cheat you,

179
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,940
but I come for a trivial matter.

180
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,980
What is it?

181
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,620
This little naughty boy stole the silk handkerchief

182
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,300
I brought for her mother yesterday afternoon

183
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,860
while I was taking the afternoon nap.

184
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,980
He came back quite pleased with himself

185
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
and realized the loss of it

186
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,020
only after he was asked.

187
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,380
It's said

188
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,060
you've taken it!

189
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,460
It doesn't matter if it's a normal handkerchief,

190
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,340
but it's made by his grandma

191
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,260
who is the Fox Queen of Qingqiu.

192
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,980
It means a lot to him.

193
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,700
So I'm here

194
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,740
to retrieve the handkerchief.

195
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,220
Zhe Yan is so good at making up fantastic stories.

196
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,500
What a spicy ginger he is!

197
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,780
Now His Majesty has to release me.

198
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,660
Li  really has great comprehension.

199
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,660
He asked the most powerful

200
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,620
and merciful god to help me.

201
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,940
I underestimated the friendship

202
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,700
between him and me as an elder sister.

203
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,380
This is the handkerchief I took at the Ninety Heaven.

204
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,420
Is this yours?

205
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,980
No, it's not!

206
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,860
Is it not this one?

207
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,460
If not,

208
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,780
you could find it out at Yuan Ji Palace.

209
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,780
Maybe Lian Song took it.

210
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,780
It's just a handkerchief.

211
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,700
I don't think you'd lie to me and keep it.

212
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,420
You won't do something

213
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,860
as disgraceful as that.

214
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,420
This handkerchief is real.

215
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,100
If so,

216
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,300
I'll need to give this handkerchief

217
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,540
to Bai Qian.

218
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,700
Bye for now.

219
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,940
Take care!

220
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,900
Come on! Let's go!

221
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,380
This is not the one!

222
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,780
This is not the one!

223
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,180
His Majesty won't lie to us.

224
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,300
Come on! Let's go!

225
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,420
- It's not! - Let's go!

226
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,620
Come on! Let's go!

227
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,660
- Bye for now! - This is not the one!

228
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,100
Don't go!

229
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,140
- Not this one! - Alright! Alright!

230
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,940
God Zhe Yan, why do you lose

231
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,220
and fail to get Sister Fengjiu out?

232
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,420
You didn't do your best.

233
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,620
I'm breaking up with you today.

234
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,220
So be it!

235
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,020
It isn't your uncle that he kidnapped.

236
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,660
Why do I need to offend him openly?

237
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,980
Don't worry!

238
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,620
I've deduced Fengjiu's fate last year.

239
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,780
The fate plate shows she'll survive.

240
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,100
Let's wait and see how she goes.

241
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,340
Maybe it will turn out the other way around.

242
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,980
You can deduce fate

243
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,380
just like Si Ming?

244
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,260
Certainly!

245
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,860
But I haven't done it for several thousand years.

246
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,580
It's another thing as to its accuracy.

247
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,340
Deduce my fate.

248
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll see if it's accurate or not.

249
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,100
Li!

250
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,180
Are you in the snares of love recently?

251
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,980
What are the snares of love?

252
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,900
It's...

253
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,500
Didn't you break up with me just now?

254
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,740
Time has changed.

255
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,020
Tell me now!

256
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,780
No!

257
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,700
Say it!

258
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,420
Till when do you plan to hide yourself?

259
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,980
So,

260
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,500
turning into a handkerchief is your hobby!

261
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,620
Your Majesty, your deduction is ridiculous!

262
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,420
Fortunately, I'm calm enough

263
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,860
not to be taken in.

264
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,460
Good!

265
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,620
I'm right in need of a handkerchief to clean my sword.

266
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,740
I'll use you for that.

267
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,220
To clean a sword?

268
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,980
To clean the well-known legendary weapon

269
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,740
which ranks among the top 10 of the ancient weapons

270
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,900
and can cut iron like sapropel,

271
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,500
the Legendary Sword Canghe!

272
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,740
What to do now?

273
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,180
I had planned it for the long term.

274
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,460
I thought

275
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,180
as long as I stay patient,

276
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,660
His Majesty will sooner or later set me free

277
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,780
if he gets bored of me one day.

278
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,260
That's the softest and most stable way

279
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,940
which hurts my face least.

280
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,940
Why would he use me to clean the sword?

281
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,620
His Majesty usually does as he says.

282
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,740
Besides,

283
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,220
he accepted the invitation of fight from Demon Lord Yan.

284
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,940
It looks like

285
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,380
he's gonna use Canghe for a good killing.

286
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,660
This is not good!

287
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,060
I have to get out tonight.

288
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,300
What has become of Cheng Yu now with her illness?

289
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,340
I have to get out for Cheng Yu anyway!

290
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,700
How can I stare at him

291
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,940
like this

292
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,180
without getting ashamed?

293
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,740
Luckily, he didn't recognize me.

294
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,460
Damn!

295
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,820
I didn't learn the lethargy formula well

296
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,700
when I attended school.

297
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,460
I've gotta

298
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,300
to cast it for a few more times.

299
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,500
Let me bury you here first.

300
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,540
It won't matter anymore wherever I am

301
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,220
if I stay together with His Majesty!

302
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,540
This is a precious Hanshi grass.

303
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,620
Its root is good for forgetting sorrows.

304
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,860
Its flower is premium seasoning for cold dishes.

305
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,740
Si Ming brought that particularly for me.

306
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,380
What a sad day that was

307
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,620
that I forgot to bring back this babe!

308
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,060
It's so heart-breaking!

309
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,420
It's not too late now

310
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,540
to make up for it.

311
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,820
The garden in the eyes of fox

312
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,900
is indeed different from that

313
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,340
in the eyes of mankind.

314
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,020
And it's different in the past

315
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,580
from it is now.

316
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,740
The unhappy things I had

317
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,180
in the Tai Chen Palace

318
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,860
is more than the happy things.

319
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,060
But all that I have in mind now

320
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,020
are all good things.

321
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,740
In that case,

322
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,580
I don't need to mind that much.

323
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,540
When I can speak,

324
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,900
I'd persuade Dong Hua into coming to Qingqiu.

325
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,900
By then, I'd say to His Majesty that

326
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,060
by when

327
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,460
I'll bring you to Qingqiu to watch the stars.

328
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,660
One! Two! Three!

329
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,940
You're still so ignorant

330
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,860
even though you're entangled by your own magic art.

331
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,420
You're one of a kind under this world.

332
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,100
No wonder God Bai Yi thinks about

333
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,900
finding a really good man for you every day.

334
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,340
Dong Hua,

335
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,140
you tore me and Ji Heng apart

336
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,860
which resulted in her suffering in the mortal realm.

337
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,300
Now she is so sad that

338
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,700
she left me without saying goodbye.

339
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,180
It's all your fault!

340
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,380
I must make you pay for it.

341
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,700
I don't believe you won't come.

342
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,620
Where am I?

343
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,540
Why am I here?

344
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,540
Oh no!

345
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,740
I clearly got out yesterday.

346
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,180
Why am I here again?

347
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,780
Am I caught and taken back again?

348
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,900
But I don't remember that at all.

349
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,060
Did I fall asleep

350
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,060
so what happened thereafter

351
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,100
is just my dream?

352
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,260
I'm even thinking of escaping

353
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,500
in my dream

354
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,620
and I dreamed in such a detailed way.

355
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,220
Let me do it all over again tonight

356
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,700
as it is in my dream.

357
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,460
How good will it be if it's all true!

358
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,340
It will save so much trouble for me.

359
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,420
There you are finally.

360
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,100
You dilly-dallying

361
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,220
ice face!

362
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,260
I've been waiting for you here for so many days!

363
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,060
Show your weapon!

364
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,660
Let's finish the fight as soon as possible!

365
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,380
If I don't beat the crap out of you today

366
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,460
to revenge previous humiliation,

367
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,580
I'll write my name upside down!

368
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,420
This is Yan Chiwu, one of the seven demon lords

369
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,180
with the title as a demon barbarian.

370
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
Are all demon barbarians

371
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,460
white-skinned Adonis?

372
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,660
Please!

373
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,020
Damn you!

374
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,020
Enough talking!

375
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,860
Let's fight the crap out!

376
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,260
Check it out!

377
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,140
This is my newly developed Yanmo Formation!

378
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,340
It took 7,000 lives from the mortal realm.

379
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,060
Even though they are all evil lives,

380
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,060
it took me great efforts.

381
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,380
If you dare to hurt them,

382
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,700
it's a cutoff to their six-realm encounters

383
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,460
to return to good.

384
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,380
Gods like you praise yourselves as kind-hearted people.

385
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,860
Show me how

386
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,220
you're going to break my Yanmo Formation.

387
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,460
Done!

388
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,380
My taking of 7,000 lives might be a breach of the sky moral

389
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,140
and deserves to be punished,

390
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,180
but the punishment should be the thunder

391
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,060
from the sky.

392
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,460
Shouldn't the gods like you

393
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,780
do your best to help them through?

394
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,620
If your sword gets stained by their blood,

395
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,580
you'll be convicted with killing.

396
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,060
You killed without any hesitation.

397
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,940
Don't you feel afraid of the sky's punishment

398
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,140
for your charge of killing?

399
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,980
Charge of killing?

400
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,500
I haven't handled any war affairs
in the past several hundred thousand years.

401
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,340
You have forgotten my style

402
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,100
when I was in charge of the life and death

403
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,780
in the six realms.

404
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:51,860
Damn!

405
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,260
Your Majesty!

406
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,380
Your Majesty!

407
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,700
Your Majesty!

408
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,820
Your Majesty!

409
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,060
Your Majesty!

410
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,620
Stay in there! Don't come out!

411
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,740
Your back!

412
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,340
Ice face, you despise me, don't you?

413
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,780
Fighting with families aside.

414
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,500
Watch out, Your Majesty!

415
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,260
Xiaobai!

416
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,500
Damn Yan Chiwu!

417
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,500
If it's not because of you fighting with His Majesty,

418
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,780
how could I get blown to this damn place?

419
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,660
In spite that His Majesty teased me so awfully,

420
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,620
he is good too

421
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,020
as he gave me the Tiangang Shield

422
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,860
to protect me.

423
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,300
I'll forget about all the past grudges.

424
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,460
But how does His Majesty know

425
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,380
my personal thoughts?

426
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,940
He called me Xiaobai in a great rush

427
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,900
just a few minutes before.

428
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,020
Why was he nowhere to be found

429
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,340
at the time when I fell off the cliff?

430
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,380
Xiaobai.

431
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,620
His Majesty calls me Xiaobai!

432
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,700
I like that!

433
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,540
Just think from his perspective.

434
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,980
If I were His Majesty,

435
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,380
I protected someone with Tiangang Shield,

436
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,460
but this person does not help in the fight

437
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,780
and she just witnessed me dragged off the cliff

438
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,380
by my enemy hand in hand.

439
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,380
I would not just watch,

440
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,980
but also stab him with another two strokes to vent my anger.

441
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,900
Two strokes to vent my anger.

442
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,180
The ice face really sucks.

443
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,100
Fighting with him will bring nothing good.

444
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,860
We even ran into the opening of the Fanyin Valley

445
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,300
at the top of Mount Fuyu

446
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,780
and fell onto the steep cliff.

447
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,020
Where is the Fanyin Valley?

448
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,220
You're intimate to the ice face.

449
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,540
How can you not know that?

450
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,420
Haven't you heard of the inseparable king birds clan?

451
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,260
Inseparable king birds?

452
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,620
The Fanyin Valley that inseparable king birds inhabit?

453
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,380
That's right!

454
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,580
It opens once in a cycle of sixty years.

455
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,500
And it shows one tiny crack every time

456
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,980
which is called the Fanyin Valley.

457
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,660
What a coincidence it is

458
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,900
that you came in at the time it was opened!

459
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,940
The wind under the feet

460
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,540
right blew us in at this time

461
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,900
as there is nothing left to blow.

462
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,660
And that crack

463
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,860
is right in the size

464
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,780
that allows two of us to come in at a time.

465
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,500
What luck is that?

466
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,580
What did you say?

467
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,900
Do you think I...

468
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,820
That hurts!

469
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,580
Did you

470
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,940
beat me up just now

471
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,620
while I was in coma?

472
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,300
That's impossible!

473
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,060
Qingqiu people are well-behaved.

474
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,420
We will never do something like that.

475
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,020
Yan, you've thought too much!

476
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,300
OK!

477
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,700
If you call me Yan again,

478
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,380
I'll cut off your tongue.

479
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,860
Then how should I address you?

480
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,420
Address me in the way

481
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,380
strong people are addressed

482
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,900
in the mortal realm.

483
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,460
Warrior Yan?

484
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,300
Warrior Yan!

485
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,220
That's more like it!

486
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Warrior Yan,

487
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,140
why do you want to fight with His Majesty again and again?

488
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,020
Why do you dislike His Majesty so much?

489
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,020
As the Green Demon Lord,

490
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,420
of course, I need to protect the woman I love.

491
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,780
It's wide-spread in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts

492
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,020
that Dong Hua is a god without any desires,

493
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,740
but I know

494
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,380
there is someone he truly loves.

495
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,260
Do you want know who it is?

496
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,860
Ji Heng!

497
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,100
How do you know?

498
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,900
It is indeed Ji Heng?

499
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
His Majesty doesn't necessarily like Ji Heng!

500
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,580
Ji Heng is as clean as ice and as pure as jade.
She is innocent and elegant.

501
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,380
Her beauty makes the fish sink, wild geese fall and flower blush,
and obscures the moon. It's beyond words of description.

502
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,580
A man

503
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,340
whose heart doesn't throb

504
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,180
for a beauty like Ji Heng

505
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,900
doesn't deserve to be a man.

506
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,180
You think her good

507
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,940
because you like her.

508
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,500
You're intimate to the ice face.

509
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,780
How do you not know who he really likes?

510
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,140
What's your name?

511
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,420
You look kind of familiar.

512
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,540
Are you the immortal from Tai Chen Palace?

513
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,180
I have absolutely nothing to do with Tai Chen Palace.

514
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,740
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu!

515
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,420
Bai Fengjiu?

516
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,780
What a poor taste!

517
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,620
Ji Heng is the best in the world!
