1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 6

3
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,680
Isn't it Ji Heng?

4
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,440
Today His Majesty's wife-to-be will stay at Tai Chen Palace.

5
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
You can't screw it up.

6
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,920
You're here.

7
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Please feel free to stay here.

8
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
How's that possible?

9
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,500
They weren't close at all

10
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,700
last time in Mount Fuyu.

11
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I can't believe it.

12
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,080
It doesn't remember me.

13
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
You will have time to get closer

14
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,720
in Tai Chen Palace later.

15
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,800
Your Majesty,

16
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,480
I heard you are getting married.

17
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Did I tell you to come in?

18
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
I told you so many times

19
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
to find a empress.

20
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,760
I guess I have said it like dozens of times.

21
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
You didn't listen to me at all.

22
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,760
What's gotten into you?

23
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
Why do you agree so easily this time?

24
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,840
I've heard so much that

25
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,200
Princess Ji Heng

26
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,880
is a rarely seen beauty in the demons.

27
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,840
Is there any beauty that Third Prince doesn't know about?

28
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
You are flattering me, Your Majesty.

29
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
Speaking of beauties,

30
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,600
for so many years,

31
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,920
you must have seen a great many of them.

32
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,400
Is she so reputed for her achievements in four arts

33
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,000
that you suddenly fall for her

34
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,040
and put an end to your bachelor life for over 100 thousand years?

35
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,640
Do you come all the way here today

36
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,260
for the gossip?

37
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,080
Well, nothing in particular.

38
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,240
Actually,

39
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,400
someone's birthday is coming.

40
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,200
I was thinking of...

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,520
Yes, it's Cheng Yu.

42
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
It's her birthday soon.

43
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,960
And recently,

44
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
she has fallen in love with collecting short knives.

45
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
So I drew a design of a short knife.

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
And I wonder if you can

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,840
make an unusual short knife for her.

48
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
What makes the short knife unusual is that

49
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
it's a short knife in close combat

50
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,960
and it becomes a long sword in long range combat.

51
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,840
When you're fighting with someone who outmatches you greatly,

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
it can release hidden weapons,

53
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,120
some silver needles that can stick the opponents down immediately.

54
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,760
When you're hunting,

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,480
it can transform into an iron bow.

56
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,680
Besides,

57
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
When you're cooking in the kitchen,

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
it can turn into a kitchen knife.

59
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,880
So it can be used as

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
a short knife, a long sword,

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
a hidden weapon, an iron bow and a kitchen knife.

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
Five in total.

63
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,160
That's right.

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
And it can be used in any occasions.

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
It's so useful that

66
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,800
Cheng Yu will definitely carry it with her

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
all the time.

68
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
That's what your plan is.

69
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,120
And I also think that

70
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,120
the short knife

71
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,080
can't be made with magic power.

72
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
It has to be made

73
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,600
with a new natural power.

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
So it can be creative enough

75
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,360
to convey

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,880
my particular feeling

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
for  Lord Cheng Yu.

78
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
It's not a problem

79
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,320
for you, Third Prince.

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,640
You don't need help for that at all.

81
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
But the thing is

82
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm usually good at making big weapons

83
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
with magic powers

84
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,520
like Bronze Ware of Demons.

85
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,720
It's a bit difficult for me

86
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,320
to make a small, delicate short knife.

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,840
So after thinking about it over and over again,

88
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,960
I can only turn to you for help, Your Majesty.

89
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,480
Only you can make something so complicated.

90
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,240
The design drawing

91
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,400
is exquisite over all.

92
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
But there are some rough places.

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,200
If it's dismantled,

94
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
traces will be left.

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,720
And wonderful workmanship

96
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,960
will not be achieved.

97
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
Thanks god

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,000
for giving me the opportunity to show my talent.

99
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
I admit that I do poorly in four arts,

100
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,240
but if I'm given the chance to revise the design,

101
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,120
I will prove to His Majesty that

102
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,760
I'm talented as well as Ji Heng.

103
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,120
And he will change the way he thinks of me.

104
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
I have to block it here,

105
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
in case Third Prince finds out

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,480
as he speaks.

107
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,700
I know you've been into

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,660
making ceramic.

109
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,720
The other day,

110
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
I found a place that is rich in

111
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,040
porcelain clay in the north desert owned by Xuan Ming

112
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
which gathers the best clay within Eight Deserts.

113
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
But Xuan Ming

114
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,240
guards it strictly.

115
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,160
If you make the short knife for me,

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,840
I will draw a map of the place for you.

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
If you go and ask him for the clay,

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm sure he will give it to you.

119
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,480
How about I give you the materials for making the knife

120
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,720
and you forge it yourself?

121
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
You know I had a beef

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,920
with Xuan Ming.

123
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Several years ago, I went for a dinner party in his mansion.

124
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,030
His concubine had her eyes on me

125
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,150
and wrote me love letters everyday.

126
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,080
He has been upset about it even until now.

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't like to

128
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,720
owe anyone anything,

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,600
or use my statues to force anyone anything.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
You go back

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,240
and change all the porcelain with gold and silver jade,

132
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,080
then leak the message that

133
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,360
you are allergic to porcelain clay.

134
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,840
The finer the porcelain is, the severe the allergy is.

135
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
You are having a birthday this year.

136
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,120
I think Xuan Ming will offer quite a few

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,960
fine porcelain to you.

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,800
And then you deliver it to me.

139
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Is there any problem?

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
No problem. No problem.

141
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,240
That's a deal.

142
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,080
I'll leave you the design of the short knife

143
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
and I will bring the materials to you later.

144
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,480
Thanks, Your Majesty.

145
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,720
Quick learner.

146
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,040
I will go find materials for the short knife.

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,800
Are you coming with me?

148
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
The tea is so good.

149
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,880
His Majesty always feeds me so well.

150
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,720
If I were really a pet,

151
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,520
he must be a good owner.

152
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,600
What?

153
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,040
The ink brush?

154
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,040
Where?

155
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,200
Little fox,

156
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,960
I read about a passage of scripture
which is so hard to understand.

157
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
But His Majesty is being so mobile that I can't find him easily.

158
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,440
Do you think I should leave him a note

159
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,800
and ask him about it later?

160
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,800
Greetings Your Majesty.

161
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,880
You added the two places, right?

162
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,120
Not bad.

163
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,160
What?

164
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,880
Not her.

165
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,240
I thought you only knew about reading.

166
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
That's so unexpected.

167
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,680
It's not easy to understand the design drawing from Lian Song.

168
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
Let alone finding the two places

169
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,520
to do final touches.

170
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,440
Your brother said that you had broad interests.

171
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm really impressed today.

172
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,760
I...

173
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,960
Since you know about this

174
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,560
and you're interested in it,

175
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,800
I will open the furnace and start forging tomorrow.

176
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,280
Come help me.

177
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,520
It's my honor

178
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
to help Your Majesty

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,360
and learn something new.

180
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,200
But I'm clumsy with my hands.

181
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm afraid to slow you down.

182
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
It's not a big deal as long as you're not dumb.

183
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,200
You start biting people now?

184
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
And it's your benefactor that you bit.

185
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,600
It's not my fault.

186
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,520
Ji Heng is a liar.

187
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,400
She didn't revise the picture.

188
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,560
I did.

189
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,560
Your Majesty.

190
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,040
You really treat me

191
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,600
as a pet.

192
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,880
Si Ming.

193
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,920
Lord.

194
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,920
I've found a good alcohol lately.

195
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
No wonder you're so happy.

196
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,360
What's this?

197
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,400
A design draft of a weapon for someone.

198
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,440
How crazy the designer is

199
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,240
to design

200
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,800
something so insane?

201
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,480
It's Third Prince who

202
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,960
wants to celebrate your birthday.

203
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,320
His Majesty was obviously protecting Ji Heng.

204
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,000
I had a conflict with Ji Heng.

205
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
But His Majesty chose to help her instead of me,

206
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,220
and snapped at me

207
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,620
indiscriminately.

208
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,200
I should have curled up far away.

209
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,040
But maybe at night His Majesty

210
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,400
will realize that he wronged me in the day

211
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
and come apologize to me.

212
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
What if he can't find me?

213
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
I'd better curl up a little closer.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
Let's see if His Majesty is still here.

215
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,640
Has he ever come looking for me?

216
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,520
Why is Ji Heng in his room?

217
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,720
The long sword is kept as an iron box here.

218
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,310
And there are some needles in the box

219
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,960
to be used as hidden weapons.

220
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,480
Third Prince's design is very perfect.

221
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,480
But I've been trying to figure out

222
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
what the two ending places are for.

223
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,360
Teacher.

224
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,080
What is it?

225
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,520
I mean could you please stop your pen for a while

226
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
and give me some enlightenment.

227
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,560
You just need to copy the picture

228
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
from Third Prince.

229
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,280
But you can't even do the simple things well.

230
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,680
Looks like

231
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm better than Ji Heng in this regard.

232
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,000
This is the only thing that I can do better than her.

233
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
But she takes it from me.

234
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
She can't even do the simple things well.

235
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,400
If His Majesty finds out,

236
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,960
I wonder if he will mock her with some harsh words.

237
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,680
This is a valve.

238
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,480
The sword will withdraw when the iron sheet is pushed aside.

239
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,080
Lian Song drew it too simple.

240
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,760
You got it?

241
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,280
Got it.

242
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,280
On those two places,

243
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
although Lian Song also drew simply,

244
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
the revision you did was good enough.

245
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,440
Actually these two places are less difficult than those two.

246
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,520
At noon,

247
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,680
the two places...

248
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
Perhaps it's my luck.

249
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,120
I used to

250
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
study alone.

251
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,160
I only know a little.

252
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,560
But I've learnt so much tonight from teacher,
more than what I already know.

253
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,960
It's getting late.

254
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,920
I want to finish the drawing.

255
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,840
Teacher,

256
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
if I can finish the drawing,

257
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,320
can you give me the screen

258
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,360
as a prize?

259
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,600
Okay.

260
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,440
If you're tired,

261
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,400
go back and rest.

262
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,200
You can finish it tomorrow.

263
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,360
But

264
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
it will slow down your process.

265
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,320
And I was thinking about

266
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,040
finishing the drawing

267
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,880
and getting my reward.

268
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,440
One day is not a big deal.

269
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,360
As for the screen,

270
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,120
I will have Chong Lin deliver to you when it's done.

271
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,520
I remember when I did something stupid

272
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
or when Chong Lin did something

273
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,600
that His Majesty was not satisfied with,

274
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
he tended to

275
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
hurt our feelings.

276
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
But he doesn't hurt Ji Heng's feelings.

277
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,040
He is so kind to Ji Heng.

278
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,240
I didn't know His Majesty could be someone
who satisfies other's request.

279
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,560
It's just that he never does that to me.

280
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,880
I heard that His Majesty never paints for anyone easily.

281
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,760
He is so nice to you, my princess.

282
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm indebted to His Majesty.

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Sooner or later, I will have to pay it back.

284
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Teacher,

285
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,360
if we pulverize the crimson stone

286
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,760
and mix it with porcelain clay,

287
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,320
the flask could have the color of

288
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,800
beautiful sunset red.

289
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,040
Ji Heng thinks so differently.

290
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,320
If I were her,

291
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,720
the best I could say is

292
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,640
'it can sell a good price.'

293
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,600
Never mind.

294
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,200
I'd better not stay here.

295
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,680
It upsets me watching you while I can do nothing.

296
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,320
My feet fell asleep.

297
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,560
Little fox.

298
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,240
Little fox.

299
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,120
It's so adorable.

300
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,080
Little fox.

301
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,520
You don't fight back anymore.

302
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,120
Do you recall who I am?

303
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,360
In Ten-evil Lotus Land,

304
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,000
you liked me so much.

305
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,360
You were even reluctant to part with me.

306
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
Maybe you feel the same way towards His Majesty.

307
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,920
But now

308
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,240
me and His Majesty can raise you together.

309
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,600
Are you happy?

310
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,840
Right.

311
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,320
Little fox, look.

312
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,720
This is a rice bowl

313
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520
I and His Majesty specially made for you.

314
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,880
I've been thinking about

315
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,600
creating a pattern

316
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,160
as your exclusive mark.

317
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,000
And it occurred to me just now that

318
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,320
your claws

319
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,520
may be the best.

320
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,000
Why on earth did I transform into a fox

321
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,560
at His Majesty's side?

322
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,760
I've worked so hard for so long.

323
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,440
But I've only made it

324
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,520
to the position of a pet.

325
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,760
I am so useless.

326
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,520
I used to be the most popular fairy

327
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,280
in Qingqiu Kingdom.

328
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,600
Perhaps the hierarchical Sky Kingdom

329
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,240
thinks that we are not followers of

330
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,040
traditional etiquette.

331
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,720
But

332
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I don't eat in a bowl

333
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
or sleep in a pet nest.

334
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,920
I just want to get close to it.

335
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
It doesn't like me?

336
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,840
It used to like me a lot.

337
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,480
Your Majesty.

338
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,640
It's been naughty lately.

339
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
Lock it up for a while.

340
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,040
Yes.

341
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,520
Your Majesty,

342
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
you said it's naughty.

343
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,400
Did you say it to me?

344
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,200
And that's all?

345
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
His Majesty ordered to lock you up.

346
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,520
And I don't know where he wants to lock you

347
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,840
or until when.

348
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,720
You were making a big scene there just now.

349
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,000
I thought it was not a good time to ask.

350
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
Come to my place.

351
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,800
Little fox.

352
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,280
You still don't want to eat?

353
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Did I mention it to you that

354
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,440
Princess Ji Heng was born to be

355
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
afraid of bleeding.

356
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,840
Princess Ji Heng is weak.

357
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,360
Even if she suffers only a minor injury,

358
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,600
the wound will bleed out a lot.

359
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,720
Let alone getting

360
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,080
such a good scratch by your claws.

361
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
It got her injured badly.

362
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,040
She finally recovered

363
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,080
after taking some magic medicine.

364
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,080
That was nerve-racking.

365
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,440
Now

366
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,760
His Majesty is too busy to think about you.

367
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I will let you out for a bit.

368
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,640
You can go enjoy the sunshine.

369
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
But remember to

370
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,320
keep away from His Majesty.

371
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,440
Don't let him see you.

372
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Or I'll be accused of not carrying out my duty.

373
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,920
I know.

374
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Exotic animals like snow lions only eat Lucid Ganoderma.

375
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,400
How could you feed it with Lucid Ganoderma?

376
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,920
Even I...

377
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Even I have never got to taste it before.

378
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
It always has been my privilege.

379
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,240
This is what you will do to me
when I'm trying to catch your attention.

380
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,720
You are His Majesty's favorite spirit animal

381
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,840
in Tai Chen Palace.

382
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,080
I heard those fairy maids gossiping that

383
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,200
His Majesty likes you a lot.

384
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,960
I thought you were a rarely seen fox.

385
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,080
But you turn out to be so ordinary.

386
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,760
I never thought that

387
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,600
I would end up

388
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,320
competing with a snow lion for favor.

389
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,480
Why are you walking so fast?

390
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,760
What?

391
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,720
You are mutinous about it?

392
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,080
Rumor has it that you are arrogant and all

393
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,200
just because His Majesty dotes on you.

394
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,280
How dare you

395
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,840
hurt my mater Princess Ji Heng?

396
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
My master is so kind and forgiving.

397
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,920
Consider yourself unlucky to meet me today.

398
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
What they say is true.

399
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,600
you can't talk.

400
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,900
Big fish. It must be a big fish.

401
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,560
Here we go.

402
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,480
Your Highness.

403
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,480
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

404
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,640
Your Highness. Your Highness.

405
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,640
Si Ming.

406
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,960
Look what I got for you?

407
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,880
Thank you. You're welcome.

408
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,480
I asked you for medicine
and you came all the way to deliver it to me.

409
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,560
It's not a big deal.

410
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
The effect will be halved if you add so much sugar.

411
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Si Ming.

412
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,080
You owed so much to others

413
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,280
for asking for all these magic medicine.

414
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
Which fairy it is that

415
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,960
you are cooking the medicine for?

416
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,720
Terrible fate.

417
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,280
It's all because of the terrible fate.

418
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,080
I've spent some days in Si Ming's mansion.

419
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm born to fear bitterness.

420
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm surprised that Si Ming remembers it.

421
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,400
I want to ask you something with sincerity.

422
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
How exactly did you end up

423
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,760
getting yourself in this situation

424
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
as an experienced princess?

425
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,160
Goddess of the Empyrean.

426
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,040
Princess of Qingqiu.

427
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
The obsession that I have has been going on for over 2000 years.

428
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,280
Is it time to give it up now?

429
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,360
My deputies, what suggestions do you have?

430
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,840
Father,

431
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,240
the empress's ceremony should be planned carefully.

432
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,320
And this time,

433
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,880
the divinity of the gods must be shown.

434
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,840
Your Majesty,

435
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,760
Demon King Xu Yang is so evil-intended

436
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,880
to propose a sudden marriage.

437
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,880
It might be their trick to stall for time.

438
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,320
How can the demons play against us

439
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,920
with their current power?

440
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,680
Third Prince, you and I both

441
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,840
fought in the previous war.

442
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,800
You should know
that the demons are quite a force to be reckoned with.

443
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Your Majesty, what do you think?

444
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,480
Sacrifice to heaven

445
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,560
will be held two days later.

446
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Take care, Your Majesty.

447
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,520
You can stop looking.

448
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,160
No one is looking for you.

449
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,960
Seems like they don't know that you went missing.

450
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,440
I got nothing to do anyway.

451
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,200
So I went to Yi Shi San Heaven to ask about you.

452
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,760
They said you were locked away by His Majesty

453
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,840
for hurting the princess of the demons.

454
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,140
Did you get hurt by the princess

455
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,100
for revenge?

456
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,600
His Majesty is getting married two days later.

457
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,560
He is marrying the princess of the demons.

458
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,240
What are you going to do?

459
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,760
I know they are getting married.

460
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,120
But I didn't expect it to be so soon.

461
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
Do you want to go back to Qingqiu?

462
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,800
It's definitely not easy to hold on to

463
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,840
the obsession for over 2000 years.

464
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,840
There's no one

465
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
around His Majesty before.

466
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,200
It's kind of a beautiful and stubborn affection

467
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,600
that you have for him.

468
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,600
But now he is becoming other's husband.

469
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,200
If you keep on doing this,

470
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,360
the affection will become

471
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,840
a torment.

472
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,040
If you get yourself into it deeper and deeper,

473
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,920
your life will somehow become a misery.

474
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,160
Life is long for you.

475
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,120
You don't want to live in a misery, do you?

476
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,680
No women in Qingqiu can bear to

477
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,320
to lose their dignity like that.

478
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,840
Do you want to see him for one last time?

479
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
Wait. I know what to do.

480
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,160
This is my pavilion.

481
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,320
Teacher.

482
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
Suo Ying seems hungry.

483
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,200
Although it's not time for the meal yet,

484
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,360
can we feed it with Lucid Ganoderma first?

485
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,160
Handsome host.

486
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,920
Beautiful hostess.

487
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,120
And their beloved spiritual pet

488
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,640
that understands human language.

489
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,440
The scene is so picturesque

490
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,320
and harmonious.

491
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,640
Shall we leave?

492
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,280
The long sword in His Majesty's hand

493
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,520
must be the present

494
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,640
Third Prince made for Cheng Yu's birthday.

495
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,360
He is using Foling Flowers

496
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,640
to test the weight and speed of the sword.

497
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,640
If it's too heavy

498
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
or too slow,

499
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,720
the wind brought by the sword will

500
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,160
blow down Foling Flowers.

501
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,240

Everything is going to be alright.
