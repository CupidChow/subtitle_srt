00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 37

3
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,780
Lord Xi Ze,

4
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,780
how is Junuo doing?

5
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Her wounds have almost healed.

6
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,500
She'll be fully recovered in a few days.

7
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,980
That'd be great.

8
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,900
Your Highness, how are you feeling these days?

9
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,620
I've been staying in my palace,

10
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,420
so I'm a little bored.

11
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,820
Mother, it'll be

12
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,860
your birthday in a few days.

13
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,580
I should try my best

14
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,060
and prepare you a special gift,

15
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,860
but unexpectedly...

16
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,620
You silly girl.

17
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,180
Forget about the gift.

18
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,740
Let's go enjoy blooms in Guan Chen Palace.

19
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,740
It'll do good to your health.

20
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,420
Got it, mother.

21
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,380
Now that there is nothing else, I'm leaving.

22
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,940
Lord Xi Ze.

23
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,420
What's up?

24
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,860
Lord Xi Ze,

25
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,780
I hope you can

26
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,140
come to my mother's birthday banquet.

27
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,380
Shall I also go to the banquet?

28
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,500
Sure.

29
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,660
We've sent an invitation to your palace.

30
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,660
Besides, Junuo is still recovering.

31
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,860
You're worried about her, right?

32
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,300
I'll try my best to cure her.

33
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,500
Aranya will go there too.

34
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,580
Actually,

35
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,660
I'm envious that

36
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
she married you.

37
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,140
She is of humble origin

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,300
and you're noble.

39
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,540
She doesn't deserve you.

40
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,500
Your Highness,

41
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,380
it's improper for us to have a private talk here.

42
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,500
Please go back.

43
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,740
Chacha.

44
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,780
Your Highness.

45
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,820
Pack this up.

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,740
And this.

47
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,820
Oh. Go to the fair later

48
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,020
and get me some foundation makeup.

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,180
I prefer a light shade to a dark one.

50
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,300
Oh.

51
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,580
Also get me some cakes.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,820
And...

53
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,820
Get me

54
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,100
some plain clothes.

55
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,980
These are all red.

56
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,300
It's too eye-catching.

57
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,340
But Your Highness,

58
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,060
red is your favorite color.

59
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,140
It used to,

60
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,060
but things have changed.

61
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,220
I liked red,

62
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,940
but I like other colors.

63
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
But Your Highness,

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,900
we'll have so much luggage.

65
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,380
Prince Qing will also occupy a lot of space.

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,100
I wonder if there is enough room for us

67
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,780
on the ship.

68
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,740
What did you say?

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,780
Qing will also go there?

70
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,580
Your Highness, don't you know that?

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,460
Someone was sent here in the afternoon

72
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,780
and told us His Majesty has showed mercy

73
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,180
and allowed you to take Prince Qing with you

74
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,220
now that the two of you have cared about each other so much

75
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,500
since your childhood,

76
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,260
which is quite moving.

77
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,420
A painted pleasure boat has been prepared for Prince Qing

78
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,180
so that you can eat and sleep with him.

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,380
Your Highness, what's up?

80
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,220
Are you too happy to speak?

81
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,700
Your Excellency, please follow me.

82
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,020
Let's drink more.

83
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,740
Okay.

84
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,220
Take a seat please.

85
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,740
What are you doing?

86
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,020
His Majesty just allowed

87
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,620
Prince Qing to come to the banquet.

88
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,780
I didn't have time to tell Her Highness about it.

89
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,500
And I can't find her at the moment,

90
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,660
so I have to take him here.

91
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,140
Aranya sits here?

92
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,220
Yes.

93
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,100
I see.

94
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,180
You can leave.

95
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,860
Got it, Your Excellency.

96
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,420
Xiaobai.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,140
Xiaobai.

98
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,740
Look.

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,580
Those two girls are your sisters.

100
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,980
The first one is Junuo.

101
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,220
The girl in purple beside her is Changdi.

102
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,540
It's the first time I've seen them.

103
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,300
They're fair-skinned and good-looking.

104
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,260
Right ahead

105
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,460
are your father and mother.

106
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,420
Madame Qing Hua is pretty.

107
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,580
She's your natural mother,

108
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
but she abandoned you as soon as you were born.

109
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,820
In your mind,

110
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,340
she's the ugliest and scariest person.

111
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,340
Okay.

112
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,700
She's cruel to Aranya. I see.

113
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,460
Don't be angry.

114
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,060
Let's go.

115
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,820
Wait.

116
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,100
Why is he there?

117
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,900
This way please.

118
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,180
I don't know.

119
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:10,860
No way.

120
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,900
I won't stay wherever he is.

121
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,140
I won't go there. You go on behalf of me.

122
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,780
No way.

123
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,540
You can't be absent

124
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,580
from Aranya's mother's birthday banquet.

125
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,820
But I'll give the game away

126
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,940
if he is there.

127
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,060
Then everyone will know

128
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,180
I'm a fake.

129
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,980
How about me staying at your room?

130
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,820
You go on behalf of me.

131
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,900
Go. Hurry.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,820
Xiaobai.

133
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,220
Your Excellency.

134
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,180
What's up?

135
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,620
Nothing. Go ahead.

136
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,340
Lord Xi Ze,

137
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,060
the banquet is going to start.

138
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,100
Let's go in.

139
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,340
Okay.

140
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Lord Xi Ze.

141
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,660
Do you know where Aranya is?

142
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,620
It's Moye that's sitting there.

143
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,260
Aranya doesn't feel well.

144
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,860
She must be too tired after the long journey by ship.

145
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,340
She'll be back soon.

146
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,020
It's unbelievable that Aranya would be seasick.

147
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,340
Lord Xi Ze,

148
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,380
I know

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,380
you came here to treat Junuo,

150
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,180
but as a couple,

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,220
you and Aranya should have a talk

152
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,940
now that you haven't seen each other for a long time.

153
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,780
Lord Xi Ze?

154
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm Su Moye.

155
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,860
It turns out you're Mr. Su.

156
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,340
How is it going? Anything went wrong?

157
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,340
Did anyone ask about me?

158
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,300
Yeah.

159
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,740
Everyone is asking about you.

160
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,980
Your sisters, your mother

161
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,740
and your husband.

162
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,700
Oh.

163
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,900
There is something I don't understand.

164
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,060
Go ahead.

165
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,900
Aranya's just reached an adult age.

166
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,860
Why does she have a husband?

167
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,140
Do you mean Lord Xi Ze?

168
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,940
He can't be taken lightly.

169
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,380
Really? Give me more details.

170
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,940
In Fanyin Valley, there is Qi Nan Palace,

171
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,740
which is governed by the Archmage.

172
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,420
Anomalies would happen

173
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,260
when an archmage chosen by heaven is born.

174
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,380
Archmages don't intervene in political affairs at ordinary times,

175
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,780
but once the emperor misconducts himself,

176
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,420
they'll go to heaven

177
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,620
and suggest deposing him

178
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,860
to guarantee a long period of stability in Fanyin Valley.

179
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,500
In other words,

180
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,660
the Archmage acts

181
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,540
as a supervisor of the emperor in the valley

182
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,940
and reports to heaven.

183
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,700
All archmages

184
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,460
are the ones an emperor wants to rope in

185
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,460
after he succeeds the throne.

186
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,260
The current archmage is Shen Ye.

187
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,780
His predecessor is Xi Ze.

188
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,620
That's why Xiangli Que

189
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,660
let Aranya marry Xi Ze when she was very young.

190
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,420
What happened later?

191
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,380
Actually, Xiangli Que tried to use Aranya

192
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,820
as a pawn to control Xi Ze.

193
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,460
Luckily, she was too young at that time.

194
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,620
And they didn't live together although they got married.

195
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,740
Two years later,

196
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,100
Xi Ze quit as the archmage

197
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,020
and began to live in solitude in the Qi Nan Mountain

198
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,300
because of severe illness.

199
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,660
Shen Ye became his successor.

200
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,340
After getting retired,

201
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,100
Xi Ze didn't seem to be interested in Aranya,

202
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,420
and they didn't live together,

203
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,460
so nobody mentioned the marriage anymore

204
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,060
as if it had never happened.

205
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,820
Aranya was his wife,

206
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,420
but he had never come out of the mountain

207
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,340
for her till her death.

208
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,020
That's why

209
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,020
I didn't mention it.

210
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,460
I didn't expect it'd confuse you today.

211
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,860
I should've been more thoughtful.

212
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,300
It's just...

213
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,980
Just what?

214
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,300
Nothing.

215
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,180
But I wonder

216
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,100
why we had a chance to see Xi Ze

217
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,180
come out of the mountain in the dream world.

218
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,820
I've never seen him before.

219
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,860
It's the first time I saw him.

220
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
I think he came out of the mountain

221
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,420
to treat Junuo.

222
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,780
Yes.

223
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,180
I've heard

224
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,660
Junuo was injured

225
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
when she had a horse race with Aranya.

226
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,580
Alright.

227
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,620
Forget about that.

228
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,140
Go to bed early.

229
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,580
No. No.

230
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,740
I can't go back to that boat.

231
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,900
Qing will swallow me alive.

232
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,380
I...

233
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,060
I...

234
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,100
The moon is bright and the view is great.

235
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,540
Let me stay here

236
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,300
and enjoy it longer.

237
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,220
Alright.

238
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:28,980
You...

239
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,060
Emperor Dong Hua will protect Fengjiu,

240
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,380
but unexpected changes may happen anytime

241
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,020
now that they're in the Dream of Aranya.

242
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,940
Once you get there, the first thing is to find them.

243
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,340
Is it possible that Xi Ze is actually Emperor Dong Hua?

244
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,060
If Dong Hua aims to use Xi Ze's identity,

245
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,700
he just needs to practice Correction Magic

246
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,540
to change

247
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,740
the inseparable king birds' memories of Xi Ze.

248
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,700
It's just a piece of cake for him.

249
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,620
Correction Magic is a simple trick,

250
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,180
so it does no harm to the dream world.

251
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,860
To finish the play,

252
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,620
he'd rather use Correction Magic

253
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,820
than disguise himself as Xi Ze.

254
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,100
It's Dong Hua's style.

255
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,580
Fengjiu must have been seriously injured,

256
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,260
so he had to get her primordial spirit
out of her body to recuperate.

257
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,500
As for the recuperation of primordial spirit,

258
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,580
all deities with excellent magic arts

259
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
know that it'd better

260
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,940
put it in a pregnant woman's womb.

261
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,260
Does Dong Hua think

262
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,860
Fengjiu's primordial spirit entered Junuo's womb?

263
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,340
In this case, it explains

264
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,380
why Dong Hua

265
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,140
cared about Junuo so much.

266
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,980
He didn't expect an accident happened to Fengjiu.

267
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,180
Her primordial spirit

268
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,220
entered Aranya's body.

269
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,220
It's much fun.

270
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,140
Now that Fengjiu is the only one

271
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,420
that could help me solve the mystery of Aranya's death,

272
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,100
I have to hide their true identities

273
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,300
from each other for the time being.

274
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
Bilianchun Tea

275
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,740
tastes best when it's heated up

276
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,300
till the fragrance of lotuses appears.

277
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,860
Aranya,

278
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,300
have a taste.

279
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,420
Is it familiar to you?

280
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,260
Nuo, you didn't eat much at the banquet

281
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,660
and you threw up.

282
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,300
Lord Xi Ze baked sweet potatoes for you.

283
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,340
Would you like to eat some?

284
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
I thought Lord Xi Ze

285
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,580
knew nothing about cooking

286
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,020
just like other noblemen.

287
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,540
I didn't expect he's good at baking sweet potatoes.

288
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,460
Lord Xi Ze has been living in solitude in the Qi Nan Mountain.

289
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,540
He hates to be bothered

290
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,060
and has never hired any servant.

291
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,420
Of course he's skilled at such things.

292
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm afraid you're the only one

293
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,180
who knows such details about Lord Xi Ze.

294
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,540
As far as I know,

295
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,700
Lord Xi Ze has been here for ten days,

296
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,020
but he's never gone to see Aranya.

297
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,900
It means what people said is true.

298
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,940
He doesn't care about Aranya at all.

299
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,900
It's improper to say that.

300
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,860
Don't talk nonsense.

301
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,180
You may get into trouble if someone hears it.

302
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,580
Nuo,

303
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,460
Aranya thought

304
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,460
she became somebody

305
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,140
now that father allowed her to come here with us.

306
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,060
But she even didn't dare to come to the banquet.

307
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,180
She's really a dirty thing raised by a snake.

308
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,860
I don't understand

309
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,660
why Lord Xi Ze doesn't divorce her

310
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,860
now that he doesn't care about her.

311
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,860
Isn't he afraid of her demeaning himself?

312
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,020
Why are you here?

313
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,300
You eavesdropped on us.

314
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,540
What's wrong?

315
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,620
It's a nice evening.

316
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,140
I got some air in the stern

317
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,260
and encountered you by accident. Okay?

318
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:38,860
You...

319
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,300
Aranya,

320
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,540
I haven't seen you for a long time.

321
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,500
Yeah. It's been a long time.

322
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,860
As my sisters,

323
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,740
you thought of some evil plan about my husband,

324
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,340
saying something disgusting

325
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,740
and doing something shameless.

326
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,060
Aren't you afraid of being heard?

327
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,460
Aranya,

328
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,300
don't forget

329
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,260
you didn't deserve Lord Xi Ze in the beginning.

330
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,020
Seeing Lord Xi Ze cares about Junuo,

331
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,940
you're jealous.

332
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,420
But with your status and identity,

333
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,980
you don't have the right to envy her.

334
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,500
If I remember right,

335
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,060
it's the same case for us two.

336
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,780
We have the same father and mother.

337
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,820
There is no difference between us.

338
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,700
How could it be the same?

339
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
You're a bastard

340
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,660
raised in a snake pit.

341
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,180
With such words,

342
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,460
you showed no respect to father and mother.

343
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,340
I was brought up by a snake.

344
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,420
How about you?

345
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,260
Are you acting so shamelessly

346
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,340
just because you were raised by our parents?

347
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,620
Aranya, you...

348
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,300
As Lord Xi Ze said,

349
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,980
it's time to feel my pulse.

350
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,340
Let's go back.

351
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,580
There is no need to quarrel with her.

352
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,140
It'd just demean you.

353
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,940
The wind is strong here.

354
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,140
I have a headache.

355
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Let's go.

356
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,060
The two of them are just so so.

357
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,180
Aranya,

358
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,660
I helped you take revenge.

359
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,860
Your Highness.

360
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,140
Your Highness.

361
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,740
Damn. I forgot.

362
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,300
Chacha must want me to stay with Qing.

363
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,140
I have to go to Moye.

364
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,300
Moye.

365
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,220
Moye.

366
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,420
Moye.

367
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,700
Moye.

368
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,180
A...

369
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,460
Aranya.

370
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,620
I'm not Aranya.

371
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,540
It's me, Fengjiu.

372
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,060
Aranya.

373
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,140
Wake up, Moye.

374
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,500
Fengjiu.

375
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,100
Princess Fengjiu.

376
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,580
Why are you here in my room?

377
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,380
What's the matter?

378
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,740
Did you forget?

379
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,940
I told you

380
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,500
I can't stay with Qing

381
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,060
in the same place.

382
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,540
How about me sleeping here?

383
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,140
I can make do with it.

384
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,380
No way.

385
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Stop kidding.

386
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,420
Absolutely no.

387
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,660
I don't care.

388
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,180
I have no choice. How about you going to keep Qing in company?

389
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,180
I'll sleep here.

390
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,420
Princess Fengjiu.

391
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,900
At this moment,

392
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,220
you're Aranya

393
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,700
and I'm your master.

394
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,620
Think about it.

395
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,980
Is it proper for you to do that?

396
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,860
What should I do?

397
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,180
I'm really scared at the mention of snakes.

398
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,220
I can't stay in the same room with him.

399
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,780
Do something about it.

400
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,180
Actually,

401
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,940
Qing is very gentle.

402
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,180
In his eyes,

403
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
you're his master

404
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,500
and his family.

405
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,140
He'll never hurt you.

406
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,380
Drop it.

407
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm scared anyway.

408
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,100
I see!

409
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,580
Have you got an idea?

410
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,260
Yes.

411
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,460
But

412
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,820
you need to suffer a little.

413
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,820
No problem.

414
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,260
Tell me about your idea.

415
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,180
Okay.

416
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,500
Turn around.

417
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,260
Junuo, look.

418
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,580
Look.

419
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,380
What's wrong, Your Highness?

420
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,220
Did you sleep well last night? Do you have a stiff neck?

421
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,420
Su Moye,

422
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,980
look at what you've done.

423
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,740
Prince Qing slithered around you

424
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,140
till midnight yesterday.

425
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,940
He didn't sleep

426
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,340
until the rooster crowed.

427
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,820
Anyway,

428
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,380
I've got through the first night.

429
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,060
But I can't let Moye do that again tonight.

430
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,780
He's skilled at doing that,

431
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,700
but I still feel dizzy and my neck hurts.

432
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,180
It's not a good idea in the long run.

433
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,020
His Majesty has been in your favor recently.

434
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,460
He even asked Lord Xi Ze

435
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,980
to spend more time with you last night.

436
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,740
All your sufferings will have their reward.

437
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,940
It's just...

438
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,060
Just what?

439
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,980
Lord Xi Ze didn't come over

440
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,300
to stay with you last night.

441
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,060
Your Highness, Her Highness Junuo asked you to go to her palace

442
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,020
for breakfast.

443
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,140
What? She invited Her Highness Aranya?

444
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,020
Is she so nice?

445
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,420
I see. You can leave.

446
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,260
Got it.

447
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,740
Your Highness,

448
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,060
Junuo and Changdi are always in the same camp.

449
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,940
They must be waiting to tease you.

450
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,020
Besides, her wounds haven't healed.

451
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,700
She must still be mad at you.

452
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,780
They just want to bully you.

453
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,260
Don't go there.

454
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,020
Don't worry.

455
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,940
I've been really bored these days.

456
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,380
Now that she invited me,

457
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,740
how could I refuse her?

458
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,180
Oh.

459
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,300
I asked you to get me some clothes the other day.

460
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,900
Take it to me.

461
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,340
I want to dress up.

462
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,980
Lord Xi Ze,

463
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,500
are her wounds healing properly?

464
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:49,940
Yeah.

465
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,020
She'll be fully recovered in a few days.

466
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,220
Lord Xi Ze,

467
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,860
did you see Aranya yesterday?

468
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,860
No.

469
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,060
She showed no respect to you.

470
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,820
We met her last night.

471
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,780
Really?

472
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,540
Where?

473
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,140
In the stern.

474
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,140
Well.

475
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,140
She's acting more and more boldly.

476
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:13,980
I...

477
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,380
Alright.

478
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,580
If there is nothing else,

479
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,740
I'm leaving.

480
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,940
Lord Xi Ze,

481
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,260
did you have breakfast?

482
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,620
It doesn't matter.

483
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,980
I'll go back for breakfast.

484
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I've prepared some porridge.

485
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,340
If it's okay,

486
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,140
how about us having breakfast together?

487
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,620
Okay.

488
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,420
Her Highness Aranya arrives.

489
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,980
It turns out he's Lord Xi Ze.

490
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,580
He's really handsome

491
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,820
and dashing.

492
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,380
It's a pity

493
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,180
he didn't love Aranya.

494
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,140
Let me show my respect to you, Junuo.

495
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,620
You're finally here. We've been waiting for you.

496
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,820
Take a seat.

497
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,140
Nuo, it's spacious here.

498
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,980
It's much larger than my palace.

499
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,340
That's for sure.

500
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,820
She's the Elder Princess.

501
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,260
Of course she deserves the best.

502
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,140
See?

503
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,660
She injured her arm.

504
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,620
Even Lord Xi Ze is burning with anxiety.

505
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,460
Changdi is really noisy.

506
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,740
The two of them should be ashamed of themselves

507
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,700
for getting so close

508
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,020
to their sister's husband.

509
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,420
Fine. Whatever.

510
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,940
I'll go to my master after the meal.

511
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,620
I'm hungry. Let's get started.

512
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,780
Aranya,

513
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,140
where did you sleep last night?

514
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,700
Why don't you answer me?

515
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,420
Why do I have to do that?

516
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,180
You...

517
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Aranya,

518
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,740
are you feeling upset

519
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,140
because Lord Xi Ze is here

520
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,780
to treat me?

521
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,140
How could I?

522
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,900
Just do as you like.

523
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,380
But...

524
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,460
But what?

525
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,180
But now that Lord Xi Ze is here

526
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,020
to treat you,

527
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,940
I'm afraid he won't be here again

528
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,820
once you're recovered.

529
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,700
So I wonder if you want to

530
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,180
get better as soon as possible or not.

531
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,940
What are you talking about?

532
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,460
Alright. I'm full.

533
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,300
Thanks for treating me. Bye.

534
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,300
You...

535
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,620
Oh. I almost forgot

536
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
my appointment with Moye.

537
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,380
We'll go for a blow and enjoy the view.

538
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,780
I'm leaving.

539
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,140
See you next time.

540
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Lord Xi Ze.

541
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,940
See you.

542
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
What's going on?

543
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,220
Aranya looks exactly like Xiaobai.

544
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,580
Is it possible

545
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,980
Xiaobai's primordial spirit is in her body?

546
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,540
But why did she look at me

547
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,740
as if she didn't know me at all?

548
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,260
It's boring to read after a nap in spring.

549
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,420
Why not drink tea by the handrail?

550
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,700
You came here in great haste.

551
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,180
Do you want to share tea with me?

552
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,740
Moye,

553
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,700
luckily I'm strong-willed.

554
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,460
I'm sure any other girl

555
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,420
would think it's hard

556
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,620
to refuse such a handsome gentleman.

557
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:56,780
It's hot.

558
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,260
Forget about it.

559
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,180
You're a person

560
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,660
of no taste.

561
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,900
Generally, people would just say,

562
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,940
"would you like some tea?"

563
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,260
What you said

564
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
is really interesting.

565
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,300
Did you often say that to Aranya?

566
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,940
How did she respond?

567
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,620
Well.

568
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
She usually

569
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,900
played a joke on me

570
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,100
before she hid and saw how I'd respond.

571
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,940
Play a joke? How?

572
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,100
She'd...

573
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,340
Why do I have to tell you?

574
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,020
You don't have to,

575
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,260
but I have to ask you a favor.

576
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,020
It couldn't be anything good.

577
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,260
Tell me about it.

578
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,460
Here is the story.

579
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,140
I heard we'll pull in to shore at Duanchang Mountain tonight.

580
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,460
I want to enjoy

581
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,140
Yueling flowers there,

582
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,980
but Qing keeps bothering me.

583
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,700
He'll be furious

584
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,020
if he fails to see me at night.

585
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,300
So I've figured out a way

586
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
to avoid him.

587
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,780
It's about Qing again.

588
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,700
Well.

589
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,060
You slept with him last night.

590
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,060
Why are you still afraid of him?

591
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,900
Speaking of that,

592
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,380
I have to get even with you.

593
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,500
What a bad idea it was!

594
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,140
You're really cold blooded.

595
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,060
My neck still hurts.

596
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,780
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

597
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,860
Well.

598
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,940
To avoid Qing,

599
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,900
you've given much thought to it.

600
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,860
I really can't deal with Qing.

601
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,580
If I can't get this issue solved,

602
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,060
I couldn't keep disguising myself as Aranya.

603
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,300
I'll help you.

604
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,340
Your Excellency.

605
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Did you see Princess Aranya?

606
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,180
I just saw her

607
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
going to the stern with Mr. Su.

608
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,380
Mr. Su?

609
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,260
Yes.

610
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,260
Luckily, Qing has poor eyesight.

611
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,660
He sees me through scent.

612
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,620
So on my way here,

613
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,460
I've thought of a good idea.

614
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,980
Give me the details.

615
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,140
We just need to let someone

616
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,380
put on my clothes

617
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,660
so that she smells like me.

618
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,660
Qing couldn't tell it's a fake.

619
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,020
Will you let whom do it?

620
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,900
I didn't have the heart to let anyone do it

621
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,660
now that Qing is really fierce.

622
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,500
But I know who is suitable for it now.

623
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,100
Changdi appeared at the right time.

624
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Changdi?

625
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:52,980
Right.

626
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,060
Let me tell you something.

627
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,940
As far as I can see,

628
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,820
Changdi has a crush on Xi Ze.

629
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,980
Really?

630
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,220
Sure.

631
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,780
If I write her a letter

632
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,180
in the name of Xi Ze

633
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,580
and ask her to meet me by the riverside tonight,

634
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,140
do you think she'll come?

635
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,380
Fengjiu,

636
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,460
what can I do to help you?

637
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,540
Moye, you look like Xi Ze in body shape.

638
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,780
How about

639
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,940
you disguising yourself as him

640
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,620
by using magic arts?

641
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,300
It must be easy for you.

642
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,340
I knew it.

643
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,260
It couldn't be anything good.

644
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,740
Look.

645
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,020
We can dig a hole by the bank

646
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,660
and get some water in it

647
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,420
before camouflaging it.

648
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,380
You just need to stand by the hole.

649
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,380
When Changdi gets close to you,

650
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,500
you'll be the only thing in her eyes.

651
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,540
She'll fall into the hole

652
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,860
as long as you dodge.

653
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,300
What are you laughing at? I haven't finished.

654
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,780
I'll make the boat lie alongshore nearby

655
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,660
and get everything ready.

656
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,860
Then you get her out of the hole and take her to the boat

657
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,060
so that she can take off wet clothes

658
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,460
and put on mine.

659
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,620
I've heard many times

660
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,220
that you're famous

661
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,180
for being mischievous

662
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,580
and you're good at playing the woman.

663
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,340
So you dare to do anything as a spoiled child.

664
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,460
I had doubts about all this,

665
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,700
but today,

666
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,340
I find you deserve your reputation.

667
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,180
I dare to do anything

668
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,580
because someone is behind me.

669
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,180
I always think it over before I make trouble.

670
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,980
How about this?

671
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,380
If we make it tonight,

672
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,700
I'll consider you my savior

673
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,300
and take you to enjoy Yueling flowers. Okay?

674
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,860
You're resolute.

675
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,380
But

676
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,020
there is one problem.

677
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,820
We shouldn't get Lord Xi Ze involved.

678
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,860
In my humble opinion,

679
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,060
Lord Xi Ze is not someone to be trifled with.

680
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,780
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble

681
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,620
when he knows about it.

682
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,340
Forget about it. No big deal.

683
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,500
I had a crush on you at the first sight.

684
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:27,060
I want to stay by your side till old age.

685
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,660
Well.

686
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,540
It was a good poem,

687
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,500
but it's not anymore

688
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
when you read it.

689
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,620
As for literary grace,

690
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,420
this poem is

691
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,220
unparalleled.

692
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,100
But as for the effect,

693
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,980
I don't think it'll be good enough.

694
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,180
What?

695
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,380
How about this?

696
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,220
I'll say

697
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,420
and you write.

698
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,660
Do as I say.

699
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,380
Write it down the way Xi Ze would do.

700
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:01,980
Hurry.

701
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,100
Since I got to know you,

702
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,500
I've had a strong admiration for you.

703
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,100
Each time I thought of you,

704
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,460
I was sleepless in bed.

705
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,540
My continuous feelings for you

706
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,700
couldn't be separated

707
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,660
by Duanchang Mountain or Sixing River.

708
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,380
Now that I've been staying with you these days,

709
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,540
I couldn't control myself anymore.

710
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,460
But there are too many people during the day,

711
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,340
so I hope I can see you in the evening

712
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,540
to relieve the pain of missing you.

713
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,300
That's why I'm writing this letter.

714
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,740
Today,

715
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,580
let's meet up

716
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,340
by Sixing River.

717
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,580
...meet up by Sixing River.

718
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,980
Lord Xi Ze.

719
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,540
Your Majesties.

720
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,140
This guy bears a similarity to me.

721
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,940
He must've practiced

722
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,500
the same kind of magic arts as me.

723
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,580
Father. Mother.

724
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't stand on ceremony.

725
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,540
I've got everything prepared.

726
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,100
Your Majesties, you must be tired after a long journey.

727
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,820
Please go have a good rest.

728
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,380
Shen Ye, thank you.

729
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,820
Your Majesty, please don't say that.

730
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,500
It's your birthday.

731
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,580
I should've kept you in company.

732
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,100
It's just I had a lot to deal with in Qi Nan Palace,

733
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,820
so I could only wait for you here with His Highness.

734
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Please forgive me.

735
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,860
Alright.

736
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,100
We're tired after the journey.

737
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,900
Let's have a good rest.

738
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,820
Shen Ye,

739
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,820
thanks for what you did.

740
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:26,980
It's okay.

741
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm going in.

742
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,740
Let's go dig a hole.

743
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,260
Go.

744
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,300
Go.

745
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,900
How about here?

746
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,580
Okay. You're good at it.

747
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,540
You do it.

748
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,500
Do what?

749
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,860
Dig a hole.

750
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,500
Do you want me to do that?

751
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,500
Okay.

752
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,180
Step aside.

753
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Amazing.

754
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,940
Sure!

755
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,180
When it gets darker,

756
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,020
it'll be more inconspicuous.

757
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,700
That'd be great.

758
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,740
Remember where it is.

759
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,380
I don't want to see you fall into it.

760
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,380
Got it, Your Highness.
