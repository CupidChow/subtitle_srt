00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 45

3
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,980
Put them all inside.

4
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,260
Chacha!

5
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,220
Your Highness!

6
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
What are you doing?

7
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,900
Your Excellency.

8
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,060
Why are you here?

9
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,300
I want to live with you.

10
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,660
Anything wrong?

11
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,100
Live here?

12
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,540
What about at night?

13
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,300
Of course, we will sleep together

14
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,340
as husband and wife.

15
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,740
No!

16
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,340
Why not?

17
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,500
Why didn't you consult with me

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,620
on such an important matter?

19
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,300
I said no and I meant it!

20
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,820
Chacha!

21
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,540
You wait here!

22
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,580
Ask them to take Lord Xi Ze's stuff

23
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
to the east side room.

24
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,020
That's where he's going to stay in future.

25
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,060
But what His Excellency said makes sense!

26
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,020
I also think

27
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,460
a couple should live in the same room.

28
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,140
- This is... - Well said!

29
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,900
However,

30
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,620
she is reserved.

31
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,740
Chacha,

32
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,260
go get a new bed and put it beside hers.

33
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,660
We will sleep in the same room but on separate beds.

34
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,340
That will do, won't it?

35
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,940
Yes!

36
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,940
Yes for what? Cha...

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,260
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,620
how can you be so unreasonable!

39
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,180
Am I?

40
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,780
The door is open!

41
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,860
Didn't you say

42
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,500
you just liked the feeling of falling in love with me

43
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,780
in the dream?

44
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,580
Your Excellency!

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,060
Your Excellency, are you going to visit Her Highness?

46
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,620
I want to apologize to her.

47
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,420
Follow me please!

48
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,660
Your Excellency!

49
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,620
Your Excellency, look!

50
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,980
What a coincidence!

51
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Lord Xi Ze just moved in Her Highness's bedroom.

52
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,620
It's not convenient now.

53
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,620
Please come some other day!

54
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,340
Why do you look extraordinarily beautiful today?

55
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,780
Are you not going back to the Qi Nan Palace?

56
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,980
Since Su Moye is there, I'm pretty assured.

57
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,220
I haven't seen him for ages.

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,540
How is he now?

59
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,380
You worried about me

60
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,220
and Shen Ye.

61
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,740
Now you're even worried about Su Moye.

62
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,860
Aren't you afraid that I'll become jea...

63
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,580
Fine! Fine!

64
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,180
I'll stop it!

65
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,380
The water lily in the yard looks pretty good today.

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,780
Would you come with me to enjoy it, honey?

67
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Don't call me that!

68
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,260
Anything wrong?

69
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,420
Honey!

70
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,580
Honey!

71
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,020
Honey!

72
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,100
Honey! Honey! Honey!

73
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,740
Enough of that!

74
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,460
OK. I'll go with you!

75
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,420
Let's go!

76
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,820
I've never seen such exuberant lotuses

77
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,340
in the Sky Kingdom or Qingqiu.

78
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,620
How about asking Chacha

79
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,580
to pick some for us?

80
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,460
No need to bother her!

81
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,180
Which one do you like?

82
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,860
That one!

83
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,340
You are so...

84
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,620
Wow! Water lily can be enjoyed like this?

85
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,940
This is awesome!

86
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,900
You abused your magic power again.

87
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,500
Do you like it?

88
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,460
The little fish are adorable!

89
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,500
Lord Shen Ye.

90
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm here to apologize to Your Highness Aranya.

91
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,540
I'm sorry that

92
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,460
I offended you verbally

93
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,780
because I drank too much the other day.

94
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,740
Never mind!

95
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,300
He came to you so late in the night.

96
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,060
He is really careless about avoiding any suspicion.

97
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,940
When you were painting

98
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
with Ji Heng in the room so late in the night,

99
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,500
did I say anything

100
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,540
while I curled up in the doorway?

101
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,140
I'm so sleepy.

102
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm going to sleep now!

103
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,740
Please enjoy the fish yourself.

104
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,940
Why are there so many changes in it?

105
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,740
Why is Xi Ze in the same room with her?

106
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,300
If she's not Aranya,

107
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,340
who on earth is she?

108
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,260
Are you going out?

109
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,220
I've stayed here for so many days.

110
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,180
I have to get back to the palace to check

111
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,420
how the magic instrument is now.

112
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,980
What magic instrument are you making?

113
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,820
One that can help us break this dream.

114
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,780
Will it really help?

115
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,820
You'll see when it's finished.

116
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,940
Fine!

117
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,980
What's in your hand?

118
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,460
It smells so good.

119
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,220
I made this soup for you in my spare time.

120
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,860
Delicious!

121
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,980
So delicious!

122
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,380
Best delicacy in this world!

123
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,900
You are perfunctory. And you didn't even try it.

124
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,820
Take it after you finish the magic instrument.

125
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,460
This soup is so good.

126
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,060
I cherish it.

127
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,900
Then finish it now before you leave.

128
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,740
I will!

129
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,460
Try it!

130
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,660
It must be good!

131
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,820
Here you are!

132
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,780
How is it?

133
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,060
Your Majesty,

134
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,340
you're finally back!

135
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,780
It's smooth

136
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,980
in general.

137
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,380
Now the base is done.

138
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,540
Thank you for staying here alone

139
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
to finish the mirror!

140
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,060
Not at all!

141
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,780
I shall try my best to fulfill your order.

142
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,260
Go back for a rest.

143
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,580
Leave the rest to me.

144
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,140
No, Your Majesty!

145
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,380
I will stay here with you.

146
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,580
The making of a magic instrument allows no carelessness.

147
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,820
Take a rest for some days and then come back.

148
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,260
What's wrong with you?

149
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,740
Are you still the most elegant

150
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,620
Second Prince Su of the West Sea?

151
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,300
Mr. Su,

152
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,220
did you break into any girl's room

153
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,780
last night

154
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,100
and get beaten out by her dad?

155
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,860
I've been making the magic instrument for His Majesty

156
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,140
day and night all these days.

157
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,740
What is this magic instrument

158
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,980
that has tortured you so badly?

159
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,940
It's nothing difficult

160
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,620
but just a bit tiring for me

161
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,220
to work on it alone.

162
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,700
I got it.

163
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,660
His Majesty has lived in my residence in the past few days.

164
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,020
He must have entrusted all the work to you,

165
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,540
hasn't he?

166
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,260
It's fine that you know it!

167
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,020
You know,

168
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,820
you let Chacha send

169
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,940
the so-called sugar foxes

170
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,260
at the most critical moment.

171
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,380
His Majesty left all the remaining work to me

172
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,020
without saying a word

173
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,540
as soon as he got that damn thing

174
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,060
and went straight off the mountain.

175
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,220
I didn't mean to blame you for it,

176
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,540
but you have to understand

177
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,540
that I become like this

178
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,500
all because I've been working around the clock

179
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,820
for seven to eight days,

180
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,500
which greatly depleted my magic power.

181
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,980
I can still stand here now

182
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,620
talking to you

183
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,420
because I've got a strong life.

184
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,500
Alright!

185
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,580
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

186
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,860
When he finishes the magic instrument,

187
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,180
he will surely repay you.

188
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:51,900
Repay me?

189
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,860
How?

190
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,820
Let me see!

191
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,380
Firstly,

192
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,140
you aren't short of jewelries.

193
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,780
Secondly, you don't like beauties.

194
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,500
I guess His Majesty will choose

195
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,700
a more friendly

196
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,220
and more precious way to repay you.

197
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,100
For example,

198
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,740
he may prepare a table of dishes in person

199
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,900
to entertain you.

200
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,180
He will cook for me in person?

201
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,020
Oh no!

202
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,060
If he can't think of repaying me,

203
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,380
do not remind him of it, alright?

204
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,820
Fine! Fine! Fine!

205
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,460
Let's keep it aside for now.

206
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,180
I came back today

207
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,140
to ask you something.

208
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,260
How is Shen Ye now?

209
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,500
Is there anything inappropriate

210
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,100
these days?

211
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,140
He didn't offend me

212
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,820
which should be considered appropriate.

213
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,380
Originally, he won't offend you in the first place.

214
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
That's how he treated Aranya before

215
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,860
and that's how he should treat you now.

216
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,980
However, he was drunk the other day

217
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,940
and talked to me deliriously.

218
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,700
Deliriously?

219
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,020
What did he say?

220
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,100
He said to me that...

221
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,020
we could have any type of relationship,

222
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,540
such as passerby,

223
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,700
personal enemy,

224
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
sworn enemy,

225
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,140
but just not possible for that.

226
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,220
Then he fell asleep as he talked.

227
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,780
I didn't get the answer from him.

228
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,700
He is supposed to remember it

229
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,700
and abide by it throughout his life.

230
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,140
This would be a blessing for Aranya.

231
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,140
However,

232
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,860
I heard Shen Ye took away three seasons

233
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,460
after Aranya died.

234
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,220
He surely loved her very much.

235
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,340
Everything happens for a reason.

236
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,820
His love

237
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
didn't just come out of nothing

238
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,460
after Aranya passed away.

239
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,740
You told me about the story

240
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,060
between them last time.

241
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,980
And it was half finished.

242
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,340
Could you finish the other half today?

243
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,620
I don't know much

244
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,180
about the other half.

245
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,820
I could recall only two of them.

246
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,220
After that,

247
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,700
Aranya led

248
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,780
quite an idle life.

249
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,660
Apart from practicing calligraphy and going to the opera,

250
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,060
she also taught archery for the masters on leave.

251
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,260
She came across Wen Tian once in a while

252
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,700
and would bring her back

253
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,100
to dine together.

254
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,300
I remember

255
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,140
she once brought Wen Tian back.

256
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,700
Wen Tian meticulously asked her

257
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,860
if she could meet Shen Ye in the Mengchun Courtyard

258
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,140
as she wanted to ask Shen Ye for a few chess techniques.

259
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,700
Aranya was so unrestrained.

260
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,300
She must have approved it.

261
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,460
Yes!

262
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,340
Her tolerance was the best

263
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,660
and she was the most unrestrained

264
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,260
that I've seen in my life.

265
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,380
Wen Tian came in and went out
of the Mengchun Courtyard very often since then

266
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,180
to play chess with Shen Ye.

267
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,980
It seemed that Wen Tian fell in love with Shen Ye,

268
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,460
while Shen Ye

269
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,980
also admired her.

270
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,220
Soon they lived in peace with each other,

271
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,780
but an accident happened right after that.

272
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,860
What was it?

273
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,620
It was related to Lord Xi Ze.

274
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,300
Your Highness!

275
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,780
Don't stand on ceremony.

276
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,340
The chief steward said

277
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,220
you needed a secret material for the sword.

278
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
It is the stone from the Qi Nan Mountain.

279
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,780
They didn't get the stone you need,

280
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,580
so you have to pick them in person.

281
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,300
I'll visit Xi Ze tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

282
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,340
Shall we go together?

283
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,740
Do you consider me as a bird

284
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,780
caged here and invite me out

285
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,860
out of mercy?

286
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,220
If you say so,

287
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,940
so be it!

288
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,460
Nobody is allowed to enter the Qi Nan Mountain
without His Majesty's consent,

289
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,900
but I'd love to have a look.

290
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,700
Could I come with you by then?

291
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,700
Sure you will go with me.

292
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,460
Not bad!

293
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,300
Wen Tian should come along,

294
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,860
in case we end up fighting with each other.

295
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,700
Let's go!

296
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,540
Your Highness, off we go for quarrying.

297
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,140
Sure!

298
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,940
There you came so quickly

299
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,460
and you have even brought me the cakes.

300
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,420
I heard you captured a Quanyin Beast.

301
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,260
Yes!

302
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,780
So I wrote you a letter

303
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
to ask you to come here to practice martial arts.

304
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,100
However, the Quanyin beast is very dangerous.

305
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,220
So

306
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,780
where is it now?

307
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,060
Follow me!

308
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,420
This Quanyin beast has been a disaster over the years.

309
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,380
I captured it with great efforts.

310
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,300
Among all the beasts,

311
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,100
it is the most agile.

312
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,380
It has no sense of physical pain,

313
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,060
which makes it most suitable for practicing martial arts.

314
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,740
If you could shoot it successfully,

315
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
there would be nothing you can't shoot in the Fanyin Valley.

316
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,740
I'd love to have a try.

317
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,020
You can't shoot it by aiming at it.

318
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,620
What you shot before were all slower than your arrows.

319
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
But the Quanyin beast

320
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,460
is always a few times faster than your arrow.

321
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,340
You'd better calculate the speed of your arrow

322
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,820
and that of its movement

323
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,380
to decide the deviation angle
that you need to consider while aiming.

324
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,380
Aranya, it's time for you to come out.

325
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,180
Not being able to shoot it in a short time is quite normal.

326
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,220
Don't get yourself swallowed by it because of fatigue.

327
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,940
Give me fifteen minutes.

328
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,700
I'll come out if I can't shoot it successfully.

329
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,260
Aranya!

330
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,900
Aranya!

331
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,420
Shen Ye.

332
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,900
You're more composed now in face of battles.

333
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,460
The Quanyin Beast is extremely fierce.

334
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,900
Why do you let Aranya

335
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,980
fight against it, master?

336
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,340
She shot it, didn't she?

337
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,860
Where were you when she was in danger?

338
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,420
She is your wife!

339
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,620
I was having cakes

340
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,100
and wasn't paying much attention.

341
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,340
Besides,

342
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,060
we just have a paper of marriage
but we are actually not a couple?

343
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,340
Neither me nor Aranya thought about it that way.

344
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,580
And you lent her a hand just now, right?

345
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,180
Wouldn't it be unnecessary

346
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,180
for me to have a hand in it?

347
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,540
If I hadn't helped her immediately,

348
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,620
her arm would have been bitten off by the Quanyin Beast.

349
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,500
It's alright

350
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,140
as she is safe now.

351
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,260
Take her off for some rest.

352
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,260
I'm going to prepare some food.

353
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,100
Don't you think my blood is dirty?

354
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,700
Why would you allow it to smudge your hand?

355
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,300
Behave yourself!

356
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,940
You have fallen in love with me, Shen Ye!

357
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,060
You fall in love with me!

358
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,620
Shen Ye!

359
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,020
Stay still!

360
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,620
I'm having a headache!

361
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,900
Give me a smile!

362
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,180
How presumptuous!

363
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,500
I guess nobody ever teased you

364
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,580
by pinching your chin like I did.

365
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,860
As Aranya was in danger in the Quanyin Beast's stone formation,

366
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,780
for the first time Shen Ye

367
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,860
revealed his affection to Aranya.

368
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,780
While you were narrating the first half,

369
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,900
I was really worried

370
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,580
whether Shen Ye really liked Aranya.

371
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,140
Now it came to the latter half,

372
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,500
I think

373
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
it's a pretty good ending.

374
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,420
It's not the ending yet.

375
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,820
A lot of things happened afterwards.

376
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,580
This was the only thing which could be considered good.

377
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,260
Well,

378
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,060
were Xi Ze and Aranya a couple at the time?

379
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,340
Yes!

380
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,300
But Lord Xi Ze wasn't so interested in love affairs.

381
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,940
The marriage was meaningless

382
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,020
to him.

383
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,860
Then why wouldn't Lord Xi Ze

384
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,420
let Aranya and Shen Ye be together?

385
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,300
Lord Xi Ze never proposed to divorce

386
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,060
over all those years

387
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,980
because he took pity on Aranya

388
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,260
for her identity as the princess.

389
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,060
She would lead a better life anyhow

390
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,620
in the name of his wife.

391
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,780
Besides,

392
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,980
even if they got divorced,

393
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,780
Shen Ye and Aranya

394
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,740
couldn't be together publicly.

395
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
In that sense,

396
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,780
Lord Xi Ze was really

397
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,340
a caring person of great loyalty.

398
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,540
What happened next?

399
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,220
What happened to Shen Ye and Aranya in the end?

400
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,300
After the day on the Qi Nan Mountain,

401
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,460
Shen Ye was trapped
in Aranya's residence for another two years.

402
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,340
But I have no idea about

403
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
what happened to them.

404
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,380
The West Sea happened to be in trouble,

405
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
so I had to get back.

406
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,940
I don't think it was a big deal.

407
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,060
You just didn't want to stay in the Fanyin Valley

408
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,900
and see Aranya and Shen Ye

409
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,500
be together every day.

410
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,100
You have seen that?

411
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,420
You can't forget about Aranya's death

412
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,260
and you sound very caring

413
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,260
when speaking of her affairs.

414
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,020
Moye,

415
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm not an idiot.

416
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,140
Aranya and Shen Ye

417
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,860
confessed to each other at the time.

418
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,060
Even if you had any feelings for Aranya,

419
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,620
you couldn't say anything

420
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,500
or do anything.

421
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,140
I just didn't expect

422
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,940
so many things happened afterwards.

423
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,020
What happened after that?

424
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,500
Two years later,

425
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,580
His Majesty Xiangli Que passed away because of illness.

426
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,260
Prince Xiangli He took the throne.

427
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,060
However,

428
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,060
in less than seven days,

429
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,700
the neighboring night owl clan

430
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,580
initiated attacks to them with the reason that

431
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,740
the inseparable king bird clan connived
with its people to hunt cross border.

432
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,220
Xiangli He led his soldiers to defend

433
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,700
and stopped the night owl clan by the Sixing River.

434
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,420
Xiangli He died in the battle

435
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,900
on August 17th.

436
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,140
Xiangli He didn't have any heir.

437
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,660
According to the succeeding sequence,

438
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,260
Aranya should take it over

439
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
as Junuo had been deprived of her titles at the time.

440
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,860
However, on August 19th,

441
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,820
Junuo in exile was taken back to succeed to the throne.

442
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,260
The next day,

443
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,180
Aranya hanged herself.

444
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,700
Hanged herself?

445
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,420
How was that possible?

446
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,460
I didn't know the details in it.

447
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,180
When I came back to the Fanyin Valley again,

448
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,180
many years had gone by.

449
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,220
Aranya's primordial spirit

450
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,060
had dissipated.

451
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,420
The royals claimed that she hanged herself.

452
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,380
Didn't anyone give you a reason

453
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,820
why she hanged herself?

454
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,220
I also heard

455
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,220
ever since Aranya passed away,

456
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,460
Junuo listed her name

457
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,380
as a taboo.

458
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,900
Do you know why?

459
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,140
It's true.

460
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,820
And I heard a kind of saying

461
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,420
that His Majesty was poisoned by Aranya

462
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,100
rather than dying of illness.

463
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,700
Do you believe it?

464
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,140
Why would Aranya poison His Majesty?

465
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,940
Even if it was true,

466
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,300
why wasn't she convicted

467
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,260
above board?

468
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,940
As an outsider,

469
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,460
you even have found out a lot of oddity in it,

470
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,580
haven't you?

471
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,740
But,

472
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,860
to the inseparable king bird clan,

473
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,900
hanging is indeed a good way

474
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,460
to dissipate one's primordial spirit.

475
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,620
That's why they dared to cheat me with it.

476
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,660
How about Shen Ye?

477
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,180
Shen Ye?

478
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,820
After the death of His Majesty,

479
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,220
he was taken back to the Qi Nan Palace again.

480
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,460
He didn't give a hand

481
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,860
while Aranya got arrested.

482
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,180
Instead, he submitted a memorial,

483
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,860
in which he pleaded to

484
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,380
hand over Aranya's case to the palace,

485
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,020
claiming that if Aranya committed a serious crime,

486
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,580
she should be reasonably executed by the palace.

487
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,860
That was impossible!

488
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,660
Didn't Shen Ye have feelings for Aranya?

489
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,500
Obviously, Shen Ye

490
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,780
should go to save Aranya against all odds.

491
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,980
Judging from that,

492
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
he was not sincere to Aranya.

493
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,220
I'm afraid his real purpose was to get back to the Qi Nan Palace.

494
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,980
Aranya's sincerity to Shen Ye

495
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,020
ended in vain after all.

496
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,540
It didn't make sense.

497
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,060
Didn't you say

498
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,140
Shen Ye lived in Aranya's residence for two more years?

499
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,660
It's easy to cheat a person for some time,

500
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,460
but not possible

501
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,740
for such a long time.

502
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,220
Do you think he could do that

503
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,660
given his personality?

504
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,860
If he really wanted to,

505
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,900
there was a chance.

506
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,260
But anyway,

507
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,420
Shen Ye didn't save Aranya.

508
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,500
On the contrary, he hit her when she was down.

509
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,860
That's outrageous

510
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,420
and so disappointing!

511
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Rumor has it that

512
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,820
Aranya hanged herself

513
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,500
on the day after

514
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,980
Shen Ye submitted the memorial.

515
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,540
Your Excellency!

516
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,860
Come in!

517
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,100
Eh...

518
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,980
Your Excellency, Her Majesty will arrive soon.

519
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,140
OK!

520
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,140
You go and inform Aranya of it!

521
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,420
Her Majesty said

522
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,100
she was coming to check out

523
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,060
Your Excellency's progress of sword forging.

524
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,300
How come?

525
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,500
It should have happened after half a year.

526
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,460
What did you say?

527
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,660
Nothing!

528
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,060
Guide Her Majesty to the sword forging room.

529
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,180
I'll be waiting there.

530
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,260
Yes!

531
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,380
Archmage,

532
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,700
how is it going with the sword?

533
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,780
I guessed Your Majesty came here

534
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,460
not just to check out

535
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,060
on the progress.

536
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,100
Surely nothing can be held back

537
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,500
from your eyes.

538
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,540
I haven't thanked you in person

539
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,340
when you saved Junuo

540
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,940
from the Lingshu Stage.

541
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,340
You don't need to thank me.

542
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,540
I knew

543
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,620
you did it not because

544
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,700
I am your auntie,

545
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,540
but that Junuo is the only offspring

546
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,540
from late emperor!

547
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,740
That's why you saved her.

548
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,380
Now that you knew it,

549
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,060
it becomes less necessary for you to thank me.

550
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,700
It's getting late. Please go back, Your Majesty!

551
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,460
Your Majesty!

552
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,140
Rise!

553
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,020
What do you want to know?

554
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,060
Who on earth is Aranya?

555
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,940
Why would she create this dream?

556
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,620
What is her purpose?

557
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,980
Why couldn't even the Emperor Dong Hua break it?

558
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,860
Aranya is my younger sister.

559
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,220
I remember she was soft and cute

560
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,300
when she was born.

561
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,420
I really liked her when I was young.

562
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,180
But...

563
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,860
she gradually became my nightmare.

564
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,180
Was she anybody bad?

565
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,660
No!

566
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
She was the one I'm envious of.

567
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,420
She lived carefreely

568
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,500
and died with vitality.

569
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,780
It was only because

570
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,780
she stood in my way to succeed to the throne!

571
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,300
Our mother thought of ways

572
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,140
to twist our destinies.

573
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,540
In the end,

574
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,060
we all got our retribution.

575
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,460
The Dream of Aranya is the retribution

576
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,500
for the inseparable king bird clan.

577
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,860
Retribution?

578
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,300
Jielu, you have never fallen in love,

579
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,580
so you won't understand the bitterness in it

580
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,460
or what one could sacrifice

581
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,140
for their love.

582
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
It all should have ended

583
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,500
in our generation.

584
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,060
But someone unexpectedly

585
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,300
sacrificed his lifetime of cultivation for Aranya.

586
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,980
I didn't get the love in my heart.

587
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,020
Neither did Aranya

588
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,020
nor did that man!

589
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,820
We searched back and forth for a whole life,

590
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,860
and ended up living in the dream.

591
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,380
Your Majesty, I don't understand it.

592
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,500
You don't need to.

593
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,100
In fact, the real Aranya

594
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,460
has dissipated long time ago.

595
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,900
What is left of her

596
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,180
is just our obsessiveness.

597
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,260
This man's cultivation is nowhere near

598
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,140
that of Emperor Dong Hua.

599
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,340
Emperor Dong Hua stayed in the dream

600
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,140
for the sake of the girl in there.

601
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,020
When the time comes,

602
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,220
nobody can stop him.

603
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,460
Spread my word now!

604
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,540
Summon your brother back!

605
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,420
My brother...

606
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,660
He also likes the girl?

607
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,660
How does he dare to compete against Emperor Dong Hua?

608
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,340
He just takes Xiaojiu as a real friend

609
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,940
and worries about her safety.

610
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Kid,

611
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,500
I really hope

612
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,140
the tragedy of the inseparable king bird clan

613
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,580
can be ended in our generation.

614
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,500
Your generation can have the happiness you want

615
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,820
and don't ruin the clan's future

616
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,220
for illusioned love.

617
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,060
I didn't make it.

618
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,100
Neither did Aranya.

619
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,220
Hope you can make it.

620
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,140
Your Majesty!

621
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,820
Off you go!

622
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,860
Summon your brother back!

623
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,300
Yes!

624
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,900
Your Majesty,

625
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,700
what happened to your mother in the end?

626
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,500
Did she regret?

627
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,340
Mother always left the best to me.

628
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,740
But she never knew

629
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,460
what I really wanted.

630
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,340
After knowing

631
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
the life-and-death romance of Aranya,

632
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,940
I decided to marry

633
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,100
an ordinary man.

634
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,620
We joined hands

635
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,340
to imprison my mother in the palace.

636
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,700
Right at the 20th year of her imprisonment,

637
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,940
she became mad.

638
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,580
Seldom did she speak.

639
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,340
Most of the time, she spoke of Aranya.

640
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,460
Now when I look back

641
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,740
after knowing all the truth,

642
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,180
I just think we were quite pathetic

643
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,140
as we were all manipulated

644
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,540
in the palace over those years.

645
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,340
I was pathetically in love.

646
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,580
Aranya was pathetically out of love.

647
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,220
But that man was still the most pathetic

648
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,780
as he loved Aranya so much

649
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,020
and did so much to stay with her.

650
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,860
In the end,

651
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,260
they were forever torn apart.

652
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,980
Do you regret, mother?

653
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,580
Emperor Dong Hua can surely

654
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,020
end the ward created by Shen Ye in the dream.

655
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,220
When he comes out,

656
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,580
the Fanyin Valley will come back to normal by itself.

657
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,620
The tragedy you created

658
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,540
can finally be brought to an end.

659
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,380
Junuo really said that

660
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,220
His Majesty was waiting for a chance?

661
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,340
I don't dare to cheat Your Highness.

662
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,820
There is less likely to be any issues in that case.

663
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,260
Take her back!

664
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,460
I'll stay here.

665
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,260
I will summon you if I need.

666
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,220
Yes!

667
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,700
The smart work and the wise worry.

668
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,180
When you act helplessly,

669
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,940
you'll be free from the burden of the worldly affairs.

670
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
You know I like to live freely,

671
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,740
but you left me here to keep up the situation.

672
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,020
Dong Hua, if you can feel it,

673
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,620
just stop indulging yourself in the romance.

674
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,780
Get out of the dream now, please!
