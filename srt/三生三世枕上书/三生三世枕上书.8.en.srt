1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 8

3
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,320
I have one more thing to report, Your Majesty!

4
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,360
The little fox has been missing since the day before yesterday.

5
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,720
You'll be solely in charge

6
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
of all the matters in Tai Chen Palace in the future.

7
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Stay in the Yi Shi San Heaven to look for it carefully.

8
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
Yes, Your Majesty!

9
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,600
Greetings to Your Majesty. What can I do for you?

10
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
Search the whole fairy mountain

11
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
for a completely red spiritual fox for me.

12
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I'll surely do my best to search for it.

13
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,040
God Zhe Yan,

14
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
what on earth do you want?

15
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm not here to calculate the interest with you.

16
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,000
But somebody is!

17
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
Damn you! You'd better remember me well.

18
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,920
Your Highness Fengjiu,

19
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,240
the three-year deadline for entertainment
hasn't become due yet.

20
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,520
Are you here to remind me that

21
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm the Demon Lord betrayed by the gods.

22
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,520
You clearly said to give me half of your cultivation,

23
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,920
but it lasted less than half a day.

24
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,440
Thanks to His Majesty's purification of the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

25
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,440
or we'll end up dying there together.

26
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,440
Yes!

27
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,390
I did promise to give you half of my cultivation,

28
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,070
but I didn't say how long it would be.

29
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,070
You promised to let me use it for three years.

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,070
You're almost as shameless

31
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,280
as Dong Hua.

32
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,920
Wait! Wait! Wait!

33
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,280
Why are the gods so shameless

34
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
and always bully us with manpower advantage?

35
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
You used Zhe Yan to wear me down first,

36
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,760
and then follow up the victory.

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,320
Speaking of shamelessness,

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,520
do you have any less of it

39
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,440
when you cheated me for my fur?

40
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
It was you who breached the agreement in the first place.

41
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,760
Now you second plan is to kill the Demon Lord, isn't it?

42
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,720
Fine!

43
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,240
Just do it!

44
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,450
You!

45
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,480
Demon Lord Nie, you took advantage of her misfortune first,

46
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,240
and then acted rudely in front of me.

47
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,440
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

48
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,440
But as you're regretful,

49
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
I'll forgive you for that.

50
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,920
I did breach the agreement.

51
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,840
If you refuse to obey that,

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
go to Qingqiu for a decisive battle with me.

53
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,960
I'll be waiting for you as always.

54
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,480
Let's wait and see!

55
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,720
I'm still cultivating the Miao Luo magic power right now.

56
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,240
When I find the soul-locking jade...

57
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,840
The revenge does make me feel much better.

58
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,560
God Zhe Yan,

59
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
why do you look upset instead?

60
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,720
Nie Chuyin is a bit strange.

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,240
He used a different magic power

62
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
from the last time when I met him.

63
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
That shameless jerk

64
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,240
was so argumentative after cheating on us.

65
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,480
He tried to put the charges on us!

66
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Don't be so credulous

67
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,200
toward others.

68
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,360
I can earn your faces back for you.

69
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,920
It is not a problem even if
you want to go to the Yi Shi San Heaven.

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,240
But you have to rely on yourself

71
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,360
to find the lost dignity!

72
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
Got that, God Zhe Yan!

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
As it always was,

74
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,320
your uncle and I are always your supporters.

75
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,480
I've let Li to stay beside the Fox King!

76
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
Remember to apologize when you get back!

77
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
As an elder sister,

78
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,800
how can I ask Li to intercede for me?!

79
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,960
Don't worry about that.

80
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,640
Ingratiating is something

81
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,640
she can easily do,

82
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,240
just as it is to you.

83
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,920
Let her stick to the Fox King.

84
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Only by doing so will you
have the chance to be exempted, right?

85
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Fa Luo! Luo!

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,760
Se Bai,

87
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,760
a musical instrument in Tai Chang.

88
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,160
It can produce beautiful music that travels several miles.

89
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Several miles...

90
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
The Yan's!

91
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,320
The Yan's scripture takes the standardized form of character as Luo.

92
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,600
It follows the pronunciation.

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Very good!

94
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,040
Greetings from Fengjiu, grandpa!

95
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,120
Sister Fengjiu!

96
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,160
Li, you recited it well today.

97
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Fengjiu,

98
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,000
you said it will take only several days

99
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,960
to travel to the fairy mountain.

100
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,960
Why are you back so late?

101
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,760
I...

102
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,240
On your knees!

103
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,160
You are the Princess of Qingqiu.

104
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,920
Even though you haven't followed the rite of Bingcang,

105
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,000
you should conduct yourself decently.

106
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,560
Grandpa, it's my fault.

107
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
Please don't be mad!

108
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
She is still too young!

109
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
Being playful makes sense.

110
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,360
However,

111
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,560
you should not have passed the throne to her so early.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
No! No!

113
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,080
Grandpa has his own reasons for that.

114
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,080
It was I who have been too playful!

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,360
Grandpa,

116
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,560
sister Fengjiu must have been too careless and got lost.

117
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,400
She is so pathetic!

118
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
Look how skinny she has become!

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,040
Grandpa, please forgive sister Fengjiu!

120
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
You're used to find supporters

121
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
ever since you're young.

122
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,920
Everyone in Qingqiu

123
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
is too tolerant to you

124
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
which turns you into an irresponsible troublemaker.

125
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,480
There is no trouble you dare not make.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Fengjiu,

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,400
you mother had quite a difficult time

128
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,800
when she gave birth to you.

129
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
Miao Luo hid the truth from the masses
and did a lot of bad things.

130
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,140
You mother had to fight for Qingqiu Mountain

131
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,640
with you in the belly.

132
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,040
She survived with great efforts.

133
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,440
In the end, Miao Luo was finally defeated by the Emperor

134
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
and got sealed.

135
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,900
Your birth was considered

136
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,800
to be a good omen in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
The catastrophe was over

138
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,760
and peaceful days started.

139
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
The Bais had a baby girl

140
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,440
with a red phoenix-feather-flower birthmark

141
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,760
on the forehead.

142
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
No respected god has ever missed

143
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,520
your first birthday party

144
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,520
or forgot to give you good wishes.

145
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,720
You grew up with plenty of love.

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Who is not exceptionally tolerant to you?

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Even I took you here from your father

148
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,080
and raised you in person.

149
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,560
If anything happens to you,

150
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,440
have you ever thought about your mother

151
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,240
or Qingqiu?

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Grandpa, please forgive me.

153
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,440
I'll surely bear your words in mind in the future

154
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,720
and be a qualified Princess of Qingqiu.

155
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,840
Grandpa, please don't be mad!

156
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,400
Grandpa!

157
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,920
Grandpa!

158
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,200
Alright! Rise!

159
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,920
Thank you, grandpa!

160
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,920
Then I'll take Li to pick loquats.

161
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,960
Let's not waste the time that

162
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
God Zhe Yan will spend with grandpa for proper business.

163
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,320
Fine!

164
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,640
Thank you, grandpa!

165
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,160
Let's go!

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,720
What does His Majesty mean?

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,640
A few lives have exchanged in a glimpse!

168
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,680
His Majesty's will is not for us to know.

169
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,960
It is probably for the search of some kind of treasures.

170
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,480
His Majesty has lost the bride on the day of marriage.

171
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,720
This is presumably for the search of the future Queen!

172
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,200
I also heard that

173
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
His Majesty has lost a favorite spiritual fox.

174
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,760
The Earth Immortals in earth realm

175
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,120
have got nothing for His Majesty in the search.

176
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,480
Maybe they are searching for the spiritual fox.

177
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,080
Which is more important between the fox and the bride?

178
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
Isn't that evident?

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Right! That's right!

180
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm just confused.

181
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,080
Take it slowly!

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,680
Be careful!

183
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,840
Your Highness!

184
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,280
Come on!

185
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,800
Here you are!

186
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
I suppose we'll get to Fanyin Valley

187
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,200
after climbing over this mountain.

188
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,840
Just call me Ji Heng in the future.

189
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm fine!

190
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,520
Maybe the Qiushui Cold Toxin breaks out again!

191
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,800
Come! Let me take you for recovery!

192
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,240
Go!

193
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,280
Stop it!

194
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Brother!

195
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
Brother!

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
Min Su, as the guard for the Princess,

197
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
you're negligent and disrespectful!

198
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,040
You let down the trust I have on you

199
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,000
over all those years.

200
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
Take him down!

201
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,200
Yes!

202
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,240
Hold it!

203
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
I did it all on my own.

204
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,520
This has nothing to do with him.

205
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,320
Do you know how severe the crime you committed?

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,080
Come with me back to the palace!

207
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm determined

208
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,240
not to return to the evil palace again!

209
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,960
The plan for the gods and demons are not for you to decide.

210
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,160
Guard!

211
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,320
Take them back to Chihong Hall!

212
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes!

213
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,920
Min Su!

214
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,730
Min Su!

215
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,320
Kill him!

216
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,070
Princess!

217
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,070
Princess!

218
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,240
Are you sure to do so for him?

219
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,440
Come back with me now!

220
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
You may kill me with your sword

221
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,520
than taking me back!

222
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
The demons are so ashamed of you.

223
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Do you think I won't take any actions on you?

224
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,360
The worst result is death

225
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,920
which is better than being manipulated by you.

226
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,600
Now that you're careless to your own life,

227
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,800
I'd do what I have to.

228
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,160
Demon Lord,

229
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,080
please let go of Princess Ji Heng.

230
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,160
What are you doing?

231
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,280
Let me answer

232
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
for all the crimes.

233
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
How can a small guard like you

234
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,080
answer for a big crime like this?

235
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,160
Get out of the way!

236
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
Get out!

237
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,480
Min Su!

238
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
Min Su!

239
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,120
Min Su!

240
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,440
Why are you doing this?

241
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,320
It's all because of me!

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
If it hasn't been me,

243
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,880
you won't be killing each other now

244
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,440
and can start it all over again.

245
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,720
It won't go back!

246
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,200
It will never go back without you.

247
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
Hold on!

248
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
I'm taking you to His Majesty.

249
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,480
- He surely will help us. - It's no use.

250
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,560
It's no use.

251
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm sorry...

252
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,360
that I can't protect the Princess

253
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,080
to the Fanyin Valley!

254
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,920
No!

255
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,440
You...

256
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,480
Don't you leave me alone!

257
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Don't come here!

258
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,240
Your Highness, don't waste your effort.

259
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,160
I have some words to say to you.

260
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,920
OK! OK!

261
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,760
I shouldn't have cheated on you.

262
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,560
No!

263
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm...

264
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm actually a girl.

265
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,080
No! That's not possible! How is that possible?

266
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,480
I'm an orphan since I was young.

267
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,840
In order to stay alive,

268
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,640
I have to dress up as a boy!

269
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,800
Fortunately, the Demon Lord took me in

270
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,080
and kept me as a guard for you.

271
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,120
I promised to send you to Fanyin Valley

272
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,880
and planned to tell you the truth there,

273
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,040
but I'm afraid that I can't wait till then.

274
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,680
No!

275
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,240
We will meet...

276
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,760
again...

277
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,840
- No! No! - in next life...

278
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Min Su!

279
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
Your Majesty!

280
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,920
Your Majesty!

281
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
The Princess...

282
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,960
The Princess is your biological sister.

283
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,240
Please don't get your eyes covered by something else.

284
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
She should be set free.

285
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,480
Your Majesty!

286
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,000
Min Su!

287
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,600
Min Su!

288
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,400
Min Su!

289
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,880
Don't leave me alone!

290
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,040
Please don't leave me alone!

291
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,080
Your Majesty, play with us, will you?

292
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,920
Really?

293
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,760
What are you doing?

294
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,080
Come! Hurry up!

295
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,920
You...

296
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,960
The moonlight is so bright at the bedside.

297
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,840
I toss and turn on bed.

298
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,400
To who?

299
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,600
Ji Heng?

300
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,120
You don't like writing since you were young.

301
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,000
Now you forget your identity

302
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,800
as a guard for Ji Heng!

303
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,480
What an idiot!

304
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,600
Tell me all about the actions

305
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,400
of Ji Heng's personal guard, Min Su, in the future.

306
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,680
Tell me how many times he meets Ji Heng in a day,

307
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,800
what words he says,

308
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
and how close he is to Ji Heng while talking.

309
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
I need to know all that.

310
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,160
Yes!

311
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,000
Go back!

312
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,400
Xu Yang,

313
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm breaking up all biological relationship with you

314
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,970
from today onwards.

315
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
Min Su!

316
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,680
Let's meet again in next life.

317
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,880
Ji Heng!

318
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Your Majesties,

319
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,680
I've figured out the Emperor's marriage escape.

320
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,560
It was planned by Min Su, the body guard of Ji Heng.

321
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,040
Ji Heng is so young and stubborn

322
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,840
that she got incited

323
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
to run away from the marriage.

324
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,320
As Ji Heng's older brother,

325
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,680
I feel regretful not to have taught her well.

326
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm willing to take any penalty.

327
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,800
Where is Min Su

328
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,760
and Ji Heng now?

329
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,480
I chased them all the way

330
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,080
and caught them.

331
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,840
However...

332
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,000
Min Su committed suicide on site for his own guilt.

333
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,760
Ji Heng fell off the cliff and got missing.

334
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,560
This is done by them alone.

335
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,440
It has nothing to do with the demons.

336
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
I hope Your Majesties can have mercy

337
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
and don't get others involved

338
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,720
that might do hard to the relationship
between the two clans.

339
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,880
I'm willing to take up whatever penalty left.

340
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,680
So what do you think, Emperor Dong Hua?

341
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
It can't be helped.

342
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,360
Forget about it for now.

343
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,320
Thank you, Your Majesty!

344
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
Now that the Emperor Dong Hua has forgiven it,

345
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,880
I would also give it a way out.

346
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,800
Hope this won't happen again

347
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
in the future!

348
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,160
Otherwise, neither the demons nor the gods will feel ashamed.

349
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,520
Thank you, Your Majesty!

350
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,720
Go get it cleaned up!

351
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,200
Excuse me please!

352
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,360
Greetings, Your Majesties!

353
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:08,040
External affairs are done. It's time to clean up internal affairs.

354
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,600
Do you two confess?

355
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,640
Goddess Zhihe created trouble at the Emperor's worship of Heaven.

356
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,120
You offended the superior
and will be exiled to the western desert

357
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,640
to take charge of rainfall.

358
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,280
You shall not return without being summoned.

359
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Lian Song failed his duty to host the marriage

360
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,560
which is a great disappointment to His Majesty's trust.

361
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,880
You shall be exiled to the South Heavenly Gate as a guard.

362
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,640
Wait a minute!

363
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
No blame attaches to the unconscious doer of wrong.

364
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,080
The Third Princess should not be punished so severely.

365
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,360
Now that His Majesty has forgiven you,

366
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,760
you shall be punished to repent in Yuan Ji Palace.

367
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,480
Thank you, Your Majesties!

368
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,600
Your Majesty, you're so cruel!

369
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,640
You interceded for Lian Song

370
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,840
rather than me.

371
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,040
Aren't you concerned about me at all?

372
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,360
The Heavenly King has given you the softest penalty

373
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,440
for my sake.

374
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,920
Aren't you content with it?

375
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,160
But I'm...

376
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,320
I've pampered you too much

377
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
in your daily matters

378
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,120
which resulted in today's accident.

379
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,880
You should be polished

380
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,280
this time for good.

381
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,280
Your Majesty!

382
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,280
Your Majesty!

383
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,520
Your Majesty!

384
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,200
Your Majesty!

385
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,480
Demon Lord!

386
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,320
Min Su is dead. Ji Heng is left all alone.

387
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,000
She fell into the mortal realm.

388
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
No wonder we didn't find her before.

389
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,800
Bring her back!

390
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,520
Yes!

391
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,680
There you go!

392
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,240
Who are you?

393
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,280
Where...where is this place?

394
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,560
Why am I here?

395
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,160
Who am I?

396
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,040
You don't remember me?

397
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,560
Then do you still remember

398
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
how you fell off the cliff?

399
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
I seem to remember that...

400
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,600
that someone is chasing me.

401
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,800
I jumped from a very high place.

402
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,280
I don't remember why they chased.

403
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,680
Don't try to recall then.

404
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,000
You need to take a good rest.

405
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
I'll help you find out your lot.

406
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,040
This is really helpful!

407
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,640
Your Majesty,

408
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,480
I prepared some clean sweet dew

409
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,280
to help you recover your cultivation.

410
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,960
Your Majesty, are you going to Miaoyi Chasm again?

411
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,920
Ever since Miao Luo was imprisoned in Miaoyi Chasm,

412
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,360
she's been breathing the three-poisonous toxin from six realms

413
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,880
and trying to break out from the seal.

414
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
She is ever more active in recent days.

415
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
She needs to be brought under control urgently.

416
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,760
But your cultivation

417
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
was impaired in the Ten-evil Lotus Land

418
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,640
and it hasn't recovered yet.

419
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,180
It is further impaired

420
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,560
when you suppressed the Qiushui Toxin in Ji Heng.

421
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,280
I'm afraid...

422
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,120
Never mind!

423
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm afraid your cultivation will be difficult to recover.

424
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
Are you here to see me again?

425
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,720
Or are you aware that

426
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
you'll soon be unable to hold me?

427
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,720
You're obsessive.

428
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
Don't you feel tired from all the repairing work?

429
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
I'll break out sooner or later.

430
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,080
Dong Hua,

431
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,820
you and I are all prestigious figures

432
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,150
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

433
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,440
You should let me go!

434
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,280
Wouldn't it be much better

435
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,150
if we join hands?

436
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,230
You shameless demon!

437
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,560
What? Getting injured so easily?

438
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,880
Or,

439
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,600
you came with injuries?

440
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,600
Don't be too hard on yourself.

441
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,040
How much longer can you seal me?

442
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
Even if I'm injured,

443
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,120
suppressing you is a piece of cake.

444
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,360
Don't you even think about breaking free!

445
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,920
Your Majesty,

446
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
there you come finally!

447
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
What happened?

448
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,320
Your Majesty!

449
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,160
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

450
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,720
How come you are so severely injured?

451
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
Do I need to summon the Imperial Doctor?

452
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,440
Don't reveal what happened today

453
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,160
to anyone else.

454
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,320
Your Majesty!

455
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,480
Your Majesty!

456
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,520
You're so careless

457
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,400
to your own life,

458
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,960
and yet you can survive this long.

459
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,680
Don't joke with me, Third Prince.

460
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,260
This is the top priority

461
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,600
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

462
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,240
God Yun Zhuang is waiting outside.

463
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,200
Invite him inside!

464
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,280
Sure!

465
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,200
Please!

466
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
Greetings to Third Prince and God Chong Lin.

467
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,640
I invited you here

468
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,920
for a particularly important matter.

469
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm all ears to it.

470
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,480
His Majesty fell asleep from the suppression of Miaoyi Chasm.

471
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,320
We both know he has issued a prohibitive edict.

472
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
So this should be held back from anyone outside the palace

473
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,680
in case it will create turmoil in the six realms.

474
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,880
I got it!

475
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,840
By the way,

476
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,000
thanks to your help the other day

477
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,440
to make the change

478
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
on the mortal Book of Fate

479
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,600
for Si Ming

480
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,680
so that it can deceive all the immortals.

481
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
What if His Majesty becomes interested

482
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,640
in the dukkha among the mortals

483
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,040
which are birth, aging, illness, death,

484
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,690
association with the unbeloved, separation from the loved,

485
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,520
not getting what is wanted, and the five clinging-aggregates,

486
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
and reincarnate into a mortal to observe them?

487
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
His Majesty slept in a hurry

488
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,750
and didn't leave any other orders.

489
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,600
But there is a thought lately

490
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
which troubles me a lot.

491
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,320
May I ask what is troubling Your Highness?

492
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,080
Even though His Majesty has visited the Miaoyi Chasm

493
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,200
and imprisoned Miao Luo,

494
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,480
I'm afraid Miao Luo might create some trouble

495
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,360
if she knows His Majesty

496
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,840
has fallen asleep because of it.

497
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,640
In order to make sure Miao Luo doesn't make any trouble

498
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,160
during His Majesty's one-hundred-year sleep,

499
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
I've thought of a way

500
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,280
to fix it recently.

501
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,760
You are extremely good at Nirvana.

502
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,120
If you could use past-life magic

503
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
to cast half of His Majesty's shadow

504
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,680
into the Fanyin Valley,

505
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
he won't know

506
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,480
he is half of His Majesty's shadow

507
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,800
as long as it's successfully done,

508
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,440
nor will he know

509
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,880
he has the responsibility to protect Miaoyi Chasm.

510
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,880
This shadow has a part of His Majesty's breath

511
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,200
after all,

512
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,480
so as long as it's reborn in Fanyin Valley,

513
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,320
it is a deterrence to Miao Luo.

514
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,160
Eh...

515
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,520
The inseparable king birds

516
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,680
die in the Fanyin Valley.

517
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Once their corpses turn into dusts

518
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
and reborn into the shadow in Fanyin Valley,

519
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,040
they will naturally go back to His Majesty.

520
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,600
There is nothing to worry about

521
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,800
to His Majesty!

522
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,840
That's a well-constructed plan.

523
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I've thought about it for a while just now.

524
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,920
It is indeed the only feasible way.

525
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,040
But in my opinion,

526
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,680
after I get to Fanyin Valley

527
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
and cast the past-life magic,

528
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,640
you and I will need to drink the oblivion water

529
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,000
to forget about this.

530
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,000
Yes!

531
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,000
You're always prudent.

532
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm expecting you to agree on it.

533
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,120
Despite that after the past-life magic,

534
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,000
it is only a thin shadow of His Majesty,

535
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,040
it is a part of His Majesty as well.

536
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,580
It's born with the principal and subsidiary causes,

537
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,800
and so does it change.

538
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,440
If it's taken by someone intentionally,

539
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,900
it won't die with the disappearance of the principal

540
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,640
and subsidiary causes.

541
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,300
Changing His Majesty's principal and subsidiary causes

542
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,560
while he is sleeping

543
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,280
will surely shake his immortal root.

544
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,040
That's right to say!

545
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,280
I'll definitely drink it.

546
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,240
That's good then.

547
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,760
This way please.

548
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,380
I've long heard

549
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,920
that Qingqiu is an immortal and auspicious place

550
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,640
and thought to travel around

551
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,320
while I am taking the study tour.

552
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,200
Coincidentally, I ran into the Emperor Bai Zhi the other day.

553
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,320
His Majesty said Your Highness is very proficient at sightseeing.

554
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,560
I will have one day off on the day after tomorrow.

555
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm wonder if Your Highness

556
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,400
could show me around the Qingqiu?

557
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,360
I...

558
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,080
One day is not enough for a sightseeing tour.

559
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,320
I heard Your Highness has great cooking skills.

560
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,200
You could come with me to the mortal realm

561
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,720
to enjoy the good food and drink.

562
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,080
I have many favorite restaurants in the mortal realm.

563
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,600
Some of the dishes are even not available in heaven.

564
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,160
I suppose Your Highness must be very interested.

565
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,800
Merrymaking is after all not a decent cause.

566
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,920
I heard Your Highness is well up

567
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,880
in the course of Weapon Forging and Ancient History.

568
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,960
What a coincidence!

569
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,200
I'm not good at either one of those two.

570
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm wondering if Your Highness have the time to help me

571
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,400
make up for the two courses?

572
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,240
I...

573
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,720
Jingwei, come here and have some worms.

574
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,560
Check out

575
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,500
if I have anything on schedule on my rest day.

576
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,320
Your Highness have a lot of things on schedule.

577
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,040
The Emperor Bai Zhi issued the order that

578
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,480
Your Highness has to check out the injuries

579
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,680
of three gods before noon

580
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,820
whose leg was broken, whose arm was broken

581
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,360
and whose neck was cut by you

582
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
when they invited you to play

583
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,480
on the rest day before your last two rest day,

584
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,720
on the one before your last rest day

585
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
and on your last rest day respectively.

586
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,480
After the noon...

587
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,360
Let me see!

588
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,000
His Highness needs to go to
Zhonghu Mountain after the noon

589
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,280
to have a decisive fight against Fairy Zhi Yue.

590
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,480
That'll be a hell of a fight.

591
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,960
In that case,

592
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,400
His Highness will be available only at night.

593
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,000
The fight with Fairy Zhi Yue

594
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,000
is not that serious.

595
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,960
I'll only take nothing more

596
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,480
than one of her arms.

597
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,840
I'll probably come back around five to seven in the evening.

598
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,160
Anyone wants to join it?

599
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,480
Excuse us!

600
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,240
My god!

601
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,080
Get running!

602
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,320
Go! Go! Go!

603
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,800
Sister FengJiu, you're really energetic!

604
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,040
Even though your family arrange your engagement too early,

605
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,400
you don't have to scare them like that.

606
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,080
You just scared off another three!

607
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,040
You may not have the willingness now,

608
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,960
but if you want to get engaged in the future,

609
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,200
they will be helpful to you.
