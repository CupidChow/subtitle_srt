00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 3

3
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,160
Foster brother.

4
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Here are the cakes and pastries.

5
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,200
Your Majesty!

6
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,280
Your cooking skill is...

7
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
You'd better have something else for fun.

8
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,800
Tasty?

9
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,520
Want to have some?

10
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,840
Yeah.

11
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,360
Let me feed you.

12
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,400
OK.

13
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Third Prince, there is an illusion here,

14
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,680
isn't it?

15
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,000
The pastries

16
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,440
look simple but elegant

17
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,270
with fascinating stuffing.

18
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,720
Between lips and teeth is the taste
of sorrowless flower's fragrance

19
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,560
and

20
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,120
the sweetness of Zijin Honeydew.

21
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,200
It's surprising that it can make people get such a realm.

22
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,960
Awesome!

23
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,120
Fantastic!

24
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,400
The fishy smell is gone!

25
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,200
Have a taste.

26
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Who made it?

27
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,000
Seeing you're addicted to cooking these days,

28
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,880
I also have a try.

29
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,800
Have you named it?

30
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,720
Not yet.

31
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
Please give it a name.

32
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
Since it's made from sorrowless flower,

33
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,680
just call it sorrowless pastry.

34
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,360
Taste is good.

35
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,800
Thank you, foster brother.

36
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,120
His Majesty praised me for my pastry.

37
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,320
Your Majesty,

38
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,280
how do you know my pastry is called sorrowless pastry?

39
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
Great minds think alike.

40
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
Do you guys

41
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,160
take turns to trick me?

42
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,760
Is that...

43
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
Unexpectedly, I understand the following sufferings like

44
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,360
birth, senility, illness, death,

45
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,280
apriya-samprayoga-duhkha,

46
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
farewell to the beloved,

47
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
pursuing devotionally for something
yet keeping out of reach for ever

48
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,000
and the five skandhas.

49
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
Just in an instant,

50
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
by tasting the sweet and sour fish,

51
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
I seemed to experience them all.

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,760
Your Majesty, your heart is full of leniency,

53
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
incomparable.

54
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
He ate it up?

55
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
Foster brother, you're really good at cooking.

56
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,080
Unexpectedly, you could make Si Ming
have such feelings and thoughts.

57
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,960
Your Highness, why are you here?

58
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,880
Tails, tails.

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
Your tails appear.

60
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,480
Si Ming.

61
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Si Ming.

62
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,880
Why did you go there?

63
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,360
I just found

64
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
there was a cute fox here.

65
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
I thought I could play with it for fun.

66
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,680
It has gone.

67
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,680
Is there really a little fox?

68
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,640
It was here just now.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,280
It has gone.

70
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
You're carrying it, right?

71
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,520
Show me.

72
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
Maybe I can use it to make a smooth tippet.

73
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,680
Third Prince is really detestable.

74
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
How could he think of using me to make a tippet?

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,240
Third Prince.

76
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,400
Third Prince.

77
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,200
Third Prince.

78
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,120
The immortal animal in my Tai Chen Palace is well trained.

79
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,320
It's certain that it won't behave so impolitely.

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
If the Heavenly King had been as attentive as me,

81
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
You wouldn't have been so smart.

82
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,400
It's true!

83
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,880
Your Majesty.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,880
How could you compare me

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,840
with your little fox?

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,960
You really push me too far.

87
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
His Majesty let you off lightly.

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,440
Anyhow, His Majesty saved me again.

89
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
One more debt.

90
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,680
It's really hard for me to pay the debt.

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,000
As there is no end in the world,

92
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,440
so is my gratitude to him.

93
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,550
Turn up.

94
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,360
How do you think?

95
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,240
Although Lian Song is not kind-hearted,

96
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,160
he has a good taste.

97
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
I just put three drops of Zijin Honeydew,

98
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,360
he could even taste it.

99
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Zijin Honeydew?

100
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,160
How bold you are!

101
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,680
Although we get on well with each other like Damon and Pythias,

102
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,280
if you keep being so reckless,

103
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,400
I can not ensure you safety.

104
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,000
What if you were discovered by them someday?

105
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
How can you account for it to Qingqiu?

106
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,920
How can I explain it to the Sky Kingdom?

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,120
I can't help it.

108
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,760
Having been in Tai Chen Palace for such a long time,

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,880
it's the first time for me to see His Majesty today.

110
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,840
I almost expose myself.

111
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,040
Daily routines make me tired every day.

112
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,500
Without a comfortable place to rest,

113
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,980
I have to stay in the Imperial Kitchen all the time.

114
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,280
I don't even have a room of myself.

115
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,040
I have told you not to come here.

116
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
Is it worthy?

117
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,920
Si Ming.

118
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,400
You...

119
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,160
Don't be fooled by the little fox.

120
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,320
Lord Cheng Yu.

121
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
You should be in the Lord Mansion.

122
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,720
Why are you here?

123
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,280
You little girl,

124
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,400
why didn't go to see me since you were in the Sky Kingdom?

125
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
You just bully Si Ming here.

126
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm here to pay a debt of gratitude.

127
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
It's a secret.

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,760
Sounds interesting!

129
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
Why didn't you turn to me? I can help you.

130
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
I'm afraid to dishonor Qingqiu.

131
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,960
Tell me

132
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,960
what your trouble is.

133
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,540
My father told me that I must repay others' kindness.

134
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,340
But they didn't tell me how to repay it?

135
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
It's not difficult.

136
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,960
Do you know what is the most important in repaying kindness?

137
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,640
That is to provide timely help.

138
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,640
It makes no sense by adding brilliance to the present splendor.

139
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
You should share the cares and burdens of His Majesty.

140
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,800
Only in this way can you match his kindness.

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,680
Share cares and burdens of His Majesty?

142
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,720
But how?

143
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,720
Just as told in the play,

144
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,840
an elegant young man was in trouble

145
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,240
and saved by a miss.

146
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,440
Then...

147
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
I remember my aunt also told me

148
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
the same.

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,920
It's true that you know much more.

150
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
So it is.

151
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,560
If there's something that you can't deal with,

152
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,000
don't be afraid,

153
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,120
just come to my mansion

154
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,920
and I can support you.

155
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,680
Don't support her anymore.

156
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,240
She is bold enough now.

157
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
If you keep...

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,680
Lord Cheng Yu.

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,960
You're really kind to me.

160
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,560
Si Ming.

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
I haven't blamed you yet.

162
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,760
Who told my secrets to Lian Song?

163
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Lian Song?

164
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Lian Song is really not kind-hearted.

165
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,760
He said he would use me to make

166
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
a fox tippet.

167
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
I nearly turned up

168
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
to fight with him.

169
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,600
He is a playboy.

170
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,600
Keep away from him.

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,800
He

172
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,400
is splenetic,

173
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,440
getting close to you

174
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,160
to irritate you to offend him.

175
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,840
Then he will take the chance to deeply offend you.

176
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,520
-He is really so bad. -You're right.

177
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,560
Luckily, you wasn't trapped.

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,280
Well,

179
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,360
Lord Cheng Yu.

180
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,440
Tell me

181
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,720
how to repay kindness?

182
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,280
Listen,

183
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,680
as for this kind of thing,

184
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,080
you'd better capture his stomach first.

185
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
For man,

186
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,400
get it?

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,680
Princess,

188
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
I'm sorry. I won't make that mistake again.

189
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,040
Please forgive me.

190
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,680
The last pastry was made by you, right?

191
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,820
Yes.

192
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,100
It was overturned carelessly.

193
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,540
So I use my hometown pastry to take place of it.

194
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,420
I won't do that again.

195
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,880
Well done.

196
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,160
I know it!

197
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
His Majesty even praised me.

198
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,320
You must teach me every step

199
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,440
of making the pastry.

200
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,640
Since foster brother praised me,

201
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,360
I will do well every time.

202
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,280
Why are you still here in a daze?

203
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,960
It's done so quickly?

204
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,640
Where is the flower core?

205
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,760
And where isn't there any stuffing?

206
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,160
Naturally, the sorrowless flower

207
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,880
was used

208
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,680
to make the shuck of the sorrowless pastry.

209
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
Since it's called sorrowless pastry,

210
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,280
its stuffing

211
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,440
is certainly made from the feelings and thoughts of the maker.

212
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,440
Then it can be finished.

213
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,160
Feelings and thoughts?

214
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
Since it's called sorrowless pastry,

215
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,920
it's sorrowless.

216
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,360
You'd better suit the remedy to the case.

217
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
As for the flower core,

218
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,240
then

219
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,640
you can choose any flower core you like.

220
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,800
Then I will put the tea that foster brother like most in it.

221
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,880
Quickly.

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,240
Serve the tea.

223
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,240
What kind of tea to serve?

224
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,240
All kinds.

225
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,160
OK.

226
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,720
Go to

227
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,520
prepare as the princess ordered.

228
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,520
OK.

229
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,760
What can I do?

230
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,440
As for the lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy
and painting that Ji Heng likes,

231
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm good at none of them.

232
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm not likely to learn them in a short period of time.

233
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,800
When Ji Heng marries Dong Hua,

234
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,360
then it's too late for me to learn.

235
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Demon Lord, the dishes have been ready for a long time.

236
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,680
I won't have anything.

237
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm busy now.

238
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,760
How about my serving them here?

239
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,240
The kitchen has specially made braised demon beast today.

240
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,560
Braised demon beast?

241
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,120
It's so inelegant!

242
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Ji Heng won't like it.

243
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,560
Tell the kitchen

244
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,560
not to cook it any more.

245
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,560
Besides,

246
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,520
If I can't marry Ji Heng,

247
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,440
I will braise you.

248
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,640
I don't mind anything.

249
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,120
We demons advocate for force.

250
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,480
I will beat Dong Hua first

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
to stop their marriage,

252
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
which,

253
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
I think, will amaze the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

254
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,920
Then Ji Heng will think highly of me.

255
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,240
At that time, I will propose a marriage.

256
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,560
I'm sure that I can make it then.

257
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,840
Min Su.

258
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
Do you still remember

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,520
we often came to play in this forest when we were young?

260
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,440
As the princess of the demons,

261
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,960
I have to practise many lessons daily

262
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
so that I will be lazy sometimes.

263
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
Among all the demon generals,

264
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,900
only you dare to accompany me playing in this forest.

265
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Because of this,

266
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,280
you are always blamed by my elder brother.

267
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,440
Only in this forest

268
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,720
can you laugh happily.

269
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,520
As long as you are happy,

270
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,000
it's nothing

271
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,600
for me to be punished.

272
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
But do you know that

273
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,920
the reason why I laugh is not that I can play in this forest

274
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,000
but

275
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,120
that you are with me.

276
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,280
I only want

277
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,360
to stay with you.

278
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,680
Xuan Yue.

279
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,760
Greet to you, Demon Lord.

280
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
Find a reliable person

281
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
to send this battle letter to the Sky Kingdom.

282
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,280
As for the close relationship,

283
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,520
I think Zilan from the Kunlun Mountain...

284
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,040
Shut up.

285
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,520
I've told you

286
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,800
not to mention

287
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,040
my shameful twin brother.

288
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
He can go to anywhere to learn skills

289
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
except Kunlun.

290
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,440
Isn't there anyone powerful enough among our demons?

291
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,640
Then I will go to find mother of all stars.

292
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,000
Ask her to send it to the Sky Kingdom!

293
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,960
Yes.

294
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,760
Braised demon beast.

295
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,000
I saw you liked these pastries.

296
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,520
So I make some for you today.

297
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,800
Please have a taste.

298
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,840
Even Third Prince

299
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
saw you at the party,

300
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,080
praising you for your good skills.

301
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,040
After you.

302
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

303
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:10,880
What's up?

304
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,120
Isn't it tasty?

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Princess.

306
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,080
Th sorrowless pastry is as tasty as usual.

307
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,520
But...

308
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,600
But what?

309
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,440
But why I can still feel the sorrow.

310
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,080
Jiu.

311
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,680
Jiu.

312
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,120
P...Princess.

313
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Why can't I make the pastry tasty?

314
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
How dare you play tricks on me?

315
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,240
Your Highness, please detect it carefully.

316
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,000
I dare not play tricks on you.

317
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,440
The flower core of the sorrowless pastry

318
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,040
varies from person to person.

319
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,720
I don't know it's such a result.

320
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,560
It varies from person to person.

321
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,560
Since foster brother like those made by you,

322
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,320
I will make the same pastry as you.

323
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,640
Dare you disobey the order of the princess?

324
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,520
I dare not.

325
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,920
Actually, my sorrowless pastries

326
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,760
are made from very common materials,

327
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,880
including East Sea Rime and Zijin Honeydew.

328
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,240
Only the root of Yushi Flower is different.

329
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,200
It's just the root of Yushi Flower.

330
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't think it's hard to get it.

331
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,340
The common roots of Yushi Flower

332
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,900
is not good enough for you, Your Highness.

333
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,920
In my opinion,

334
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,080
naturally

335
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,240
the root of Yushi Flower King in the center of Rebirth Sea

336
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,760
is the best for you.

337
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,400
In this way, your precious heart

338
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,400
can be felt by His Majesty.

339
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Good idea!

340
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Yu Ru.

341
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,720
Get prepared

342
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,880
to Rebirth Sea.

343
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes.

344
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,280
Go with me.

345
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,760
Yes.

346
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
Princess.

347
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,680
Hope you can discern and apprehend as early as possible.

348
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,160
Just be a good immortal.

349
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,280
My waist!

350
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,760
I need to have a good rest.

351
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,960
Jiu.

352
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,960
What are you doing?

353
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,520
Is there a law in heaven that being lazy is forbidden?

354
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Why are you still in a daze?

355
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
Go with me.

356
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,960
I myself

357
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,120
will supervise your picking up it.

358
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,360
Since the root of Yushi Flower is at the bottom of the sea,

359
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,120
Jiu,

360
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,520
go to dig it out for me.

361
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
Are the tea and pastries ready?

362
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,240
Let's have a rest first.

363
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,040
Yes.

364
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,720
Yes.

365
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,160
Your Majesty.

366
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
Mother of all stars sent you the battle letter
of Demon Lord, Yan Chiwu,

367
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,240
asking for a fight with you.

368
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Your Majesty, how to reply to it.

369
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,360
Chong Lin.

370
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,760
How do you like the tea leaves?

371
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,120
Your Majesty,

372
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,240
I can't see the difference.

373
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Do you know

374
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
what is the most important thing to tea leaves?

375
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,560
Your Highness, you have ever said that

376
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,840
the most important thing to tea leaves
is that it should be picked timely.

377
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
Time.

378
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,360
I see.

379
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,680
It's really bright and brilliant.

380
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,160
Let's go back to Tai Chen Palace.

381
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
Don't leave.

382
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,440
Princess.

383
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,800
It's the princess that should be punished.

384
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,720
How unlucky I am!

385
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,800
Stop.

386
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Is it true that even heaven can't stand me

387
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,200
because I am not well-behaved,

388
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,160
so it punishes me?

389
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,560
Congratulations! Your Highness!

390
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,160
Finally you make it. Your effort is worth.

391
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
His Majesty must like it.

392
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,320
Have you cooked fish?

393
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,560
It's already in the pot,

394
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,960
waiting to be cooked by you.

395
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,280
I will go back to the palace to change my bead hairpin first.

396
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,920
Foster brother will be back soon.

397
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,920
You.

398
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,920
Stay here.

399
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,160
Help to watch the degree of heating in the Imperial Kitchen.

400
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,640
Yes.

401
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,320
Sweet and sour fish is a delicious food in the earth,

402
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,360
which must be cooked with the cooking skill of the earth.

403
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
Help me to watch the fire carefully.

404
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,480
Don't use magic arts.

405
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,840
If there is any error,

406
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,080
you are to blame.

407
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,400
Yes.

408
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,100
Did mother of all stars

409
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,960
send the battle letter to His Majesty?

410
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,280
Long time has passed.

411
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,000
Didn't I ask mother of all stars

412
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,760
to send the battle letter to the Sky Kingdom by herself?

413
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
How has there been no news since she left?

414
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,760
Demon Lord.

415
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,320
I have a friend

416
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,040
who can help to Yi Shi San Heaven to find some information.

417
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,360
Go quickly.

418
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:26,800
OK.

419
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,200
OK.

420
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,360
Violet clothes and white hair.

421
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,560
His Majesty Dong Hua.

422
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,840
What's wrong?

423
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,280
If I ask Zhe Yan to help me now,

424
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,720
will he laugh at me?

425
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,640
Xuan Yue.

426
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,440
Demon Lord.

427
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,040
Is your friend reliable?

428
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,080
When can the ice-face fight with me?

429
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
He hasn't replied yet.

430
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,040
Long time has passed.

431
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

432
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,160
My friend has a special way

433
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
to ask to see Demon Lord's steward Chong Lin.

434
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,000
He is a carp spirit.

435
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Carp spirit?

436
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,080
Your Majesty.

437
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,800
Am I dreaming?

438
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,760
His Majesty helped me to pick up my hair clasp.

439
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,440
Right.

440
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,160
Your bead hairpin really looks beautiful.

441
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,600
What is so fragrant?

442
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,800
Glad to see you, Your Highness.

443
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,760
Chong Lin.

444
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
Where is foster brother now?

445
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,280
He has gone to the Imperial Kitchen.

446
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,120
Is it true that my sweet and sour fish
is so fragrant that it can spread for tens of miles.

447
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,960
Princess.

448
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,720
Only Jiu is in the kitchen.

449
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,040
If she receives the award instead of you...

450
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,120
How dare she?

451
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,200
Your Majesty!

452
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,720
Glad to see you, Your Majesty.

453
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,040
Leave quickly.

454
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,600
Yes.

455
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,760
Wait.

456
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,120
Fry it in hot oil.

457
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,640
Then add some grape-fruit to make it tasty.

458
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,240
And the last is

459
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,480
the root of the sorrowless flower?

460
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,080
Yes.

461
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,160
Foster brother.

462
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
I specially went to Qingqiu to pick up
the root of the sorrowless flower

463
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,800
in preparation for making sweet and sour fish.

464
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,520
Stay in Tai Chen Palace to make dishes.

465
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,800
Foster brother.

466
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,240
What is

467
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,800
the flower on the hair clasp?

468
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,760
I have never seen it in the Sky Kingdom.

469
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,520
Is it from the earth?

470
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,720
No.

471
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,320
It's the sky

472
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,200
and stars of Qingqiu.

473
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,560
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

474
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,880
who can tell how many years it has been through?

475
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,800
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

476
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,480
who can tell how many years it has been through?

477
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,680
What does it mean?

478
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,120
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

479
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,040
who can tell how many years it has been through?

480
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,640
Your Majesty.

481
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,080
Your Majesty.

482
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,760
It's the first time that we have talked with each other.

483
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,480
What a wild fox,

484
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,840
shouting so joyfully?

485
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,040
Demon Lord,

486
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,020
here is the letter in reply.

487
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,440
Read it.

488
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,280
It says that

489
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,000
it's time for picking tea-leaves in
the tea garden of Tai Chen Palace.

490
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,520
So he doesn't have time to meet the challenge.

491
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,160
Picking tea-leaves?

492
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,280
Unexpectedly, because of picking tea-leaves,

493
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,800
he refused to fight with me.

494
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,680
Does he think of me as a fool?

495
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,620
Your Majesty.

496
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,820
Yan Chiwu from the demons...

497
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,280
Ice-face.

498
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,230
I have picked up all the tea leaves for you.

499
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,800
When can you fight with me?

500
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,800
Chong Lin.

501
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,520
Yes.

502
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,000
Why don't you look at me?

503
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,460
Thanks a lot.

504
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,780
No need.

505
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,040
Let's go!

506
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,080
Where to fight?

507
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,120
I have got several fragrant trees recently.

508
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,920
Having put them in the garden for a long time,

509
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,600
I'm afraid I still need time to plant them.

510
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,400
You ice-face!

511
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,360
As for planting flowers, the best time is the most important.

512
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,520
Wait.

513
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,160
I will go to plant the flowers for you.

514
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,920
Then you won't have any excuses.

515
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,440
Demon Lord Yan.

516
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,080
Demon Lord Yan.

517
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,800
You can't enter.

518
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,200
Get out of the way.

519
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,200
Demon Lord Yan.

520
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,800
Demon Lord Yan.

521
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,160
Don't stop me.

522
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,640
Demon Lord Yan.

523
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,560
What's wrong?

524
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,560
Can't I drink some tea?

525
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,120
It's so hot.

526
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to stop him.

527
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,960
It's...

528
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,920
It doesn't matter.

529
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,240
I have planted the trees for you.

530
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,880
When can we fight?

531
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,520
Chong Lin.

532
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,700
Is there still sludge in the two mus of lotus pond

533
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,440
that needs to be got rid of?

534
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,720
When will you deal with it?

535
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,320
The lotus pond hasn't been cared for a long time.

536
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,200
As for the sludge in it,

537
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,320
I'm afraid it needs a lot of time to get rid of it.

538
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,760
Your Majesty, if you want to deal with it,

539
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,120
I will issue orders soon.

540
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,280
No need.

541
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,520
I can do it by myself.

542
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
You want to find an excuse again?

543
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,120
Wait a moment.

544
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,480
Demon Lord Yan.

545
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,480
Demon Lord Yan.

546
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,400
Demon Lord Yan.

547
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,600
There is so much work in the Sky Kingdom.

548
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,580
It's not easy for Ice-face.

549
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,580
As His Majesty, the Emperor of the Three Realms,

550
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,460
unexpectedly, he does everything by himself.

551
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,080
Surprisingly!

552
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,160
In Tai Chen Palace,

553
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,480
if His Majesty smiles, there must be something wrong.

554
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,160
Chong Lin, why did you laugh just now?

555
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,120
Si Ming.

556
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,320
You don't know that

557
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,560
the Demon Lord Yan Chiwu asked to challenge His Majesty.

558
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,040
His Majesty has excused himself from the challenge.

559
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,920
Unexpectedly, Yan Chiwu is so stubborn that

560
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,840
he insisted on fighting with His Majesty.

561
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,460
He even did all the chores in Tai Chen Palace.

562
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
How could it be?

563
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,900
When His Majesty plays tricks on others,

564
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,000
he really enjoys himself.

565
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,680
How long has he been working here?

566
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,500
The Demon Lord has cleaned up the whole Tai Chen Palace

567
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,340
both inside and outside.

568
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,400
He was fooled by His Majesty.

569
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,240
So far, the only chores in Tai Chen Palace

570
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,240
is the apricots in Yinxing Forest waiting to be picked.

571
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm afraid

572
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,160
the demon King might pick the apricots as well.

573
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,160
When he finds he was fooled,

574
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,880
I don't know what he will do.

575
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,400
What will he do?

576
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,720
Will he pull down Tai Chen Palace?

577
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,000
Anytime His Majesty plays a trick on someone else,

578
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,440
he doesn't cause himself any trouble.

579
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,400
Just worry about the demon king.

580
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Well, I have something else to do.

581
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
I'm leaving.

582
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,840
After I pick all the apricots,

583
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,200
the ice-face can't have any excuses.

584
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,640
How could there be a basket of apricots here?

585
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Tai Chen Palace has many rules.

586
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,180
How could they put things so randomly?

587
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,440
It means that

588
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,320
they are mine.

589
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,480
They don't need you.

590
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,720
I need you.

591
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,840
So sweet!

592
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,920
It must be tasty to make apricot sauce by them.

593
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,880
By the way,

594
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,160
His Majesty also likes the fragrance of apricots.

595
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
His Majesty is in a good mood today.

596
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,440
If I can make delicious apricot sauce

597
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,280
and present it to His Majesty,

598
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,200
I'm sure to make it better

599
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,080
for His Majesty to have a better mood.

600
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,760
Let's go, apricots.

601
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,000
What?

602
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,960
Where are the apricots that I picked just now?

603
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,800
There are so many tricks in the Sky Kingdom!

604
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,760
Are the apricots able to be invisible?

605
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,800
No wonder the ice-face can't deal with it by himself

606
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,560
but ask me for help.

607
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,120
I will find out

608
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,280
whether the apricots disappeared by themselves

609
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,280
or someone else wanted to trick me.

610
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,960
Why should I help to catch the thief for Tai Chen Palace?

611
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,360
I should pick all the apricots as quickly as possible

612
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,480
and then have a fight with the ice-face. That's it.

613
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,120
Ice-face.

614
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,320
Have I finished all the chores in the palace?

615
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm here to remind you that

616
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,620
it's time for you to fulfill your promise of

617
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
fighting with me.

618
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,600
When did I promise you?

619
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,800
You told me by yourself.

620
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,000
You said if I could help you do something,

621
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,800
then you would agree to fight with me.

622
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
I have considered it.

623
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,000
I won't fight.

624
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,920
You played tricks on me from the beginning to the end?

625
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,160
I...

626
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,560
I helped you pick tea-leaves, plant trees,

627
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,680
clear the lotus pond,

628
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,080
mend the tiles and pick apricots.

629
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,560
How could you turn hostile, denying all that I did now?

630
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
I...

631
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,440
do turn hostile.

632
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,760
So what?

633
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,120
Dong Hua.

634
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,600
I will fight with you with my full strength.

635
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,320
Dong Hua.
