1
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 2

3
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
Are you going to place it or not?

4
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,360
A complete stick of incense has burnt out.

5
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,480
Greetings, Your Majesty!

6
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
Greetings, Your Majesty!

7
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
No regret about a placed chess piece.

8
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Third Prince,

9
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,600
wouldn't it be a bit disgraceful for you

10
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,000
to play with such a rummy trick?

11
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,880
Playing chess is just like leading an army for a fight.

12
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,120
The essence of military strategy is
to be ever-changing and unpredictable.

13
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,520
You lose!

14
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,440
Alright!

15
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,200
You mentioned His Majesty just now.

16
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,880
I was wondering if you have any idea

17
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
why His Majesty visited the Imperial Kitchen

18
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,400
so frequently in recent days?

19
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,440
So there are things in Tai Chen Palace

20
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,080
that you don't know.

21
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,880
Yeah!

22
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,200
Quite a lot!

23
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
I can tell you the things

24
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
about His Majesty.

25
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,080
What about Lord Cheng Yu?

26
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,720
Let's exchange what we know. I'm all ears now.

27
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,920
OK.

28
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
Do you know that

29
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,160
His Majesty has fallen in love with
cooking skills recently?

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,000
Cooking skills?

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,880
What a hobby it is for His Majesty!

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,000
I suppose His Majesty

33
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,520
must have extraordinary cooking skills.

34
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
Not quite!

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
His Majesty's cooking skills

36
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,950
must be surprisingly stunning!

37
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
No Emperors in history ever stepped into the kitchen.

38
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,240
His Majesty is so outstanding.

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,960
But it is indeed his style.

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,760
The lotus flower will bloom

41
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
in a few days.

42
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,880
The Emperor wants everyone to gather at Tai Chen Palace

43
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
and discuss the scriptures together.

44
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,520
We'll be able to

45
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,040
observe His Majesty's cooking skills by then.

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,960
However,

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
we need to wait for some more days.

48
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,360
But His Majesty has invited me

49
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,560
to Tai Chen Palace

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,200
to have a taste in advance.

51
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,280
How about you going together with me

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
so that you can have a try

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,520
of His Majesty's cooking beforehand?

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,760
Thank you for that, Third Prince!

55
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,760
No problem!

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
I should be thankful to you.

57
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's go!

58
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,200
Thank me?

59
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,360
Si Ming was so excited to

60
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
have tasted His Majesty's cooking

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
that he passed out!

62
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
I didn't want him to come, but he insisted.

63
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,560
Look how impolite you are

64
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,520
in front of His Majesty!

65
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm so speechless to you!

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,640
Come and help!

67
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,840
Don't you know His Majesty's cooking?

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,900
Don't just stand there and watch!

69
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,380
Guards!

70
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,480
Hurry up!

71
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Help Si Ming stand up!

72
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,040
So the early bird does catch the worm.

73
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
I surprisingly came across His Majesty
early in the morning!

74
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,000
He...

75
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,600
He...

76
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
He smiled.

77
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you looking at?

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
His Majesty just smiled.

79
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Who's got the bad luck?

80
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,560
Bad luck?

81
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
Just remember

82
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,200
nothing good will happen

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,600
if His Majesty smiles.

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,320
No way!

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,800
That's not true for someone as good as His Majesty.

86
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,280
Go!

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,320
You'll get scolded if you don't wait on them.

88
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,920
Si Ming!

89
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,440
Si Ming!

90
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,800
Poisonous! Poisonous!

91
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,040
Si Ming!

92
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,560
Third Prince!

93
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
We've been on good terms

94
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,960
for hundreds of thousands of years.

95
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,480
Why would you harm me like this?

96
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,720
Si Ming,

97
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,320
you have to go to hell.

98
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,160
See?

99
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,160
Si Ming deserves to be the NO. 1 follower

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
under the King of Longevity from the south pole.

101
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,360
He is greatly discerning and apprehending

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
and can deliver all living creatures from torment.

103
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Third Prince,

104
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,200
His Majesty only invited you.

105
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,560
It suddenly occurred to me that
I haven't finished my Buddhist scriptures yet,

106
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,560
so I need to go back for that.

107
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Don't spoil His Majesty's lotus banquet.

108
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,280
Eh...

109
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,160
Cheng...

110
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
Cheng Yu!

111
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,320
Cheng Yu!

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,400
I need to check out Cheng Yu's Book of Fate.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,240
I'll check it carefully.

114
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Check it out! Check it out!

115
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,670
Lift up your spirit!

116
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,960
June 15th is a day off.

117
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Every corner of the palace

118
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,910
must be thoroughly cleared.

119
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,560
You!

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Go to the tea garden and pick all the tea leaves!

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Yes!

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,400
You!

123
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
Clean up the pavilions in the corridor!

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Yes!

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
You clean up the side palace.

126
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,120
Yes!

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,400
Side palace

128
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
is the living palace for Princess Zhihe.

129
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,320
What's coming will come!

130
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,040
Let's go!

131
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,480
Why do you come so late?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,160
Even the side palace of the Tai Chen Palace

133
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,040
is so elegantly decorated!

134
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
His Majesty has set up

135
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
every corner of the Tai Chen Palace.

136
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,920
Of course, it is elegant and beautiful!

137
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,040
His Majesty is indeed good at everything.

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,240
What are you waiting for?

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
Send this Mufeng Butterfly inside.

140
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,280
Mufeng Butterfly?

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
Zhe Yan ever said that

142
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
this kind of butterfly usually dances in the wind

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,280
and it creates hurricane once it touches water.

144
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
Take it now!

145
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,000
Sister,

146
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,320
we're new here.

147
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,040
The Mufeng Butterfly is really something we can't control.

148
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
If anything bad happens and offends the Princess,

149
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
you will be implicated in it.

150
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,720
Do as you're requested!

151
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
You may not be familiar with it now,

152
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,480
but you'll naturally become familiar

153
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,800
after a few more times.

154
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
Take it and leave!

155
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Yes!

156
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
Why could you accept it?

157
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,760
It is obviously a hot potato handed to you

158
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,000
as nobody else wants it.

159
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,240
Don't worry!

160
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,760
I used to catch butterflies in my hometown
when I was little.

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm fine with it.

162
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
It's a piece of cake.

163
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,480
I've climbed up the Sky Kingdom.

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,200
This won't be a challenge to me.

165
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
It's dust everywhere

166
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
and it stinks.

167
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,960
What if foster brother visits my palace?

168
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,960
Spray some flower dew!

169
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,040
Yes!

170
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
Why is the Mufeng Butterfly still not delivered yet?

171
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,480
Here it comes!

172
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,320
Go now!

173
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,320
You should only pay back the favor.

174
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't ever expose your identity

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,280
as the Princess of Qingqiu.

176
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
Who are you?

177
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,720
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

178
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,800
It's my fault

179
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,120
not to have taken care of it well.

180
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,720
Please forgive me!

181
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
So careless you were!

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,440
It almost hurt the Her Highness.

183
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,040
There is no room for you in Tai Chen Palace!

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,880
Mercy please, Your Highness!

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Please have mercy on me!

186
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,640
Raise up your head!

187
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Foster brother has asked us

188
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,520
to treat the fairy maids in palace with generosity.

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,160
So your punishment is to clean up the lotus pond.

190
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,600
Get your personality ground.

191
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,320
Her Highness is merciful.

192
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,800
Take your punishment and leave!

193
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,960
Yes!

194
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,680
Thank you, Your Highness!

195
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,720
Excuse me please!

196
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,840
Butterfly!

197
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,280
How miserable you are!

198
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,400
It's so unlucky of you

199
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,040
to get implicated into this undeserved catastrophe.

200
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Alright!

201
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,400
We're sort of destined.

202
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
Wait a minute!

203
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,720
I'll find some tools

204
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,000
before I apply the medicine for you.

205
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,280
This one it is!

206
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,320
It is itchy, isn't it?

207
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,840
I have been...

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
the No. 1 troublemaker in Qingqiu since I was young.

209
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,000
I always get my buddies injured.

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,200
As a result,

211
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,560
I have acquired the techniques
for medicine application.

212
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,640
This is my voice of experience.

213
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,760
Done!

214
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,920
Gosh!

215
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
His Majesty's stuff

216
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,160
must be returned in intact condition.

217
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
What do I do now?

218
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,520
I've got an idea.

219
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,440
A good brush pen can be made

220
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,600
with the softest fur at the tip of the nine-tailed fox.

221
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,800
It's said that Your Majesty made

222
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,360
all the tea set that he uses daily by himself.

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,760
Besides,

224
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,080
he is good at the four arts

225
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,560
and he is a rarely elegant scholar.

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,920
All the incenses burned in the Tai Chen Palace

227
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,720
are made by him in person.

228
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,040
No one in the Sky Kingdom

229
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,440
can imitate him.

230
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,560
I got that.

231
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,360
You helped me only because

232
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,960
you don't want me to give myself
away in front of His Majesty, right?

233
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,400
Thank you!

234
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,440
Now even the smell is the same as that of here.

235
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,920
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

236
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,680
You're usually calm!

237
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,240
Why are you so panicked today?

238
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,920
Your Majesty!

239
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,480
I've got news about Meng Hao.

240
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,320
He's been missing for so many years.

241
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,240
Where did he go?

242
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
Baishui Mountain!

243
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,960
The Baishui Mountain at the southern suburb of the demons?

244
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,640
Yes!

245
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,110
Come out!

246
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,280
Don't you recognize my sword?

247
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Greeting from Meng Hao, Your Majesty!

248
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
Rise!

249
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
Why did you end up like this?

250
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,760
Your Majesty,

251
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,200
the previous Chi Demon Lord used his Queen as a bait

252
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,400
to trap me in Baishui Mountain.

253
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,440
They impaled my bones with dragon-hunt lock

254
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,520
and sealed my power.

255
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I guarded the cinnamomum camphora
in the pond year in and year out.

256
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,440
I don't believe it

257
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,360
considering your magic arts.

258
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
Love is deeply rooted

259
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
into my bones.

260
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,880
My cultivation is not enough

261
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,400
to help me through this tragic romance.

262
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
It is my own willingness

263
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,480
to be trapped here.

264
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,600
Your own willingness?

265
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,000
You don't have to do that.

266
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,520
I was seduced by the demons.

267
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,280
I feel guilty to Your Majesty,

268
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,640
so I'm willing to stay here as an atonement

269
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,400
for my guilt.

270
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,200
If it bothered me,

271
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,640
I wouldn't have come.

272
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
Please allow me to stay, Your Majesty!

273
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,360
Is there anything

274
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,360
you're still concerned about?

275
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,480
I

276
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,400
dare not to hold anything back from Your Majesty.

277
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,800
I do have some concerns.

278
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,880
Is it worth it?

279
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
It is a destined tragedy

280
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
in the eyes of others,

281
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,640
but it's as sweet as candies

282
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,280
to me.

283
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,640
Your Majesty is most concerned about
the people in general in the world

284
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
and never get indulged in personal romance.

285
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
So it's hard for Your Majesty
to understand the feeling in it.

286
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,160
If so,

287
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,080
I'll leave you to it.

288
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,480
Conduct yourself well in future.

289
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,440
Wherever I am, you can find me.

290
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,640
Here you are!

291
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Take the fruit and make some tea with it.

292
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
Even though Your Highness cultivates water magic,

293
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
this fruit is cold in property,

294
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,680
so it's better for you not to eat too much of it.

295
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,920
As you wish then.

296
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,000
The Demon Lord summons you.

297
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,080
Brother!

298
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,240
Why does he summon me so suddenly?

299
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
The demon officer who spread the word
said there was something important.

300
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,800
Alright then!

301
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm going to the Chihong Hall.

302
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Mind your words

303
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,160
when you visit Ji Heng.

304
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,280
Don't get me embarrassed.

305
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,920
Sure!

306
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,040
I've been studying the four arts for a long time.

307
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
This time, I have to win Ji Heng's affection.

308
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,760
I believe I can do it!

309
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,360
I...

310
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,960
Who is it?

311
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,240
Nie Chuyin!

312
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,280
Yes, I am!

313
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,920
Your Highness,

314
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,760
calm down!

315
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,600
Wait a minute!

316
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,720
What are you doing here?

317
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
Are you into Ji Heng as well?

318
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,600
Your Highness,

319
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
I am Mr. Nobody!

320
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,600
I dare not to covet Her Highness.

321
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,240
That's more like it.

322
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,920
Prepare the necklace that I'll give Ji Heng
as a gift.

323
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,440
Yes!

324
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,480
The Princess is not in the palace.

325
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,840
How do you know?

326
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,160
You're very familiar with Ji Heng's whereabouts.

327
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,080
What's your intention?

328
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,000
Your Highness,

329
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,560
I don't dare to have any intention

330
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,560
with your presence.

331
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,360
It was the Demon Lord who asked me
to find the Princess,

332
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,360
but I didn't even meet her.

333
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,640
Fine! Then I'm going to Chihong Hall now.

334
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,160
Brother!

335
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,920
Brother! Are you looking for me?

336
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,040
Heng,

337
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,080
do you know the Emperor Dong Hua?

338
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,560
Emperor Dong Hua?

339
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,400
Everyone knows him!

340
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,720
Why do you ask?

341
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,360
I want you

342
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,880
to get engaged with him.

343
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,120
What?

344
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,880
You want to marry Ji Heng

345
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,240
to Dong Hua?

346
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,240
Heng,

347
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,480
this arrangement is critically important.

348
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,680
It determines the future of the demons.

349
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,520
Think it over before you give my any replies.

350
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,280
Anyway, only my sister can be matched

351
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,880
with a husband as noble as him.

352
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,840
Xu Yang,

353
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
you don't even care about

354
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,520
the marriage of your sister!

355
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
Yan Chiwu,

356
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,280
this is the domestic affair for my clan.

357
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,800
It's none of your business.

358
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,680
You!

359
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,040
Xu Yang,

360
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,720
I... I am a demon lord after all.

361
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
Marrying Ji Heng to me

362
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
is also for the sake of overall interests.

363
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,520
If you do it otherwise,

364
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,440
I'll rise in rebellion.

365
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,200
Overall interest goes first!

366
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,560
Overall interest goes first!

367
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,680
When can the cleaning be finished

368
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,200
without using magic arts?

369
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Here comes His Majesty!

370
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
So long, Your Majesty!

371
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,200
Off you go!

372
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,640
Your Majesty!

373
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,160
Yu Ru!

374
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,800
Jiu, you're just too ignorant.

375
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
How dare you stand in front of the Princess!

376
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,120
Foster brother!

377
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,280
Foster brother!

378
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,680
You're finally back!

379
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,120
Foster brother!

380
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,200
The Heavenly King endowed me
with a Kuwu Qin the other day.

381
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
The Shang string and Zhi string
always have some sort of flaws.

382
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,200
I hope you can help me with this.

383
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,040
It's still early now.

384
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,320
I'm fine to check it out!

385
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Don't try to covet my foster brother

386
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,400
with your good look.

387
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,680
I know what you're thinking in your heart.

388
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
You're so rude and obtrusive

389
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
and you offended His Majesty!

390
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320
Get out of the palace now!

391
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Guards!

392
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,560
Zhihe!

393
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,800
Foster brother!

394
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll come in a minute.

395
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't have time for you now.

396
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,160
If you are able to clean up
the Bodhi tree leaves by the pond in today,

397
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,520
I'll allow you to stay.

398
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,840
Foster brother!

399
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,920
Wait for me!

400
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:23,880
Go!

401
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,560
How ridiculous!

402
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,040
How dare you irritate the Princess!

403
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,560
Intentional obstruction!

404
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,720
That's outrageous!

405
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,960
So, you got any ideas?

406
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,520
You're awesome!

407
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,920
Your Highness,

408
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,680
the yard is cleaned up.

409
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,000
Shall we release Jiu back?

410
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,160
So soon?

411
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,240
Jiu!

412
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,240
Your Highness!

413
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,240
I gave you the chance out of mercy,

414
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,800
but you just loafed on the job.

415
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,280
And you used the Mufeng Butterfly.

416
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,480
So it should be your accomplice.

417
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,320
Guards!

418
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,720
Flog them in the buttocks for 20 times each

419
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,720
and drive them out of palace.

420
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
Yes, Your Highness!

421
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,680
Let me go!

422
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,120
I've already cleaned up the yard

423
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,320
as requested by the Princess.

424
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,840
Why do you drive me out?

425
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,600
Bizarre wind blows everywhere.

426
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,440
How can you make it clean?

427
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,320
Your Highness have been in the palace the whole time.

428
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,800
How do Your Highness know
there is bizarre wind everywhere?

429
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,120
Stop the far-fetched defense!

430
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,440
Verbal resistance is another conviction.

431
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,240
You'll be punished with both convictions.

432
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,400
That's 40 times of flogging on the buttock.

433
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,560
Let me go!

434
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,160
And what kind of immortal realm creature

435
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,640
Let me go!

436
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,280
is this Mufeng Butterfly?

437
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,840
The Mufeng Butterfly is innocent.

438
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,440
Please have mercy, Your Highness!

439
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
I must banish it to the mortal realm

440
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,720
and let it cultivate from the start.

441
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,560
Mufeng Butterfly did nothing.

442
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,440
Why did you do that?

443
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,720
It looks like this girl

444
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
just wants to work against me today.

445
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,160
This is intolerable!

446
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,000
Who is making so much noise here?

447
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,520
I heard a lot of noise

448
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,880
that disturbed His Majesty's rest.

449
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,960
So I came here to check out,

450
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,280
only to find that it is Your Highness!

451
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
It's not my intention to disturb
the foster brother's rest,

452
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,680
but this fairy maid is just too annoying!

453
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,240
It made me so angry!

454
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,400
Don't tell foster brother about this.

455
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
Now that the fairy maid is unfamiliar
with the manners,

456
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,520
ground her into the Imperial Kitchen to repent

457
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,520
about her own guilt.

458
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,280
Eh...

459
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,040
Leave now!

460
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,080
What about Mufeng...

461
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,760
Go!

462
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,920
Leave now!

463
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,160
Yes!

464
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,560
Your Highness!

465
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,000
Your Highness!

466
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,120
It's too late at night.

467
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,560
Please take a rest for the day!

468
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,280
You!

469
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,880
What a pity for the Mufeng Butterfly!

470
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,320
It did nothing wrong.

471
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,440
Zhihe is to blame for this.

472
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,200
She beat the butterfly nowhere!

473
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,120
Forget it!

474
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,320
The sorrowless flower has bloomed.

475
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Sorrowless! Sorrowless!

476
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,160
It matches so well with the occasion.

477
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,360
I should make a wish.

478
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
I wish Tai Chen Palace

479
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
can stay sorrowless and disaster-free

480
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,640
and always remain beautiful.

481
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,240
Prayer is done.

482
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,280
You can't be wasted, right?

483
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,960
Something seems to be missing.

484
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,660
Yushi Flower Root,

485
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,560
East Sea Rime,

486
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
and the Zijin Honeydew!

487
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
This is more like it.

488
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,560
Hurry! Hurry up!

489
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,440
Get moving!

490
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,840
Jiu, get out of the way!

491
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,240
His Highness Lian Song and Si Ming

492
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
are coming to the palace to discuss
the scriptures with His Majesty.

493
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,720
It's not common for His Majesty to hold
a banquet in the palace to enjoy the flowers.

494
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
We should be careful

495
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
not to spoil it.

496
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,680
Yes!

497
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,920
Third Prince and Si Ming came here

498
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,000
to enjoy flowers and discuss scriptures.

499
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,560
I'm taking out the frosted liquor that
was brewed many years ago in particular.

500
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,600
Hope you don't mind my lousy brewing skill.

501
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,520
Frosted liquor is refreshing
and turns bitterness into sweetness.

502
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,760
It's uncommon among fairies

503
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,520
to have such an elegant taste.

504
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,920
Zhihe,

505
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,560
I heard that you formally acknowledged
the Doumu Lord as your master.

506
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Do you have any gain?

507
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,960
I do have some gain.

508
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,280
The scroll given by my foster brother yesterday

509
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,720
matches very well with my heartfelt emotion.

510
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,640
These two people

511
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,480
have met

512
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,120
or haven't met.

513
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,200
They miss each other.

514
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,000
They miss each other so deep

515
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
that even death won't tear them apart.

516
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,200
Serve the sweet and sour fish.

517
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,800
It is made with a new cooking skill.

518
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,240
Try it!

519
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,480
It's so shameful that

520
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,880
I forgot myself

521
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
when I tried this sweet and sour fish

522
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,320
for the first time.

523
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,160
I went into meditation right
where I was before I even sat down

524
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,560
and perceived the truth to a lot of
problems that puzzled me in the past.

525
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,960
It's hard to forget

526
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,480
in retrospect.

527
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,920
How about Third Prince having a try first today

528
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,480
so that you could teach me to taste

529
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
the Thoughts of Zen from His Majesty.

530
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,720
You flattered me.

531
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
I've tried it once.

532
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,680
It was impressive.

533
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
It's unnecessary to try it twice.

534
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,240
I smoked it with sandalwood.

535
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,720
It must taste differently.

536
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,400
Third Prince,

537
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,200
please!

538
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
Exaggerating!

539
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Amazing!

540
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,160
Amazing?

541
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,480
This dish you made is indeed delicious.

542
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,000
You are the only one in the Sky Kingdom

543
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,040
who has such an extraordinary skill.

544
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
What do you think of it, Third Prince?

545
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,280
This Glass fish

546
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,920
smells fishy in the first place.

547
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,680
After smoked by sandalwood,

548
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,600
it's both bitter and fishy.

549
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,800
This is as bad

550
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,840
as how it is in my heart.

551
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,040
I've gotta think about

552
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,720
Your Majesty's meaning behind it.

553
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,800
Where are the desserts?

554
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,720
Serve the Third Prince with some desserts.

555
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,240
Yes, Your Highness!

556
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,120
What are you waiting for?

557
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,360
Hurry! Hurry!

558
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,800
Where is the almond cake?

559
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,720
Make it quick!

560
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,040
Here it goes! Here it goes!

561
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,040
Help me with this.

562
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,960
Hurry up!

563
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,440
Coming!

564
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,000
OK!

565
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,320
Help me serve this.

566
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Don't make it too cold.

567
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,160
Jiu, serve the dishes!

568
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,160
Move! Move!

569
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,480
But I can't go out.

570
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,480
What are you waiting for? Go!

571
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,200
This is really a blessing in disguise!

572
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
I can finally see His Majesty!

573
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,640
Oh my god!

574
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,640
I screwed up this time!

575
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,440
Jiu served it!

576
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,360
The desert hasn't come yet.

577
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,000
Please allow me to check it out.

578
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,440
Please wait a second, foster brother and you all.

579
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,320
Your Highness!

580
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,080
Why are you here

581
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,280
but not in the Imperial Kitchen to repent?

582
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,480
There is not enough manpower in the Imperial Kitchen

583
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,160
and they are afraid to keep the guests
waiting for too long,

584
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,960
so I'm appointed to serve the dessert.

585
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,520
Leave it!

586
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,320
I'll take over from here.

587
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,720
You get back immediately!

588
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:13,880
Remember!

589
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,600
You can't step out of the Imperial Kitchen
without my permission.

590
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,560
But I didn't...

591
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,120
No!

592
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,080
I've been here for so long.

593
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,320
I must meet His Majesty today!
