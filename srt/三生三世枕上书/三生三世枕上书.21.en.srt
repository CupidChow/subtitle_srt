00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 21

3
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,420
Song Xuanren,

4
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,860
the whole secret chamber hasn't another way out.

5
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,740
You can't escape from here.

6
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,540
Let's have a quick fight to decide the winner.

7
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,580
If I kill you in person,

8
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,820
we won't owe each other anything.

9
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,700
We don't have to fight

10
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,140
any more in the rest of life.

11
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,300
It's you again

12
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,420
who disturb my business over and over.

13
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Xiaojiu.

14
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,420
Your Majesty,

15
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,100
the knife he's holding is a demon knife.

16
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,500
Who on earth are you, a human being or a demon?

17
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,620
It'll be fine that

18
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,620
you protect him this hard.

19
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,060
I'll make you accompany him to death.

20
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,020
Kill them both.

21
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,860
Ye Qingti.

22
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,380
Your Majesty, you go first.

23
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,300
Go with me.

24
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,180
Quick.

25
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,140
Quick.

26
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,140
Run.

27
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,980
Quick.

28
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,980
Run.

29
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,180
Qingti.

30
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,220
Don't.

31
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,060
Let's go.

32
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,260
Don't.

33
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,100
Qingti.

34
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,780
Let's go.

35
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,220
Qingti.

36
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,700
Go.

37
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,340
Qingti.

38
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,740
Qingti.

39
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,340
Qingti.

40
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Qingti.

41
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,260
Don't.

42
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,460
Qingti.

43
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,860
Don't.

44
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,340
Don't.

45
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,660
Xiaojiu.

46
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,700
Xiaojiu.

47
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,140
Xiaojiu.

48
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,100
Don't scare me, Xiaojiu.

49
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,300
Xiaojiu.

50
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,740
Xiaojiu.

51
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,180
What's on earth is happening?

52
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,740
The emperor of the State of Chengyu appeared in a sudden.

53
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,060
But

54
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,700
he is Emperor Dong Hua.

55
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,260
Dong Hua?

56
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
Have you seen him clearly?

57
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,060
Absolutely clearly.

58
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,780
Dong Hua goes to the mortal realm?

59
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,620
For soul-locking jade?

60
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,660
Your Highness,

61
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,660
what should we do now?

62
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,060
Go back to the State of Chong'an first.

63
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,420
We'll talk about others later.

64
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,100
Yes.

65
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
How is she?

66
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,020
The pulse of Madam Jiu is gentle,

67
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
but her wound is strange.

68
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,860
Her wound is deep,

69
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,420
but she's not bleeding.

70
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,700
And the wound isn't healing.

71
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,780
When can she wake up?

72
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,740
Report to Your Majesty.

73
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,300
Madam Jiu might have a heart disease.

74
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,500
When she can wake up

75
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,620
may...

76
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,380
may depend on her fortune.

77
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,500
I'm going to prescribe some medicines
for invigorating heart first.

78
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,340
All of you withdraw.

79
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,460
Yes.

80
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,140
Xiaojiu,

81
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,020
I always think you don't care about me,

82
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,940
but this time,

83
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,540
you've saved my life
without concerning about your own safety again.

84
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,620
I knew yesterday

85
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,820
that you're not a mortal.

86
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,740
Then where do you come from?

87
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,460
Are you an immortal in heaven?

88
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,700
Please answer me.

89
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,460
I want to accompany you

90
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,940
instead of going anywhere.

91
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,340
I want

92
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,140
us to forget everything that has happened.

93
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,820
I want a fresh start.

94
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,140
Withdraw.

95
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,180
- Yes. - Yes.

96
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,900
I'll hold an elaborate funeral for my elder brother.

97
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,060
Rest assured, mother.

98
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,780
Don't bury him.

99
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,220
Don't bury him.

100
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,420
Mother.

101
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,060
I'm so sad.

102
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,940
I even hate myself

103
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,180
for not disciplining your elder brother.

104
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,700
Mother.

105
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,940
I try that hard to raise you two up.

106
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,860
What worries me the most

107
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,700
is that you two may engage in a fratricidal struggle on some day.

108
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,460
The day has finally come,

109
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,820
and it has also led to a catastrophe.

110
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,700
So many innocent people were killed,

111
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,780
and our State of Chengyu has been harshly weakened.

112
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,540
Song Xuanying,

113
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,900
he's not my son,

114
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,740
but the sinner of the entire dynasty.

115
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,300
Mother.

116
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,300
He doesn't deserve a funeral.

117
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,100
Let him decay in the underground palace.

118
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Xuanren,

119
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:48,180
the whole State of Chengyu will count on you alone.

120
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,820
I know it'll be hard,

121
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,380
but you have to take the responsibility,
no matter how hard it will be.

122
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,580
We can't let the State of Chengyu fall down in our generation.

123
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,900
I get it.

124
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,100
Rest assured, mother.

125
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,820
Thanks to

126
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,940
Madam Jiu

127
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,380
and Ye Qingti this time.

128
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,860
Ye Qingti sacrificed himself for you.

129
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,660
It's enough.

130
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,180
Don't hate him anymore.

131
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,260
As for Bai Xiaojiu.

132
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,700
Let it go.

133
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,660
Your affection for her

134
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,220
and her worship for you

135
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,260
are what I haven't expected.

136
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,540
She has saved you again.

137
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,460
I've figured it out.

138
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,340
Later,

139
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,060
regardless of you allowing her to go back where she comes from,

140
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,660
or be a Madam continuously,

141
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,140
or even the empress,

142
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,060
I won't stop you.

143
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,100
Mother.

144
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,740
Ren'er,

145
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,700
what a man

146
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,740
should do in his entire life is learn to endure.

147
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
It's impossible

148
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,940
to let oneself enjoy the time

149
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
while make other people satisfied.

150
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,660
There're too many things.

151
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,140
There's too much sorrow.

152
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,700
What we can do is endure.

153
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,060
Maybe it's the grief of being an imperial member.

154
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,820
Mother,

155
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,420
lie down to have a rest.

156
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,100
Qingti.

157
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,580
Don't hide yourself, Qingti.

158
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,660
Ye Qingti,

159
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,580
is it you?

160
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,100
Qingti.

161
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Qingti.

162
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,820
Qingti,

163
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,940
you died because of me.

164
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,820
In the three realms,

165
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,180
where on earth are you?

166
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,260
Where on earth are you?

167
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,140
What's up?

168
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,620
What are you hiding?

169
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,740
Nothing.

170
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,660
Just a little something

171
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,140
I wanted to give you.

172
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,500
But I haven't got the chance.

173
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,220
You can't take back what you sent out.

174
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,380
Take it.

175
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,180
It's beautiful.

176
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,940
Really?

177
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,540
I thought you got tired of the delicate articles in the palace,

178
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,980
and don't fancy something like it.

179
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,100
No, it's not true.

180
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,020
Does it look nice?

181
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,900
You like it?

182
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm glad you like it.

183
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,340
Do you regret it?

184
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,300
No.

185
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,220
I just feel sorry

186
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,780
to drag you into this.

187
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,220
No need to be so polite to me.

188
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,820
Run.

189
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,380
Qingti.

190
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,300
Qingti,

191
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,100
you lost your life

192
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,620
because of my stubbornness.

193
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,140
Now that I can't make up for you now,

194
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,500
I can observe three years of mourning for you.

195
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,500
Your Highness, you wake up.

196
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,580
Call someone

197
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
to report to His Majesty that

198
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,300
Her Highness has woken up.

199
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,420
Yes.

200
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,620
Your Highness,

201
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,420
you've scared me so much.

202
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,900
You finally wake up.

203
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,260
Your Highness,

204
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,220
what do you wear on your head?

205
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,260
What time is it?

206
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,940
It's past 11 o'clock at night.

207
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,660
Your Highness, where are you going?

208
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,580
I want to take a walk.

209
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,180
Wait for me, Your Highness.

210
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,780
Allow me to accompany you.

211
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,860
Muyun,

212
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,460
leave me alone.

213
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
Cheng Yu,

214
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,940
Ye Qingti is dead.

215
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,580
I've never expected that there would be someone

216
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,700
who's willing to die for me.

217
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,820
I owe him a life.

218
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,460
Dying for you

219
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,180
perhaps is his destiny.

220
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,820
What else can I do?

221
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,500
How can I requite him?

222
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,140
Human being is originally different from the immortal.

223
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,540
There's nothing you can do

224
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,380
but wait for the next opportunity.

225
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
Perhaps

226
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,900
you'll meet each other again.

227
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,580
You have to take good care of yourself
no matter how deep sorrow you are in.

228
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,940
The powder can heal a wound cut by a demon knife.

229
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,740
Keep it well.

230
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,380
Apply it on time.

231
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,260
Don't follow me.

232
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,700
Yes.

233
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,580
Go back with me.

234
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,060
Why do I have to go back?

235
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
I'm fine here.

236
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,340
I want to admire the moon here alone.

237
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,420
I don't want to go back.

238
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,100
Fine. I'll accompany you.

239
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
Are you willing to remain my empress?

240
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,900
Everything has come to an end.

241
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,660
Let's have a fresh start, shall we?

242
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,100
If you don't prefer the constrictions,

243
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,580
I'll do whatever you wish,

244
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,860
just the same as we used to do.

245
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,260
What do you think?

246
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,860
Quick. Report to His Majesty.

247
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,500
Her Highness has gone again.

248
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,260
What?

249
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,220
Hurry up.

250
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,220
Have you found her?

251
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,340
We have searched everywhere,

252
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,140
but there's no trace of her in the imperial palace.

253
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,340
Report.

254
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,820
Your Majesty, there comes the news.

255
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,180
The guard at the Jiangyu Gate reported that

256
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,500
Madam Jiu rode outside the palace
towards the west early in the morning.

257
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,380
Prepare a horse.

258
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,500
Hurry up. Prepare a horse.

259
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,140
Yes.

260
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,300
Qingti,

261
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,700
it's me who get you involved in trouble this life.

262
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,220
It's all my fault.

263
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,780
It's all because I cling to the happiness in the mortal realm.

264
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,980
I cling to the affection of His Majesty.

265
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,740
And I fail to end everything soon.

266
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,620
It's all my fault.

267
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,980
Xiaojiu.

268
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,660
Don't come here.

269
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,540
Sure.

270
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,140
As you wish.

271
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,460
Don't stand there.

272
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,940
It's too dangerous.

273
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,020
Come here.

274
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,780
Come.

275
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,460
Your Majesty,

276
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,460
you've been asking me for

277
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,140
who is the one in my heart, haven't you?

278
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,300
The one I put in my heart

279
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,060
is Ye Qingti.

280
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,980
I don't believe what you're saying.

281
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,260
You must be lying to me.

282
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,260
I have asked Ye Qingti.

283
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,820
You don't love him at all.

284
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,740
If you do love him,

285
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,940
why do you save me over and over?

286
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,220
Come here.

287
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,140
We can have a talk.

288
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,860
Since I came to the imperial palace,

289
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,900
being an Imperial Lady,

290
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,260
a Madam,

291
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,900
even an empress

292
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,180
hasn't made me happy.

293
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Because the one I love isn't you.

294
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,300
Fine. Fine. Fine.

295
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,500
It's fine.

296
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,980
Even though

297
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,300
the one you loved earlier is him,

298
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,500
he has already died now.

299
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,100
Let's start with a clean slate, shall we?

300
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,900
Why...

301
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,980
why don't you accept me, even though he has died?

302
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,860
Do I mean

303
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,140
nothing to you in your heart?

304
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,860
Fine.

305
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,580
I'll do what you wish.

306
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,180
I won't force you.

307
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,740
I'll let you go.

308
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,980
Let you leave the imperial palace.

309
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,380
Let you have the life you want, will you?

310
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,220
Xiaojiu,

311
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,020
come here.

312
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,980
Come here.

313
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,820
Your Majesty,

314
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,740
I once expected that

315
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,980
I would be in my deepest sorrow
when I loved you without your response.

316
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,700
But now I find that

317
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,740
the sorrow that you fall for me without my response

318
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,100
will overwhelm me.

319
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,420
Your Majesty,

320
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,060
I'm sorry for

321
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,700
not responding to your love.

322
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,180
It's not only your misfortune,

323
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,620
but also mine.

324
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,460
Xiaojiu.

325
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,620
Your Majesty,

326
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,580
goodbye.

327
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,740
Don't.

328
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,940
Your Majesty.

329
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,220
Xiaojiu.

330
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:26,860
Your Majesty.

331
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,580
Your Majesty.

332
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,420
Your Majesty.

333
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,420
Your Majesty.

334
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,580
No.

335
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,180
No.

336
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,900
Xiaojiu.

337
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,540
Xiaojiu.

338
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,820
Xiaojiu, wait for me.

339
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,020
Wait for me.

340
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,140
Isn't anything wrong with His Majesty, is it?

341
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,140
Your Excellency,

342
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,700
the disease His Majesty got doesn't matter.

343
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
But...

344
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,900
but His Majesty is heart-broken,

345
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,660
and has no will to live,

346
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,180
which matters the most.

347
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,060
It's...

348
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,460
You must have some methods to bring Ye Qingti back to life,

349
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,100
mustn't you?

350
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,860
Ye Qingti is killed by a demon knife,

351
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,180
and has been penetrated by the vicious demon spirit.

352
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,180
Even if he had an opportunity to resurrect,

353
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,660
he would only be a vicious demon,

354
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,460
experiencing generations of miserable cycle.

355
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,980
Isn't there any way to help him out?

356
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,620
The only way to make it up is

357
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,260
to create another immortal body

358
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,020
to neutralize the demon spirit.

359
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,540
And then clear up what he owns as a human being
in the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool

360
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,020
to make him an immortal.

361
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
Being an immortal?

362
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,740
Wouldn't that be better than going back to the mortal realm?

363
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,220
Then I'll be able to see Qingti

364
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,620
in the Sky Kingdom.

365
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,620
But it'll be hard during the process.

366
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,660
Think about it.

367
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,340
How hard will it be
to make an ordinary person become an immortal?

368
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
How can it be possible

369
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,820
to create an immortal body so easily?

370
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,460
How can an immortal body be created?

371
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,260
There is a kind of tree named pimpon,

372
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,460
which blossoms once every ten years

373
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,700
and bears fruits once every ten years.

374
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,580
According to the age of the tree,

375
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,740
the fruits can have different uses.

376
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,540
Fruits of certain age

377
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,660
can not only make a mortal back to life,

378
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,580
but can also turn a mortal into an immortal.

379
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,020
What a magical fruit it is!

380
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,860
Then where can I find a pimpon tree?

381
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,940
In Sukhavati,

382
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,380
over the Sky Kingdom.

383
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,020
There are also several places where pimpon trees can be found,

384
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,500
but unluckily,

385
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,780
pimpon trees among the Heaven and the Earth

386
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,020
haven't borne any fruit

387
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,820
since the recent thousands of years.

388
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,380
However, these pimpon trees don't die away,

389
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,300
they have been growing.

390
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,500
Maybe they can bear some fruits

391
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,300
in a short while.

392
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,220
Wait for the opportunity.

393
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,020
You will have to wait for the opportunity

394
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,740
that can make a mortal become an immortal.

395
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,140
I can help you

396
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,700
to put Ye Qing in the Yuanqi Terrace first,

397
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,260
letting him absorb some energy.

398
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,380
I can keep him in safety temporarily,

399
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,300
which can buy you more time.

400
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,100
Your Majesty.

401
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,380
Ren'er,

402
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,740
why do you look so withered?

403
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,580
Mother.

404
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,340
Ren'er,

405
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,820
you are the emperor of the State of Chengyu.

406
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,100
You can't give up on yourself to this extent.

407
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,300
If you keep acting like this,

408
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
what should civil and military officials

409
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,100
and all citizens

410
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,860
of our state do?

411
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,740
Do you forget what late Emperor has taught you?

412
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,540
How can you abandon the responsibility for

413
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,180
inheriting the achievements and merits made by forebears

414
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,220
just because of a woman?

415
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,700
Ren'er,

416
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:13,220
I've already lost one child.

417
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,260
I can't endure to

418
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,460
lose you anymore.

419
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,540
Ren'er.

420
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,220
I'm not a filial son.

421
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,380
Mother, please choose another to be the emperor.

422
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,660
Make it brighter.

423
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,260
Your Majesty,

424
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,980
all the candles have been lit.

425
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,980
Make it brighter,

426
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,780
then I can see Xiaojiu's face clearly.

427
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,860
