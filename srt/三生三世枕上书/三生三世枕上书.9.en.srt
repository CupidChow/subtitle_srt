1
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 9

3
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,480
How is the marriage? Finally you are back.

4
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
Fengjiu has bullied

5
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
those youths that her aunts introduced

6
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,560
seriously.

7
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,200
Her aunts were so angry that

8
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,880
they went to tell her granny Madam Fu Mi.

9
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
You mean Fengjiu?

10
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

11
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,520
They said she had the good look in vain

12
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,880
without becoming

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,480
the queen spirit to fool with the male gods,

14
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
but playing with spears and swords every day.

15
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,560
Caring for nothing but eating and being lazy,

16
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,160
her attractive appearance is totally wasted on her

17
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
with self-abandonment.

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
They were so angry

19
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,480
that they beat their breast and stamped their feet.

20
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,600
How did her granny say?

21
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
Naturally she stood by Fengjiu,

22
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
blaming her aunts

23
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,120
and saying that the youths that they introduced

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,480
were not good enough.

25
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,720
Now she is thinking of

26
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,520
finding someone for Fengjiu by herself.

27
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,520
Probably, she wants to

28
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
find someone from a family holding high
official positions for at least three generations

29
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,120
with real power and handsome look.

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
He can't be a warrior.

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,600
Only in this way can he match with Fengjiu.

32
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,720
And their baby fox in the future

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,960
can be cleverer and cuter.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,560
She won't disgrace the red fox clan

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,760
and nine-tailed white fox clan.

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,480
Only these requirements will make
most of the youth among the gods

37
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
lose the chance.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,920
This is just some general requirements.

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,480
As for the details,

40
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,280
she will list them after she returns

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
and ask my father to help Fengjiu choose her husband carefully.

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a pity that they don't know

43
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,960
Fengjiu has chosen a perfect husband.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
Not exactly so.

45
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,880
Having forgotten most of them,

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,120
she is now as lively as before.

47
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,720
If she really forgets everything,

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,200
you won't see such a scene.

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,640
You know how difficult it is to make the peach blossom wine.

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,080
She has learned to make it day after day without rest and sleep,

51
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,640
and made lots of wine.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,960
She is forcing herself to stop thinking of him.

53
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,520
As the only grandchild in the Bai family,

54
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
she is loved in every possible means.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,960
Why can't she have a happy marriage?

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,120
Jingwei, don't complain to me any more.

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,920
Did you hear what I said?

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,080
Got it, Sister Fengjiu.

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,720
Shall we go down the mountain by foot

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
or magic arts?

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,760
Someone is coming.

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Xie Guchou.

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
Why are you here?

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,080
Go back first.

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,840
You ask me to return alone again?

66
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
I will make bean paste cakes tonight.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,200
I can leave two for you, OK?

68
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,240
OK.

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
Goodbye, Sister Fengjiu.

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Leave quickly.

71
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Xie Guchou, why are you here to see me?

72
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,400
Qingqiu has good scenery.

73
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,600
Let's walk around.

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Recently, there is something

75
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,800
that I think you should know.

76
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,080
How could be there

77
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,920
anything in the haven and earth

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,240
that can baffle you, My Lord of Nether World?

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,360
People in the mortal realm have natural deaths.

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,560
As for the death of spirits, it only
has something to do with three gods.

81
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,520
Lord of the Southern Dipper, Lord of the Northern Dipper

82
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
and Lord of the Nether World.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,840
The Southern Dipper is in charge of living,
the Northern Dipper is in charge of death

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,520
and the Nether World is in charge of the imprisonment
and judgment of a person after his or her death

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,200
as well as a Yuanqi Terrace.

86
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
Only you can trouble others.

87
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,320
How could there be anything that can trouble you?

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,520
Are you still thinking

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,480
whether to tell it to me ?

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I know.

91
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,480
Maybe you want to talk about the wine that I will give you.

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Don't worry.

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,520
I've promised, of course I will give you.

94
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,520
Moreover,

95
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,240
it's Zhe Yan's peach blossom wine.

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,080
However,

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Zhe Yan and my uncle

98
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,240
are angry with each other these days.

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Nobody dares to get close to them.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,200
Even I

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,160
also feel awkward.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
It's about Emperor Dong Hua.

103
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Maybe it's unknown among the people from heaven and earth.

104
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,000
Perhaps the Southern Dipper and the
Northern Dipper haven't perceived it, either.

105
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,560
Just because I am in charge of Yuanqi Terrace,

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,920
I just perceived it.

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,040
Sorting out the Yuanqi Book,

108
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,440
I found there was someone in another world

109
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
who didn't have a marriage.

110
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,400
I went to check,

111
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
only to find he hadn't ever appeared in the six-realm encounters.

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,800
You know every living thing comes to this world

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
through the Yuanqi Terrance.

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,160
In order to change the fate without my permission,

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,800
only the past-life magic can help make it.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,640
In this world,

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,400
few people have such magic arts.

118
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Among the gods, besides me,

119
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,760
only God Yun Zhuang can make it.

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
Tai Chen Palace?

121
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,200
Could it be...

122
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,320
It was said that His Majesty

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,160
asked to be born in the earth

124
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,720
because he wanted to experience
the eight sufferings on the mortal realm.

125
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,040
It's recorded in Si Ming's Book of Fate that

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,640
His Majesty will be born
on the mortal realm three hundred years later.

127
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,800
During these three hundred years,

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,800
he's cultivating peacefully in Tai Chen Palace.

129
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,480
While cultivating,

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,600
it's possible that he asks God Yun Zhuang

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,600
to play past-life magic on his shadow to make him

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,280
appear in another world and have experiences here.

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,040
Is it really His Majesty?

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Since His Majesty concealed it to all the other gods,

135
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
it's likely that it's a secret.

136
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,200
I have considered for a long time to tell you this.

137
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,680
Do you know why?

138
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
It can't be that

139
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
you want to have one more pot of wine.

140
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,280
Why are you still behaving so strong-willed in front of me?

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,880
Many years ago, you invited me to drink wine.

142
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,080
When you were drunk, you told me His Majesty

143
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
ever saved you from the mouth of the tiger demon.

144
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
In order to repay his kindness,

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,120
you wanted to save him in Ten-evil Lotus Land,

146
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,040
only to be saved by him again.

147
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
In the end, you still

148
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
owe him the gratitude.

149
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,030
Do you want to find a chance to repay him?

150
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,520
I think it's the right time now.

151
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,360
Facing His Majesty's shadow

152
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,670
is better than facing himself.

153
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm afraid it's a little awkward

154
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,920
to return to Tai Chen Palace to see him.

155
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,360
You're different from before,

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
saying too much today.

157
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,720
You ever told me that

158
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,080
sorrow

159
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,440
would fade as time went by.

160
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,280
It can't make sense.

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
Why?

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,880
Hundreds of years have passed,

163
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm still as sad

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,560
as I was then.

165
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,840
That's because it's not long enough.

166
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,640
Actually,

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
His Majesty also did many things for me,

168
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
such as building a hexagon pavilion for me to enjoy the cool,

169
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,200
roasting sweet potato for me,

170
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,600
cooking sweet and sour fish for me

171
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,680
as well as binding up my wounds.

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
Is his kindness to you

173
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,240
so little?

174
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,800
What about those bad memories?

175
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,880
As for the bad memories...

176
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,720
Once I corrected the map of Lian Song's short knife.

177
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,640
Ji Heng said she corrected it.

178
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,760
I was so angry that I bit her.

179
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,060
You start biting people now?

180
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,520
His Majesty scolded me

181
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
and drove me out of the room.

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,440
What happened later?

183
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
Later,

184
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,120
I scratched Ji Heng and hurt her.

185
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
His Majesty locked me up.

186
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Feeling that I was so poor,

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
Chong Lin let me out.

188
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,200
Unexpectedly, I met Ji Heng's pet.

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
It scratched me, hurt me

190
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,960
and threw me to the pond.

191
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,880
It was Si Ming who saved me.

192
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
Later

193
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,320
His Majesty would marry Ji Heng.

194
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,600
So I left the Sky Kingdom.

195
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
Actually,

196
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,480
Si Ming is right.

197
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,600
He said I had a great affection for His Majesty,

198
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,160
which was as deep as the sea.

199
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
I don't how deep the love is.

200
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,160
Compared to him

201
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,400
who is in a high rank honorably,

202
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
I'd rather that he is not so kind.

203
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,800
Then

204
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,400
only I myself

205
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
can feel his kindness.

206
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Only I can love him.

207
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,440
I'm sure to be kind to him.

208
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,520
As for your kindness to him,

209
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
he didn't know it in the past

210
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,160
and won't know in the future.

211
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
At that time, he was indifferent to you,

212
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,760
didn't you feel sad?

213
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,080
Of course I was sad.

214
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,800
I love His Majesty,

215
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,960
so I changed myself into a pet.

216
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
His Majesty would certainly regard me

217
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,280
as a pet.

218
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,880
As for pets,

219
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
sometimes, they are favored,

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,880
but sometimes, they're not.

221
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,120
When he was indifferent to me,

222
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,680
I was very sad.

223
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,200
Maybe in my heart,

224
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,680
I didn't regard myself as a pet.

225
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,000
You have been humble enough in front of him,

226
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,440
giving up your precious fur,

227
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,480
noble identity,

228
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,200
your family and friends for him.

229
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
You have done enough

230
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,920
to repay his kindness.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,280
I give up them

232
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,640
just for my selfish desire.

233
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,040
It's not the same with repaying his kindness.

234
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,480
You're right.

235
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,800
As for His Majesty, it's just his shadow

236
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
that comes to the mortal realm.

237
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,480
I think it's a good chance.

238
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
Since His Majesty conceals it from other gods,

239
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,640
I won't ask him

240
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
where he is.

241
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,240
Why not

242
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,720
take my shadow,

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
do the same to mine as His Majesty's

244
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,520
and make me born where he is?

245
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,320
I hope my shadow

246
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
can take the place of me to repay his kindness.

247
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,400
When he is in danger, I can save him.

248
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,880
As for anything he wants,

249
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,880
I can help him to get it.

250
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,800
You can help him get anything he wants?

251
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
What if he can't get what he wants in the end

252
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,800
and you can't repay his kindness?

253
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,280
Didn't you say that His Majesty would

254
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,360
go to the mortal realm by himself to experience
his misfortunes three hundred years later?

255
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,560
Then I will ask Si Ming clearly

256
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,720
where His Majesty is.

257
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I think when I see him at that time,

258
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,160
I won't be as helpless as now.

259
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,760
OK.

260
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,280
Give me half of your shadow.

261
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,920
No matter you repay his kindness or not,

262
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,680
I will inform you at that time.

263
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,720
You Majesty, you're awake.

264
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
I cost most of my cultivation this time.

265
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,400
Next time before I go to the Miaoyi Chasm,

266
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
I need to go to another place to recover my cultivation.

267
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,960
Your Majesty, you mean

268
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,040
your experience in the mortal realm
should be brought forward, right?

269
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,360
But...

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
Through experiencing my misfortunes,

271
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,840
I can recover my cultivation as soon as possible.

272
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
Since you have made up your mind,

273
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,000
you must be careful with everything.

274
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,120
Chief Eunuch.

275
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,440
We have something important to tell His Majesty.

276
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
Wait a moment. I will go to report it.

277
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,800
Hurry up. Be careful.

278
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Hurry up.

279
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,880
Hot water. Hot water.

280
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,480
Here it is.

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
My sister is sure to give birth to little prince safely.

283
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,960
Put in energy.

284
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,720
Hold on.

285
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,240
It will come out soon.

286
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,760
Change some hot water.

287
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
Quickly. Let me change it.

288
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,440
Hot water, hot water.

289
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,320
OK.

290
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,520
Chief Eunuch.

291
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,160
With flood in the south and drought in the north,

292
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,720
serious disasters are everywhere.

293
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,120
The wild is full of the dead bodies of the starved.

294
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,640
Chief Eunuch. Please inform His Majesty

295
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,160
to decide on a way to relieve the people in disaster.

296
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,520
It's...

297
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,880
The disaster can't be delayed,

298
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
but Her Majesty is giving birth now,

299
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
please

300
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,480
hold on for a moment.

301
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,720
A baby was born.

302
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,440
Well,

303
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,440
it's not a good sign.

304
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,640
Your Majesty.

305
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,720
Congratulations! It's a little prince.

306
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,600
Good.

307
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Fantastic!

308
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,920
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

309
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,360
Bad news.

310
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,960
Bad news. Your Majesty.

311
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,840
Her Majesty died.

312
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,160
Your Majesty, it's flooded in the south.

313
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,000
With continuous rainstorms,

314
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
many rivers have overflown.

315
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,440
Common people lost their homes.

316
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Your Majesty, there is drought in the north.

317
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,640
Canals and ditches is dried out.
The crops nearly have no harvest.

318
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,880
Grass and trees withered and died.
The wild is full of the dead bodies of the starved.

319
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,310
There are natural and man-made disasters everywhere.

320
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,240
The situation is dangerous.

321
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,830
Your Majesty. Please...

322
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,560
Well,

323
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,070
I see.

324
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,960
As for the flood in the south,

325
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,240
strengthen the dike,

326
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,840
dig ditches to shunt the flood.

327
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,760
As for the drought in the north,

328
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
draw the water between the mountains

329
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,760
and transport people to the places which have food.

330
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,320
Open the granaries in the north and south at the same time

331
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,080
to aid the common people.

332
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
Si Kou.

333
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,840
Relieve the refugees and punish the roving bandits.

334
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Yes. Your Majesty.

335
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,560
Si Kong.

336
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,440
Reduce the tax with grain supply.

337
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,280
Yes. Your Majesty.

338
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,600
Si Ma.

339
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm here.

340
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,840
Lead the soldiers

341
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
to save and help the common people.

342
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,640
Yes. Your Majesty.

343
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,040
Please perform your own functions well.

344
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,840
Anybody who is against my orders

345
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,760
should be killed.

346
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm at your command.

347
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Your Majesty.

348
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,920
Leave.

349
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,400
Yes.

350
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,920
Your Majesty.

351
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,160
Grant the child a name.

352
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,880
Xuerong is kind and broad-minded.

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,080
Just call him

354
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,880
Xuanren.

355
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,800
Xuanren.

356
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
Song Xuanren.

357
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
Lord Cheng Yu.

358
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,600
How are you doing these days?

359
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,520
I'm fine.

360
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,480
Si Ming.

361
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,680
I have a friend who has cultivated to be a fairy recently.

362
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
She decided to go to Qingyun Hall

363
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,000
to pay a formal visit to His Majesty on the fifth of May.

364
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,720
However, there is news from Tai Chen Palace that

365
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,120
the ceremony this year has been canceled temporarily.

366
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,640
What's wrong?

367
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,040
Well.

368
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,400
I don't know.

369
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
It's certain that you know it. Tell me.

370
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,400
I...

371
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,360
I really don't know.

372
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,040
Or I will ask Lian Song to ask you about it.

373
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,160
Don't mention it to anybody else.

374
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,120
His Majesty has gone to the mortal realm
to experience his misfortunes in advance.

375
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,080
Fengjiu.

376
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,680
Cheng Yu.

377
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,480
It's a sunny day today.

378
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,120
It's a pity that you don't go out to have a walk.

379
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,640
Come to play with me outside.

380
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I don't want to go out.

381
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
I want to stay here.

382
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,240
Then go to my palace

383
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,280
to drink with me.

384
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,560
I don't want to drink.

385
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,000
It has been over for a long time.

386
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,360
Are you still sad for him?

387
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,520
Cheng Yu.

388
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,240
Don't worry about me.

389
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm fine.

390
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,160
I don't believe it.

391
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,040
Otherwise you won't be so unhappy.

392
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,680
Maybe

393
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
it's because I haven't repaid his kindness.

394
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,920
If I make it someday,

395
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
then maybe I will be relieved.

396
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,560
You still want to repay his kindness?

397
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,400
It's not the same thing.

398
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,280
Zhe Yan also told me

399
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,080
I should earn my dignity little by little.

400
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
Loving His Majesty and forgetting His Majesty

401
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,720
are my own things.

402
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,440
His Majesty has ever saved me.

403
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,480
It's reasonable for me

404
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,280
to remember to repay his kindness all the time.

405
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,240
I got a piece of news about His Majesty.

406
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,160
Maybe it can help you.

407
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,480
What is it?

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,560
His Majesty has gone to the mortal realm
to experience his misfortunes.

409
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,840
Isn't it said that it should be three hundred years later?

410
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,360
Yeah. I didn't expect that it would be so soon.

411
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Is it reliable?

412
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,760
I heard Si Ming said it. It can't be false.

413
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,840
Then I must go to ask Si Ming.

414
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,040
Si Ming.

415
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,680
Si Ming.

416
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,880
Si Ming.

417
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,400
Si Ming.

418
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,800
Your Highness.

419
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,180
= Dong Hua =

420
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,480
Si Ming.

421
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,440
Why are you here in the Sky Kingdom?

422
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Si Ming.

423
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,320
I specially come to see you.

424
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,760
What's the matter?

425
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Is it true that His Majesty went to
the mortal realm to experience his misfortunes?

426
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,360
His Majesty went to experience his misfortunes?

427
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,520
I haven't heard of it.

428
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't conceal it from me. I have known it.

429
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,040
Who told you?

430
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,480
Si Ming, tell me

431
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,520
where His Majesty has gone.

432
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,840
Your Highness, don't ask about it.

433
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,160
Were you not seriously hurt last time?

434
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,160
Si Ming.

435
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,120
You know I didn't repay his kindness

436
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,920
last time I came to the Sky Kingdom.

437
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,680
After I returned to Qingqiu, I thought twice.

438
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,480
I think I should carry it through to the end.

439
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,840
So I want to take this chance

440
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
when His Majesty is experiencing
his misfortunes in the mortal realm

441
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,720
to repay his kindness.

442
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,280
Only in this way can I forget His Majesty completely.

443
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,680
I can understand your feelings.

444
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,680
But it's related to His Majesty's

445
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,440
failure or success in experiencing
his misfortunes in the mortal realm.

446
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,760
I still have some other official business to do.

447
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,640
So I can't stay with you anymore.

448
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,600
You'd better return to Qingqiu early.

449
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,280
Come here.

450
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,460
= Dong Hua =

451
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,800
Dear audience,

452
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,920
Today I will tell you

453
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,840
the story of national treasure.

454
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,840
It's said that when State of Chengyu was built at the beginning,

455
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,960
it was surrounded by strong neighboring states
which were like revenging tigers.

456
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,000
The former emperor always
personally led his troops to the battle

457
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
to resist the strong enemies.

458
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Once it was invaded by the strong enemies from the north.

459
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,200
The former emperor himself
was in command to challenge the enemies.

460
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,880
As soon as the battle formation was deployed,

461
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,040
unexpectedly, the foxy enemies stabbed them in the back.

462
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,840
Being injured,

463
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,640
the former emperor couldn't continue commanding the troops.

464
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,800
The generals and soldiers protected
the former emperor to withdraw while fighting.

465
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,520
Eventually, they got to a valley,

466
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
falling into the trap of the enemies.

467
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,440
The generals and soldiers fought in the bloody battle
for three days and nights.

468
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,560
However, there were so many enemies

469
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,400
and the ring of encirclement
was narrowed smaller and smaller.

470
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,760
The whole army was going to be destroyed completely.

471
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,720
It was at this very moment that

472
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,280
a shinning light

473
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,000
appeared in the sky.

474
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,160
A huge fireball

475
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,360
fell straight into the tent
of the enemies' supreme commander.

476
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,600
The enemies were in a chaos.

477
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,040
Taking the chance, the former emperor jumped

478
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,600
and led the generals and soldiers to rush ahead

479
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
and beat the enemies.

480
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,920
In the place where the fireball was fallen,

481
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,040
a precious stone was found,

482
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,000
which was regarded as a national treasure,

483
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,960
named Lingbi Stone.

484
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
Awesome!

485
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,440
A precious stone fell from the sky.

486
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,360
It's incredible.

487
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,000
You brag!

488
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,600
How dare I brag?

489
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
In the place where the precious stone fell,

490
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,720
there was a big pit smashed by it.

491
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,320
It is 30 miles away
from the city frontier juncture in the north

492
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,120
in a valley.

493
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,840
Whether it's true or false,
go to have a look and you'll know.

494
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,800
Battlefield

495
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,720
is a place with the most grievance.

496
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,320
Demon Lord.

497
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,800
How is she now?

498
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,880
Princess Ji Heng has got well,

499
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,720
but she hasn't regained her memory yet.

500
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,320
Is there any progress in your inquiry these days?

501
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,360
I have found that the soul-locking jade
is in State of Chengyu.

502
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,200
Take good care of her for me.

503
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Rest assured, Demon Lord.

504
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,200
This is a secret place in the three realms

505
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,440
with few tracks.

506
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,600
Nobody knows princess is here.

507
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,040
Ten years in the mortal realm is just in a blink of an eye.

508
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,160
Maybe she will be put into use soon.

509
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,560
Today

510
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,840
all the princes and sons of the aristocratic
families will hunt in the same hunting ground,

511
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,280
competing your skills of riding and shooting with each other

512
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,280
to show the strength of our state,

513
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,800
thinking of danger in times of peace
with the practice of military force.

514
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,920
You can show your skills and talent as mush as possible.

515
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,120
No need to be modest to each other.

516
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,440
Anybody who has many preys can be awarded.

517
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,360
- Thank you, father. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

518
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,320
Good.

519
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,320
As for the hunting in previous years,

520
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,560
it was judged by the number of the beasts.

521
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,280
I want to play it in another way this year.

522
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,680
What's your idea, father?

523
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,200
I think

524
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,080
we can change the rules this year.

525
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,840
Victory or defeat is judged
by the number of the preys of birds

526
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,000
and their rarity.

527
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,600
What do you think of it?

528
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,640
- You're so wise, father. - You're so wise, Your Majesty.

529
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,320
OK. Then let's begin.

530
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,400
The time is limited to six hours.

531
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,520
Ready!

532
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,760
Go!

533
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Your Highness,

534
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,600
are you OK?

535
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,640
I'm fine.

536
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,800
The horse can't run anymore.

537
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
Well,

538
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,360
the horse suddenly has a violent death.

539
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,080
It must be poisoned by someone.

540
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,680
I will go to report it to His Majesty.

541
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,360
Forget it.

542
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,680
Don't make more trouble.

543
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
Just say that the horse is ill.

544
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,640
Carry another horse here.

545
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,960
It's a pity.

546
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
Your Highness, will you blame me

547
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,560
for disturbing your skylark?

548
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,960
Brother, don't laugh at my poor shooting.

549
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
The skylark is not mine.

550
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,800
Hunting in the same hunting ground with fair competition,

551
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,880
the one who has better skills can win.

552
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,360
If you shoot it,

553
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,640
then it means my skill is not god enough.

554
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,920
Your Highness, you are really broad-minded.

555
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,040
Have you harvested much?

556
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
It's still empty.

557
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,760
Father did change the hunting rule this year.

558
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,560
Judging by the number of preys of birds,

559
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,480
it's more difficult than previous years.

560
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,600
No wonder you just hunted a pheasant.

561
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,800
You changed the horse on the field,

562
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,320
which will certainly affect your performance.

563
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,080
I can't blame the horse for my poor shooting skills.

564
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,040
I

565
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,200
hunted three crows, two sparrows

566
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
and a lark.

567
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,880
What about this?

568
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,560
I will give you one of my preys.

569
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,840
You can regard it as yours.

570
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,600
Neither of us tell it to others.

571
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,720
Father won't know it, either.

572
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,200
Thank you for your kindness, brother.

573
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,320
I don't have good shooting skills,.

574
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
let alone resort to trickery

575
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,080
to cheat father.

576
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,160
You're really ambitious!

577
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,960
Good luck to you!

578
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,560
You'd better hurry up.

579
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,960
Six hours

580
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,520
will be up soon.

581
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,280
Catch it.

582
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,360
It was shot by you.

583
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,160
If you didn't shoot,

584
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,200
maybe it's I who am lying on the ground now.

585
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,960
You deserve to have the golden eagle.

586
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,080
I am Ye Qingti.

587
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,840
Thank you for saving me.

588
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,160
Ye Qingti?

589
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,240
Are you from the family of Duke Yongning?

590
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,440
My father is Duke Yongning, Ye Zhenguan.

591
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,360
What's your name, please?

592
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,040
Song Xuanren.

593
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,840
Crown Prince.

594
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,560
I'm sorry to be impolite.

595
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,760
Forget it.

596
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
I've heard that you guard the frontier

597
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,360
with eminent achievements.

598
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,840
I regret not to have known you before.

599
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
It's my honor to hunt with you.

600
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,560
The golden eagle was hunted by you.

601
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,280
It's not mine.

602
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,840
Your Highness, you shot the pheasant first

603
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,040
and then used it to attract the golden eagle.

604
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,710
You behave carefully at each step with supreme wisdom.

605
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,760
I really appreciate you.

606
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,600
Naturally the prey belongs to you.

607
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,920
I'm leaving.

608
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,360
Where is Crown Prince?

609
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,800
The Crown Prince hasn't been back yet.

610
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,080
Father,

611
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,840
I just saw His Highness.

612
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,840
Without many preys,

613
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,360
I think maybe he is still looking for preys.

614
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,360
So the time was delayed.

615
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,680
Worthless!

616
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,960
Chief Eunuch!

617
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,920
By the way,

618
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,080
have you finished counting the preys of

619
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,880
the princes and sons of the aristocratic families?

620
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,400
Your Majesty,

621
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,080
it's almost done.

622
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,800
Among all the princes,

623
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,160
the Eldest Prince hunted the most.

624
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Among all the sons of the aristocratic families,

625
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,880
it's...

626
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,080
He is back.

627
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,160
His Highness is back.

628
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,120
Your Majesty, His Highness is back.

629
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,760
I'm sorry I'm late. Please forgive me, father.

630
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,040
Where is your prey?

631
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,080
A golden eagle!

632
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,440
He deserves to be the Crown Prince.

633
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,720
Good.

634
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,640
Xuanren.

635
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,000
Unexpectedly, you hunted a golden eagle.

636
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
It's hard to get it.

637
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,960
As for the hunting in the paddock,

638
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,840
according to the rules,

639
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,280
with hunting a golden eagle,

640
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,200
His Highness got the first place.

641
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,640
He is awarded a ferghana horse,

642
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,200
a Mubai Sword,

643
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,120
a plain silver armor with gold wire.

644
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,800
The Eldest Prince and General Ye also performed well.

645
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,040
They are awarded a ferghana horse each.

646
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,040
As for other people, go to get your awards by yourself.

647
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,360
- Thank you, Your Majesty. - Thank you, father.

648
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,040
Your Majesty, you are not in good health.

649
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,880
It's good to return to the palace early.

650
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,960
One more thing.

651
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,920
I received a battlefield report,

652
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
saying the State of Chong'an

653
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,600
frequently disturbed our border recently.

654
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,720
So the first prize winner of the hunting today

655
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,960
should go on an expedition instead of me
to pacify the disturbance in the border

656
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,720
and show the national prestige of our State of Chengyu.

657
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,240
As you wish.

658
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,880
I'm sure to succeed in carrying out the assignment.

659
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,800
Xuanren.

660
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,640
I appoint you as the commander in chief of the troops,

661
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,000
can you pacify the disturbance?

662
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,000
Your Majesty.

663
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
Although the State of Chong'an is a big state,

664
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,440
our State of Chengyu is administered
by father with kindness.

665
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,560
Working together as a whole country

666
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,520
and protected by the Lingbi Stone,

667
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,680
it's destined

668
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,320
to beat the enemies.

669
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,840
Good. You deserve to be the Crown Prince.

670
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,200
It's my duty to share your worries and burdens.

671
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,560
Ren,

672
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,560
it's the first time for you to go an expedition.

673
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,080
I have chosen a general

674
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,040
to help you.

675
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,880
I'm wondering who you chose.

676
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,640
The son of Duke Yongning, Ye Qingti.

677
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,960
Pay my visit to you, Your Majesty,

678
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,720
Your Highness.

679
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,760
Forget it.

680
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,120
Xuanren, Duke Yongning

681
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,920
spread their martial arts from generation to generation.
They're brave and skillful in battle.

682
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,280
All the generations go to fight in the battlefield
and repay the country with supreme loyalty.

683
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,720
Among the younger generation,

684
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,520
Ye Qingti is the most outstanding one.

685
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,160
I have appointed him as your vice commander.

686
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,760
I'm sure to help His Highness in my full support.

687
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,440
Father, you really considered thoroughly.

688
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,760
I will lead the army to the battlefield tomorrow.

689
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,880
Good.

690
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,040
Si Ming, finally you're back.

691
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,640
Si Ming.

692
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,080
Your Highness.

693
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,720
Turn up.

694
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,600
You read His Majesty's Book of Fate secretly!

695
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,920
Only you can do such a thing.

696
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,160
How dare you not admit after doing it?

697
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,560
It's not what you always do.

698
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,000
I just come to play with you.

699
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,720
Why are you so nervous?

700
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,360
What did you see?

701
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,880
What are you saying?

702
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,960
His Majesty's Book of Fate.

703
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,400
No.

704
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,640
Tell me the truth.

705
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,520
Is it true in the Book of Fate?

706
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,080
It says the state where His Majesty
is experiencing his misfortunes

707
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,280
is having a battlement with the neighboring state.

708
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,760
It's a dangerous battle that His Majesty

709
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,040
has to go to have an expedition by himself.

710
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,840
So you plan to go to the mortal realm secretly

711
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,760
to see His Majesty.

712
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,640
You said if I went to the mortal realm,

713
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,320
it would affect His Majesty's experiencing his misfortunes.

714
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,760
So I won't go there.

715
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,360
Even if I went to the mortal realm,

716
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,400
I would just glance at him secretly.

717
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,440
Can I do that?

718
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,040
No way.

719
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,920
I just cast a glance at him.

720
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,960
I won't disturb His Majesty.

721
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Can I do that?

722
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
What if His Majesty was just in danger

723
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,560
when you glanced at him secretly?

724
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Can you stand by doing nothing?

725
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,000
I...

726
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,200
Of course you can't.

727
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
It's certain that you will help him.

728
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,680
But Your Highness,

729
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,840
if fairies use magic arts in the mortal realm,

730
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,000
they must be backfired.

731
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,200
As for the result of the backfire,

732
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,720
you can't stand it.

733
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,600
How serious is it?

734
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,040
You will be backfired

735
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,720
by the same degree of your magic arts.

736
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
Not only your fairy power will be destroyed badly,

737
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,560
but also it may harm your immortal root.

738
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,160
It's difficult to recover.

739
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,320
So serious?

740
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,040
Your Highness, give up the idea.

741
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Since you said I couldn't go there,

742
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,520
then I won't go.

743
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,600
Don't worry.

744
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,280
Just be busy with your things. I'm leaving.

745
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,640
OK.

746
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,360
Si Ming said if I went there,

747
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,880
it would affect His Majesty's experiencing his misfortunes.

748
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,280
However, to experience his misfortunes

749
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,080
means he must be in danger.

750
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,200
Si Ming also said

751
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,360
if I used magic arts in the mortal realm,

752
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,080
I would be certainly backfired.

753
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,200
What can I do?

754
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,040
If I want to repay his kindness,

755
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,360
I can't just think of myself.

756
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,760
Anyway, I must go to have a look.
