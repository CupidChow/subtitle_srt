You filled the whole imperial city with a dreamscape?

72
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,580
It's true that's a small trick,

73
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,260
but you did it on a large scale.

74
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,300
It must've consumed you a lot of energy.

75
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300

76
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,020

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,220
why you did such a thing

79
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,380
that made you lose more than you gain.

80
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,740
When I was in the yard, I forgot

81
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,260
you haven't been fully recovered.

82
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,860

I'm in good mood tonight.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,380
You've been stern-faced

85
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,180
since I got to know you.

86
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,860
Why are you in good mood today?

87
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Is it because

88
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,540
you've finished the magic instrument?

89
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,900
Because you sent me this.

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,780
Are you so happy just because I sent you some sugar foxes?

91
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,340
You were

92
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,220
not as happy as now

93
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,140
when I made you sweet and sour fish.

94
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,580
I knew nothing about that,

95
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,580
so I missed a lot.

96
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,180
Now I just want to do more things

97
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,380
to make you happy.

98
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,260
Only one left?

99
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,100
You ate the other nine?

100
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,660
And the five for Su Moye.

101
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,220
You really have a sweet tooth.

102
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,100
If you want to eat something

103
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,140
or there is something you don't have but others do,

104
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,060
just let me know.

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,580
I'll get it all for you.

106
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm good at cooking.

107
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm not a picky eater.

108
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
I like everything you cook.

109
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,780
Xiaobai, you care about me so much.

110
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,740
I'm so happy.

111
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,380
Your Majesty,

112
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,460
you must've been

113
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,020
a considerate and sweet kid in your childhood.

114
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,740
You must've been wronged many times

115
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,140
before you grew up.

116
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,860
But,

117
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,340
from now on, as the Big Devil of Qingqiu,

118
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,100
I'll take you

119
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,140
to see what you've never seen

120
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,900
and play what you've never played.

121
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,660
I'll let you enjoy yourself to the full.

122
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Let's go have fun.

123
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,460
Go.

124
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,620
Look.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,060
Do you like this Konghou?

126
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,700
You have good taste.

127
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm known as "Dough Figurine Tang",

128
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,900
but actually,

129
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,580
I'm best at making Konghou.

130
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,780
So, many young men

131
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,460

132
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,380

133
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
who will definitely like it.

134
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,180
This is the last one.

135
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,180
If you like it...

136
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
- I'll buy it. - I'll wrap...

137
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,940
Wrap it up.

138
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,700
It's on her?

139
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,020
You didn't play with dough figurines, right?

140
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,580
It's made of rice and flour,

141
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,180
but it's not edible.

142
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,980
Just play with it for a few days.

143
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,180
If you want something to eat,

144
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,940
there is sugar painting over there.

145
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,580
Let's go and have a look.

146
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,580
Okay.

147
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,700
Do you like this mini Konghou?

148
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,980
Sure.

149
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,700

150
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,700
Here is the change.

151
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,540
Keep it.

152
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,500
He likes the mini Konghou you made very much.

153
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,660
Keep the change as a reward.

154
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,980
Let's go.

155
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,420
Excuse me.

156
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,140
What do you want, miss?

157
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,140
Look over there.

158
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,860
Miss.

159
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,140
Look.

160
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,940
Sir, I want two.

161
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,180
Okay! Just one minute.

162
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,420
Look.

163
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
This is a monkey.

164
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,900
This is a horse.

165
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,700
It has no legs.

166
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,980
Are they eaten?

167
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,980
What's this?

168
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,300
A wolfhound.

169
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,860
Here you are.

170
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
Thanks.

171
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,860
This dragon looks nice.

172
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,100
This fox looks like you.

173
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,100
But it's not as good as that I made.

174
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,500
Sir.

175
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,340
Okay. Here is the change.

176
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,220
Keep it as a reward.

177
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Thank you.

178
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,140
Do you like it?

179
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,420
Yes.

180
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm good.

181
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,060
It's for you.

182
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,660
Both of them are yours.

183
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,860
When I went to a fair in my childhood,

184
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,780
what I liked most was

185
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,700
to buy everything I wanted.

186
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,420
I kept buying till I had to go home.

187
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,460
The happiness of holding what I liked

188
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,700
could last a very long time.

189
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,300
So, whatever you want to buy today,

190
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,020
I'll get it for you. Okay?

191
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,500
Okay.

192
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,580
Xiaobai.

193
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,380
Stay close to me.

194
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,100
Buy more and you'll get a discount.

195
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,100
Is it fresh?

196
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,900
Absolutely.

197
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
Masks.

198
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,220
Look at the masks.

199
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,220
Look.

200
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,540
Do you want a mask?

201
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,180
Look at the masks.

202
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Look at this.

203
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,580
A fox mask.

204
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,940
Its eyebrows can move.

205
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,940
Interesting, right?

206
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,460
Do you want this?

207
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,060
Here you are.

208
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,460
I'll give you the change.

209
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,620
Keep it as a reward.

210
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Thank you.

211
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,340
Great.

212
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,180
Now you look like a fox.

213
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,660
You're a member of my family.

214
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
Yes, I am.

215
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,460
Let's go.

216
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,540
You also gave me a cypress mask that night

217
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,780
when we went to the Duanchang Mountain for the Yueling flowers.

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,460
At that time, I mistook you as Su Moye

219
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
and told you a lot of things.

220
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,860
You came here on purpose to save me,

221
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,860
but I failed to recognize you

222
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,460
because of memory disorder.

223
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,660
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,820
I didn't know

225
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,340
why you changed your attitude suddenly,

226
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,380
but seeing you care about me,

227
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,540
I was quite moved.

228
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,540
It turns out

229
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,860
you have been staying with me.

230
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,100
Xiaobai.

231
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,780
Wherever you go in the future,

232
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,180
I'll always stay by your side.

233
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,420
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

234
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,540
Have a look.

235
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,780
Masks.

236
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,380
Look at these masks.

237
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,180
Miss, do you want a mask?

238
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,460
Miss, you haven't paid for it.

239
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Your Highness Fengjiu,

240
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,700
you just sent the sugar foxes at the wrong time.

241
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,060
It's the critical moment to make the mirror,

242
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,180
but to make you happy,

243
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,260
Dong Hua has totally ignored it.

244
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,060
Fine. Forget about it.

245
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,380
The night is darker here.

246
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,860
It makes the sea of Foling flowers more beautiful.

247
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,340
Give it to me.

248
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,540
Look at those kids.

249
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,860
When I was young,

250
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,020
I often ran around like them.

251
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,060
My fourth uncle's mount

252
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,460
is a bird called Jingwei.

253
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
He often bullied me when I was a kid.

254
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,340
He once painted my fur black

255
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,380
when I fell asleep.

256
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,500
Really?

257
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,380
Were you often bullied when you were young?

258
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Not at all.

259
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,780
My classmates

260
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,740
couldn't wait to flatter me.

261
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,260
The only one who dared to bully me

262
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,860
was Jingwei.

263
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,140
But I took my revenge later.

264
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,220
How did you revenge?

265
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,820
I put a rabbit on his stomach

266
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,060
while he took a nap.

267
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,100
When he woke up,

268
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,060
I told him he gave birth to it.

269
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,100
He was scared into crying.

270
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,140
Well done.

271
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,580
But after he knew it was my trick,

272
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,740
he chased me for two months.

273
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,220
Why two months?

274
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,220
Because the final exam would be held two months later.

275
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,100
He wanted to copy ancient history off me.

276
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,540
Did you do well in that subject?

277
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,780
At that time,

278
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
I was into you.

279
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,260
You're an ancient hero,

280
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,420
so ancient history

281
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,100
is the history of your brilliant achievements in war.

282
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,580
I also tried to do well

283
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,740
in the subject you like,

284
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,500
but you like Buddhist theories best.

285
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,460
I was really unable to do that.

286
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,420
Actually, I didn't understand

287
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,740
why you could grasp Buddhist theories so well

288
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,340
although you kept fighting.

289
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,580
Later,

290
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,100
I suddenly realized

291
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,580
it's not impossible for those who wield a sword

292
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,300
to thoroughly understand the Buddhist theories.

293
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,860
Perhaps,

294
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,660
only those who are still concerned about all people

295
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,940
after having seen the world through

296
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,100
can understand the Buddhist theories

297
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,620
so thoroughly.

298
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,100
I also knew you like fishing,

299
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
but they didn't teach us.

300
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,100
Xiaobai.

301
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,860
Your Majesty,

302
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,660
you took me here to celebrate Girls' Festival

303
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
because you knew I was in bad mood, right?

304
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,140
Why?

305
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,380
Since Shen Ye came to my mansion,

306
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,140
I've been writing to him

307
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,620
as Aranya did.

308
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,380
From these letters,

309
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,020
I could feel

310
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,140
how Aranya cared about Shen Ye and how she loved him.

311
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,820
I'm moved by her.

312
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
I also feel sorry for her.

313
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,540
Don't get trapped in it, Xiaobai.

314
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,260
You're not Aranya.

315
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,260
You don't need to experience her sorrow.

316
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,220
I'll figure out a way to get out of here.

317
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,140
Just focus on getting your primordial spirit recovered.

318
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
After we get out,

319
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,620
I'll marry you and let you be my empress.

320
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,020
Your empress?

321
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,300
Am I dreaming?

322
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,300
No.

323
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,140
Will you forget everything you said

324
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,620
after you go out?

325
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,700
No.

326
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,940
Then...

327
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,740
You don't need to think or do anything.

328
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,380
Just spend your life as Aranya.

329
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,580
I'll take care of everything

330
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,100
after we go out.

331
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,900
You just need to wait to be my bride.

332
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,940
The Wunu Building.

333
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,820
Girls are throwing sachets on the Wunu Building.

334
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
Let's go have a look.

335
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,100
It's bustling.

336
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,500
Why are they walking faster and faster?

337
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,300
Your Majesty.

338
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,900
Hurry up, Your Majesty.

339
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,060
There are too many people.

340
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,340
Be careful not to get hurt.

341
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,220
Do you know that?

342
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,260
The Wunu Building only shows up

343
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,740
in the evening at the Girls' Festival.

344
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,580
Legend has it that

345
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,620
it's a token of affection

346
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,660
Lord Wunu in charge of the Wunu Star

347
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,940
sent to a prince of the inseparable king bird clan.

348
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,260
Really?

349
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Pitifully, members of the inseparable king bird clan

350
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,220
cannot marry any outsider.

351
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,820
So the two of them couldn't stay together.

352
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,180
Only this building shows up

353
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,100
in the evening of every Girls' Festival.

354
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,220
What's up, Your Majesty?

355
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,420
Nothing.

356
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,460
What happened later?

357
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,460
Later,

358
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,260
girls come to the building

359
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,100
and throw their sachets

360
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,780
to men they love.

361
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,460
A girl throws her sachet towards the person she likes

362
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,140
when he passes by.

363
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,060
If he accepts it,

364
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,700
he'll have a night tour with her.

365
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,700
Remember.

366
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,060
If anyone

367
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,100
throws her sachet to you,

368
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,340
don't accept it.

369
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,860
Because you've already had me.

370
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,020
Why are you smiling?

371
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,260
Did you hear what I said?

372
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,140
Yes.

373
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,060
Don't accept sachets. I've already had you.

374
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,420
Put it on,

375
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
just in case.

376
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,300
You're blushing.

377
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,340
You need this more than I do.

378
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,340
Let's go.

379
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,740
Put it on.

380
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,500
Throw.

381
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,380
Hurry!

382
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,580
Throw.

383
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Come over.

384
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,900
Why did they all throw at him?

385
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,460
I did it!

386
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,620
He's mine.

387
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,020
Don't try to take him away.

388
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,940
I don't think so.

389
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,620
I did it before you did.

390
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,620
You're forcing him to accept it.

391
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,700
You must come from somewhere else.

392
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,460
How did you know that?

393
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,660
Generally, only outsiders

394
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,300
would take their lovers here.

395
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,500
How should I take it off?

396
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,300
You couldn't do it.

397
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,220
It's impossible.

398
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,100
Put it on.

399
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,620
What is it?

400
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,660
What are they doing?

401
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,340
Sir, you accepted my sachet.

402
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,700
You have to spend the night with me.

403
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,620
Xiaobai, wait for me here.

404
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,500
Sir, why are you leaving?

405
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,260
Wait for me.

406
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,980
Stay, sir. Wait for me.

407
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,100
Wait for me.

408
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,020
What's going on?

409
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,740
So,

410
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,940
do you really want to

411
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,460
spend the night with me?

412
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,260
You didn't expect I could come and go freely

413
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,700
in the Dream of Aranya, right?

414
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,860
He said he'd marry me,

415
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,420
but he left me there alone

416
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,980
when he met another girl.

417
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,100
Your Highness!

418
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,580
Your Highness.

419
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
What's wrong, Chacha? Why are you in a hurry?

420
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,500
Something's happening in the Mengchun Courtyard.

421
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,020
Lord Shen Ye

422
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,060
is roaring drunk in the yard.

423
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
Isn't he always

424
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
calm and serious?

425
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,540
Why did he suddenly get drunk?

426
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,740
I don't know.

427
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,460
Don't worry. Let's go have a look.

428
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,100
Your Excellency.

429
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,260
- Your Excellency. - You can't drink anymore.

430
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
You can't drink anymore.

431
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:12,780
Your Excellency.

432
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,220
Leave me alone.

433
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,180
Your Excellency, you can't...

434
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,780
Let me drink.

435
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,420
Give me the wine.

436
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,620
Your Highness.

437
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,580
Your Highness, are you okay?

438
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,180
Your Excellency.

439
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,420
Your Highness.

440
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,620
- Let me be. - He smashed all this?

441
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,900
Your Excellency.

442
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,180
Yes, Your Highness.

443
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,660
Lord Shen Ye is drunk dead.

444
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,980
I couldn't leave him alone,

445
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,660
so I asked Chacha to tell you about it.

446
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,980
Your Excellency.

447
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,020
I want to drink.

448
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,700
Stop it. Your Excellency. Stop it.

449
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,100
Your Excellency, you can't drink anymore.

450
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,140
Lord Shen Ye is drunk.

451
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,180
He's emotionally unstable.

452
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,460
You may get hurt if you stay here.

453
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,180
Let me stay here and serve him.

454
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,980
Please go back and rest up.

455
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:46,940
Don't bother.

456
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,660
I'm here to see him.

457
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,100
Why is he drunk?

458
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,340
He was drinking in the yard

459
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,940
and everything was going well.

460
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,820
But when we tried to take him back to his room

461
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,220
and gave him hangover soup,

462
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,900
he began to resist.

463
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,580
Then he smashed all dishes and cups

464
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,660
and asked us to take him more wine.

465
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,380
Your Excellency.

466
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,180
We've got more wine for you.

467
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
It's not wine!

468
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Give me wine.

469
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,260
Stop drinking.

470
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,660
Stop it.

471
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,700
Stop drinking. There is no more.

472
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,180
Don't give him hangover soup.

473
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,420
Let him smash everything.

474
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,020
There is something you don't know.

475
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,300
These chinaware articles

476
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,660
are top-grade treasures given by His Majesty.

477
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,740
That bowl

478
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,900
is worth 100 gold leaves.

479
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,140
100 gold leaves?

480
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,980
Exactly.

481
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
No wonder the sound was so pleasing to the ear

482
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,620
when it was broken.

483
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,500
Steward, all of you can leave.

484
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,340
Got it.

485
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,860
Go away.

486
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,020
Your Excellency.

487
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,420
- Please stop it. - Go away.

488
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,420
We're leaving.

489
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,580
Your Excellency, we're leaving.

490
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,780
Let's go.

491
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,500
Go.

492
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,460
Chacha, you can leave too.

493
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,980
Got it.

494
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,740
Why did you drink so much?

495
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
Leave me alone.

496
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,620
Go away.

497
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,060
Why should I leave?

498
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,900
I'm Aranya. I'm here for you.

499
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,100
Don't mention her name.

500
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,460
You're not her.

501
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,340
You're not her.

502
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,380
I found it out when we were at the Lingshu Stage.

503
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,260
The way you looked at me.

504
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,100
The words you said to me.

505
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,380
Aranya wouldn't be like that.

506
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,620
Even on the day when we fell out,

507
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,020
your response was different from hers.

508
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,780
You wrote 20 letters

509
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,900
exactly the same as she did

510
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,020
and you got Wen Tian to help you,

511
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,140
but you're not her.

512
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,260
You've drunk too much.

513
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,100
You...

514
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,900
You're not Aranya.

515
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,900
She could be anybody to me.

516
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,860
A stranger,

517
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,620
a foe,

518
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,060
an enemy or something else.

519
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,340
But it's just impossible for her to be like this.

520
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,260
It's impossible.

521
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,420
Definitely.

522
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,540
It's impossible.

523
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,020
What do you mean?

524
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
You said...

525
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,820
You once said,

526
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,740
"maybe I really liked you",

527
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,100
"maybe I really fooled you."

528
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,180
You're drunk.

529
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

530
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,740
You're stupid and stubborn.

531
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,860
I'll never give up

532
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,140
until I get back Red Qi of my primordial spirit.

533
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,060
Remember.

534
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,980
I'll get back what belongs to me sooner or later!

535
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,860
Xiaobai.

536
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
Aranya.

537
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,500
I've been waiting for you.

538
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,260
Come back.

539
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,260
Aranya.

540
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,500
Aranya.

541
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,500
Aranya.

542
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,580
Are you into her?

543
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,340
Yes.

544
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,940
In this case,

545
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,540
why didn't you tell her?

546
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,740
Why did you treat her coldly?

547
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,740
I thought

548
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,020
I could protect you by doing that.

549
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,300
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,100
I pushed you away so many times.

551
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Your Excellency.

552
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,860
Is Aranya back?

553
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,020
Yes.

554
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,740
Her Highness has gone to visit Lord Shen Ye.

555
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,740
Shen Ye?

556
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,380
Shen Ye was drunk dead.

557
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,100
Her Highness asked us to come back

558
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,940
and she'd take care of him herself.

559
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,900
Fine. It's of no use.

560
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,020
Forget about it.

561
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,980
Maybe you love each other.
Maybe you aren't destined to stay together.

562
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,460
Now that you like her,

563
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,660
you should've told her about your feelings,

564
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,820
instead of keeping regretting when it was too late.

565
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,100
Anyway,

566
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,420
it's hard to have a crush on someone

567
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,340
and it's harder someone you love also loves you.

568
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,100
What are you doing?

569
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,900
Isn't he drunk?

570
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,980
We should let him have a good sleep.

571
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,580
Then he'll stop talking nonsense.

572
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,060
Why did you make him unconscious?

573
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,780
I can't let him talk nonsense to you.

574
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,860
But you even didn't know

575
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,220
why he got drunk

576
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,180
before you hit him.

577
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,700
No matter what reason it is for,

578
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,740
he shouldn't try to touch your face

579
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,140
after getting drunk.

580
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,540
Xiaobai,

581
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,300
remember

582
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,940
you're not Aranya.

583
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,580
But he got drunk not because of me.

584
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,700
Then for what?

585
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,220
Because he has known I'm not Aranya.

586
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
He remembers every word Aranya said

587
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,100
and everything

588
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,780
Aranya cared about.

589
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,220
He remembers her eyes

590
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,900
and her movements.

591
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,860
No matter how hard I acted,

592
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,020
I couldn't fool him.

593
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,580
Xiaobai,

594
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,620
don't you think

595
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,460
you care about Shen Ye too much?

596
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,220
Because I think

597
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,340
Aranya was like what I used to be.

598
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,180
Trust me, Xiaobai.

599
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,900
We'll stay together

600
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,180
after we get out of here.

601
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,020
You just left me alone

602
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,460
on the street.

603
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,020
I can't believe you said that.

604
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,500
You've misunderstood me so much.

605
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
I know you do things for a reason,

606
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,020
but actually, I don't want to

607
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,380
get out of the Dream of Aranya.

608
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,660
Why not?

609
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,820
Because...

610
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,380
Because once we get out of the dream world,

611
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,020
you'll become Emperor Dong Hua

612
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,900
who sits up high in a leading position

613
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,780
and I'll still be a fox

614
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,020
that you don't care about.

615
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,060
In this case,

616
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,460
I prefer I'm Aranya

617
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,500
and you're Xi Ze.

618
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,460
Then we can stay together

619
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,220
in the Dream of Aranya.

620
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,180
Xiaobai,

621
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,900
what happens here is not true.

622
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,460
Even if you keep helping Shen Ye

623
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,900
fulfill his wish as Aranya,

624
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,940
everything here won't

625
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,140
have anything to do with us

626
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,540
when we get out of here.

627
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,820
Shen Ye

628
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,900
will still go back to the world without Aranya.

629
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,500
Everything you did

630
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,620
wouldn't help him in the real world.

631
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,860
His Majesty was right.

632
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,380
Shen Ye and Aranya are a miserable couple.

633
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,100
I feel sorry for Aranya

634
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,340
and want to awaken Shen Ye as Aranya,

635
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,700
but I've never thought

636
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,580
it might do more harm to Shen Ye.

637
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,380
His Majesty must've gone

638
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,460
back to the Qi Nan Palace.

639
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,940
I didn't expect Miao Luo

640
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,180
has recovered her strength so rapidly

641
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,820
that she can enter the Dream of Aranya at will.

642
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,100
If she takes back the Red Qi of her primordial spirit

643
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,300
from Xiaobai,

644
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,300
I'm afraid she'll come out of the Miaoyi Chasm.

645
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,540
The task of top priority

646
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,500
is to keep Xiaobai safe

647
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,820
and make the mirror.

648
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,020
We have to get out of the dream world as soon as possible

649
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,620
If His Majesty can't get out...

650
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,540
Impossible.

651
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,100
Your Highness,

652
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,140
if they still don't come out

653
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,460
some days later,

654
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,700
let me go into the dream world.

655
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,220
It's unnecessary.

656
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,540
I said he could do it.

657
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,060
He's bound to do it.

658
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,020
You haven't got any news?

659
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,260
Go back.

660
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,460
It's not safe here. You shouldn't be here.

661
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,380
Servant!

662
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,220
Your Excellency, you woke up!

663
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,260
Are you feeling okay?

664
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,740
Yeah.

665
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,060
You got drunk last night. Her Highness was worried.

666
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,500
She asked me

667
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,420
to take you some hangover soup.

668
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,700
Did Aranya come here last night?

669
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,700
After hearing you got drunk,

670
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,900
Her Highness came here and took care of you herself.

671
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,940
Lord Xi Ze came here too,

672
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,740
but it seemed something unpleasant happened

673
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,260
between him and Her Highness.

674
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,180
I talked nonsense after getting drunk.

675
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,540
I must've bothered Her Highness.

676
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,900
You may leave now.

677
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,580
Yes, Your Excellency.

678
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,700
This is the last life

679
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,100
where I can collect Aranya's primordial spirit.

680
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,340
I can't make any careless mistakes,

681
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,100
or I'll never have a chance to make it.
