00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 38

3
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,260
Thanks to the mask I got,

4
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,820
I can easily sneak into the mountain

5
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,980
wearing it.

6
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,860
Why hasn't she come?

7
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,420
She's coming.

8
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,380
I have read the letter

9
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,780
that you left to me.

10
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,420
You sent me the message and asked me

11
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,460
to come here to relieve the lovesickness,

12
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,420
since there were too many people in the day.

13
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,820
But I have come here now,

14
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,780
why don't you turn around

15
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,540
and even have a look at me?

16
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,060
Actually you don't need to worry about disturbing me.

17
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,340
I also have...

18
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,180
Lord Xi Ze,

19
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,740
save me.

20
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,100
She's dropping down.

21
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,100
What should I do?

22
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,860
Your Highness,

23
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,060
give me your hand.

24
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Give me your hand.

25
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,060
Your Highness.

26
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,580
Your Highness, are you okay?

27
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,860
Are you okay, Your Highness?

28
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,780
Lord Xi Ze,

29
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,500
my clothes have been soaked,

30
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,100
and the night wind is chill.

31
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,420
Your Highness,

32
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,940
you should be careful next time.

33
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,740
I'll lead you the way to get changed.

34
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,900
Come on. Get up.

35
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,460
Give me your hand. Follow me.

36
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,380
Your Highness,

37
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,700
this way.

38
00:04:59,580 --> 00:04:59,980
Follow me.

39
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,100
Your Highness, it's my fault

40
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,460
to make your clothes wet today.

41
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,980
There are some clean clothes in the painted pleasure boat.

42
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,020
You'd better get changed as soon as possible.

43
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,700
Lord Xi Ze, don't blame yourself.

44
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,180
It's my negligence.

45
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,180
It's fine. It's fine.

46
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,340
Please, this way.

47
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,180
Fine.

48
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,180
What's up?

49
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,620
Qing... Qing.

50
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,380
Your Highness.

51
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,860
Your Highness.

52
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,820
Your Highness.

53
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,820
Is everything going well

54
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,220
when they go inside the painted pleasure boat?

55
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,500
What are you doing here?

56
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,860
You scared me.

57
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,780
I have promised to take you to enjoy the Yueling flowers

58
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,100
when everything is done.

59
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,180
But

60
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,980
why do you come back so soon?

61
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,100
Where's Changdi?

62
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,340
You come out as soon as you've led her in?

63
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,620
You are so fast!

64
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,100
What's up?

65
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,820
Why do you still look like Xi Ze?

66
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,020
Change back to your own appearance quickly.

67
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,500
There isn't anyone else here.

68
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,620
Well,

69
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,460
take this.

70
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,660
We have to wear it

71
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,140
when we enjoy the Yueling flowers in the mountain later.

72
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,020
So I prepared one for you.

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,220
I heard there's a tradition

74
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,540
called Jade Girl Birthday here.

75
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,900
Once wearing a mask,

76
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,660
young men and women who haven't got married

77
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,300
can send speechless messages of love by songs and dances,

78
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,100
which can help them find their perfect matches for a lifetime.

79
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,780
How about it? Are you happy with it?

80
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,340
Let me tell you,

81
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,580
if some lady who you don't know of

82
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,820
invites you with a song,

83
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,060
keep the words in mind,

84
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,260
"firm your basis and consolidate your immortal root."

85
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,620
If there is some strange young man who comes to compel me,

86
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,980
you also should remember these words,

87
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,940
"don't be lenient. Punch him to the ground."

88
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,780
It's said that

89
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
the Duanchang Mountain has been
blockaded tonight because of it.

90
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,580
We should take care of each other along the way.

91
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,820
Certainly, you should take care of me more.

92
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,860
Sure.

93
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,300
Why do you sound like Xi Ze?

94
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,980
Why don't you change back since I've asked you?

95
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:02,940
Forget it. Forget it.

96
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,900
It's not early. Let's go.

97
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,100
Come on. Come on. Come on. Move.

98
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,540
Here I am to congratulate you, mother.

99
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,700
Happy birthday to you.

100
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,540
I wish that your happiness will
be as immense as the Eastern Sea,

101
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,420
and your life will be as long as the Southern Mountain.

102
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,540
He,

103
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,180
it's been one year since we met each other last time.

104
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,180
The Guan Chen Palace isn't far from the capital city.

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,140
Why don't you return to the capital city?

106
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,140
Mother.

107
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,020
I feel better staying in the Guan Chen Palace.

108
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,100
The scenery here is great and it's also quiet.

109
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,980
I'm weak since I'm a child.

110
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,500
I feel comfortable

111
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,620
to nurse my body here.

112
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,860
As long as you feel comfortable, it's fine.

113
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,860
You should go to the capital city

114
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,180
to visit your father when you have time.

115
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,300
Sure.

116
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,940
Why aren't Princess Aranya and Princess Changdi here?

117
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,820
Yeah,

118
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,860
where are they?

119
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,900
They are too naughty.

120
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,660
Aranya is playful,

121
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,220
so it's usual that she comes back late.

122
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,660
As for Changdi...

123
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,620
Father, mother.

124
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,500
You...

125
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,540
Guards.

126
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,100
Take the bastard away.

127
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,500
Yes.

128
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,180
You take Prince Qing away first.

129
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,180
Yes.

130
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,140
Send His Majesty, Her Majesty and others back
to have a rest respectively.

131
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,700
Yes.

132
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,660
It's too dark here.

133
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,420
Let's go.

134
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,340
Move.

135
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,660
It's getting more and more desolate

136
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,980
when we go further and further to the Duanchang Mountain.

137
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,340
And there are also howls from wolves.

138
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,300
I'm so lucky to have you with me.

139
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,780
Come here.

140
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,180
Come on.

141
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,180
Come here.

142
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,700
Be seated.

143
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:34,980
Lie down.

144
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,260
Why are you so imperturbable tonight?

145
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,780
Is it because

146
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,540
you think the letter I wrote to Changdi in daytime

147
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,780
is too disgusting?

148
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,140
Don't be mad at me.

149
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,140
Who is Su Moye?

150
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,740
A man who goes through
the flowering shrubs without taking one.

151
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,380
It's just an outrageous love letter.

152
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,300
How can it surprise you
to the extent of being silent along the way?

153
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,220
Moye,

154
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,900
have the beautiful scene in a good day
and the union of love birds

155
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,700
reminded you of any memories

156
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,020
and made you sentimental?

157
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,940
The book says that Yueling flowers

158
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,100
won't bloom until about nine o'clock at night.

159
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,260
We'll have to wait for some time.

160
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,460
It's fine.

161
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,940
Well,

162
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,020
I've learned a song about Yueling flowers.

163
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,980
Let me sing it for you.

164
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,300
Yueling flowers, the snow in the sky.

165
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,100
They start to wither when they just bloom.

166
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,260
Once exuberant, once withered.

167
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,740
Once exuberant, once withered.

168
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,020
They wither when the moon comes out.

169
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,180
They bloom when the moon disappears.

170
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,060
Yueling flowers don't know

171
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,100
they never meet the moon.

172
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,820
They bloom in an instant.

173
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,300
They wither in an instant.

174
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,780
The instants witness their blooming and withering.

175
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,140
You sang the song well.

176
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,940
In fact,

177
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,380
I'm not interested

178
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,860
in plants and flowers.

179
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,060
But

180
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,980
I have read the book

181
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,180
saying that Yueling flowers

182
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,580
only bloom on the Jade Girl Birthday.

183
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,820
They don't bloom when the moon appears.

184
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,740
They bloom when the moon disappears.

185
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,220
So,

186
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,340
the moon doesn't appear this time of a year.

187
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,980
However, it's also said that

188
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,700
what Yueling flowers want to
encounter the most is the moonlight.

189
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,500
What a pity!

190
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,740
It can't be more miserable
that love birds are doomed to be apart.

191
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,140
Moye,

192
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,340
I feel that you're a little different from what you used to be.

193
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,500
What's the difference?

194
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,580
I can't describe it,

195
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,740
but I feel

196
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,740
it's either strange

197
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,140
or familiar.

198
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,500
It seems that

199
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,340
the situation has happened before.

200
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,420
Moye,

201
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,820
have you ever had feelings for a girl?

202
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,460
I've already known,
even though you don't answer my question.

203
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,380
The one you fall for must be Aranya.

204
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,500
Yueling flowers are blooming.

205
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,820
They're so beautiful.

206
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,300
These Yueling flowers are all blooming.

207
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,820
Look at that.

208
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,460
Come here. Come on.

209
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,540
I finally get to see Yueling flowers.

210
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,540
They're so beautiful.

211
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,340
Moye,

212
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,180
it's been over two hundred years.

213
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,260
You haven't forgotten her yet,

214
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,020
which means

215
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,340
Aranya hasn't wasted her life.

216
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,540
See.

217
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,060
Just like the Yueling flower,

218
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,340
we all think it's pretty.

219
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,380
The reason why it's so astonishingly pretty

220
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
is that it's the only one that sparks in the night sky.

221
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,460
We can see nothing but it,

222
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,340
so we think it's the most beautiful.

223
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,100
What else do you know?

224
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,340
You've always had her in your heart,

225
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,540
and never let her go over the two hundred years.

226
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,020
You volunteer to seal other memories,

227
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,220
but her image is clearer

228
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,420
and more impressive in your heart.

229
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,900
Then you're in deeper sorrow.

230
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,420
Actually,

231
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
apart from her, there will be more persons suitable for you.

232
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,740
Sometimes the reason

233
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,140
why we're so obsessed with someone

234
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,380
isn't that we don't know the fact,

235
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,420
but we don't want to.

236
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,460
What's wrong with remembering only one in heart?

237
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,420
Is there anyone else who is worth

238
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,580
my special attention?

239
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,900
It's really rare to see someone else
who is as single-minded and faithful as you.

240
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
I don't mean you're wrong.

241
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Instead of remembering her

242
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,340
in your heart miserably...

243
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:28,940
I...

244
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
When do I look miserable?

245
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,620
If you're not miserable,

246
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,500
why don't you change yourself back?

247
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,260
And you act so abnormal that you talk less with me.

248
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,180
Actually I'm the one who can feel the pain the most clearly.

249
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,780
It's not as painful as usual.

250
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,580
It's a bittersweet pain

251
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
that can torture one's mind the most.

252
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,540
So

253
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,100
you can't neglect how you feel.

254
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,660
The pain deep in your heart will be the most fatal.

255
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,540
I guess you may not get it clearly.

256
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
You have to admit the pain, if it does hurt.

257
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,820
As a man,

258
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,380
how can't you be generous to admit it?

259
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,980
You've said so much,

260
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
but you're wrong.

261
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,980
The one I like isn't Aranya.

262
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,260
Are you too miffed to admit it,

263
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,540
because I hit what's in your mind?

264
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,420
If I did miff,

265
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,380
I would have denied it more,

266
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,260
since you said it out loud.

267
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,260
Fine.

268
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,860
Then spit it.

269
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,580
Who is the one you like?

270
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,500
How does she look like?

271
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,660
I don't mean Aranya.

272
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,740
I'm just showing my concern to you.

273
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,860
She's pretty,

274
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,900
and she will be prettier when she grows up.

275
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,780
She has good personality

276
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,740
and she is capable

277
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,620
in every aspect.

278
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,420
In short, she's perfect.

279
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,740
It's certain that she's perfect,

280
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,460
since she's the one I adore.

281
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,340
Pretty appearance, good personality
and being capable of everything.

282
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,140
It's no wonder that Aranya has passed away

283
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,980
in the Heaven Free of Grievance in her early age.

284
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,780
There's an old saying

285
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,020
that even God may envy of a beauty.

286
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,220
There's nothing that can be complained about,

287
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,260
if these people pass away in their early age.

288
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,780
In fact,

289
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,460
I used to

290
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,020
have a deep affection for someone.

291
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,060
Although I can't remember how he looks,

292
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,860
I can feel

293
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm supposed to love him so much.

294
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,820
But I never get his response.

295
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,620
Maybe now he is regretful

296
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,580
for not cherishing you earlier.

297
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,340
I think he should be an arrogant person.

298
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,500
Otherwise,

299
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,580
why do I feel heartbroken

300
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
every time I think of him?

301
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,020
Well,

302
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,260
the flowers have withered.

303
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,420
It's time for us to go back.

304
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,140
Let's go.

305
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,460
Lord Xi Ze,

306
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,540
why do you lie to me?

307
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,260
I've never admitted that I'm your master.

308
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,020
Then...

309
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,660
are you the one who was talking with me just now?

310
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,300
What can I do now?

311
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,260
I've talked with the wrong person.

312
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,940
I've talked so much with Xi Ze.

313
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,380
Have I said anything impertinent?

314
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,060
Oops!

315
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,260
I've mentioned Aranya so many times.

316
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,860
Has he found that I'm not Aranya?

317
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,860
Fine. Let it go.

318
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,340
Everyone must have been asleep,

319
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,020
since it's late in the night.

320
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,060
Moye must have gone to sleep.

321
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,220
I must have a nice sleep,

322
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,620
since Qing doesn't come to bother me.

323
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,580
I'd better go find Su Moye tomorrow.

324
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,060
The primordial spirit of Xiaobai

325
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,260
really isn't in her body.

326
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,900
How is it?

327
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,380
Have you heard from Moye?

328
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,380
No, I haven't.

329
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,540
Your Highness,

330
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,420
all is going to the palace.

331
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,380
We can't stay

332
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
in the painted pleasure boat alone.

333
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,860
Shall we go to the palace in a while either?

334
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,020
I'd better go find Moye first.

335
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,180
Fine.

336
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,900
Do you still remember to find me?

337
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,340
- Moye. - Mr. Su.

338
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,860
Master, have some tea.

339
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,700
You.

340
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,180
Do you know what a serious trouble you've stirred up?

341
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,500
What do I do?

342
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,500
I don't act royal enough to

343
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,420
leave you alone to face Changdi, do I?

344
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,860
Do you know what happened later last night?

345
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,340
What happened?

346
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,700
I took Changdi here to change the clothes last night.

347
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,780
Qing happened to appear,

348
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,580
and he chased after Changdi,

349
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
which made her cry out loud

350
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,740
and run through even four woods in rags.

351
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,060
Then,

352
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,700
Changdi kept running all the way

353
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,300
to finally arrive at the Guan Chen Palace.

354
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,860
And then?

355
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,100
She came across His Majesty and Her Majesty,

356
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,700
which

357
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,300
made her faint directly.

358
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,700
Why didn't you keep chasing after her?

359
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,820
I did!

360
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,300
She ran as fast as she could.

361
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,500
I couldn't even catch her.

362
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,820
It's so unlucky

363
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,100
to be witnessed by

364
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,020
His Majesty and Her Majesty.

365
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,700
What about you?

366
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Where did you go yesterday?

367
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,180
Where did you go?

368
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,140
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

369
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,180
Let me tell you that

370
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,940
Changdi is always displeased with Aranya,

371
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,500
and she's a trouble maker.

372
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,820
Maybe she will make you in trouble later.

373
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,500
Do you know it?

374
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,100
I guess not.

375
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,660
I mean, at least Aranya

376
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,540
is the biological daughter of Her Majesty and His Majesty.

377
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,420
Even if they punish her, they won't punish her too hard.

378
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,620
It's hard to say.

379
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,300
Even though Changdi is unruly,

380
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,540
His Majesty loves her most at ordinary times.

381
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,180
Why?

382
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,020
They are both princesses, aren't they?

383
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,580
I don't know why Aranya is so pathetic

384
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,100
but Changdi is beloved?

385
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,660
Perhaps it's because Qing Hua feel less hatred
towards His Majesty

386
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,220
after the birth of Changdi.

387
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,500
And

388
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,020
she is the youngest daughter.

389
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,220
Qing Hua is always fond of her.

390
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,260
Well, I'm done.

391
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,100
See,

392
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,940
I happen to lodge in the body of Aranya

393
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,140
who Her Majesty doesn't like.

394
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,740
Your Highness.

395
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,540
Your Highness,

396
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,500
His Majesty invites you to the palace.

397
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,820
His Majesty also

398
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,820
asks you to live

399
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,260
in the Xiaohan House of the palace these days.

400
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,860
Please take your belongings with you.

401
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,540
Aranya,

402
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,020
do you confess your sin?

403
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,060
I have no idea what sin I've committed.

404
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,060
Don't go too far.

405
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,460
I have shown my mercy

406
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,860
to allow you to take Qing on board.

407
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,860
But

408
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,460
you don't constrain him

409
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,180
and even allow him to scare Changdi into faint.

410
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,140
She is your sister of the whole blood.

411
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,100
Do you think

412
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
what sin you've committed?

413
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,660
Your Majesty,

414
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,700
Her Highness Aranya did make a mistake on this thing.

415
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,260
It makes sense if you intend to punish her.

416
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,260
But a mistake made by a disciple
is also the one of his master.

417
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,060
I don't discipline her strictly,

418
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,980
so I'm willing to accept the punishment
with Her Highness Aranya.

419
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,780
I wish you can calm your anger, Your Majesty.

420
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,460
He's right. Father.

421
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,780
Don't ruin the family harmony

422
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,060
because of the trifles.

423
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,780
It's the first time that

424
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,380
Sister Aranya has come to my palace.

425
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,980
I feel guilty that

426
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
I haven't taken good care of Changdi.

427
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,260
If you want to punish her, please punish me together.

428
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,700
Go. Go. Go.

429
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,580
Since Mr. Su says so,

430
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,020
I won't let you down.

431
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,700
Please ponder upon your faults.

432
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,500
Lock Aranya

433
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,860
in the stone cage for ten days

434
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,140
to ponder upon her faults.

435
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,140
Thanks for your clemency, Your Majesty.

436
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,820
But,

437
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,540
- Your Highness. - It's Changdi...

438
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,220
Fine.

439
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,260
Let's go.

440
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,740
Your Highness,

441
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,140
what's up?

442
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,220
It's not a big deal.

443
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,900
It's just I'll be grounded for days

444
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
to ponder upon my faults.

445
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,220
Your Highness,

446
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,060
please follow me.

447
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,940
Your Highness.

448
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,500
Don't worry.

449
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,500
It's not a big deal.

450
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,060
You guys,

451
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,860
put the belongings in the Xiaohan House first.

452
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,900
Her Highness will be back in a few days.

453
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,380
Yes.

454
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,780
You're fine,

455
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,220
and you don't need to see me anymore.

456
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,540
Lord Xi Ze,

457
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,420
since you didn't even check on me,

458
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,420
how do you know it?

459
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,460
Besides,

460
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,780
did I do anything wrong

461
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,740
to annoy you?

462
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,740
You worry too much.

463
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,060
I feel

464
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,900
you are in good health,

465
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,660
and your breath

466
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
is peaceful,

467
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,340
once you step in.

468
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,220
Lord Xi Ze,

469
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,740
my father was seriously angry at Aranya.

470
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,500
I'm sincerely asking you

471
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,300
to check on my father.

472
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,260
What happened to Aranya?

473
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,380
Aranya didn't take good care of Qing.

474
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,180
Qing went outside

475
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,780
and scared Changdi.

476
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,420
And father and mother happened to witness it.

477
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,460
Father was so seriously furious

478
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,900
that he punished Aranya to ponder upon her faults
in the stone cage for ten days,

479
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,740
and her master Mr. Su also got involved.

480
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,940
Aranya's birth parents are so cruel-hearted

481
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,020
to lock their own daughter

482
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,620
in the place like this.

483
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,820
But it's fine.

484
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,580
I don't have to find a way to avoid Qing.

485
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,380
See how I'll deal with that bad girl, Changdi,

486
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,340
when I meet her again.

487
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:47,980
Come out.

488
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,660
Move.

489
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,740
Am I released so soon?

490
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,740
Are you in the room, Your Excellency?

491
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,620
Come in.

492
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,140
Lord Xi Ze,

493
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,780
my father specially invites famous local theatrical troupe

494
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,220
to put on performances in the palace.

495
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,980
I go out of my way to notice you.

496
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,820
I'm wondering whether you can go there with me.

497
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,660
I get it.

498
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,900
Is there anything else?

499
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,220
No, there isn't.

500
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,660
Okay.

501
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,860
I'll go there later.

502
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,140
You come at the right time, Lord Xi Ze.

503
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,820
It's show time!

504
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,740
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

505
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,420
Lord Xi Ze,

506
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,260
is it about Aranya?

507
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,740
Exactly.

508
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,500
Pondering upon the faults in the stone cage doesn't matter.

509
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,940
It's merely a small punishment.

510
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,940
It's the rule of our imperial clan.

511
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,940
You don't have to worry about it, Lord Xi Ze.

512
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,340
Please be seated.

513
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,020
Lord Xi Ze, please.

514
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,340
What the hell is this place?

515
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,860
Do Aranya's parents have a feud

516
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,060
with her?

517
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,980
How can they be that cruel-hearted
to lock their daughter in a place like this?

518
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,340
Do you feel comfortable in the serpentine cage?

519
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,980
You have a glib tongue, don't you?

520
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Why do you keep silent today?

521
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,820
Does it hurt? And you can't say a single word, can you?

522
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,780
Sister,

523
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,900
you allow that stupid snake to tease me.

524
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,020
Haven't you expected that

525
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,100
I'm not as silent as someone

526
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,540
who can swallow an insult,

527
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,420
and I'll double what I've suffered sooner or later?

528
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,060
Father has punished you to stay in the stone cage

529
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,540
to calm yourself in meditation.

530
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,860
But I think

531
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,300
staying in such an ordinary stone cage won't work.

532
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,740
So I specially ask people to exchange it

533
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,620
with the serpentine cage for you.

534
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm wondering whether you're satisfied with it or not.

535
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,900
Changdi,

536
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,860
you're my sibling of the whole blood.

537
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Why do you do this to me?

538
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,100
It's so ridiculous.

539
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,420
Do you think you can regard yourself as my sibling

540
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,180
since I call you sister?

541
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,060
You can't even behave yourself,

542
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,980
just because father takes you
to the Guan Chen Palace for once.

543
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,580
Don't go too far.

544
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,220
Aranya,

545
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,860
have you been dreaming of being the same as me?

546
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,300
What a pity!

547
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,220
How can you be the same as me?

548
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,980
I'm the favorite youngest daughter of father and mother

549
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,740
while you're the superfluous one after you were born.

550
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,700
Even if I killed you,

551
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,900
I would only be grounded by father.

552
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,220
It's on fire!

553
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,220
It's on fire!

554
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,100
It's on fire?

555
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,620
It's on fire. It's on fire.

556
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,500
Sister, what a coincidence!

557
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,300
You can't blame me this time.

558
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,340
Even God thinks it's miserable for you to live in this way

559
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,660
and wants to release your soul from purgatory.

560
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Save me.

561
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,300
Only one shot can make you unbearable,

562
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,820
how dare you rattle on with the minus talent?

563
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,220
Get out of my way if you spill all out.

564
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,500
We need help.

565
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,380
It's on fire.

566
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,020
Yes.

567
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,420
Quick.

568
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,580
We need help.

569
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,100
Quick. Quick. Quick. Run.

570
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,460
Come on, that way.

571
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,700
Where is Third Princess?

572
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,220
Hurry up.

573
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:33,700
I haven't seen her.

574
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,260
Hurry up. Hurry up.

575
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,260
- Mother. - Why do you stand still?

576
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,140
Find her out now.

577
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,420
Ensure her safety.

578
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,260
I will. I will.

579
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,180
Quick. Quick. Quick.

580
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,140
Quick.

581
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
Changdi.

582
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,580
Fa... Father.

583
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,620
Quick. This way.

584
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,180
Come on.

585
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,020
Move.

586
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,420
Quick. Quick. Quick.

587
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,540
Quick. Quick.

588
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,180
This way.

589
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,220
They go so far as to lock you in the serpentine cage.

590
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,900
Yes.

591
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:15,900
Come here.

592
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,860
We need more hands.

593
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,380
Quick. Quick. This way. This way.

594
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,580
Get more water here.

595
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,340
Hurry up.

596
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,460
Where is Her Highness Aranya?

597
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,620
I don't know. I don't know.

598
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,060
Come here. Come here. Quick.

599
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,980
Here is the water. Quick.

600
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,180
Xiaobai,

601
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,260
I won't let you get hurt again.

602
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,620
Get more water here. Quick.

603
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,500
Here it is. Here it is.

604
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,180
Come here. Come here.

605
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,940
Your Excellency. Your Excellency.

606
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,340
The dungeon is about to collapse. You can't step in.

607
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,260
Your Excellency.

608
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,980
Aranya.

609
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,060
Your Majesty.

610
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,740
Your Majesty.

611
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,260
Hang in there.

612
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,980
It won't be hurting soon.

613
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,700
Aranya.

614
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,660
It's you who saved me?

615
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm here to save you.

616
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,740
What I've done is for you.

617
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,700
Let's go.

618
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,860
Aranya,

619
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,740
I'll definitely bring you back to life.

620
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,820
What I owe you,

621
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,940
and what they owe you

622
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,540
will all be returned to you.

623
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:02,940
Your Highness.

624
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,180
Your Highness.

625
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,340
Your Highness.

626
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,300
Your Highness.

627
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,820
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

628
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:37,980
Your Highness.

629
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,660
Your Highness, you wake up.

630
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,060
Are you hurt?

631
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,540
How can it happen?

632
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,780
It's said that you can be released in two days, isn't it?

633
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,180
How do you feel?

634
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Is there anything wrong with you?

635
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,140
Well, slow down. Slow down.

636
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,420
I feel bitter in my mouth.

637
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,180
Was it Shen Ye who gave me the pain killers?

638
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,540
Shen Ye?

639
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,020
It's Shen Ye who saved you.

640
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,180
Chacha,

641
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,780
prepare a pot of hot tea for Her Highness first.

642
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,540
Sure.

643
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,180
I'm on my way.

644
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,220
Where is this place?

645
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,020
It's the Xiaohan House

646
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,380
that is far away from the palace.

647
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,980
It's so miserable of you to

648
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,260
suffer from such a big disaster

649
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,460
without one night in the palace.

650
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,420
Being far away from the palace also has advantages.

651
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,500
A big fire hit the palace

652
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,900
while the Xiaohan House is safe.

653
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,180
Aranya has never won the favor.

654
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,060
But this time,

655
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,580
she can be said to benefit from the misfortune.

656
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,340
Well, Moye,

657
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,180
have you known that the palace would be on fire today

658
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,540
and Aranya would be stuck?

659
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,580
I did know a fire would break out.

660
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,540
But Aranya was in the Xiaohan House

661
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,980
without a step out

662
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,180
when the fire was breaking out the other day.

663
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,300
So I didn't notice whether the fire

664
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,260
had spread to the dungeon.

665
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,580
It's all Changdi's fault.

666
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,420
She locked me in the serpentine cage.

667
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,260
I was helpless

668
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,380
when the fire was spreading.

669
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,940
If Shen Ye hadn't been there,

670
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,140
I would have died.

671
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,740
The serpentine cage?

672
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,820
In fact,

673
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,980
Aranya had never made any troubles

674
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,220
to be prisoned in the dungeon.

675
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,580
You are different from her,

676
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,700
so what you suffered from

677
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,460
is also different from her.

678
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,140
No matter what I do,

679
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,380
I can't duplicate Aranya's life.

680
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,860
How could you know the reason of her death?

681
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,500
It's...

682
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,420
In the Dream of Aranya,

683
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,380
it's doomed to be the situation that
small errors can lead to huge consequences.

684
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,100
There are uncertainties

685
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,140
that may change what will happen here,

686
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,380
but among these,

687
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,660
there's only one thing that can't be changed easily.

688
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,820
What's it?

689
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,260
Do you know the white lotus

690
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,380
in the Pundarika Pond

691
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,460
which is transferred from a human heart?

692
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,500
The lotus always knows the changes of four seasons

693
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,900
as well as shifts of days and nights

694
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,180
while thousands of white lotus blossoms
in the Pundarika Pond

695
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,060
never change.

696
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,180
Do you mean

697
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,300
what never changes isn't the lotus nut

698
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,940
but the human heart?

699
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,940
Exactly.

700
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,420
What happens in the mortal realm means nothing.

701
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,380
Only hearts never change,

702
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,540
including how Junuo treats you,

703
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,980
as well as how Changdi treats you.

704
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,540
And how His Majesty and Her Majesty treat you.

705
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,300
So you ask me to go through the life of Aranya.

706
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,740
Then I can get to know how they treat Aranya

707
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,180
through worldly affairs,

708
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,180
which is the reason of her death.

709
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:33,740
Exactly.

710
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,100
So you can do whatever you want to do,

711
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,940
and you don't have to behave as the previous Aranya.

712
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,140
As long as you remember

713
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,820
that you should make the same choices

714
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,180
as Aranya did on certain great events
and don't go against her choices,

715
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,900
everything will go well.
