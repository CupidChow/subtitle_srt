00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 56

3
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,220
You created the starlight ward

4
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,180
at the risk of losing your own life.

5
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,700
Dong Hua,

6
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,980
don't you have any compassion for me?

7
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,100
My compassion for you was the reason you escaped last time.

8
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,380
This time,

9
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,580
I will show you no mercy.

10
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,660
Today,

11
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,900
I will give you the satisfaction.

12
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,460
Great.

13
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,060
If you seal me in the starlight ward,

14
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,020
none of us is getting out.

15
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,780
You will go to hell with me.

16
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,940
Right.

17
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,700
Ice face can fight.

18
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,740
You took half of your heart out to make this ring for me.

19
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,780
His Majesty can't just die like that.

20
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,660
Chong Lin.

21
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,020
I want to see him.

22
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,620
Look. The stars are falling down.

23
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm afraid it's too late.

24
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,860
No, it's not.

25
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,540
We're not destined to be together.

26
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,820
But that doesn't mean

27
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,300
we can't die together.

28
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,620
His Majesty's got to be fighting Miao Luo

29
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,340
somewhere.

30
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,700
Do you know

31
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,940
where they are now?

32
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,540
The stars are falling down to the Fanyin Valley.

33
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,900
So His Majesty's probably there.

34
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,780
You may get to see him alive

35
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,340
if you rush over now.

36
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,780
Your Majesty.

37
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,380
Your Majesty.

38
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,580
Dong Hua.

39
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,660
Are you really going to die with me here?

40
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,940
I've made myself clear about

41
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,500
why I'm here.

42
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,300
Don't ask me over and over again.

43
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,340
You are indeed fearless.

44
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,940
If my death is a price to pay

45
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,100
for the peace of the Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

46
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,340
it's worth it.

47
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,260
I didn't know you could be so ruthless with yourself.

48
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,740
I'm not ruthless.

49
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,900
It's you who has this overwhelming obsession.

50
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,980
Obsession?

51
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,140
I, the demon king, have no obsession.

52
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,740
Don't forget that

53
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,580
you were the one who made me a demon.

54
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,380
Chong Lin.

55
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,540
Are you alright?

56
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,700
The dark energy is too strong.

57
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,660
Even starlight ward

58
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,460
can't cleanse it.

59
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,420
Looks like His Majesty is determined to

60
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,820
fight Miao Luo on his own.

61
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,740
Lian Song.

62
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,660
Do something about it!

63
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,780
No one can enter the ward,

64
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,860
except His Majesty.

65
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,140
Yan.

66
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,580
Yan Chiwu?

67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,060
Why are you all wearing a sad expression?

68
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,660
It's true that we can't enter the starlight ward.

69
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,540
But ice face will come out eventually

70
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,940
when he defeats Miao Luo, right?

71
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,340
The stars are falling down already.

72
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,180
Don't you see it?

73
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,700
That means an immortal is dying.

74
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,620
You mean...

75
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,340
Ice face...

76
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,860
He's not getting out?

77
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,980
Your Majesty.

78
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,300
Your Majesty.

79
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,620
Your Majesty.

80
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,260
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

81
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,860
Fengjiu.

82
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,300
What are you doing, Ye Qingti?

83
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,140
I know you want to break in and help His Majesty.

84
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,980
But I can't just watch you die.

85
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,980
Let go of me.

86
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,260
Your Highness.

87
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,060
I'd rather be hated by you

88
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,020
than let you die for nothing.

89
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,780
Qingti.

90
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,700
Only the one who created the ward

91
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,460
is allowed to enter.

92
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,580
Others won't be able to get in.

93
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,700
Let go of me!

94
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,300
I don't know much about things in the immortal realm.

95
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,100
How could I know if you're lying or not?

96
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,140
Qingti.

97
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,300
His Majesty's life is at stake.

98
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,740
I won't do stupid things.

99
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,620
I just want to take a close look at him.

100
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,580
Let me go.

101
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,500
The stars are falling down nonstop.

102
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,540
Is any god dying?

103
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,740
Something's up.

104
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,460
What's going on?

105
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,620
Follow me.

106
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,100
Let me go!

107
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,340
Xiaojiu.

108
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
- Fengjiu. - Your Highness.

109
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,780
Fengjiu.

110
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,460
Your Highness.

111
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,180
Xiaojiu.

112
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,980
How did she get into the starlight ward?

113
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,340
It's because of the colored glaze ring.

114
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,220
That's half of His Majesty's heart.

115
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,940
With half of His Majesty's heart,

116
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,900
of course Fengjiu could get in easily.

117
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,260
I don't know if Her Highness is His Majesty's misfortune

118
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,860
or the other way around any more.

119
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,180
Xiaobai.

120
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,620
Xiaobai.

121
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,860
How could this happen?

122
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,580
How could this happen?

123
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,820
Xiaobai.

124
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,900
Blood from nine-tailed fox's heart can cleanse evil spirit.

125
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,100
Her cultivation has been weakened

126
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,060
after she was stained by my blood.

127
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,420
Dong Hua.

128
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,300
Even now,

129
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,340
you are still protecting the fox.

130
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,900
I want you to lose the love of your life forever

131
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,820
and experience the heartbreaking pain.

132
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
Xiaobai.

133
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,660
Stop the bleeding from your wound

134
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
and wait for me under the Lingshu Stage.

135
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,100
I will take you home soon.

136
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,740
You are lying again.

137
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,060
Look.

138
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,740
Blood from nine-tailed fox's heart can cleanse evil spirit.

139
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
But I couldn't have cleansed Miao Luo's evil spirit

140
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,460
so fast.

141
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,460
If you hadn't fed me with your golden blood

142
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,820
in the Dream of Aranya,

143
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,340
I couldn't have done that.

144
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,820
After you lied to me for so many times

145
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,180
and I got you wrong for so many times,

146
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,140
we are still together now.

147
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,180
Aren't we destined for each other?

148
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,620
Your Majesty.

149
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,260
Don't push me away every time.

150
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,340
You think you can kill me by doing that?

151
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,100
You still don't get it, do you?

152
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,700
You can't kill me by doing that!

153
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,260
What's wrong?

154
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,740
Do they win or lose?

155
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,500
There seems to be nothing going on.

156
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,020
Should we just wait it out?

157
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,860
Xiaojiu, wait for me.

158
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,140
I bet

159
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,420
I will break the ward

160
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,500
and get you out.

161
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,660
No.

162
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,580
The starlight ward is set for

163
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,820
eliminating all evil spirits.

164
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,780
If you break in while evil spirits are not eliminated,

165
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,060
everything in there will be destroyed.

166
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,700
Dark energy is so strong now.

167
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,220
Ice face has to fight against Miao Luo

168
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,540
while injured heavily.

169
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
He and Xiaojiu don't seem to have energy

170
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,220
for removing the dark energy.

171
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,540
What's wrong with me?

172
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,340
What's wrong with me?

173
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,540
What's wrong with me?

174
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,540
No.

175
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,140
Dong Hua, don't.

176
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,740
Don't make me disappear.

177
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,860
Dong Hua.

178
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,860
Seal me!

179
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,700
No, Dong Hua!

180
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,340
Dong Hua!

181
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,140
Dong Hua!

182
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,780
You are all immortals.

183
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,140
Can either one of you do something about it?

184
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,260
There's one way

185
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,020
that may work.

186
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,740
What is it?

187
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,860
When the ward is being broken,

188
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,460
if there's a strong force supporting from the outside,

189
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,940
the people inside may be saved.

190
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,140
You mean

191
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,700
we gather all our powers

192
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,460
to force the ward open

193
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,660
and then we let the ward destroy all dark energy

194
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,140
after we rescue them out?

195
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,340
No one has ever tried

196
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
this way before.

197
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't know how it will turn out.

198
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,100
The condition is critical now.

199
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,940
As long as we can save ice face and Xiaojiu,

200
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,300
it's worth trying.

201
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,940
Third Prince, what do you think?

202
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,300
We don't seem

203
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,060
to have another choice.

204
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,220
Okay.

205
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,660
Everyone.

206
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,580
We will work together

207
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,260
to open the ward.

208
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,660
When the ward is open slightly,

209
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,500
God Zhe Yan,

210
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,860
you and I,

211
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,500
the longest living immortals here

212
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,340
should get in

213
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,020
and rescue them.

214
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,300
That's for the best.

215
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,580
Others will stay here

216
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,180
to keep the dark energy.

217
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,460
Let's get ready.

218
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,820
It must hurt a lot.

219
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,300
Xiaobai.

220
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,460
No.

221
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,180
I've worked so hard to finally see you.

222
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,900
It doesn't hurt at all.

223
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,180
You shouldn't be here.

224
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,220
You made starlight ward

225
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,220
to smash Miao Luo

226
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,020
and the Miaoyi Chasm, along with yourself.

227
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,900
Although I'm not so smart,

228
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,980
I've loved you for so long.

229
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,580
I know what you're thinking.

230
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,220
Tell me.

231
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,980
How can I get you out?

232
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,380
Why do you want to get me out?

233
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,380
Because I broke your heart?

234
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,580
But you broke my heart, too.

235
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Let's call it even,

236
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,060
okay?

237
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,140
I want to be by your side.

238
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,900
You want me to keep you company, right?

239
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,980
Yeah, you're right.

240
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,420
I did want you to come.

241
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,900
I've always wanted to take you along wherever I go.

242
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,860
Even when I'm going to die,

243
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,660
I don't want to part with you.

244
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,220
But I can't do that, Xiaobai.

245
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,260
You have a long way to go.

246
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,500
You don't want to take me along.

247
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,180
But I'm afraid I'll have to go before you.

248
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,780
Dong Hua.

249
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,740
It hurts.

250
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,900
Say something nice to me.

251
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,500
Cheer me up.

252
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,940
What do you want to hear?

253
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,100
Tell me that you like me.

254
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,700
I love you.

255
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,940
I love you, too.

256
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,580
Promise me that

257
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,860
you will hold my hands

258
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,620
when I'm about to die.

259
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,900
Wherever you go,

260
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,340
I want to be with you.

262
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,060

speak out these words.

349
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,300
I used to think that to love someone

350
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
is to give

351
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,580
and to become the person they like.

352
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,220

353
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,500
my love for him is all that matters.

354
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,060
Even if it's like a moth to a flame,

355
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,260
it's the best kind of love.

356
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,540
I didn't realize

357
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,020
until I lost you that

358
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,860
the best kind of love

359
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,820
is that I can remove all my camouflage

360
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,940
and be who I am.

361
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,340
I can be a kid if I want to.

362
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,740

363
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,380
without pretending.

364
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,700
I can act like a spoiled child if I want to.

365
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,100
I can get into a huff

366
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,100
if I want to.

367
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,780
Whenever I feel upset,

368
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,420
he will stretch out his arms for me

369
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,140
to lean on.

370
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
I didn't know that the best kind of love

371
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,260
has always been around me.

372
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,740
I didn't even know.

373
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,420
Yan, I'm sorry.

374
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,980
It took me so long to finally

375
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,140
realize how important you are to me.

376
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,220
The sweetest word in the world

377
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,900
is nothing poetic.

378
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,460
It's that I don't want to part with you

379
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,820
as long as you're by my side.

380
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,780
I want to be with you for the rest of my life, Yan.

381
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,260
Yan.

382
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,900
From now on,

383
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,340
I want to be the one who loves you.

384
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,500
What's wrong?

385
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,380
Why are you not talking?

386
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,620
Don't you like me now?

387
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,140
I...

388
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,700
No, no, no. I...

389
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,620
It's not like that. I...

390
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,260
Ji Heng.

391
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,220
Of course I like you.

392
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Loving you is the most important thing in my life.

393
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,460
I... I...

394
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,220
Jeez, you finally see me.

395
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,740
I'm... I'm more than happy.

396
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,500
I...

397
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,820
I finally did it!

398
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,100
You are finally in love with me!

399
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,180
Ji Heng.

400
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,700
Look at you.

401
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,300
Ji Heng.

402
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,180
You're not going to regret it, right?

403
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,020
I think... maybe...

404
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,940
maybe...

405
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,820
we should

406
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,020
go to the bedroom now.

407
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,100
Let go of me. Let go of me.

408
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,500
What are you talking about?

409
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,500
I'm not going to the bedroom with you.

410
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,180
I'm kidding, girl.

411
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,380
Ji Heng.

412
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,460
I'm here with you.

413
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,020
From now on,

414
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,060
we will never part with each other.

415
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,300
You're working in Tai Chen Palace.

416
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,220
Have you noticed any beautiful new fairy maids

417
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,300
recently?

418
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,660
Good one.

419
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,540
You're getting to resemble Dong Hua.

420
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,340
Third Prince.

421
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,580
Demon Lord Yan, you're here again.

422
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,940
I'm passing by.

423
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,700
Third Prince, you're losing this one.

424
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,300
I was distracted.

425
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,580
So I made the wrong move.

426
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,340
Come on, Qingti.

427
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,300
Let's play one more round.

428
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,420
I have to go back to the Tai Chen Palace for my duty.

429
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,180
Sorry.

430
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,900
I'll get going.

431
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
I'll play it with you.

432
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,540
I thought you hate playing the game of go.

433
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,500
It's true.

434
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,380
But I haven't seen you for a while.

435
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,660
I miss you more than

436
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,140
I hate to play chess.

437
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,820
The starlight ward has already been broken.

438
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,980
And you've been stopping by Bihai Cangling

439
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,340
for the past three months.

440
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,340
You have nothing better to do in the demons, do you?

441
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,860
I lost my way, okay?

442
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,700
God Zhe Yan, you're right.

443
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,460
Fox clan of Qingqiu

444
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,500
is a treasure waiting to be dug up.

445
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,260
No one would have expected it, right?

446
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,940
As blood from nine-tailed fox's heart

447
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,300
and His Majesty's golden blood cleansed the dark energy,

448
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,380
the starlight ward was broken automatically.

449
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,860
With that,

450
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,540
Bihai Cangling was saved.

451
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,180
All have survived safe and sound.

452
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,980
Except Fengjiu.

453
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,460
I'm really worried about her.

454
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,780
She's still in a coma

455
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,300
with her spirit hurt.

456
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,900
Lord,

457
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,340
I'm not a quack.

458
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,060
Even if I was one,
Fengjiu would be blessed enough to be fine.

459
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,060
They all say she and His Majesty are not meant to be.

460
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
But what I think is that

461
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,180
Fengjiu and Dong Hua are a destined couple.

462
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,300
They're one in a million.

463
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,660
That's right.

464
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,500
They shouldn't have listened to the Fate Stone.

465
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
All they did was in vain.

466
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,700
They're supposed to be together.

467
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,660
The Fate Stone was so absurd.

468
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,020
If it were me,

469
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,060
I would be mad enough

470
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
to crack it open.

471
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,420
Third Prince, you've really got some balls.

472
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,860
Well, yeah.

473
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,540
Who was the one being so sacrificial

474
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,420
and dragging God Zhe Yan

475
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,500
into entering the ward

476
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,500
that day?

477
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,260
Fengjiu was obviously more useful.

478
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,820
The one and only nine-tailed red fox in the universe

479
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,660
should be so powerful!

480
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,380
She's indeed my friend.

481
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,780
Idiot.

482
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Hey, mind your tongue.

483
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,540
Who's the kid?

484
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,540
You can tell that.

485
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,260
from his hair color,

486
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,140
He's Dong Hua's child?

487
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,460
What is Dong Hua?

488
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,100
Is it a place?

489
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,900
I'm my mother's son.

490
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,220
Uncle Xie Guchou, where's my mother?

491
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Your mother is hurt.

492
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,740
But she will wake up after a few months of rest.

493
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,700
She used to compliment you a lot.

494
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,100
That you are calm and responsible for your age.

495
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,980
Let me see

496
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,900
if you're really responsible.

497
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,060
Go in there.

498
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,340
The smell of medicine is so strong.

499
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,300
Mother.

500
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,300
Mother. Mother.

501
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,820
Who are you?

502
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,980
I'm Bai Gungun.

503
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,300
Who's

504
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,580
Bai Gungun?

505
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,900
My mother's son.

506
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,300
Is it so surprising

507
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,020
for you?

508
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,060
You even dropped the bowl.

509
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,580
Uncle, you're so good-looking.

510
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,100
Who are you?

511
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,340
Gungun.

512
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,540
I'm your father.

513
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,300
Mother, father, you are kissing again.

514
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,180
I want a kiss, too.

515
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,500
The journey of life is so long.

516
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,380
Fate can't decide my life.

517
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,620
I, Bai Fengjiu, will bring Emperor Dong Hua

518
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,580
into my life no matter what.

519
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,900
Because

520
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,180
I love you the most.

521
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,060
For the three eternities,

522
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,540
you little fox

523
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,380
are bound to be mine.

524
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,020
In every eternity,

525
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,380
Dong Hua belongs to Fengjiu.

526
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,740
Both of you are mine.
