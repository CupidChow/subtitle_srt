1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 6

3
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,680
Isn't it Ji Heng?

4
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,440
Today His Majesty's wife-to-be will stay at Tai Chen Palace.

5
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,160
You can't screw it up.

6
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,920
You're here.

7
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,280
Please feel free to stay here.

8
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,880
How's that possible?

9
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,500
They weren't close at all

10
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,700
last time in Mount Fuyu.

11
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
I can't believe it.

12
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,080
It doesn't remember me.

13
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,760
You will have time to get closer

14
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,720
in Tai Chen Palace later.

15
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,800
Your Majesty,

16
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,480
I heard you are getting married.

17
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
Did I tell you to come in?

18
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
I told you so many times

19
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
to find a empress.

20
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
I guess I have said it like dozens of times.

21
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
You didn't listen to me at all.

22
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,760
What's gotten into you?

23
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,040
Why do you agree so easily this time?

24
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,840
I've heard so much that

25
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,200
Princess Ji Heng

26
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
is a rarely seen beauty in the demons.

27
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,840
Is there any beauty that Third Prince doesn't know about?

28
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,680
You are flattering me, Your Majesty.

29
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Speaking of beauties,

30
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
for so many years,

31
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,920
you must have seen a great many of them.

32
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,400
Is she so reputed for her achievements in four arts

33
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
that you suddenly fall for her

34
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,040
and put an end to your bachelor life for over 100 thousand years?

35
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,640
Do you come all the way here today

36
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,260
for the gossip?

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,080
Well, nothing in particular.

38
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,240
Actually,

39
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
someone's birthday is coming.

40
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,200
I was thinking of...

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,520
Yes, it's Cheng Yu.

42
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
It's her birthday soon.

43
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,960
And recently,

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,480
she has fallen in love with collecting short knives.

45
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,920
So I drew a design of a short knife.

46
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,960
And I wonder if you can

47
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,840
make an unusual short knife for her.

48
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
What makes the short knife unusual is that

49
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,280
it's a short knife in close combat

50
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,960
and it becomes a long sword in long range combat.

51
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,840
When you're fighting with someone who outmatches you greatly,

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
it can release hidden weapons,

53
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,120
some silver needles that can stick the opponents down immediately.

54
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,760
When you're hunting,

55
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,480
it can transform into an iron bow.

56
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,680
Besides,

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
When you're cooking in the kitchen,

58
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,840
it can turn into a kitchen knife.

59
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
So it can be used as

60
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,400
a short knife, a long sword,

61
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
a hidden weapon, an iron bow and a kitchen knife.

62
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Five in total.

63
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,160
That's right.

64
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
And it can be used in any occasions.

65
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,560
It's so useful that

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
Cheng Yu will definitely carry it with her

67
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
all the time.

68
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
That's what your plan is.

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,120
And I also think that

70
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,120
the short knife

71
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,080
can't be made with magic power.

72
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,800
It has to be made

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,600
with a new natural power.

74
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
So it can be creative enough

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,360
to convey

76
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,880
my particular feeling

77
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
for  Lord Cheng Yu.

78
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
It's not a problem

79
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,320
for you, Third Prince.

80
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,640
You don't need help for that at all.

81
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,640
But the thing is

82
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,280
I'm usually good at making big weapons

83
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
with magic powers

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,520
like Bronze Ware of Demons.

85
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
It's a bit difficult for me

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
to make a small, delicate short knife.

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,840
So after thinking about it over and over again,

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,960
I can only turn to you for help, Your Majesty.

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Only you can make something so complicated.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
The design drawing

91
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,400
is exquisite over all.

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,360
But there are some rough places.

93
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,200
If it's dismantled,

94
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
traces will be left.

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
And wonderful workmanship

96
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
will not be achieved.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,360
Thanks god

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,000
for giving me the opportunity to show my talent.

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,240
I admit that I do poorly in four arts,

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,240
but if I'm given the chance to revise the design,

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
I will prove to His Majesty that

102
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm talented as well as Ji Heng.

103
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,120
And he will change the way he thinks of me.

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
I have to block it here,

105
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
in case Third Prince finds out

106
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,480
as he speaks.

107
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,700
I know you've been into

108
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,660
making ceramic.

109
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,720
The other day,

110
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,520
I found a place that is rich in

111
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,040
porcelain clay in the north desert owned by Xuan Ming

112
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,200
which gathers the best clay within Eight Deserts.

113
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
But Xuan Ming

114
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,240
guards it strictly.

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
If you make the short knife for me,

116
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,840
I will draw a map of the place for you.

117
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,960
If you go and ask him for the clay,

118
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
I'm sure he will give it to you.

119
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,480
How about I give you the materials for making the knife

120
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
and you forge it yourself?

121
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,960
You know I had a beef

122
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,920
with Xuan Ming.

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,560
Several years ago, I went for a dinner party in his mansion.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,030
His concubine had her eyes on me

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,150
and wrote me love letters everyday.

126
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,080
He has been upset about it even until now.

127
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,360
I don't like to

128
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
owe anyone anything,

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
or use my statues to force anyone anything.

130
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,240
You go back

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
and change all the porcelain with gold and silver jade,

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
then leak the message that

133
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
you are allergic to porcelain clay.

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,840
The finer the porcelain is, the severe the allergy is.

135
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,880
You are having a birthday this year.

136
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,120
I think Xuan Ming will offer quite a few

137
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,960
fine porcelain to you.

138
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,800
And then you deliver it to me.

139
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Is there any problem?

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
No problem. No problem.

141
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,240
That's a deal.

142
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,080
I'll leave you the design of the short knife

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,200
and I will bring the materials to you later.

144
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,480
Thanks, Your Majesty.

145
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,720
Quick learner.

146
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,040
I will go find materials for the short knife.

147
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,800
Are you coming with me?

148
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,000
The tea is so good.

149
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,880
His Majesty always feeds me so well.

150
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,720
If I were really a pet,

151
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,520
he must be a good owner.

152
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,600
What?

153
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,040
The ink brush?

154
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,040
Where?

155
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,200
Little fox,

156
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,960
I read about a passage of scripture
which is so hard to understand.

157
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,600
But His Majesty is being so mobile that I can't find him easily.

158
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,440
Do you think I should leave him a note

159
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
and ask him about it later?

160
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
Greetings Your Majesty.

161
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,880
You added the two places, right?

162
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,120
Not bad.

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,160
What?

164
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,880
Not her.

165
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
I thought you only knew about reading.

166
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,040
That's so unexpected.

167
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,680
It's not easy to understand the design drawing from Lian Song.

168
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,560
Let alone finding the two places

169
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,520
to do final touches.

170
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
Your brother said that you had broad interests.

171
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
I'm really impressed today.

172
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,760
I...

173
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Since you know about this

174
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,560
and you're interested in it,

175
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,800
I will open the furnace and start forging tomorrow.

176
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,280
Come help me.

177
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,520
It's my honor

178
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,160
to help Your Majesty

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,360
and learn something new.

180
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,200
But I'm clumsy with my hands.

181
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,760
I'm afraid to slow you down.

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,600
It's not a big deal as long as you're not dumb.

183
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,200
You start biting people now?

184
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
And it's your benefactor that you bit.

185
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,600
It's not my fault.

186
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,520
Ji Heng is a liar.

187
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,400
She didn't revise the picture.

188
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,560
I did.

189
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,560
Your Majesty.

190
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,040
You really treat me

191
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
as a pet.

192
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,880
Si Ming.

193
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,920
Lord.

194
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
I've found a good alcohol lately.

195
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,800
No wonder you're so happy.

196
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,360
What's this?

197
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,400
A design draft of a weapon for someone.

198
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,440
How crazy the designer is

199
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,240
to design

200
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
something so insane?

201
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,480
It's Third Prince who

202
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
wants to celebrate your birthday.

203
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,320
His Majesty was obviously protecting Ji Heng.

204
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
I had a conflict with Ji Heng.

205
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,600
But His Majesty chose to help her instead of me,

206
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,220
and snapped at me

207
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,620
indiscriminately.

208
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,200
I should have curled up far away.

209
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,040
But maybe at night His Majesty

210
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,400
will realize that he wronged me in the day

211
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,920
and come apologize to me.

212
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,000
What if he can't find me?

213
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
I'd better curl up a little closer.

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,240
Let's see if His Majesty is still here.

215
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,640
Has he ever come looking for me?

216
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,520
Why is Ji Heng in his room?

217
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,720
The long sword is kept as an iron box here.

218
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,310
And there are some needles in the box

219
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
to be used as hidden weapons.

220
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
Third Prince's design is very perfect.

221
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,480
But I've been trying to figure out

222
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
what the two ending places are for.

223
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,360
Teacher.

224
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,080
What is it?

225
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,520
I mean could you please stop your pen for a while

226
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,200
and give me some enlightenment.

227
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,560
You just need to copy the picture

228
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
from Third Prince.

229
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
But you can't even do the simple things well.

230
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,680
Looks like

231
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm better than Ji Heng in this regard.

232
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,000
This is the only thing that I can do better than her.

233
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
But she takes it from me.

234
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,760
She can't even do the simple things well.

235
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,400
If His Majesty finds out,

236
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
I wonder if he will mock her with some harsh words.

237
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,680
This is a valve.

238
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,480
The sword will withdraw when the iron sheet is pushed aside.

239
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,080
Lian Song drew it too simple.

240
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,760
You got it?

241
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,280
Got it.

242
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,280
On those two places,

243
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,960
although Lian Song also drew simply,

244
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,960
the revision you did was good enough.

245
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,440
Actually these two places are less difficult than those two.

246
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
At noon,

247
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
the two places...

248
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,440
Perhaps it's my luck.

249
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,120
I used to

250
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,240
study alone.

251
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,160
I only know a little.

252
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,560
But I've learnt so much tonight from teacher,
more than what I already know.

253
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,960
It's getting late.

254
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,920
I want to finish the drawing.

255
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,840
Teacher,

256
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
if I can finish the drawing,

257
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,320
can you give me the screen

258
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,360
as a prize?

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,600
Okay.

260
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,440
If you're tired,

261
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,400
go back and rest.

262
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,200
You can finish it tomorrow.

263
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,360
But

264
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,440
it will slow down your process.

265
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
And I was thinking about

266
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,040
finishing the drawing

267
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,880
and getting my reward.

268
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,440
One day is not a big deal.

269
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,360
As for the screen,

270
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,120
I will have Chong Lin deliver to you when it's done.

271
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
I remember when I did something stupid

272
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,800
or when Chong Lin did something

273
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,600
that His Majesty was not satisfied with,

274
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
he tended to

275
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,320
hurt our feelings.

276
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
But he doesn't hurt Ji Heng's feelings.

277
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,040
He is so kind to Ji Heng.

278
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,240
I didn't know His Majesty could be someone
who satisfies other's request.

279
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,560
It's just that he never does that to me.

280
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,880
I heard that His Majesty never paints for anyone easily.

281
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,760
He is so nice to you, my princess.

282
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,640
I'm indebted to His Majesty.

283
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
Sooner or later, I will have to pay it back.

284
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,120
Teacher,

285
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,360
if we pulverize the crimson stone

286
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,760
and mix it with porcelain clay,

287
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,320
the flask could have the color of

288
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,800
beautiful sunset red.

289
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,040
Ji Heng thinks so differently.

290
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,320
If I were her,

291
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720
the best I could say is

292
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,640
'it can sell a good price.'

293
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,600
Never mind.

294
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,200
I'd better not stay here.

295
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,680
It upsets me watching you while I can do nothing.

296
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,320
My feet fell asleep.

297
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Little fox.

298
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
Little fox.

299
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,120
It's so adorable.

300
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,080
Little fox.

301
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,520
You don't fight back anymore.

302
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,120
Do you recall who I am?

303
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
In Ten-evil Lotus Land,

304
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,000
you liked me so much.

305
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
You were even reluctant to part with me.

306
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
Maybe you feel the same way towards His Majesty.

307
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
But now

308
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,240
me and His Majesty can raise you together.

309
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,600
Are you happy?

310
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,840
Right.

311
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,320
Little fox, look.

312
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,720
This is a rice bowl

313
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,520
I and His Majesty specially made for you.

314
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,880
I've been thinking about

315
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,600
creating a pattern

316
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,160
as your exclusive mark.

317
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,000
And it occurred to me just now that

318
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
your claws

319
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
may be the best.

320
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
Why on earth did I transform into a fox

321
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,560
at His Majesty's side?

322
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,760
I've worked so hard for so long.

323
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,440
But I've only made it

324
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,520
to the position of a pet.

325
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,760
I am so useless.

326
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,520
I used to be the most popular fairy

327
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,280
in Qingqiu Kingdom.

328
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,600
Perhaps the hierarchical Sky Kingdom

329
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,240
thinks that we are not followers of

330
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,040
traditional etiquette.

331
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,720
But

332
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
I don't eat in a bowl

333
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,480
or sleep in a pet nest.

334
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,920
I just want to get close to it.

335
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,640
It doesn't like me?

336
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,840
It used to like me a lot.

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,480
Your Majesty.

338
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,640
It's been naughty lately.

339
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,000
Lock it up for a while.

340
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,040
Yes.

341
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,520
Your Majesty,

342
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,400
you said it's naughty.

343
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
Did you say it to me?

344
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,200
And that's all?

345
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,560
His Majesty ordered to lock you up.

346
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,520
And I don't know where he wants to lock you

347
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,840
or until when.

348
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,720
You were making a big scene there just now.

349
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,000
I thought it was not a good time to ask.

350
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,360
Come to my place.

351
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,800
Little fox.

352
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,280
You still don't want to eat?

353
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Did I mention it to you that

354
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,440
Princess Ji Heng was born to be

355
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,360
afraid of bleeding.

356
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,840
Princess Ji Heng is weak.

357
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,360
Even if she suffers only a minor injury,

358
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,600
the wound will bleed out a lot.

359
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,720
Let alone getting

360
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,080
such a good scratch by your claws.

361
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,280
It got her injured badly.

362
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,040
She finally recovered

363
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,080
after taking some magic medicine.

364
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
That was nerve-racking.

365
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,440
Now

366
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,760
His Majesty is too busy to think about you.

367
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
I will let you out for a bit.

368
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,640
You can go enjoy the sunshine.

369
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,640
But remember to

370
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,320
keep away from His Majesty.

371
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
Don't let him see you.

372
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,440
Or I'll be accused of not carrying out my duty.

373
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,920
I know.

374
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,360
Exotic animals like snow lions only eat Lucid Ganoderma.

375
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,400
How could you feed it with Lucid Ganoderma?

376
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,920
Even I...

377
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
Even I have never got to taste it before.

378
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
It always has been my privilege.

379
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
This is what you will do to me
when I'm trying to catch your attention.

380
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,720
You are His Majesty's favorite spirit animal

381
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,840
in Tai Chen Palace.

382
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,080
I heard those fairy maids gossiping that

383
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,200
His Majesty likes you a lot.

384
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,960
I thought you were a rarely seen fox.

385
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,080
But you turn out to be so ordinary.

386
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,760
I never thought that

387
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,600
I would end up

388
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
competing with a snow lion for favor.

389
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,480
Why are you walking so fast?

390
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,760
What?

391
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,720
You are mutinous about it?

392
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,080
Rumor has it that you are arrogant and all

393
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,200
just because His Majesty dotes on you.

394
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,280
How dare you

395
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,840
hurt my mater Princess Ji Heng?

396
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,280
My master is so kind and forgiving.

397
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,920
Consider yourself unlucky to meet me today.

398
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,000
What they say is true.

399
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,600
you can't talk.

400
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,900
Big fish. It must be a big fish.

401
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,560
Here we go.

402
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,480
Your Highness.

403
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

404
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,640
Your Highness. Your Highness.

405
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,640
Si Ming.

406
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,960
Look what I got for you?

407
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
Thank you. You're welcome.

408
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,480
I asked you for medicine
and you came all the way to deliver it to me.

409
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,560
It's not a big deal.

410
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,600
The effect will be halved if you add so much sugar.

411
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,480
Si Ming.

412
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,080
You owed so much to others

413
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,280
for asking for all these magic medicine.

414
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,200
Which fairy it is that

415
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,960
you are cooking the medicine for?

416
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,720
Terrible fate.

417
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,280
It's all because of the terrible fate.

418
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,080
I've spent some days in Si Ming's mansion.

419
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm born to fear bitterness.

420
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm surprised that Si Ming remembers it.

421
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,400
I want to ask you something with sincerity.

422
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
How exactly did you end up

423
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,760
getting yourself in this situation

424
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
as an experienced princess?

425
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,160
Goddess of the Empyrean.

426
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,040
Princess of Qingqiu.

427
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
The obsession that I have has been going on for over 2000 years.

428
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,280
Is it time to give it up now?

429
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,360
My deputies, what suggestions do you have?

430
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,840
Father,

431
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,240
the empress's ceremony should be planned carefully.

432
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,320
And this time,

433
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,880
the divinity of the gods must be shown.

434
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,840
Your Majesty,

435
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,760
Demon King Xu Yang is so evil-intended

436
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,880
to propose a sudden marriage.

437
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,880
It might be their trick to stall for time.

438
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,320
How can the demons play against us

439
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
with their current power?

440
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,680
Third Prince, you and I both

441
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,840
fought in the previous war.

442
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,800
You should know
that the demons are quite a force to be reckoned with.

443
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,400
Your Majesty, what do you think?

444
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,480
Sacrifice to heaven

445
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
will be held two days later.

446
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,960
Take care, Your Majesty.

447
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,520
You can stop looking.

448
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,160
No one is looking for you.

449
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,960
Seems like they don't know that you went missing.

450
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,440
I got nothing to do anyway.

451
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,200
So I went to Yi Shi San Heaven to ask about you.

452
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,760
They said you were locked away by His Majesty

453
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,840
for hurting the princess of the demons.

454
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,140
Did you get hurt by the princess

455
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,100
for revenge?

456
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,600
His Majesty is getting married two days later.

457
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,560
He is marrying the princess of the demons.

458
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,240
What are you going to do?

459
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,760
I know they are getting married.

460
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,120
But I didn't expect it to be so soon.

461
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,720
Do you want to go back to Qingqiu?

462
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,800
It's definitely not easy to hold on to

463
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,840
the obsession for over 2000 years.

464
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,840
There's no one

465
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
around His Majesty before.

466
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,200
It's kind of a beautiful and stubborn affection

467
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,600
that you have for him.

468
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,600
But now he is becoming other's husband.

469
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
If you keep on doing this,

470
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,360
the affection will become

471
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,840
a torment.

472
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
If you get yourself into it deeper and deeper,

473
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,920
your life will somehow become a misery.

474
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,160
Life is long for you.

475
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,120
You don't want to live in a misery, do you?

476
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,680
No women in Qingqiu can bear to

477
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,320
to lose their dignity like that.

478
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,840
Do you want to see him for one last time?

479
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,640
Wait. I know what to do.

480
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,160
This is my pavilion.

481
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,320
Teacher.

482
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,240
Suo Ying seems hungry.

483
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,200
Although it's not time for the meal yet,

484
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,360
can we feed it with Lucid Ganoderma first?

485
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,160
Handsome host.

486
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,920
Beautiful hostess.

487
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,120
And their beloved spiritual pet

488
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,640
that understands human language.

489
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,440
The scene is so picturesque

490
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,320
and harmonious.

491
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,640
Shall we leave?

492
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,280
The long sword in His Majesty's hand

493
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,520
must be the present

494
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,640
Third Prince made for Cheng Yu's birthday.

495
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,360
He is using Foling Flowers

496
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,640
to test the weight and speed of the sword.

497
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,640
If it's too heavy

498
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
or too slow,

499
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,720
the wind brought by the sword will

500
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,160
blow down Foling Flowers.

501
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240

Everything is going to be alright.
