00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 35

3
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,820
You're awake?

4
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,900
Do you feel uncomfortable?

5
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,140
His Majesty!

6
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,300
How come he treats me so gently?

7
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,860
It must be a dream.

8
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,660
Since it is a dream,

9
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,540
I can take this advantage to fulfill
some of my unrealized dreams.

10
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,580
His Majesty is surprisingly real

11
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,700
in the dream.

12
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,700
This is unbelievable!

13
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,860
Do you need me to teach you

14
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,860
how to inhale and exhale at this time?

15
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,220
This has always been the custom in Qingqiu.

16
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,060
Don't be such a bumpkin

17
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,420
and judge me!

18
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,020
You are just

19
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,380
a thirty-thousand-year-old little fox.

20
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,620
Do you really know such custom?

21
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,500
Anyway,

22
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
as a locally born and bred fairy,

23
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,460
I don't even know

24
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,460
what type of custom that is.

25
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,780
His Majesty can't know it either.

26
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,860
Did you just breathe?

27
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
It's a big taboo in Qingqiu.

28
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,460
A cousin of the grey wolf next door

29
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,940
got disengaged by his fiancée

30
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,860
because of this.

31
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,580
It's something disrespectful.

32
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,940
This custom is pretty interesting.

33
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,900
I have never tried it.

34
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,180
It's pretty good

35
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,660
to follow the Qingqiu custom.

36
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,220
That's very shameful of you to say so!

37
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,980
Do you still remember

38
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
who embraced first?

39
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,420
Eh...

40
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,820
Admittedly...

41
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,380
Admittedly, it was I who embraced first,

42
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,060
but this is nothing but my dream.

43
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,460
I can do whatever I want.

44
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,260
You are just my imagination.

45
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,940
I can take advantage of you if I like to,

46
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,380
but you can't do otherwise.

47
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,860
There isn't any rule to follow

48
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,100
in my dream anyway,

49
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,500
so don't reason with me.

50
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,060
My words are the only rule.

51
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,220
So you take this as a dream!

52
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,700
I was wondering

53
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,100
why you became so open all of a sudden

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,340
and

55
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,180
didn't get mad.

56
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,300
What do you mean?

57
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,900
Isn't this a dream?

58
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,420
Where am I?

59
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,620
Why would I be mad?

60
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,900
Did I really

61
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
take advantage of you?

62
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,460
Do you still remember

63
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,340
what were you doing before you fell asleep, Xiaobai?

64
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,740
I seem to have lost the memory.

65
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,820
Your hands are so cold.

66
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,420
Are you afraid?

67
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,140
What is there to be afraid of

68
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,020
while I'm here?

69
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,980
You just lost your head from too much sleep.

70
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,260
It happens if you sleep too much.

71
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,940
Do you remember what happened lately?

72
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,580
I don't think it matters

73
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,540
if you lost your memories of everything.

74
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,300
Since

75
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,460
you're not my dream,

76
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,900
this is not the Sky Kingdom either.

77
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,140
So

78
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,660
why are you here with me

79
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,940
as this is not the Sky Kingdom?

80
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,860
And,

81
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,140
how did you get an injury?

82
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,660
Where are we?

83
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,940
It's nothing, Xiaobai!

84
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,420
This place is called the Dream of Aranya.

85
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,580
Do you remember

86
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,540
when you left Tai Chen Palace?

87
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,900
Isn't it a few months before

88
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,980
you married Her Majesty?

89
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,780
She only has the memory

90
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,340
as the spiritual fox in the Sky Kingdom.

91
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,900
That's why she didn't get mad at me.

92
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,300
This is much easier for me.

93
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,260
The Dream of Aranya

94
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,740
can disturb the memories of the severely injured.

95
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,300
The severely injured?

96
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,500
Am I injured again?

97
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,620
What's the Dream of Aranya for?

98
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,700
This is a ward

99
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,900
similar to the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

100
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,980
Yan Chiwu trapped me here.

101
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,260
You worried about me,

102
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,020
so you hurried here to save me.

103
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,300
Yan Chiwu is too powerful.

104
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,220
He trapped you twice!

105
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,940
And he trapped you too!

106
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,500
We couldn't get out of here

107
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,420
and have to stay.

108
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,980
Why is he

109
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,500
so malignant?

110
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,740
So,

111
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,180
how come I don't have any memory

112
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,140
of the part he trapped you again

113
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,940
and I rushed to save you?

114
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,940
Because you slept too much, Xiaobai.

115
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,780
Don't you always come to save me

116
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,020
when I get trapped?

117
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,420
You do know I am that little fox.

118
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,340
Why do you come to know now?

119
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,020
It's my fault.

120
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,620
No big deal anyway.

121
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,460
You had been good to me

122
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,860
before Ji Heng came to the Tai Chen Palace.

123
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,620
You became bad to me

124
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
only after Ji Heng came.

125
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,300
Don't be bothered by that.

126
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,380
Ji Heng

127
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,020
is the one you love.

128
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,020
But I am nothing more

129
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,420
than a spiritual pet

130
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,380
in the Tai Chen Palace.

131
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,180
I scratched her

132
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,340
and you imprisoned me as a consequence.

133
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,140
That's nothing wrong actually.

134
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,260
It doesn't matter

135
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,860
that you didn't come to see me.

136
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,900
You were preparing for the marriage to Ji Heng.

137
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,980
That involves a lot of red tape

138
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,940
and rituals.

139
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,540
I'm just fine that

140
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,420
you forgot about me at the time.

141
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,900
You need to mind least of all

142
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
for the incident that

143
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,700
your favorite spiritual pet lately almost killed me.

144
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,260
Now

145
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,940
I've figured out a set of logic

146
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,940
to understand it.

147
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,300
If I had let Chong Lin

148
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,460
arrest me that day,

149
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,780
this incident would not have happened.

150
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,300
I can't blame everyone and everything but myself.

151
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,540
It's all destined anyhow

152
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,100
that all the bad luck would fall on me.

153
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,380
Maybe, god wants to use

154
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,860
all the sufferings I had in your palace to show that

155
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,580
our destinies are not tied at all.

156
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,740
So,

157
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,220
I just...

158
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,620
Xiaobai,

159
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,300
so what do you want to do?

160
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,740
It's been an hour since Xiaobai woke up.

161
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,860
She lost all her cultivation

162
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,780
after falling into the Dream of Aranya

163
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,140
and recovered from the primordial spirit injury

164
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,580
with my supply of blood three times a day.

165
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Her body is still pretty weak.

166
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,580
Even if I make a recovery seal

167
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,540
with my own spiritual power,

168
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,060
Xiaobai's body must be put in it

169
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,580
within two hours

170
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,540
after she wakes up

171
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,380
so that it can work effectively.

172
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,660
The seal is a good place for recovery,

173
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,540
but it's improper to keep the primordial spirit
in there for a long time.

174
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,820
For Xiaobai's case,

175
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,780
it's best to put her primordial spirit

176
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,260
into the body of local clans

177
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,060
so that it can absorb some vitality all the time.

178
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
As for the Dream of Aranya,

179
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,220
no hurry to get out of it.

180
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,420
Xiaobai hates me in her heart now.

181
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,460
But there is only one hour left

182
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,260
before putting her into the recovery seal

183
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,860
and she has only one hour to hate me.

184
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,900
It's a waste to everyone

185
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,660
to go through the last hour.

186
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,180
What's up, Your Majesty?

187
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,780
Why do you look so worried?

188
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,260
Xiaobai,

189
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,180
actually, we're already married.

190
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,540
Married?

191
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,300
How is that possible?

192
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,900
Why is that not possible?

193
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,660
Why don't I remember that at all?

194
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Because

195
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,500
you're amnesiac.

196
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,900
I said you slept too much just now

197
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,660
because I was worried you'd be afraid after knowing this.

198
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,100
But in fact,

199
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,460
you're amnesiac.

200
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,780
How unlucky I am!

201
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,380
But how could I have promised the engagement?

202
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,540
I...

203
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,060
Because you liked me, didn't you?

204
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,660
However, it can't be this reason.

205
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,180
If this is the reason,

206
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,500
then what I did before was...

207
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
That's only one of them.

208
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
The major reason is

209
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,140
I kneeled down to beg for your forgiveness.

210
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,180
You...

211
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,340
You kneeled down in front of me?

212
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,500
Why do you marry me?

213
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,340
Did you do something to me already

214
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,860
so you had to?

215
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,380
What about your love, Ji Heng?

216
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,420
Ji Heng?

217
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,540
Why do you think like that?

218
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,700
Ji Heng and I are not in the same age.

219
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,260
There is nothing between us.

220
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,020
Then,

221
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
I...

222
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,580
Actually,

223
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,700
this is still a dream.

224
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,940
I'm not having a dream.

225
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,540
Then we're indeed engaged.

226
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm more and more confused about this.

227
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,100
I have more questions to ask.

228
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,940
If as you said we're already married,

229
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,260
how did my father

230
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,140
come to accept it?

231
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,140
My father has always been

232
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,940
a very earthly immortal.

233
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,340
You are not from a powerful family,

234
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,940
nor do you have any power in hand.

235
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,060
They should not consider you

236
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,180
as the son-in-law.

237
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,420
Qingqiu has such a rule

238
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,660
to choose a son-in-law?

239
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,380
I didn't know that.

240
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,940
Maybe Bai Yi thought even though

241
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,540
I don't have the so-called promising future,

242
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,100
I kneeled down for you

243
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,540
which showed the uprightness and loyalty in my personality

244
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,940
and made myself pathetic, so he accepted it.

245
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,420
Uprightness and loyalty?

246
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Did my father say that?

247
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,860
He also thinks you're pathetic?

248
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,820
Qingqiu has always been soft-hearted

249
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,220
and easily become merciful.

250
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,500
That's true.

251
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,220
It looks like you are indeed not bluffing.

252
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,020
So I am already married with you.

253
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,460
However,

254
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,900
Your Majesty,

255
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,060
other than kneeling down,

256
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,180
you must have done something more humiliating, haven't you?

257
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,580
Don't you cheat on me

258
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,420
just as I no longer remember it.

259
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,580
It's such an underestimation

260
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,300
that you'd think mere kneeling

261
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,540
can make me come round.

262
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,620
I don't believe that.

263
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,100
What should I do

264
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,540
to make you understand it, Xiaobai?

265
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,700
His Majesty must become shy

266
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,940
as he starts to ask me rather than answer my questions.

267
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,900
Anyway,

268
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,620
he must have done a lot of things outside the box

269
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,460
to get me back.

270
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,060
He just doesn't want to recall them now.

271
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,020
What do you want me to do, Xiaobai?

272
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,940
Well,

273
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,140
I heard that

274
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,780
opening of chest can best prove

275
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,620
how a person loves the other.

276
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,460
My aunt told me

277
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,300
chest opening is very popular in the mortal realm

278
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,780
to show your love to someone.

279
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,100
Nothing is more sincere

280
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,820
as the mortal dies once the chest is opened

281
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,260
and death can show their high ideal.

282
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,260
The ideal has to be loyal and thus trustworthy.

283
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,820
Anyway,

284
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,740
this is just for saying,

285
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,060
as you suddenly asked me

286
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,380
what I want you to do.

287
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,780
I just speak as my mind goes.

288
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,500
That's just a lead-in.

289
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,580
If I really have anything that needs your help,

290
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,340
I'll write that down

291
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,980
and redeem it with you afterwards.

292
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,700
We're engaged anyway.

293
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,140
No worries for that.

294
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,620
Fine!

295
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
Let's keep it on record!

296
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,300
Come to me whenever you want.

297
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,780
Your hands are so cold.

298
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,940
I've put nerve soothing incense into this heating stove.

299
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,620
It's good for sleep.

300
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,300
We're indeed engaged.

301
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,420
His Majesty accepted whatever I said today.

302
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,660
And he added incense to my heating stove.

303
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,660
Even the red rain is not this hardly attainable.

304
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,820
Enjoy the heating!

305
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,980
I wanted to know what kind of incense you added.

306
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,860
I don't think

307
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,260
that's what you are thinking.

308
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,380
So it is this!

309
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,380
I... I wasn't thinking about this.

310
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,140
I was thinking that

311
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,900
since we're married,

312
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,980
I should never have been the one to kiss you proactively.

313
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,220
Your Majesty must have taken the initiative

314
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,340
because

315
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,740
I'm a restrained person.

316
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,820
Well said.

317
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,140
I did take the initiative.

318
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,740
When you recover after a few months

319
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,100
and get out of the seal,

320
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,020
will your chaotic memory get corrected

321
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,220
and you hate me more when you recall this?

322
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,060
Xiaobai,

323
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,340
what should I say to cheer you up by then?

324
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,780
Will this really work?

325
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,180
We have no solution

326
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,140
other than waiting.

327
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,340
The risk is unpredictable

328
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,500
to save someone in the Dream of Aranya.

329
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,300
There once was a god

330
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,940
casting a strong spell in it.

331
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,700
No one ever got rescued out of it.

332
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,220
Instead, the ward was broken.

333
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,580
The god and the person to be rescued
all ended up going to the netherworld.

334
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,340
Though His Majesty has enormous magic power,

335
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,300
the Dream of Aranya

336
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,580
doesn't accept great magic power

337
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,940
to work against it.

338
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,100
They've been there for quite some hours.

339
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,860
I'm worried that

340
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,100
His Majesty and Jiuge

341
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,260
may have ended up in disaster.

342
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,140
Whatever happens,

343
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,100
His Majesty will surely protect her.

344
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,500
You protect the Dream of Aranya

345
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,780
like a soft-shelled egg

346
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,020
that allows no touch.

347
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,620
In my opinion,

348
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,620
since every way is ominous,

349
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,380
we might as well smash it with a hammer

350
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,020
so that we can see whether they're still alive.

351
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
The ice face is useless

352
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,140
except his strong magic power

353
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,380
which can be used to protect Xiaojiu

354
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
when the dream breaks.

355
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,900
He has lived for so long anyway.

356
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,140
A few years less

357
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,020
means nothing to him.

358
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,060
Compared with being trapped in the dream,

359
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,820
this idea sounds feasible

360
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,540
even though it's a long shot gamble.

361
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,220
I'm also sort of interested

362
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,940
as to whether the Dream of Aranya

363
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,060
can trap His Majesty!

364
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,020
In all, you have no solution to it.

365
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,100
Gods like you

366
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,020
are never helpful.

367
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,340
So you have any solutions?

368
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,500
I...

369
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,460
I don't have either.

370
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,060
Yan, where are you going?

371
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,380
Finding out solutions.

372
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,340
Stay obedient while you're here!

373
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,820
I'll return your primordial spirit

374
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,180
after some time.

375
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,860
Dong Hua!

376
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,100
Are you sick?

377
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,740
Which medicine in Fanyin Valley

378
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,540
can match the god's blood?

379
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,540
Let me save you.

380
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,980
Where is this place?

381
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:04,980
Your Highness!

382
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,500
Your Highness Aranya, you finally wake up!

383
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm so scared.

384
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,860
Who are you?

385
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,620
I'm Chacha!

386
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,540
Your Highness Aranya, you've been sleeping for quite a long time.

387
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,980
Aranya?

388
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,460
Go to fetch the porridge in the kitchen

389
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,660
for Her Highness now.

390
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,020
They call me Aranya.

391
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,220
Is my name Aranya?

392
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,460
Why don't I have

393
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,380
any impression

394
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,980
about what happened before?

395
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
No impression either

396
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,860
to these people

397
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,900
or this place.

398
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,740
Who is Aranya?

399
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,460
-Your Highness! -Who am I?

400
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,020
Your Highness!

401
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Your Highness, are you alright?

402
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,580
You've been sleeping for so long

403
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,820
that you must be hungry.

404
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,500
This is abalone lotus seed cubilose porridge

405
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,740
made just now by the kitchen.

406
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,180
Please take some, Your Highness!

407
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,740
Put it here!

408
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,820
I'm not so hungry now.

409
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,980
Leave me please!

410
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
I'll let you know if I need your help.

411
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,540
Yes!

412
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,820
The infant in my dream just now

413
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,180
must be Aranya.

414
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,220
But who is the youngster?

415
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,580
Gosh!

416
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,700
What crime on earth did I commit?

417
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,940
Why don't I have any memory at all?

418
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,880
Aranya

419
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,940
The demons have been silent for more than a century.

420
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
Is the demons' gathering

421
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,700
still necessary?

422
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,020
Your Highness,

423
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,100
you said we can make peace through intermarriage

424
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,900
when we started war against the gods.

425
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,900
But what now?

426
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Intermarriage is screwed.

427
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,700
Even the princess is gone.

428
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,580
Stop talking!

429
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,380
Is that for you to say?

430
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,300
OK. I'll stop!

431
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,340
But why is Demon Lord Yan

432
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,220
missing for so long?

433
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,900
I suppose his Qingxuan Hall

434
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,300
is covered by weed now.

435
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,180
Speaking ill of me?

436
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,700
Aren't you afraid

437
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,660
I'll cut your tongue off?

438
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,500
Yan Chiwu,

439
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,700
where have you been?

440
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,660
Xu Yang, I found Ji Heng now.

441
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,980
She's trapped in Fanyin Valley.

442
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Fanyin Valley?

443
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,980
Why is she there?

444
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,540
She is poisoned by Qiushui Cold Toxin.

445
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,620
Emperor Dong Hua

446
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,140
put her there to rehabilitate.

447
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,300
Before her rehabilitation, she couldn't get out.

448
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,060
Emperor Dong Hua put her there?

449
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,220
Yes!

450
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,220
Only Emperor Dong Hua can take her

451
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,700
to a place as bad as that.

452
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,100
Ji Heng's toxin can only be detoxicated

453
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,020
in the Fanyin Valley.

454
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,780
Now Dong Hua and Fengjiu, the Princess of Qingqiu,

455
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,180
are both trapped in the place called Dream of Aranya.

456
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,860
It's unknown whether they can get out or not.

457
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,780
Ji Heng is so heart-broken

458
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,580
that she insisted on staying there with Dong Hua!

459
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,340
Come with me to get Dong Hua out!

460
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,060
Ji Heng will be assured that way.

461
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,540
Demon Lord Yan,

462
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,380
where did you say they are?

463
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,820
The Dream of Aranya.

464
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,820
Really?

465
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,340
Is that true?

466
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,100
I witnessed Dong Hua

467
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,660
walking in without his magic power.

468
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,220
It's unknown whether he is alive or not.

469
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,940
Even so,

470
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,860
it's a great chance given by god

471
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,940
to the demons.

472
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,020
Great!

473
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,220
It's been over a hundred years

474
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,740
since anything fresh happened.

475
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,900
We should take this chance

476
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,780
to sabotage the gods.

477
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,500
Without Emperor Dong Hua,

478
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,820
I think

479
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,300
they should be very worried.

480
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,980
I promised Min Su

481
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,020
to set Ji Heng free.

482
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,220
Demon Lord,

483
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,260
this is a very rare opportunity!

484
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,140
Don't be worried.

485
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,540
The demons have been idle for so long.

486
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,580
If we really start war with the gods,

487
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,740
how much possibility of winning

488
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,940
do you think we have?

489
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,580
How much possibility of winning?

490
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,300
I want you to rescue someone

491
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,780
not to take advantage of a perilous state.

492
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,380
Have you forgotten the dignity of the demons?

493
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,180
Dignity means nothing now.

494
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,220
Just chill!

495
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,300
Just think that

496
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,380
it's still unknown if Emperor Dong Hua will come back.

497
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,500
We'll conserve strength and store up energy now.

498
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,100
If he really doesn't return,

499
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,460
we'll announce war by then.

500
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,860
Announcement of war

501
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,060
is nothing small.

502
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,500
Let's discuss that later.

503
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,940
Yes!

504
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,540
There you come!

505
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,340
Nie Chuyin pays respects

506
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,620
to Your Majesty!

507
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,220
Enough!

508
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,340
Why do you come to me today?

509
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,820
Yan Chiwu's said that

510
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,100
Emperor Dong Hua is trapped in the Dream of Aranya.

511
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,420
Your Majesty,

512
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,620
this is the perfect chance for you to break the seal.

513
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,100
What did you say?

514
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,500
What happened to Dong Hua?

515
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,860
I said

516
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,740
Emperor Dong Hua is

517
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,820
in the Dream of Aranya in Fanyin Valley.

518
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,660
No wonder I feel my power increased greatly the other days.

519
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,340
It's because you entered the Dream of Aranya.

520
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,860
Dong Hua,

521
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,540
I'll never let you get out alive.

522
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,140
Everything here looks so strange.

523
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,140
Forget it.

524
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,380
I think I have to ask the guy up there

525
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,820
and get out alive anyhow.

526
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,540
Sit down!

527
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,740
Sit down now! I need to ask you something.

528
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,620
What is this?

529
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,700
This is lily cake which you like most.

530
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,580
So I like lily cake most?

531
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Yeah!

532
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,900
What's up, Your Highness?

533
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,300
Nothing!

534
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,620
I just want to see

535
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,220
if you understand me best.

536
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,660
Let me test you again.

537
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,940
What liquor do I like best?

538
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Lotus Dew!

539
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,980
If you get some of my questions right

540
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,820
in future,

541
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,780
I'll give you rewards.

542
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,580
Thank you!

543
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,900
Do you have any other questions?

544
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,060
Why don't you ask altogether?

545
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,340
How greedy you are!

546
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,940
I've rewarded you already!

547
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
Stay content!

548
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,620
Aranya must not have stuck to the trifles in usual

549
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,020
and treated her maids pretty well,

550
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,180
otherwise Chacha

551
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,300
wouldn't have dared to speak to me like that.

552
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,300
Come with me to check out on that side.

553
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,220
Why don't you come?

554
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,100
Your Highness,

555
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,300
it's getting late. You should take shower now.

556
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Time for shower?

557
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,420
Fine! Let's get back to the room.

558
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,500
It's actually good to be served with shower.

559
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,100
Chacha, what is that?

560
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,780
Snake oil.

561
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,420
Snake oil?

562
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,740
You have told me before that

563
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
bathing with this snake oil

564
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,300
refreshes the body and drives away dampness.

565
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,860
So you require this to be added

566
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,700
whenever you take shower.

567
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,020
My gosh!

568
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,860
However wrong I am,

569
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,700
you can't torture me like this.

570
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,060
I'm most afraid of snakes.

571
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,060
The 20 years of cultivation is done.

572
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,140
How are you,

573
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,180
Aranya?

574
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,740
Sleep here in future.

575
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,500
Don't sleep on the grassland.

576
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,100
Even though you grew up in the snake nest,

577
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,780
you're not a snake.

578
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,180
You're the princess of the inseparable king birds,

579
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,580
so you must have a name.

580
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,140
Now that your parents didn't give you a name,

581
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,340
let me give you one.

582
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,340
Aranya!

583
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,860
This is your name.

584
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,620
If I say these three characters in future,

585
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,700
it means I'm calling you.

586
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Understood?

587
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,540
Aranya.

588
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm Shen Ye,

589
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,340
your cousin.

590
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,820
You are Aranya,

591
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,340
Xiangli Aranya!

592
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,260
Aranya!

593
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,060
Aranya!

594
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,180
In a few days, I'm going to start
a long-term cultivation in reclusion.

595
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,820
It has been delayed over and over again,

596
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,740
but it can't be escaped after all.

597
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,420
I must fulfill the duty as an archmage.

598
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,060
Aranya,

599
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,740
after I leave,

600
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,700
no one will be here to take care of you.

601
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,100
If you are hungry,

602
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,780
eat the fruit of the Solanum pseudocapsicum.

603
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,340
If you're thirsty, take the water of Jieyou Spring.

604
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,500
Don't live on snake blood any more.

605
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,700
Do you understand?

606
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,340
I'll be back for sure.

607
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,980
I'll come to save you

608
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,100
when I become the archmage.

609
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,420
Aranya,

610
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,620
I am your only relative.

611
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,900
They may have abandoned you,

612
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
but you have me.

613
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,620
Cousin, wait!

614
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,260
Cousin, are you still busy with the affairs from the palace?

615
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,220
And have you met Aranya?

616
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,460
Last time I was playing with Sister Junuo in the garden,

617
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,180
she wanted to play with us.

618
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,900
Aranya?

619
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,220
She is back?

620
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,100
Don't you know about that?

621
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,740
Father intended to betroth Aranya

622
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,940
to Lord Xi Ze

623
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,380
in the hall today.

624
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
What?

625
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,820
She will marry to my master?
