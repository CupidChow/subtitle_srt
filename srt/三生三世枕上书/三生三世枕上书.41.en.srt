00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 41

3
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,820
Junuo should suffer from her own actions,

4
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,340
since Junuo and Changdi

5
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,900
bullied me over and over.

6
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,180
I'm wondering how I can take revenge on them.

7
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,260
Now

8
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,900
I don't have to do it on my own.

9
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,540
But

10
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,300
you have to save her this time.

11
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,620
Why?

12
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,060
I know it'll be hard for you,

13
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,100
but nobody other than you

14
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,660
could save Junuo.

15
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,500
Why?

16
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,980
Do you remember what

17
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,060
I've told you months before?

18
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,260
You have to help make the same decision

19
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,060
on several crucial things

20
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,700
that decide Aranya's fate.

21
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,060
This is the first one.

22
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,940
When Junuo was executed that year,

23
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,820
it was Aranya who saved her.

24
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,220
So you have to save her again this time,

25
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,060
as Aranya did before.

26
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,980
Besides, this is the key step for you

27
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,100
to leave the Dream of Aranya.

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,100
That's fine.

29
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,060
Now that I have to do this,

30
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,100
you should give me

31
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,300
the same excuse as Aranya had at that time.

32
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,620
Although she hadn't made as many troubles as I did,

33
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,140
there was always a feud

34
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,100
between Junuo and her.

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,300
Why did she save Junuo

36
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,900
at that crucial moment?

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,940
Because the one she wanted to save at that time

38
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,900
wasn't Junuo

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,540
but Shen Ye.

40
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,740
Shen Ye?

41
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,620
What's the story?

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,260
When Junuo was executed that day,

43
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,980
Shen Ye came to save her.

44
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,780
But he was in trouble unexpectedly.

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,580
Aranya came out to save them both boldly.

46
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
At that time, I thought

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,660
there was enmity between her and Shen Ye,

48
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,860
but I knew it later.

49
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,540
Why she saved Shen Ye

50
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,700
was because she fell for him.

51
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,940
Then what about Shen Ye?

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,980
Now that Aranya saved Shen Ye,

53
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,380
did he know Aranya fell for him?

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,860
The clan of inseparable king birds values chastity.

55
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,900
Madam Qing Hua married twice,

56
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,540
which Shen Ye disagreed.

57
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,260
He couldn't fall for

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,500
the two princesses who were given birth to by Madam Qing Hua

59
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,940
after she remarried Xiangli Que,

60
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,180
especially for Aranya.

61
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,100
Among the three princesses,

62
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,940
he could only

63
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,980
fall for Junuo.

64
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,220
But it's Aranya who saved him.

65
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,620
He was supposed

66
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,780
to requite Aranya for saving his life, wasn't he?

67
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,700
Then what happened to them later?

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,700
Although Aranya saved their lives,

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,140
His Majesty ordered

70
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,060
to degrade Junuo to an ordinary person,

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,700
and didn't allow her to step into the capital city forever.

72
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,780
Besides, His Majesty believed that Shen Ye played favoritism,

73
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,060
and what he did disgraced the holy orders.

74
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,820
So he was deported from the Qi Nan Palace.

75
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,380
However, Aranya requested His Majesty

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,620
to allow Shen Ye to live in her mansion

77
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,700
and help her cast a sword

78
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,100
in the name of Lord Xi Ze.

79
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,580
Cast a sword?

80
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,700
She used the excuse for presenting a sword
to the Crown Prince of the Sky Kingdom

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
as a birthday gift

82
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,700
to defend Shen Ye.

83
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,700
But I'm afraid

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,380
Shen Ye wouldn't have understood Aranya.

85
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,380
From the perspective of him,

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,940
that Aranya kept him in her mansion

87
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,340
was merely to imprison him

88
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,020
and take her revenge on him.

89
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,660
Did Shen Ye return evil for good?

90
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,060
Aranya shouldn't have been treated this way.

91
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,860
I was always reminded of the words Aranya once said.

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,980
"One has to follow his heart, his destiny and the situation,

93
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,820
no matter who he is, an immortal or an ordinary person."

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,180
It's a pity that

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
Aranya fell for Shen Ye,

96
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,020
but her destiny with Shen Ye

97
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,300
was doomed in the situation.

98
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,220
You mean,

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,260
why did Aranya choose to be a good person?

100
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,580
Why did she choose to suffer all this?

101
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,580
If Aranya had acted as half open-minded as you,

102
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,420
she wouldn't have ended up where she was.

103
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,220
Since

104
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,460
it's a big deal,

105
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,140
you have to ponder over it.

106
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,340
Something big is about to happen

107
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,060
in the imperial palace tonight.

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Aren't you going to rise?

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,140
I'm begging you to spare Junuo, Your Majesty.

110
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,740
As the Elder Princess,

111
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,580
Junuo committed adultery when she's unmarried.
And she also cheated the emperor.

112
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,020
She should be guillotined according to the law.

113
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,460
There's nothing I could do.

114
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,780
Your Majesty,

115
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,740
Junuo didn't make the mistake on purpose.

116
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,580
Not on purpose?

117
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,220
What she has done

118
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,020
is a huge humiliation to the imperial family.

119
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,980
If I don't guillotine her,

120
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,620
everyone will consider that I abuse the law.

121
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,820
No matter how unbearable I feel,

122
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,380
I have to do it.

123
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,500
If you really wanted to spare Junuo

124
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,380
how come you used these words as an excuse?

125
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,180
Do you know what you're saying?

126
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,020
Your Majesty,

127
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,740
after all these years,

128
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,700
you still can't bear Junuo, can you?

129
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,140
If I didn't bear Junuo,

130
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,780
I wouldn't have waited till today.

131
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,860
It's you

132
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
who always cover up for her and connive what she does.

133
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,300
I won't blame you for that.

134
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Don't mention

135
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,260
releasing Junuo anymore.

136
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,980
What are you saying?

137
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,100
Say it again.

138
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,420
The day Junuo was executed,

139
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,940
Aranya flew to the guillotine

140
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,620
with a naked blade, and she sacrificed her blood to the sword,

141
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,660
which finally saved both of them.

142
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,300
Why did she have to save them

143
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,980
by sacrificing her blood to the guillotine?

144
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,340
What Junuo did was ignominious,

145
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,740
but the execution of a princess

146
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,140
should be recorded in the annals of history.

147
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,860
So they made an elaborate plan.

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,220
Only clan relatives of the imperial family
were allowed to watch the execution.

149
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,020
The Lingshu Stage, in front of the immortal palace,
was chosen to be the place of execution.

150
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,420
The executioner must be extraordinary,

151
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,060
since he was chosen from those

152
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,900
whose families had been hangmen for more than three generations.

153
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,500
There are so many traditions

154
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,980
for the beheading of the inseparable king birds.

155
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,260
The most important one is the sword,

156
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,580
which is the sacred treasure of the inseparable king birds.

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,620
White Tiger Sword.

158
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,340
White Tiger Sword?

159
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,460
White Tiger Sword

160
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,540
should be sacrificed by the wrist blood of the one
who's about to be executed before use

161
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
in order to release the double-winged white-fronted tiger
that protects the sword.

162
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,420
The double-winged white-fronted tiger will

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,220
swallow the flesh and blood as well as
the primordial spirit of the one who is about to be executed,

164
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,620
and trap the primordial spirit in the sword
to make the one executed incapable of going to heaven.

165
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,780
It's too horrible.

166
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,700
Since the white-fronted tiger is so fierce,

167
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,300
how can I withstand it?

168
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,820
Don't be flustered in advance.

169
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm about to tell you

170
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,540
the key to seal the tiger back to the sword.

171
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,220
The white-fronted tiger is eager for blood.

172
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,500
As long as you volunteer to feed it with fresh blood,

173
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,780
and seal it back to the sword with your spiritual power,

174
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,620
you'll be able to save Shen Ye and Junuo.

175
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,340
Will I have to feed it with fresh blood?

176
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,540
The blood isn't yours anyhow.

177
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,700
It's Aranya's blood.

178
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,660
What are you scared of?

179
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,660
You're telling the truth,

180
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,780
but I'm the one who is about to suffer the pain.

181
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,340
What a daredevil Aranya is!

182
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,140
I'm afraid of pain most.

183
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,380
Shen Ye.

184
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,180
She betrayed you, but you still want to save her?

185
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,260
We grew up together,

186
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,580
even she did something wrong.
If there is a chance for her to be alive,

187
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,780
how could I not save her?

188
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,220
What a big speech you make!

189
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,780
Do you still remember me?

190
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,860
I do.

191
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,180
You're Xiangli Aranya.

192
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,740
I guess you haven't come up with the way

193
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,940
to seal the white-fronted tiger back.

194
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,100
People say that the blood of Your Excellency

195
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,500
can purify the dirty.

196
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,900
So I'm wondering whether or not

197
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,020
Your Excellency will show mercy

198
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,900
and purify my blood today.

199
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,540
Aranya,

200
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,500
the day that Junuo is about to be executed is coming.

201
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,340
Qing Hua will come to discuss the strategy with me soon.

202
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,740
But I have no idea

203
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,340
whether now you will do the same

204
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,260
as you used to that year.

205
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,900
Your Excellency.

206
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,100
Come in.

207
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,980
Your Excellency, Her Majesty is coming to see you.

208
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,900
Welcome her in.

209
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,820
Yes.

210
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,100
Archmage.

211
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,860
What do you

212
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,420
come for this time?

213
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,580
You must have known what happened to Junuo.

214
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,700
I know you used to

215
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,340
be indifferent to what happened to the imperial family,

216
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,940
but there's an engagement between Junuo and you.

217
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,060
Will you be indifferent to her either?

218
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,820
The evidence is irrefutable,

219
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,260
and the sentence is made totally based on the law.

220
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,260
Junuo truly did something wrong, and she should be punished,

221
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,660
but you also have the right to make the decision,

222
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,860
How could Xiangli Que make the decision on his own

223
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,620
without discussing with you?

224
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,020
Princess fornicated her master,

225
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
and she was guilty as charged.

226
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
I wouldn't have been able to change anything,
even if I had been present.

227
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,300
That His Majesty made the decision without me

228
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,500
was to protect my fame.

229
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,140
Indeed,

230
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,620
Junuo is guilty to you,

231
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,060
since she's your wife-to-be.

232
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,140
Anyway, Junuo is also your cousin.

233
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,140
As the Archmage,

234
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,580
you must have some way to save her.

235
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,180
Shen Ye,

236
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,100
Junuo is the only descendant

237
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,740
left by my late husband to me.

238
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,460
Do you really want to see her

239
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,300
killed by the White Tiger Sword?

240
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,860
Please save Junuo for the sake of my late husband.

241
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,660
I'm begging you, please.

242
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,140
Master.

243
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,180
Are you hurt?

244
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,620
Shall I find a pharmacist to heal you?

245
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm fine. Don't bother.

246
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,940
I used to think that you pled illness to live in solitude
and transferred the position to me

247
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,900
was because you didn't want
to take care of business in the immortal palace.

248
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,380
You wanted to be free.

249
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,020
I didn't expect that you're hurt.

250
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,540
What did you

251
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,300
come to me for just now?

252
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,620
You don't come to me

253
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,940
to talk about this, do you?

254
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,460
No.

255
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,740
You have seen that

256
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,780
Her Majesty came to me.

257
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,260
She wanted to know

258
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,620
whether I could save Junuo.

259
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,420
Junuo is your wife-to-be.

260
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,060
Now that it has happened,

261
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,700
whether to save her or not, it's your own decision to make.

262
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,100
It's none of my business.

263
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,980
You go back first.

264
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,980
I need some rest.

265
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,140
There are so many odds in the dream world.

266
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,020
Aranya changes,

267
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,020
and the Junuo thing happens ahead of schedule.

268
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,460
Lord Xi Ze seems to be different from what he used to.

269
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,140
Junuo is about to be executed in a few days.

270
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,740
What on earth is going to happen?

271
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,140
There's only one day ahead of the execution of Junuo.

272
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,740
I still don't know how well Fengjiu can shoot arrows.

273
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,060
I hope she wouldn't make any mistake.

274
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,180
I can't. I can't.

275
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,100
I can't do it to myself.

276
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,500
Aranya. Aranya.

277
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,660
What a heroine you're!

278
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,900
You can even do this to yourself.

279
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
I can't make it. I have to figure out another way.

280
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,620
Shall I keep the blood in advance

281
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,900
so that I can wait to spray the blood over the sword

282
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,460
at the critical moment when I save her?

283
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,540
It won't work.

284
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,940
Then I still have to

285
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,140
draw my blood in advance.

286
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,980
I can't make it.

287
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,860
I really can't.

288
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,980
Your Highness,

289
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,900
it's the make-or-break moment.

290
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,660
We can only count on you.

291
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,740
I'm really scared. Can't I stay?

292
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,580
Don't forget that

293
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,380
you're Aranya now.

294
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,020
Can I use this?

295
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,020
What's it?

296
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,540
Chicken blood.

297
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,260
Chicken blood!

298
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,620
Are you out of your mind?

299
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:49,980
Since

300
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,220
I pondered it over when I went back yesterday night.

301
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I can't do it to myself,

302
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,860
so I came up with the worst plan out of frustration.

303
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,300
Do you think

304
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,460
whether the white-fronted tiger can taste it,

305
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,700
if I use chicken blood to feed it?

306
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,620
You...

307
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,740
How can you come up with the way of using chicken blood?

308
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,300
You're...

309
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,500
Give it to me.

310
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,660
No, I won't.

311
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,220
Give it to me.

312
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,100
No, I won't.

313
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,740
Hand it over.

314
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,340
No way.

315
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,700
Fine.

316
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,700
To tell you the truth,

317
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,140
the tiger won't drink anything

318
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,740
but fresh blood.

319
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,380
And if you want to seal it,

320
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,180
the blood you use should be from someone who has consanguinity

321
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,900
with the one who's about to be killed by the sword.

322
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,660
So I did all in vain?

323
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,100
Finally you get it.

324
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,340
Hand it over.

325
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,100
Hand it over.

326
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,540
What the hell is it?

327
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,180
Are you forcing me to do it by myself?

328
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,900
Have you seen

329
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,300
how Madam Qing Hua looks at Junuo?

330
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,460
You mean, why does she come?

331
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,740
Why does she have to

332
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,740
watch her favorite daughter guillotined in person?

333
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,980
Now that she can't bear it, why does she come?

334
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,700
Maybe it's because she loves Junuo so much

335
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,580
that she wants to see her the last time.

336
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,020
How Junuo acts today

337
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,860
makes me respect her.

338
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,020
She is about to be executed,

339
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,860
but she still can maintain her demeanor as an imperial member.

340
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,540
It's almost the time.

341
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,460
It's time for the execution.

342
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,860
Who dare

343
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,180
disturb the execution?

344
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,820
It's Shen Ye.

345
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,780
He does come in time.

346
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,580
Of course, he does.

347
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,260
I didn't lie to you, did I?

348
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,340
Since Shen Ye can subdue
the white-fronted tiger with only one move,

349
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,300
is there no need for me to join the fight?

350
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,180
Don't be happy too early.

351
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,820
It's just the start,

352
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,340
and the best has yet to come.

353
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,380
Shen Ye just pushed the white-fronted tiger back for the moment.

354
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,420
The tiger is not good for nothing.

355
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,340
It won't take long

356
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,060
for it to regain the strength

357
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,700
and struggle to shake off the sword.

358
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,140
It will be your turn soon.

359
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,620
Why don't you say it clearly earlier?

360
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,180
I can't make it. I have to go.

361
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,380
Do you want to leave the Dream of Aranya?

362
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,620
Your Majesty.

363
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,300
Archmage Shen Ye,

364
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,620
why are you here?

365
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,340
I've learned something from the chapter

366
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,900
about measurement of penalty by the spiritual sword before.

367
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,380
Once the spiritual sword is used,

368
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,260
if the person subject to enforcement
can seal the tiger back to the sword

369
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,780
before his primordial spirit is broken,

370
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,780
it shows Heaven's care for every living thing.

371
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,180
No matter how big crime the person subject
to enforcement has committed,

372
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,460
he can be pardoned.

373
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,380
You're wise, Your Majesty.

374
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,620
Can Princess Junuo be sentenced

375
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,940
according to this law today?

376
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

377
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,260
Let's go.

378
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,580
Shen Ye.

379
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,540
Hide yourself.

380
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,420
What's wrong?

381
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,860
Why can Shen Ye hardly resist so soon?

382
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,700
The white-fronted tiger is born of evil power,

383
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,140
and the appearance of a tiger is merely a shape.

384
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,340
So the wound on it isn't

385
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,700
far more serious than it looks.

386
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,620
Now Shen Ye is almost worn out.

387
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,660
You have to save him.

388
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,180
It's your turn.

389
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,180
I can't make it.

390
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,820
You've said that I should draw my wrist blood

391
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,940
to seal the primordial spirit of the white-fronted tiger.

392
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,380
How could I make it?

393
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,100
It's easy for you to say it out.

394
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,220
See. The white-fronted tiger is so eager for blood,

395
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,100
and it's fierce.

396
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,140
How could I fight against it?

397
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,100
The clan of inseparable king birds has the special constitution.

398
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,220
See.

399
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,260
Junuo is weak now,

400
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
and her fresh blood can no longer
satisfy the white-fronted tiger.

401
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Aranya and Junuo are born of one mother,

402
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,420
so their fresh blood is almost the same.

403
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,860
You will have to feed the white-fronted tiger
with half of your fresh blood later,

404
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,780
and then seal it
with all your spiritual power along with Shen Ye.

405
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,580
You can seal it back.

406
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,620
Half of my fresh blood?

407
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,540
Then wouldn't I end up half dying?

408
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,540
It can't wait. Come on.

409
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,300
Your Highness,

410
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,820
I owe you this time.

411
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,300
You'll have to remember it.

412
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,380
Are you a fool?

413
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,300
Even though she betrayed you, you still want to save her?

414
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
She's my wife-to-be,

415
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,060
and the sister I grew up with.

416
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,860
Even though she did something wrong,
if there exists a chance for her to be alive,

417
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,220
how could I not save her?

418
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,620
What a deep sibling relationship,

419
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,060
and how great the conjugal love is!

420
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,460
Have you forgotten that

421
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,660
I'm your sister either?

422
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,180
Why do you always neglect me?

423
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,100
No,

424
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,380
I never neglect you.

425
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,380
Never do I.

426
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,100
You really are Aranya,

427
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,460
rather than someone else. Right?

428
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,980
I just think you don't have to do this.

429
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,540
Now

430
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,900
we have to deal with that tiger first.

431
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,820
Dong Hua,

432
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,340
I kept little of primordial spirit and Red Qi

433
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,340
in the battle with you that year.

434
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,980
I didn't expect that it will appear in the Dream of Aranya.

435
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,980
God is blessing me.

436
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,420
Xiaobai,

437
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,580
hang in there.

438
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,900
The moment I take back Red Qi

439
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,140
is when I break the ward.

440
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,700
Dong Hua,

441
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,740
I'm about to meet you.

442
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,180
According to the law,

443
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,260
Junuo is spared from death penalty.

444
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,660
She can get away with death penalty,
but she can't get away with the punishment.

445
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,940
She is evicted from the imperial clan
and degraded to a common person now.

446
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,020
She's not

447
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,460
allowed to step into the capital city forever.

448
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,660
Thank you for sparing me from death, father.

449
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,420
Archmage Shen Ye,

450
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,060
you serve as a supervisor,

451
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,060
but you hinder the execution out of personal relationship.

452
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,660
What you've done humiliated the sacred position.

453
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,900
I shall report to the Sky Kingdom

454
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,380
to evict you from Qi Nan Palace

455
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,260
and degrade you to a common person.

456
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,500
And you're not allowed to step into the capital city forever.

457
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,820
I accept it.

458
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,140
Aranya,

459
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,340
as a princess,

460
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,980
you create a tremendous uproar in the execution ground,

461
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
how dare you do that?

462
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,180
You're

463
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,340
fined a salary of a month and punished
to ponder upon your faults for a month.

464
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,540
Father.

465
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,700
Mother.

466
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,420
I buried the misunderstanding of the past,

467
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,220
and fought against the white-fronted tiger

468
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,060
for saving Junuo.

469
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,860
Not only did I not win your praise,

470
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,180
I'm even fined the salary.

471
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,180
It's fine.

472
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,100
I accept it.

473
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,660
I have yet to report

474
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,100
one thing about Archmage.

475
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,900
What's it?

476
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,420
A few days ago,

477
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,940
Lord Xi Ze came to tell me

478
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,140
that he would invite Archmage

479
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,020
to help cast a sword

480
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,300
that would be presented to the Crown Prince
of the Sky Kingdom as a birthday gift,

481
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,700
when the immortal envoy would come to the valley.

482
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,460
Lord Xi Ze, is she telling the truth?

483
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,420
Yes,

484
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
she's telling the truth.

485
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,860
Well,

486
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,420
let Shen Ye go to Aranya's mansion to cast the sword

487
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,620
as a criminal.

488
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,020
As long as the sword isn't cast,

489
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,380
he won't be allowed to leave the mansion.

490
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,220
Once the sword is made,

491
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
he'll have to leave the capital city immediately.

492
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
Thank you, father.

493
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,260
I accept it.

494
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,780
I'm sorry, Shen Ye.

495
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,660
It's I who implicated you in trouble.

496
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,740
I didn't intend to save you.

497
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,420
I was saving myself.

498
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,380
Although

499
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,580
Aranya keeps you in her mansion

500
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,540
with the excuse for casting a sword for the immortal lord,

501
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,060
she makes you prisoned in the mansion

502
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,140
and lose freedom.

503
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,060
It's all my fault.

504
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,940
I'm sorry about it, Shen Ye.

505
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,820
You should leave here

506
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,620
to live your life.

507
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,900
Shen Ye.

508
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,860
Your Highness.

509
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,940
I made it. You should thank me.

510
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,420
If she were not Aranya,

511
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,380
why would she make the same decision?

512
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,780
If she were Aranya,

513
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,300
why would she be seriously injured today?

514
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,380
And

515
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
why is Lord Xi Ze involved in it?

516
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,180
What's wrong with her?

517
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,300
You made her

518
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,580
do it.

519
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,580
It's Aranya's choice.

520
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
But it shouldn't be Xiaobai's.

521
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,660
She did everything you told her.

522
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,900
I'll take her away first.

523
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,780
My power has been sealed in your body for too long.

524
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,300
Now I have to take it back.

525
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,620
Something's wrong.

526
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,380
Dong Hua?

527
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,980
Dong Hua,

528
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,820
you won't be able to stop me this time.

529
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,460
You're just the shape.

530
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,460
How dare you say it so arrogantly?

531
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,940
Save your nonsense.

532
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,180
It's too painful.

533
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,940
Moye is a liar.

534
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,660
I almost die of the wound.

535
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,860
There is a phoenix feather flower on her forehead.

536
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,900
What's up?
