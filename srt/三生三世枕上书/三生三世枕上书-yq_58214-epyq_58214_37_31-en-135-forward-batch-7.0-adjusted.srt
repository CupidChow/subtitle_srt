Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 31

3
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,980
It's so cold!

4
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,660
So cold!

5
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,740
You're the first one who dares sleep directly
in the ward confining demons and evils

6
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,340
since heaven was separated from earth.

7
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,020
Whoever is surrounded by
the dark energy of demons and evils

8
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,060
will have nightmares.

9
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,580
Having lived for thirty thousand years,

10
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,020
can't you remember the important tips of

11
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,700
being gods and immortals?

12
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,820
So cold!

13
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,860
So cold!

14
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,500
Mother!

15
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,420
Mother!

16
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,180
No!

17
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,940
No!

18
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,580
Mother!

19
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,300
Mother!

20
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,660
So cold!

21
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,540
No!

22
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,500
I didn't mean to leave.

23
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,420
I'm so cold!

24
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,660
Just sleep with me.

25
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,020
It seems she's really sick.

26
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,180
Now she's even talking nonsense.

27
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,620
Mother!

28
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,300
It's no use crying.

29
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,180
It won't work even if your voice is pitched much higher.

30
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm not your...

31
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,260
Leave me alone.

32
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,860
Just let me cry to death.

33
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,300
Be a good girl.

34
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,380
Take it easy.

35
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,780
I've done nothing to you.

36
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,260
You clung on to me in your sleep.

37
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,060
Feeling hot while sleeping,

38
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,060
you loosened your collar yourself.

39
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,900
Why am I here?

40
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,940
Aren't I supposed to be at the Jieyou Spring?

41
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,660
You said you would take care of me,

42
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,180
but you fell asleep,

43
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,980
so I had to take care of you instead.

44
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,380
I was probably too tired.

45
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
Why didn't you

46
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,820
leave me here alone?

47
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Because you cried and begged me to stay.

48
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,300
All right! Stop it!

49
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,100
You had nightmares due to

50
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,100
the dark energy left by Miao Luo.

51
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,340
I had no choice but to save you.

52
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,300
When you're sick, you can really be...

53
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,340
All right! Stop it!

54
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
I know what I'm like

55
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,980
when I'm sick.

56
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,860
Has anyone else seen how you
would be like when you're sick?

57
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,580
Besides my family,

58
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,780
you're the first one to see that.

59
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,980
Now I owe him again.

60
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,900
However, when I'm unconscious,

61
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,460
I can't choose my savior.

62
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,700
Then I won't bother paying back the favor.

63
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,140
Your Majesty kind of saved me this time.

64
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,500
I'm deeply grateful.

65
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,020
Otherwise, I'm afraid I would have lost my life in the ward.

66
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,660
However,

67
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,900
if you hadn't taken me

68
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
to Mount Fuyu half a year ago,

69
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,700
I wouldn't have gotten into this situation.

70
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,740
So,

71
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,260
though you've saved me,

72
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,020
we are even in terms of these two things.

73
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
Your Majesty, what do you think?

74
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,540
What about the other two things you just can't let go of,

75
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,300
me saving you after half a year

76
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
and me turning into a silk handkerchief to trick you?

77
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,820
How dare you bring them up?

78
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,060
Good for you!

79
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,420
You're really audacious!

80
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,180
As to those two things,

81
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,660
Your Majesty, you're good at Buddhist doctrines.

82
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,700
However angry I feel,

83
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,180
it's just my opinion.

84
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,020
Everything has its cause and effect.

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,820
Why do you have to know the answer?

86
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,900
Compared to that,

87
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,820
I'd like to ask you something.

88
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,900
I clung on to you unconsciously

89
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
because I was sick.

90
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,900
If you had pushed me away,

91
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,180
I wouldn't have clung on to you again.

92
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,660
Why didn't you push me away?

93
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,420
You let me make a fool of myself.

94
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,780
You threw yourself on me.

95
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,260
I found it quite rare.

96
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,740
Why should I push you away?

97
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,820
Your Majesty,

98
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,260
you were unreasonable before.

99
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,220
If I want to be unreasonable, I will be unreasonable.

100
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,020
If I want to be reasonable,

101
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,860
I can be reasonable sometimes.

102
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,940
Anyway, thank you for taking care of me.

103
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,420
Sorry for all the trouble.

104
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,860
I wonder what time it is now.

105
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,300
Yan might be looking for me now.

106
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,140
See you.

107
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,460
I remember when you were little,

108
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,020
you fell into a snake nest for walking at night,

109
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,820
so you never dare to walk at night since then.

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,140
I wonder whether you've checked what it's like outside.

111
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,060
It's already dark.

112
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
Someone is outside.

113
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
Could it be Ji Heng?

114
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,900
It seems like her.

115
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,220
Are you overreacting?

116
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,740
I just saw a figure at the door.

117
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,260
Visiting you so late at night, it must be Ji Heng.

118
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,500
Why should we lower our voices

119
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,020
when she's here?

120
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,580
If she misunderstands us, how will you explain to her?

121
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,620
Why should I explain to her?

122
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,860
Aren't you afraid that she might misunderstand us?

123
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,460
I feel

124
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,740
you might have misunderstood me.

125
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,060
Are you done?

126
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,140
If you're done, just be a good girl and lie down.

127
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,780
I'll go and fetch your medicine.

128
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,540
Master, let me carry it for you.

129
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,060
No need.

130
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,500
What's His Majesty doing?

131
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,580
Isn't he afraid that Ji Heng might get jealous?

132
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,100
Xiaojiu, you're back!

133
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Thank God!

134
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,300
I thought you were eaten up by the python.

135
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,420
Stop yelling! Aren't you afraid others might hear you?

136
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,540
Well...

137
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,540
So what happened later last night?

138
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,020
Don't mention it! I didn't make it.

139
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,140
What about you?

140
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,940
I looked for it in the tunnel all night long,

141
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,740
but I didn't find it.

142
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,940
Me, neither.

143
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,060
But later I met His Majesty.

144
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,100
The ice face?

145
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
Was he also there to steal the pimpon fruit?

146
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,860
Of course not.

147
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,340
But strange things happened later.

148
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,060
Help me analyze them.

149
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:24,980
Go ahead!

150
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,100
Last night, His Majesty saved me.

151
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,540
We stayed together temporarily,

152
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,260
but Ji Heng came inside unexpectedly.

153
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,020
What?

154
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,740
Ji Heng visited the ice face at midnight?

155
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,980
Ice face, good for you!

156
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,460
No!

157
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,940
You pretended to let me see Ji Heng,

158
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,940
but you played dirty behind my back!

159
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,460
No! No! Stay calm!

160
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,260
Nothing happened between them.

161
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,500
It's just

162
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,060
at that time,

163
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,180
I was lying on His Majesty's bed.

164
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,180
Nothing happened between us!

165
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,780
But what surprised me was that

166
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,100
His Majesty tried nothing to cover it up.

167
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,620
He was not afraid that Ji Heng might see me.

168
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,860
What does that mean?

169
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,220
I just know that

170
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,820
the ice face is not so generous.

171
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,300
He pretended to promise me that
he wouldn't stop me from seeing Ji Heng,

172
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,660
but he bore grudges secretly,

173
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,220
and he vented his jealousy on

174
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,180
the innocent Ji Heng.

175
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,980
Jealousy?

176
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,380
I mean he wanted to hurt Ji Heng out of jealousy.

177
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,220
He

178
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,380
is jealous of you?

179
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,300
Yes!

180
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,860
Look!

181
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,180
Having Ji Heng see

182
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,580
another woman is lying on his bed,

183
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,620
he obviously wanted to hurt Ji Heng.

184
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,420
Because he also felt hurt

185
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,860
after seeing Ji Heng contact with me.

186
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,980
In this case,

187
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,100
the ice face also loves Ji Heng deeply.

188
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,700
He had to release his mood

189
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,700
via such a way.

190
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,740
Can the word "mood" be used here?

191
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Does that make sense?

192
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,100
Of course it does.

193
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,940
It makes perfect sense to me.

194
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
The harder the ice face tries to hurt Ji Heng,

195
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,220
the more likely

196
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,940
I'm gonna take Ji Heng back.

197
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,220
I feel that

198
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,020
I stand a better chance now!

199
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,420
Forget it.

200
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,460
As the saying goes,

201
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,620
"Better to tear down ten temples

202
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,420
than to destroy a marriage."

203
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,860
What do you know?

204
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,700
If a marriage can be destroyed, it's not true love.

205
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,420
Only those can't be destroyed
can be called predestined marriages.

206
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,460
Unexpectedly,

207
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,780
there're so many tricky

208
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,060
and sophisticated theories in love.

209
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,620
And these theories

210
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,780
can all be linked with one another.

211
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,780
Without learning

212
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,620
any useful trick,

213
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,700
I went straight to Tai Chen Palace,

214
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,540
hoping to see His Majesty more.

215
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,300
I was really audacious back then.

216
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,420
At last, he didn't notice me as expected.

217
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,820
Only till today do I realize

218
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,020
how naive I was back then.

219
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,940
Lord.

220
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,900
Si Ming,

221
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,140
what have you done?

222
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,980
Why were you snickering?

223
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,580
Nothing.

224
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,860
I just thought of Her Highness.

225
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,900
You thought of Fengjiu?

226
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,140
I remembered the time when I first met her.

227
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,020
Interesting.

228
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,460
Back then,

229
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,260
she seemed clever and quick-witted.

230
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,860
She was so audacious that she dared to cause any trouble,

231
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,060
but she was extremely innocent.

232
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,660
Whatever you told her,

233
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,260
as long as you remained serious,

234
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,220
she would surely be fooled.

235
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,060
I also remember

236
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,500
God Zhe Yan tricked her that

237
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,260
whoever ate the peaches of

238
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,540
the peach forest would get pregnant.

239
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,820
She was so scared that she cried loudly.

240
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,980
So God Bai Zhen ate five peaches

241
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,340
right in front of her.

242
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,380
And she kept staring at

243
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,700
God Bai Zhen's belly every day.

244
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,820
After quite some time,

245
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,460
seeing that no infants were born,

246
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,900
she finally felt relieved.

247
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,140
Later, His Majesty tricked her again.

248
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,820
You mean when she was still a little fox.

249
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,340
Right.

250
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,580
She believed again?

251
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,500
Yes!

252
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,900
After all, it was His Majesty who told her that.

253
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,420
Lord.

254
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,020
His Highness Lian Song seems to suspect something.

255
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,900
About what?

256
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,660
Now Her Highness is in the Fanyin Valley with His Majesty.

257
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,860
As to what has happened before,

258
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,740
I wonder whether I should cover it up for Her Highness

259
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,660
or take this chance to reveal it.

260
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,540
Perhaps,

261
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,780
they might have a future.

262
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,780
But you've already confirmed that

263
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,140
they're not meant for each other.

264
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
But if not,

265
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,380
how could they meet again in the Fanyin Valley

266
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,100
and be dragged into the awful
mess of Miaoyi Chasm together?

267
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,340
If fate can be rewritten,

268
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,820
there could be changes.

269
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,820
Lord, I just want to remind you

270
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,620
that if His Highness Lian Song
wants to figure something out,

271
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,220
he won't stop until he gets what he wants.

272
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
He will surely come to you.

273
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,780
You should know

274
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,620
how to deal with him.

275
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,060
OK.

276
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,380
I knew you would come.

277
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,780
Dong Hua,

278
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,620
we had a wonderful time yesterday.

279
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,660
Was it far better than any experience you've had?

280
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,660
It appears

281
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,220
you've used the power of the soul-locking jade

282
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,180
to form the incarnation at the full moon night.

283
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,940
So what?

284
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,220
I've absorbed the soul-locking jade.

285
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,700
Soon, I'll break out of

286
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,900
your seal.

287
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,260
If you're really that capable,

288
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,500
why should you form the incarnation?

289
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,780
I only used it

290
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,500
to explore the secret in your heart.

291
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,620
Now is not the time for us to fight.

292
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,380
We'll never fight,

293
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
because you won't be able to get out.

294
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,500
I know why you're here today.

295
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,060
I've found out your secret,

296
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,300
so you're restless.

297
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,140
Just guess.

298
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,100
What did my incarnation see

299
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,940
in your arms yesterday?

300
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,820
Behind the sea of flowers in your heart,

301
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,220
there is a woman in white.

302
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,860
Am I right?

303
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,780
And that woman in white

304
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,900
won't escape the palm of my hand, either.

305
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,540
Your incarnation won't be able to get out any more.

306
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,340
You know you can't confine me for long.

307
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,300
I've known your weakness.

308
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,940
I should get the pimpon fruit

309
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,700
or that girl's Red Qi as soon as possible.

310
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,300
Why do you push me?

311
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,540
I... I have to leave now!

312
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:06,900
Well,

313
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,020
the door is here.

314
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,860
I'm out of time.

315
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,300
Xiaojiu

316
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,020
is a nine-tailed red fox?

317
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,340
You've lived in the same courtyard with her,

318
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,900
but you actually didn't know
she's the Princess of Qingqiu.

319
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,780
She did tell me she's Bai Fengjiu.

320
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,100
But I never thought

321
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,980
she's the Princess of Qingqiu.

322
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,740
Well, why are you here?

323
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,140
Xiaojiu said she doesn't want to

324
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,900
see you for the moment.

325
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,220
Demon Lord Yan,

326
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,700
you actually speak more politely now.

327
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,540
Well, you find it weird?

328
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,580
Then I'll talk to you as I used to.

329
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,460
This is her room.

330
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,620
How can you get in and out as you wish?

331
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,460
Then why do you get in?

332
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,820
How long have you been living in the same courtyard?

333
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
About half a year since we entered the valley.

334
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,420
Ice face,

335
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,940
why should I answer you?

336
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,780
I like your room.

337
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,460
I'd like to switch room with you.
You can take the west room in the Yulin Courtyard.

338
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,180
No way!

339
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,140
Ji Heng also lives in the Yulin Courtyard.

340
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,060
Ji Heng!

341
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,060
Yan,

342
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,060
why are you here?

343
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,940
Well, you are...

344
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,820
I did someone a favor

345
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,860
to switch room with him.

346
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,860
From now on,

347
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,660
we're living in the same courtyard.

348
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,260
I'm at your service.

349
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,860
May I water the flowers for you?

350
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,940
Yan,

351
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,580
who lives in the Jifeng Courtyard

352
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,380
with you?

353
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,620
Xiaojiu.

354
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,540
I haven't finished yet.

355
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,820
Am I not welcome?

356
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,420
Jiuge!

357
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,740
Why are you sitting here in a daze?

358
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,380
Meng, where are you going?

359
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,940
The tournament is about to start in a few days.

360
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,340
I'm going to visit Master.

361
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,860
See if I can do anything to help.

362
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,180
It's getting cold these days.

363
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,900
Go back to your room early.

364
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,380
Be careful not to catch a cold.

365
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
It's so weird.

366
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,740
I've been here for more than half a year,

367
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,300
but the weather never gets better.

368
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,580
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

369
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,740
Here's the thing.

370
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,860
In the Fanyin Valley,

371
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,580
there aren't four seasons in a year.

372
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,860
You mean,

373
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,100
the Fanyin Valley is always so cold.

374
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,700
Right.

375
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,300
How could this be?

376
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,900
Actually, over one hundred years ago,

377
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,860
we could experience the progression of seasons

378
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,420
in the Fanyin Valley,

379
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,980
but it changed later.

380
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,900
Why?

381
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,980
It's a long story.

382
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,500
It is said that two hundred years ago,

383
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,580
there was an archmage

384
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,540
named Shen Ye in our clan.

385
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,220
One year, he cut off spring, summer
and autumn with his sword and hid them into his sleeve.

386
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,060
Then he left with them

387
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,620
and lived a recluse life in Qi Nan Palace.

388
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,100
Never was he out again.

389
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,020
Since then, there is only winter in the Fanyin Valley.

390
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,220
But why did he

391
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,780
cut off the three seasons with his sword?

392
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,420
It is said he did that because of Aranya.

393
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,780
Who was Aranya?

394
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,100
She was the Second Princess of our clan.

395
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Legend has it that when she was alive,

396
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,940
she especially loved spring, summer and autumn.

397
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,740
But after she died,

398
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,420
her name became

399
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,100
a taboo of the entire clan.

400
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,060
Shen Ye took away the three seasons

401
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,620
to remind our clan that

402
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,860
even we can't mention her name,

403
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,980
we should never forget her.

404
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,820
Why did her name

405
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,980
become a taboo?

406
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,500
Forget about that.

407
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,700
In a word,

408
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,540
never mention Shen Ye and Aranya to anyone else.

409
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,140
It's the taboo of our clan.

410
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,060
If only Aranya loved

411
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,700
the icy winter.

412
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,460
Then life won't be so hard

413
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,220
in the Fanyin Valley.

414
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,300
I just told you not to mention her.

415
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,100
Fine. I won't mention her again.

416
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,060
What's in the jar you're holding?

417
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,940
You never put it down.

418
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,820
Let me have a look.

419
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,540
Well, I'll tell you some other day.

420
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,300
I've talked with you for so long today.

421
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,140
I still have to visit Master.

422
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,820
Fine.

423
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,100
Remember to tell me the story of

424
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,380
Shen Ye and Aranya some other day.

425
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,060
It's so cold!

426
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,340
Why is he here?

427
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,380
You're...

428
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,260
Well,

429
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,980
didn't Yan tell you?

430
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,340
We've switched rooms.

431
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,220
From today on,

432
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,020
you'll be the one to serve me.

433
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,660
Who?

434
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,620
If Chong Lin is here, the tea
should be ready at an early time.

435
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
Then why not bring Chong Lin with you

436
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,220
when you entered the valley?

437
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,380
You're here.

438
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,020
Why should I bring him?

439
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,220
Why can't you bring him

440
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,620
when I'm here?

441
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,860
If he's here, I can't order you around.

442
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,460
Why can't you order me around

443
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,220
when he's here?

444
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,380
You're right!

445
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,660
I can still order you around even if he's here.

446
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,140
Go and cook for me.

447
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,740
Your Majesty,

448
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,820
I really think that

449
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,460
you're quite thick-skinned sometimes.

450
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:00,980
Right.

451
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,300
You're very perceptive.

452
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,140
The night before,

453
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,660
didn't you say you want to steal

454
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,180
something called pimpon?

455
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,140
I didn't say anything.

456
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,740
Nor did you hear anything.

457
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,740
Actually, I've always wanted to cook fish

458
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,620
for Your Majesty,

459
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,780
but I never got the chance.

460
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,780
What flavor do you like?

461
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,620
Steamed fish is OK.

462
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,580
There're many ways of making steamed fish.

463
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,620
Which one do you prefer?

464
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,860
Make a peony-shaped cut on the fish body,

465
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,740
and put sliced white mushrooms

466
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,140
into the cut before steaming,

467
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,380
or directly stuff the fish belly

468
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,660
with sliced mushrooms and tender
bamboo shoots before steaming?

469
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,580
The second method might be...

470
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,100
Can you stand on your own?

471
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,940
Use the first method today,

472
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,300
and the second tomorrow.

473
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,860
Cook the fish with the garlic
juice the day after tomorrow.

474
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,980
What's wrong with your arm?

475
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:10,740
Over there.

476
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,580
My wound opened when I carried you back.

477
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,980
You're lying! I'm not that fat!

478
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,900
I think

479
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,860
now you should worry about my wound

480
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,820
instead of your weight.

481
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,460
Well, why is your arm so fragile?

482
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,980
Because you're too fat.

483
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,580
Nonsense! I'm not fat!

484
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,020
I didn't hit you when you win.

485
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,900
Now that I win, you can't hit me, either.

486
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,580
Your hair is sticking out.

487
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,220
Xiaobai,

488
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,660
have you forgotten to comb your hair today?

489
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,660
What do you know?

490
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,700
It's the latest style.

491
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,500
You called me Xiaobai just now.

492
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,940
What's wrong with that?

493
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,500
Well,

494
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,460
no one has ever called me Xiaobai.

495
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,740
A few days ago, you switched room

496
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,180
with His Majesty excitedly.

497
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,740
Why are you so gloomy today?

498
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,820
It seems Ji Heng doesn't welcome me.

499
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,860
These days, she kept a poker face,

500
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,100
and she didn't respond when I talked to her.

501
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Don't think too much.

502
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,940
Maybe she's got something in mind.

503
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
She is used to serving His Majesty

504
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,060
and seeing him morning and night.

505
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,180
She may not get used to the
change within such a short time.

506
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,300
Now that you're living

507
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,660
in the same courtyard with her,

508
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,300
she'll find the good in you as time passes by.

509
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,900
You're right.

510
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
I should try harder.

511
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,900
Well, why did His Majesty move
into Princess Jiuge's courtyard?

512
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,500
What does that imply?

513
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:02,900
Imply?

514
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,300
Is it possible that His Majesty

515
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,060
is in love with Jiuge?

516
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,380
In your opinion, do they match?

517
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,180
Jiuge is good-looking.

518
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,300
She seems to be a good match for His Majesty.

519
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,140
Terrific!

520
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,940
Now Jiuge and the ice face live in the same courtyard.

521
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,340
If I can bring them together

522
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,140
and comfort Ji Heng

523
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,580
when she's heartbroken...

524
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,500
Well,

525
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,500
what will she do?

526
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,020
It sounds like

527
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,700
taking advantage of her vulnerability.

528
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,540
Also, if you do this to Jiuge,

529
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,140
you clearly

530
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,060
value lover over friend.

531
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,780
What do you know?

532
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,220
It's hard to find a perfect match.

533
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,700
I try to find Jiuge a perfect match

534
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,260
because I care about her.

535
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,780
However,

536
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,220
since I've said lots of bad things about

537
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,940
the ice face to Xiaojiu,

538
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,860
I should figure out a way to reverse his image.

539
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,580
I've seen nothing.

540
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,820
Don't you ever knock the door
before entering someone else's room?

541
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,660
I didn't know you were undressing.

542
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,060
But why not lock the door when undressing?

543
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,700
It's my room.

544
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,980
Why should I lock the door?

545
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,020
I...

546
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,340
What are those?

547
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,860
The medicine for treating wounds.

548
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,980
Apply it to your wound by yourself.

549
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,860
Come here.

550
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,500
Have you applied the medicine yet?

551
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,700
How come I feel nothing?

552
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,700
I'm applying the medicine now.

553
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,660
Anyway,

554
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,380
powerful as you are,

555
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,900
that banshee is no match for you.

556
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,020
How could she hurt you?

557
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,460
Did you

558
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,220
hurt your arm on purpose

559
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,700
so as to keep me here for your entertainment?

560
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,420
Am I so boring?

561
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,380
Yes.

562
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,500
Xiaobai,

563
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,620
you've really misunderstood me a lot.

564
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,180
You failed to get the pimpon fruit.

565
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,700
What should you do?

566
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,980
It's fine.

567
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,780
I can go and get it on the fifteenth day next month.

568
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,580
Will it be too late?

569
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,220
No, it won't.

570
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,380
The final competition of

571
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,940
the tournament is yet to start.

572
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,100
I've still got time.

573
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,660
Jiuge.

574
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,660
Jiuge, you didn't sleep well

575
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,140
for reviewing lessons late at night, right?

576
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,580
Master, what can I do for you?

577
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,020
His Majesty mentioned you yesterday,

578
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,700
saying that you've improved a lot recently.

579
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,420
With the permission of His Majesty,

580
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,420
I've added your name

581
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,300
to the final list of the tournament.

582
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,940
Get well prepared.

583
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,260
Yan, have I heard it right?

584
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,260
You heard it right!

585
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,340
You've entered the final competition.

586
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,780
So we don't

587
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,620
have to steal...

588
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,620
...the pimpon fruit, right?

589
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,060
You mean,

590
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,660
it was the ice face who asked Master

591
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,620
to add your name to the final list.

592
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,420
I guess so.

593
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,900
His Majesty asked me about

594
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,220
the pimpon fruit yesterday.

595
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,340
Xiaojiu!

596
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,540
The ice face...

597
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,420
No.

598
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,540
Dong Hua.

599
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,500
Serious and righteous as Emperor Dong Hua is,

600
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,020
his name is widely known in
the Eight Deserts and Six Directions!

601
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Are you OK?

602
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,420
Aren't you against him all the time?

603
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,060
Just think about it.

604
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,260
He specially visited Master

605
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,420
to add you to the final list,

606
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,500
regardless of damaging his name.

607
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,180
Xiaojiu,

608
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,980
this is a big favor.

609
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,780
He did help me this time,

610
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,540
but he also tricked me before.

611
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,580
He...

612
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,460
He didn't come to your rescue for half a year,
and he turned into a handkerchief to trick you.

613
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,540
But these are just small mistakes.

614
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,100
Compared to the big favor of helping you

615
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,500
get into the final competition,

616
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,500
those are nothing.

617
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,980
Xiaojiu, to you,

618
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,980
his favor outweighs his mistakes.

619
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,940
He's a good man rarely seen.

620
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,660
Do you think I'm too harsh on His Majesty?

621
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,540
Demons or gods, we should be
grateful and pay back favors.

622
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,100
If you ignore such a big favor

623
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,020
simply for some small mistakes

624
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,700
he once made,

625
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,740
what makes you so different

626
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,060
from mortals or beasts?

627
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,820
You've really changed your view on His Majesty!

628
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,700
I...

629
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,260
I misunderstood Dong Hua a lot in the past.

630
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,340
But what he did this time

631
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,540
makes me realize that he clearly

632
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,380
wants to make friends with you.

633
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,020
Xiaojiu, treasure the opportunity

634
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,420
of making such a friend.

635
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,220
Don't misunderstand him ever again.

636
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,780
I have to think about it.

637
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,020
To achieve my own goal,

638
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,740
I could even say those words!

639
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,980
How shameless I am!

640
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,660
Go on! Go on!

641
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,580
I don't know you've got such a hobby.

642
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,260
Sorry to interrupt.

643
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:55,980
Wait!

644
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,740
What hobby?

645
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:58,780
See you.

646
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,460
Don't go!

647
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,620
Listen! I'm not! I didn't!

648
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,580
I...

649
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,380
I just feel sorry for Xiaojiu.

650
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,620
If you feel sorry for her, just make up to her.

651
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,460
Why did you hit yourself?

652
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,820
I just feel...

653
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,660
I just feel...

654
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,940
You value lover over friend?

655
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,580
Right.

656
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,500
That's it!

657
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,020
Xiaojiu has gone through hardships with me.

658
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,380
But I treated her this way.

659
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,340
I'm...

660
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,500
Disloyal?

661
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,700
How come you know it so well?

662
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,340
My elder brother sucks at keeping secrets.

663
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,300
With some little tricks, he told me everything.

664
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,260
What did Meng tell you?

665
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,340
He just told me that

666
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,780
you feel that if master falls in love with Xiaojiu

667
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,180
after being with her morning and night

668
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,740
while you don't under the same circumstances,

669
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,020
it can make you seem more faithful

670
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,180
and devoted to the musician.

671
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,060
Then when the musician is heartbroken,

672
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,020
you can seize the chance

673
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,940
to win her heart.

674
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,340
After hearing his summary,

675
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,180
I find myself even more shameless.

676
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,780
Tell me.

677
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,300
If you were Xiaojiu

678
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,740
and you knew I was going to set you up

679
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,620
with someone you didn't like out of my selfishness,

680
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,300
would you be mad at me?

681
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,020
Are you blind?

682
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,580
In the entire Fanyin Valley,

683
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,020
I'm afraid you're the only one who thinks

684
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,380
Xiaojiu doesn't like master.

685
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,460
Don't you really think that

686
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,980
a girl really means it

687
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,740
when she tells you she hates
someone or doesn't like someone?

688
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,740
Well, no.

689
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,620
But why does she lie to me?

690
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Why doesn't she tell me she likes the ice face?

691
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,460
It's really a waste of time talking to you!

692
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,820
Then if she likes the ice face,

693
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,340
I don't have to feel guilty about

694
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,180
bringing them together.

695
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,940
Right.

696
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,100
Well, Ji Heng says she doesn't like me. Does that mean...

697
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,580
No!

698
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,100
She really doesn't like you.

699
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,340
How could you know?

700
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,140
How come Xiaojiu doesn't mean it,

701
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,980
but Ji Heng does?

702
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,940
Because the person she says she doesn't like is master.

703
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,140
Xiaojiu is contending with the musician.

704
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,460
Can't you see it?

705
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,220
If it's not for master,

706
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,180
why should Xiaojiu go against her?

707
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,060
Is she so narrow-minded?

708
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
Everyone knows the musician likes master.

709
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,100
As to why does Xiaojiu avoid master,

710
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,220
I've no idea.

711
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,620
However,

712
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,620
it proves that she cares.

713
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,020
Anyway, girls are not so hard to guess.

714
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,300
The musician goes after master,

715
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,420
Master goes after Xiaojiu,

716
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,540
and Xiaojiu avoids master herself.

717
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,100
That's how they deal with each other.

718
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,980
In this case,

719
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,020
I'm not harming Xiaojiu,

720
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,180
but helping her instead.

721
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,860
I didn't expect that

722
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,940
the ice face is so popular among women.

723
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,740
I remember you also had a thing for him...

724
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,140
I've already

725
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,260
thought it through.

726
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,100
It's meaningless.

727
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,100
You don't like him anymore?

728
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,220
Master cared about the musician before.

729
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,940
I thought if I worked harder

730
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,180
and became more excellent than the musician,

731
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,700
he might also care about me.

732
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,060
But later, Xiaojiu came along.

733
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,580
He treats her differently.

734
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
It has nothing to do with others.

735
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,020
No matter how hard I try, I won't be able to step in.

736
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,740
I am the princess of the inseparable king birds.

737
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,140
It's just a man.

738
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,900
No need to bother about that.

739
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,980
In a word, the ice face is to blame.

740
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,100
He has seduced multiple women
and just can't remain faithful in a relationship.

741
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,580
Dumb as you are,

742
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,020
you can't figure out anything.

743
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,860
Just keep pursuing your musician.

744
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,260
Stop thinking randomly.

745
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,980
I wonder how I became more and more confused before.

746
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,420
I should never ask Meng for advice.

747
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,420
I should've come to you.

748
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,820
You should've known that long ago.

749
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,100
You're also a girl. How can I forget that?

750
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,940
Yan,

751
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,100
are you seeking death?

752
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,580
But now God is on my side.

753
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,500
Just like you, Ji Heng will find out

754
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,540
what a man the ice face really is sooner or later.

755
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
Then she'll like him no more.

756
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,300
Xiaojiu, congratulations!

757
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,180
You finally made it to the final
competition of the tournament.

758
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,820
Jiuge,

759
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,180
hope you can get what you want.

760
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,140
Cheers!

761
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,100
Cheers!

762
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,300
But I made it thanks to His Majesty.

763
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,500
Yan is right.

764
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,260
I have to pay back the favor.

765
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,740
Really.

766
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,260
Without His Majesty,

767
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,020
I probably wouldn't make it to the final.

768
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,060
So in a few days,

769
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,820
I'll invite His Majesty to dinner

770
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,620
at Zuilixian Restaurant.

771
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,780
Everyone, you must all come!

772
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,780
Of course! Of course!

773
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,140
Good! Good! Good! That's the spirit.

774
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,300
Cheers!

775
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,140
Cheers!

776
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,940
However,

777
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,540
though I've made it to the final,

778
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
I've no idea

779
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,180
what the final competition is about.

780
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,860
What else can it be?

781
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,180
It must be a competition of magic arts.

782
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,940
On the contrary,

783
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,940
this time, the tournament

784
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,820
will be held in the Green Plum Cove outside the city.

785
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,380
Magic arts are forbidden in that place,

786
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,300
so this tournament

787
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,380
is a conventional sword competition.

788
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,660
Sword spirit and techniques are more emphasized when rating.

789
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,980
Contestants will stand on snow piles

790
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,060
and compete with swords.

791
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,700
Whoever falls off first will lose.

792
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,500
I see.

793
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,900
As long as it's not about musical instruments,
the game of go, calligraphy, painting,

794
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,380
or poetry, it's fine.

795
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,660
You can do it!

796
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,460
I believe in you.

797
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,220
Well, Xiaojiu,

798
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,580
I've always wanted to ask you.

799
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,060
Why are you so obsessed with

800
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,700
the pimpon fruit?

801
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,980
Is it really for maintaining your beauty,

802
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,700
just like Jielu?

803
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,860
Right.

804
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,380
Which goddess doesn't want to

805
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,180
remain beautiful forever?

806
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,300
Well,

807
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,180
Forget it.

808
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:24,740
Let's drink!

809
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,500
Cheers! Cheers!

810
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,860
Xiaojiu,

811
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,100
I don't know

812
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,940
why you have to get the pimpon fruit,

813
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,340
but,

814
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
I do admire you.

815
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,700
You get what you want

816
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,940
through your own efforts.

817
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,180
We're much alike in this regard.

818
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,500
But I envy you more.

819
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,500
For what?

820
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,420
I envy you.

821
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,460
Thought there have been twists and turns, it ends well.

822
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,100
But even if I made it to the final,

823
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,740
I may not get the pimpon fruit.

824
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,780
If I can make Ji Heng like me,

825
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,820
I'm willing to go through all kinds of hardships.

826
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,660
But for some things,

827
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,060
it won't work however hard you try.

828
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,780
Yan,

829
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,980
you've drunk too much.

830
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,820
You're talking about results,

831
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,180
but I don't even get the chance

832
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,620
to see her.

833
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,460
Are you referring to the woman you love,

834
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,700
the Princess of Qingqiu?

835
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,420
Yes.

836
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,700
Unexpectedly, I only saw her once,

837
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,420
but I've never got the chance
to talk to her ever again in my life.

838
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,100
There might still be chance.

839
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,700
Maybe it's not the right time yet.

840
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,940
Really?

841
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,860
Jiuge, thanks to your blessing!

842
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,820
Cheers!

843
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,620
How about this?

844
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,820
Warrior Yan,

845
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,220
invite Ji Heng to Zuilixian Restaurant.

846
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,780
I'll make sure you sit next to each other,

847
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,980
so you can talk more.

848
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:01,780
Buddy!

849
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,500
Good buddy!

850
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
I'll ask her tomorrow.

851
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,500
OK.

852
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,420
Xiaobai, come in.

853
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,300
His Majesty is calling me again.

854
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:09,980
I have to go back.

855
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,900
It's my treat! You must all come!

856
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:14,980
Coming!
