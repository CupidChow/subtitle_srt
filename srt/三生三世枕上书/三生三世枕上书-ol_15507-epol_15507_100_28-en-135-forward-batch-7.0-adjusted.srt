1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 28

3
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,940
Your Majesty,

4
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,460
has the war of Mount Fuyu not finished yet?

5
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,020
That Demon Lord Yan

6
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,980
is not a threat.

7
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,260
Now that the disaster is quelled,

8
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,220
Your Majesty, why are you still so worried?

9
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,900
I left her in the Fanyin Valley.

10
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,580
What have you left?

11
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
A silk handkerchief.

12
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,300
Leave me alone.

13
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,540
Yes.

14
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,660
Which man in the world

15
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,140
doesn't like Ji Heng?

16
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,340
In that case,

17
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,580
since His Majesty likes Ji Heng so much,

18
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,940
why did I hear that

19
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,100
when they got out of the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

20
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,740
Ji Heng asked His Majesty for a spiritual fox

21
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,220
they found together,

22
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,180
but His Majesty didn't give it to her?

23
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,100
What do you know?

24
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,700
It's a strategy.

25
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,380
It's just like you like ice face,

26
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,780
so you will try every means to connect with him.

27
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,860
He didn't give that spiritual fox

28
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,980
to Ji Heng

29
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,380
so that Ji Heng would visit Tai Chen Palace

30
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,420
frequently to see it later.

31
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,860
He's really cunning.

32
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,460
Though he talks casually,

33
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,300
he's pretty scrupulous.

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,940
I know you like him,

35
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,740
just as I like Ji Heng.

36
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,660
We have the same misfortune.

37
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,740
Take my advice.

38
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,740
It's never too late to mend your ways.

39
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,100
I don't know this sentence

40
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,380
can also be interpreted this way.

41
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,980
Just mend your ways.

42
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,260
However, the ice face failed to get married in the end.

43
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
Ji Heng ran away from the wedding.

44
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,700
He lost not only his empress

45
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,900
but also the spiritual fox.

46
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,580
How miserable he was!

47
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,580
You said you're from Qingqiu.

48
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,820
Do you know

49
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,900
where that spiritual fox is now?

50
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,420
It sounds ridiculous.

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,820
The ice face actually

52
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,900
came to me for the fox.

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
He thought I had abducted the fox.

54
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,660
Do I look like someone

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,620
who would abduct a fox?

56
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,260
He really underestimated me!

57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,940
However,

58
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,540
I heard that he still hasn't found it after years of searching.

59
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,420
In my opinion,

60
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,820
that fox is probably dead.

61
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,700
I wonder what kind of a fox that is

62
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,260
to be so favored by him.

63
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,300
Warrior Yan,

64
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,660
after talking for so long,

65
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,940
you must be thirsty.

66
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,980
Shall we look for the exit?

67
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,300
We can't stay here

68
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,420
forever.

69
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,620
You've made a point.

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,740
Watch out!

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,380
After all, we've been through trouble together.

72
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I can't watch you fall down

73
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,380
and do nothing.

74
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,420
Forget it! I'm coming!

75
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,140
Today is really an auspicious day.

76
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,980
It's exceptionally easy to avoid those spies

77
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
in the imperial palace and get outside.

78
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,180
Let's go and have a look!

79
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,700
What's wrong?

80
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,220
Look over there!

81
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,980
Turn them over!

82
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,220
They hit someone.

83
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,220
Second Prince!

84
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,700
I pay respects to Your Highness!

85
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,020
How dare you!

86
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,180
You actually attacked
the Second Prince of the inseparable king bird!

87
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,900
I'm so unlucky

88
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,260
to have fallen into the nest of the inseparable king birds!

89
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,100
The inseparable king birds had a problem with Qingqiu.

90
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,180
I can't let them know

91
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,260
I'm from Qingqiu.

92
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,860
It seems that without suffering,

93
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,260
you won't know

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,100
how powerful we inseparable king birds are.

95
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,100
Guards!

96
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
Take them to the prison

97
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,180
to wait for execution!

98
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,220
- Yes! - Yes!

99
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,940
Go!

100
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,860
That girl

101
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,620
looks familiar.

102
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,300
Brother, you finally wake up!

103
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,420
You freaked me out.

104
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,580
Are you OK?

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,140
Brother, what're you doing?

106
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,100
Brother,

107
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,820
where are you going?

108
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,340
You were knocked out a moment ago.

109
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,380
The pharmacist said you should rest well.

110
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,460
Jielu,

111
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,580
you said I was knocked out?

112
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,380
Right!

113
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
And you were knocked out by two people.

114
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,700
Is my secret trip outside

115
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,860
the imperial palace exposed?

116
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,500
That I haven't heard of.

117
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,820
However, for us inseparable king birds,

118
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,340
traditionally, unmarried men
are not allowed to leave the valley alone.

119
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,180
Brother, why do you break the rule repeatedly?

120
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,700
You know that I've longed for

121
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,940
the colorful world outside the valley

122
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,060
and wanted to experience the outside world for a long time.

123
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,900
I've waited so long for the Jiazi Valley to open,

124
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,060
but now it's all ruined.

125
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,420
If...

126
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,980
If Her Majesty finds out...

127
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,660
Well...

128
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,620
So...

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,460
So I sneaked out.

130
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,020
Well,

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,380
where are the two people who knocked me out?

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,660
After hearing that they knocked you out,

133
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,820
Her Majesty ordered to put them into prison.

134
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,300
Just let me finish.

135
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,860
Luckily, you're not severely injured,

136
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,220
so they've been sent to the water dungeon instead.

137
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,500
I was the one who made the mistake.

138
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,060
I certainly can't get them in trouble.

139
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,140
Jielu, do you who knocked me out?

140
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,540
I only know it's a man and a woman.

141
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,820
Brother,

142
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,420
wait for me!

143
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,260
Get out!

144
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,060
Where're you taking me?

145
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,940
The water dungeon.

146
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,180
The water dungeon?

147
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,780
You birds do have many tricks.

148
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,900
Cut the crap!

149
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,940
Still feeling dizzy after falling down just now,

150
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,940
I don't feel like having a fight.

151
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,260
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to capture me.

152
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,300
Knocking out the prince of the inseparable king birds

153
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,620
can either be big or small.

154
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,180
If he can't wake up,

155
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,260
it's a big deal.

156
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,580
If he wakes up,

157
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,620
with others interceding for us,

158
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,340
there's hope.

159
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:22,940
Hurry up! Hurry up!

160
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,580
Her Majesty ordered

161
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,420
to escort them to the Palace Hall immediately.

162
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,780
It seems that he has woken up.

163
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,900
I just heard from the Second Prince that

164
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,220
you're the prince and princess of

165
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,500
the night owls across the river.

166
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,340
Admiring the Imperial College of our clan,

167
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,300
you took a study tour here.

168
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,780
You injured the Second Prince by accident.

169
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,260
Why did the Second Prince make up such a lie?

170
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,820
It appears that it's a misunderstanding after all.

171
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,620
Sorry for making you suffer.

172
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,380
You're honored guests coming from afar.

173
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,340
Well,

174
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,460
we should treat you well.

175
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,700
Thank you, Your Majesty!

176
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,660
Thank you, Your Majesty!

177
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,500
Since you admire our Imperial College,

178
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,940
I'll allow you to live in the Jifeng Courtyard of

179
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,180
the Imperial College.

180
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,180
On the one hand, your sincere wish

181
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,060
to study in the Imperial College can be satisfied.

182
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,260
On the other hand, it's convenient
for younger generations of our two clans

183
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,660
to exchange and compete with each other.

184
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,900
What do you think?

185
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,420
Your Majesty, thank you for your careful
and considerate arrangement.

186
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,060
We can't thank you enough.

187
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,780
We'll definitely study hard in the Imperial College.

188
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,180
Mother,

189
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,620
then I'll take them to the Jifeng Courtyard.

190
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,700
Go ahead.

191
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,820
Please.

192
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,500
Let's go!

193
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,100
Go!

194
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,340
Wait outside.

195
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,340
Yes!

196
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
Your Highness, thank you for saving us on the hall just now.

197
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,860
But there's one thing we really can't understand.

198
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,100
Are you wondering

199
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,740
why I saved you?

200
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,420
Frankly speaking,

201
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,940
it's also for my own good.

202
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
You mean?

203
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
I went out of the valley without permission.

204
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,660
If my mother finds out,

205
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,060
she won't spare me easily.

206
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,260
But now,

207
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,900
you're safe,

208
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,500
and I can avoid being punished.

209
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,940
Please keep the secret for me.

210
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Your Highness, rest assured.

211
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,900
However,

212
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,660
when can we get out of the valley?

213
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,900
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for another 60 years.

214
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,060
60 years!

215
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,300
It's so long!

216
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,060
It's a long story.

217
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,300
We inseparable king birds

218
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,740
are born fragile and delicate.

219
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,300
A tiny bit of foul air in the mortal realm can make us sick.

220
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,100
Therefore,

221
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,740
many years ago, our ancestors

222
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,220
found the Fanyin Valley after untold hardships

223
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,860
and led our entire clan to live a reclusive life in the valley.

224
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,900
Does this have anything to do with us leaving the valley?

225
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,460
Take it easy.

226
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,660
I haven't finished yet.

227
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,580
There's foul air sealed at the core of our valley.

228
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,940
If we open the valley too often,

229
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,540
the foul air might leak.

230
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,540
Once the Fanyin Valley is polluted,

231
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,780
the Four Seas and Eight Deserts will be in danger.

232
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,940
So the Fanyin Valley only opens every 60 years,

233
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,060
and it only opens a crack

234
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,300
for a short period of time, so that

235
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,020
immortal messengers from the Sky Kingdom

236
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,420
on business to the valley can pass.

237
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,700
The day you fell down
happens to be the opening date of the valley.

238
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,100
Well,

239
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,860
is there any other way to get out?

240
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,740
Even the most perceptive immortal messenger from heaven

241
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,020
needs to practice for three thousand years

242
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,020
to pass that crack.

243
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,940
So long...

244
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,060
Take it easy.

245
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,820
Fate had us meet each other this way.

246
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,380
I'm Xiang Limeng.

247
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,780
I wonder what your names are.

248
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,980
You can call me Xiaojiu.

249
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,620
Xiaojiu?

250
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,540
Terrific!

251
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,900
The princess of the night owls whose identity you've borrowed

252
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,060
also has "Jiu" in her name.

253
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,980
She's named Jiuge.

254
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,740
It'll be convenient for you

255
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,620
to use her name in the Fanyin Valley later.

256
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,780
Then I'll call you Jiuge.

257
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,300
OK! Good!

258
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,220
The Jifeng Courtyard has two rooms,
the east room and the west room.

259
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,900
Feel relieved to live here.

260
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,100
Whatever you need, just tell the servants.

261
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,180
Your Highness, you're really considerate.

262
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,780
Just call me Meng.

263
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,740
Bro, I wonder how I should address you.

264
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,540
Warrior Yan!

265
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,420
Just call me Yan.

266
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,900
Jiuge. Yan.

267
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,460
Have a good rest then.

268
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm leaving.

269
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,100
I'll take the east room.

270
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,540
You can have the west room.

271
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,940
It's weird.

272
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,820
After entering the Fanyin Valley,

273
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,060
he seems infatuated.

274
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,300
What's wrong with him?

275
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,540
Get up!

276
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,700
What's wrong with you?

277
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,980
Get up now!

278
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,220
It's late at night! Why should I get up

279
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
instead of sleeping?

280
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
We've been trapped in the valley

281
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,140
for so long.

282
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,340
Rather than sit here and wait,

283
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,900
we'd better figure a way out on our own.

284
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,660
Meng said

285
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,940
there's no way other than waiting for the valley to open.

286
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,820
Hurry up and practice magic arts with me.

287
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,860
Xiaojiu!

288
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,980
Without telling me the destination,

289
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,780
how could I know where to go with my magic arts?

290
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,220
Here you are! It's for you!

291
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:18,860
Well...

292
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,580
I'm leaving.

294
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,220
It's so weird!

295
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,100
I've practiced the magic arts to get out of the city.

296
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,340
How come I'm back again?

297
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,260
What about you?

298
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,380
Have you got out of the city?

299
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,100
The Fanyin Valley is really weird.

300
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,060
Xiaojiu, Meng said that

301
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,700
even the most perceptive immortal messenger from heaven

302
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,660
needs to practice for three thousand years

303
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,980
to pass that crack.

304
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,940
Your tiny bit of magic arts won't work!

305
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,140
No!

306
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
I have to try again.

307
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,820
Jiuge, how come...

308
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,220
How come...

309
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,780
Well, it's a mistake! It's a mistake!

310
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,500
Sorry to interrupt!

311
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,180
You!

312
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,060
You!

313
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,260
You!

314
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,660
What happened?

315
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,540
It's so scary! It's so scary!

316
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,660
Luckily, I ran away fast.

317
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,340
Xiaojiu,

318
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,540
you're still there.

319
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
I told you it's useless.

320
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,020
It's midnight already.

321
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,060
Let's wash up and go to bed.

322
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,020
Haven't we made an appointment with Meng tomorrow morning?

323
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,540
I'm going to sleep.

324
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,940
Fine. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

325
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,420
Chong Lin,

326
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,420
when will winter come?

327
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,460
Your Majesty,

328
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,860
winter will come in half a year.

329
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,980
Protected by Tiangang Shield,

330
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,700
she'll be safe within half a year.

331
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,020
Your Majesty, who are you talking about?

332
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,940
You may leave.

333
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,300
Yes.

334
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,140
Sir,

335
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,980
come and have a look.

336
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,140
Here are more.

337
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,940
Warrior Yan,

338
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,780
I thought you would be worried that

339
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,100
we couldn't get out of the city.

340
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,180
It seems you're not worried at all.

341
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,980
With wine and meat,

342
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,180
as well as me, a handsome warrior, by your side,

343
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,460
what to be worried about?

344
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,780
Normally,

345
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,660
unruly as you are,

346
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,780
you wouldn't give up

347
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,100
without putting up a fight.

348
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,460
I thought you would rather stay in the water dungeon

349
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,620
than suffer the pain of reading books.

350
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,540
I didn't expect that after staring blankly for a while,

351
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,620
you just obeyed the arrangement of Her Majesty obediently.

352
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,700
Are you interested in that woman in white?

353
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,820
I just can't get it.

354
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,020
There're so many women in white in the world.

355
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,220
Warrior Yan,

356
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,380
will you answer my question.

357
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,060
Whatever you say,

358
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,060
I know you're anxious

359
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,500
because the ice face hasn't come to save you yet.

360
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,420
Of course.

361
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,940
I offended His Majesty before.

362
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,420
I didn't expect him to save me

363
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,380
in just two or three days.

364
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
I'm offering him a transitional period

365
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,700
to calm down.

366
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,380
A grudge holder as he is,

367
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,540
how can you wait for him to save you?

368
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,140
As long as His Majesty

369
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,460
comes to my rescue within a month,

370
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,740
I will generously forgive him

371
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,860
for sending me to Mount Fuyu

372
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,540
and leaving me here to suffer.

373
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,380
That being said,

374
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,820
he should be able to get in.

375
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,020
With powerful magic arts accomplishments,

376
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,100
His Majesty

377
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,180
can go

378
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,620
wherever he wants.

379
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,420
Good.

380
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,620
Meng!

381
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,020
Come on! Have a drink!

382
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,380
Come on! Come on! Come on!

383
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,220
Come here! Come here!

384
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,900
I've been looking for you everywhere.

385
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,260
I didn't know you're here.

386
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,180
Jiuge,

387
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,340
why don't you take a bite?

388
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,940
Are you still thinking about leaving the valley?

389
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,220
I wanted to practice the teleportation trick that day

390
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,820
to see whether I could leave the city or not.

391
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,220
Unexpectedly, the trick suddenly failed.

392
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,500
So...

393
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,060
I forgot to tell you.

394
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,300
Magic arts can only be practiced
within the capital of the Fanyin Valley.

395
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,500
Once you step outside the capital,

396
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,980
even for half a step,

397
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,580
you won't be able to practice magic arts.

398
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
I see.

399
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,220
Sorry for offending you that day.

400
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,980
I, Xiaojiu...

401
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,340
I, Jiuge would like to propose a toast to you.

402
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:34,940
OK.

403
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,740
Just drink. Why do you talk so much?

404
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,140
Drink!

405
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,340
Sister Fengjiu! Sister Fengjiu!

406
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,700
Li!

407
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,420
I'm here to save you!

408
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,220
Li,

409
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,140
I didn't care for you for nothing.

410
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,860
Let's go!

411
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,700
Sister Fengjiu,

412
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,540
with you on the cloud, I can't practice the cloud-riding trick.

413
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,100
Don't you have Wind Fire Wheels?

414
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,860
No!

415
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,380
My wheels will be crushed.

416
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,740
Sister Fengjiu,

417
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,900
can you wait here.

418
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,140
I'll look for help.

419
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,420
Li!

420
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,660
Li!

421
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,420
Li!

422
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,060
Li!

423
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,060
The knowledge of forging weapons

424
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,860
is profound and abstruse.

425
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,340
For example,

426
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,780
there're many ways to forge a sword.

427
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,180
As to choosing which way...

428
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,100
Yan.

429
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,460
...it depends on your own cultivation and aptitude.

430
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,260
Master knows nothing about

431
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,060
forging weapons,

432
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,540
but he actually talks nonsense

433
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,260
with a serious look.

434
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,180
He's shamelessly boastful!

435
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,140
Jiuge.

436
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,620
Do you have any question?

437
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
Master, well,

438
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,260
I want to ask

439
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,020
if I want to forge a short knife,

440
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,340
which can turn into either a sword

441
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,980
or a crossbow

442
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,900
and shoot hidden weapons when necessary,

443
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,380
how should I design the mechanism

444
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,140
for such a weapon.

445
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,540
Forging knives and swords depends on aptitude and cultivation.

446
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,740
Normal women had better read more books.

447
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
Master, you haven't answered my question yet.

448
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,420
Master, actually,

449
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,220
I've already drawn a sketch.

450
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,780
Please give me some advice.

451
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,660
You don't have to waste time

452
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,980
in these useless stuff.

453
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
Since you've got nothing to do,

454
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,580
you should go back and copy the Weapon Theories for five times

455
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,100
to remove the fickleness.

456
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,900
Master,

457
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,980
don't you know the answer?

458
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,620
You!

459
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,140
Master is gone.

460
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,340
He obviously knows nothing.

461
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,380
Let's go! Go!

462
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,020
Let's go!

463
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,500
Go! Go!

464
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
Come on, I'll take you to eat something delicious.

465
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,620
Let's go!

466
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,300
Xiaojiu, is that old man gone?

467
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,380
Yes.

468
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,580
Then I'll go to the temperament class.

469
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
You're actually interested in temperament!

470
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,740
Ji Heng,

471
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,340
I know you're here!

472
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,020
Do you know

473
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,900
how hard I've tried to find you?

474
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,380
How's your poison?

475
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,460
How do you feel?

476
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,300
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

477
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,540
I'm Yan! Yan Chiwu!

478
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,140
Have you lost your memories again?

479
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,980
I'm the musician of this place.

480
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,700
I'm not Ji Heng.

481
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,620
Mr. Yan,

482
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm afraid you're too caught up in the past.

483
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,180
Is it fun?

484
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:27,860
Wait!

485
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,460
Let me ask you.

486
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,900
Is it fun to you?

487
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,100
You!

488
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
Wait for me!

489
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,180
What're you doing?

490
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,860
What a rude boor! Who are you?

491
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm the future Green Demon Lord.

492
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,820
Yan Chiwu!

493
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,620
Instead of paying respects to my elder brother,

494
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,900
you come to mess with me.

495
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,260
I'll tell my elder brother

496
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,700
to dismiss you from your position as the Demon Lord.

497
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,020
Wait!

498
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,140
Elder brother?

499
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,900
You must be Princess Ji Heng!

500
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,540
You're so cute!

501
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,500
You want to speak with Demon Lord Xu Yang.

502
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,580
I can go with you.

503
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,700
I'll ask your elder brother to make you my wife.

504
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,060
Cut the crap!

505
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,300
Princess Ji Heng,

506
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,900
I'll protect you. Wait for me!

507
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,500
Though you're wearing a veil,

508
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,260
I can still recognize you.

509
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,260
Moreover,

510
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,100
your voice remains the same.

511
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,780
Why don't you admit who you are? Is there a problem?

512
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,420
Last time, we talked happily together.

513
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,180
Did I piss you off somehow?

514
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,820
Why did you leave suddenly?

515
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,300
Was it because you don't like my palace.

516
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,100
Sure you don't.

517
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,180
It's not as peaceful and quiet as this place.

518
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:35,900
Rest assured.

519
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,940
When I go back, I'll...

520
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,580
Mr. Yan,

521
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,340
I'm just an idler in the valley.

522
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Please stop wasting time on me.

523
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,300
Fine.

524
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,940
Whether you're Ji Heng or a musician,

525
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,260
it doesn't matter.

526
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,940
After all, I've found you.

527
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,500
As long as you stay in this valley,

528
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,340
I will go nowhere else.

529
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,820
I can protect you right here.

530
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,900
It's a deal!

531
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,900
Keep watering the flowers.

532
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,860
I won't disturb you.

533
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,740
The student tournament held by the Imperial College

534
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,060
every ten years is about to come.

535
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:18,900
Meng!

536
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,780
Meng!

537
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,340
Why did you have to lie that

538
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,980
we admire

539
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,740
the Imperial College

540
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,940
of your clan?

541
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Because of that,

542
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,620
I have to

543
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,300
attend this class now.

544
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,660
I...

545
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,740
Jiuge,

546
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,900
have you finished the task of book copying
I assigned you last time?

547
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,140
Master,

548
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,900
here's the thing.

549
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,620
I was

550
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,220
busy forging that short knife,

551
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,300
so I was too tired to engage myself

552
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,140
in useless stuff such as book copying.

553
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,980
I beg your pardon.

554
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,740
Go back and copy the Weapon Theories

555
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,420
for five more times!

556
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,660
Let's go.

557
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,900
Class is dismissed.

558
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,660
Go! Go! Go!

559
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,860
Jiuge!

560
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,700
Jiuge,

561
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,780
the tournament is about to start.

562
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,700
Will you sign up?

563
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,180
Tournament?

564
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,380
Look at you! You got distracted in class again!

565
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,900
The tournament of the inseparable king birds

566
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,260
is held every ten years.

567
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,620
This year, far more students have signed up,

568
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,620
and they are more excited than ever.

569
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,020
What's so special about

570
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,300
this tournament?

571
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,780
Those signing up this year

572
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,420
are so excited because of the prize.

573
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,820
What's the prize?

574
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,540
It's the pimpon fruit.

575
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,420
The pimpon fruit?

576
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,180
There is a kind of tree named pimpon,

577
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,580
which blossoms once every ten years

578
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
and bears fruits once every ten years.

579
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,460
According to the age of the tree,

580
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,620
the fruits can have different uses.

581
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,380
Fruits of certain age

582
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,860
can not only make a mortal back to life,

583
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,460
but can also turn a mortal into an immortal.

584
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,140
Isn't that the pimpon fruit

585
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,980
which can save Ye Qingti?

586
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,220
Jiuge, what did you say?

587
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,740
I mean

588
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,180
I've heard that

589
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,500
the pimpon fruit is really rare.

590
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,780
The pimpon tree blooms every ten years

591
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
and bears fruits every ten years.

592
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,740
Moreover, each tree can only bear one fruit.

593
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,140
The effects of these fruits are different

594
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,900
according to their harvest time.

595
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
It's so precious!

596
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,900
So it is!

597
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,500
The pimpon tree used to be

598
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,580
one of the five magic trees in the Sky Kingdom.

599
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,940
Somehow,

600
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,500
these trees all stopped bearing fruits.

601
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,820
Now in heaven and on earth,

602
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,580
only the pimpon tree beside the Jieyou Spring
inside the Fanyin Valley can bear fruits.

603
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,020
Well,

604
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,540
what's the effect of this pimpon fruit?

605
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,980
I heard that as to the fruit this year,

606
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,140
for mortals, it can add flesh to bones

607
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,620
and resurrect the dead,

608
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,820
and for immortals, it can improve cultivation

609
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,300
and maintain youth and beauty forever.

610
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,620
Compared to the peach in the Sky Kingdom,

611
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,940
it's far better.

612
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,220
Add flesh to bones and resurrect the dead.

613
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,100
Right.

614
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,620
The bones can also be turned into an immortal body.

615
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,580
Then I'll go and sign up.

616
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,780
Jiuge,

617
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,660
it only works on mortals.

618
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,540
As an immortal,

619
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,340
it won't work on you.

620
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,700
Didn't you just say

621
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,340
by eating it, immortals can maintain youth and beauty forever?

622
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,300
I see.

623
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,300
However,

624
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,700
the students signing up this year are more than ever.

625
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,020
Due to limited competition place,

626
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,140
my mother has ordered Master to screen the candidates in advance.

627
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
Only by passing his test

628
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,260
can the candidates get to the final.

629
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,660
To be screened by Master.

630
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,340
Well,

631
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,260
I've offended him repeatedly.

632
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,660
He won't let me get to the final for sure.

633
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,020
Jiuge, what're you murmuring about?

634
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,740
Nothing.

635
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,260
I said I have to go and sign up.

636
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,020
The pimpon fruit?

637
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,060
It's extremely good

638
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,420
for neutralizing my dark energy.

639
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,820
If the pimpon fruit can really resurrect the dead,

640
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,380
Qingti, I'll definitely save you.

641
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,460
I know you've got nothing good for me.

642
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,100
You've followed the bad example of the ice face.

643
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,620
Now you even smile as wickedly as he is.

644
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,140
If you have the strength to yell,

645
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,860
you might as well copy more characters for me.

646
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,460
Remember to imitate my handwriting.

647
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,180
You are really demanding!

648
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,220
How come it's so thick?

649
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,580
Didn't Master only punish you to copy the book for ten times?

650
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,740
I've offended

651
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,380
that local tyrant.

652
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,340
Also,

653
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,660
in order to join the competition,

654
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,740
I can take temporary setbacks

655
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,140
to curry favor with him. Is that OK?

656
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,500
He asked me to copy the book for ten times.

657
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,580
I'll copy it for twenty times.

658
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,540
I'm kind of trying to please him.

659
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,740
Isn't it too implicit?

660
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,180
Really?

661
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,940
May Master Ji Han

662
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,580
live a long and happy life.

663
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,460
May Mater Ji Han

664
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,860
live a blessed and prosperous life.

665
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,700
What do you think? Will this please him?

666
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,940
If he doesn't feel like reading to the end,

667
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,140
you've wasted time writing these words.

668
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,540
Well,

669
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,780
then I'll put the disgusting flattery

670
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,700
in front.

671
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,740
What do you think?

672
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,060
I think it's OK.

673
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,380
Wait!

674
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,780
What on earth is his name?

675
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,220
Ji Han or Han Ji?

676
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,940
Isn't he called "Master"?

677
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,740
Does he have another name?

678
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,380
Your Majesty,

679
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,580
why do you summon me late at night?

680
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,940
It's for the Miaoyi Chasm.

681
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,140
Your Majesty, thanks to your righteousness,

682
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,060
after secluding yourself for seven days and seven nights,

683
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,580
you created the Miaoyi Chasm

684
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,940
at the cost of your own cultivation,

685
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,660
thus keeping the mortal realm safe
for hundreds of thousands of years.

686
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,140
Judged from Your Majesty's look,

687
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,740
is there anything wrong with the Miaoyi Chasm?

688
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,420
The Miaoyi Chasm quaked three hundred years ago.

689
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,220
I took many days to mend it,

690
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,020
only to postpone

691
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,380
its collapse.

692
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,540
How long can it last?

693
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,980
I don't know, either.

694
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,260
I invite you over

695
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,580
to work out a strategy.

696
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,540
If the Miaoyi Chasm collapses,

697
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,860
it will be a disaster for all men and gods.

698
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
It's a life-and-death matter of heaven and earth.

699
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,580
We must consider carefully before making a decision.

700
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,580
Exactly.

701
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,620
Ever-victorious General,

702
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,980
why are you so dispirited with your head down?

703
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,060
Are you missing Her Highness Fengjiu from Qingqiu?

704
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,140
Just like me.

705
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,620
Take good care of it.

706
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,620
Yes!

707
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,260
Meng!

708
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,780
Jiuge,

709
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,420
can you be more ladylike?

710
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,140
Can you walk like a lady?

711
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,420
What's wrong with the way I walk?

712
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,860
I do walk like a lady.

713
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:24,940
Forget it.

714
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,340
What can I do for you?

715
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,820
Meng,

716
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,500
do you know the name of Master?

717
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,060
Master?

718
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,420
Why do you suddenly ask me this?

719
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,180
You must have thought of a prank.

720
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,300
What're you talking about?

721
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,060
Am I so mischievous?

722
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,900
Do you know it or not?

723
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,700
I actually don't know his real name.

724
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,100
I've called him "Master" since childhood.

725
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,940
It's weird.

726
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,940
How come his name

727
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,340
is even more confidential

728
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,260
than a girl's name?

729
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,580
I don't believe that

730
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,100
no one

731
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,100
in the entire Imperial College

732
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
knows his name!

733
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,140
Just wait!

734
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,860
I'll ask whoever I see later.

735
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,300
I can definitely get his name.

736
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,140
Wish you good luck!

737
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,300
Your Majesty,

738
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,140
Immortal Official Chong Lin, the Chief Immortal Messenger
of Tai Chen Palace has sent the word that

739
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,660
the tea class scheduled tomorrow

740
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,940
will be taught by another immortal official.

741
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,660
Busy as immortal official is,

742
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,620
we feel honored that he's willing to give a lecture in our clan.

743
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,980
Inform the Master. Ask him to arrange it properly.

744
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,380
Yes.

745
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,260
Isn't that His Majesty?

746
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:10,980
Yes.

747
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,140
Since His Majesty is gonna give the lecture

748
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,100
in the Fanyin Valley as usual,

749
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,340
why do you ask me to give the lecture about tea on his behalf?

750
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,780
Here's the thing.

751
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,500
Last night, His Majesty and His Highness Lian Song
discussed something important.

752
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,060
I thought he wouldn't come,

753
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,980
so I asked you to give the lecture on his behalf as usual.

754
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,580
I didn't expect

755
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,980
His Majesty would come.

756
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,780
With the Eight Deserts and Six Directions to be concerned about,

757
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,220
His Majesty even remembers to give a lecture.

758
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,540
The world is so blessed to have him as the emperor.

759
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,820
Your Excellency, sorry for bothering you.

760
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,180
Now that His Majesty is here in person,

761
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,060
Your Excellency may as well go back to the Sky Kingdom.

762
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,060
See you.

763
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,740
His Majesty didn't ask me to accompany him this time.

764
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,340
He actually went there alone.

765
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,780
Is he not here

766
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,580
for the Miaoyi Chasm?

767
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,780
OK. OK. OK.

768
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,900
Hurry up! Hurry up!

769
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,460
That's all?

770
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,020
Yes.

771
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,740
Princess Jielu,

772
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,060
I wonder why you set

773
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,020
these traps.

774
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:41,620
Right.

775
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,260
Haven't you heard Master yesterday?

776
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,340
Today, an immortal official

777
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,740
good at tea theories will give a lecture about tea instead.

778
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,820
I want to use these traps

779
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,260
to scare him away.

780
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,540
But if he's scared away,

781
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,020
no one will give us the lecture.

782
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,740
That's exactly what I want.

783
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
In that way,

784
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
the lecture can be given by the original master.

785
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,460
Right!

786
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,460
Your Highness, you're so clever.

787
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,780
Clever?

788
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,900
I find her too naive.

789
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,220
I wonder who on earth

790
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,180
that beloved and respected master is.

791
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:09,980
Give me a hand.

792
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,740
I know you love him deeply,

793
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,660
but he pays no attention to you.

794
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,580
You're as far apart as heaven and earth.

795
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,060
By doing so,

796
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,900
he might be annoyed

797
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,220
and may never give lectures in our clan again.

798
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,700
It's fine if he stops giving lectures here.

799
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,540
But if my mother wants to punish you for that,

800
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,140
don't blame me for not interceding for you.

801
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,860
If Her Majesty blames me,

802
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,740
I'll accept the punishment myself.

803
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,100
I don't need your help.

804
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,060
Then do you know

805
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,900
he's got a lover

806
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,420
in the Sky Kingdom.

807
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,580
When did that happen?

808
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,060
How come I've never heard about it?

809
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,500
I heard that though they haven't performed
the heaven-worshipping ritual,

810
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,020
he treats that fairy as his wife.

811
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,540
He not only treasures and favors her,

812
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,460
but sleeps and shares a bath with her.

813
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,580
Why are you crying?

814
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,500
Speaking of dandies in the Sky Kingdom,

815
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,220
Lian Song, the Third Prince of the Heavenly King,
is the most famous.

816
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,900
But I've heard nothing about him

817
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,860
sleeping and sharing a bath with a woman
before performing the heaven-worshipping ritual.

818
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,580
Which immortal official on earth is so wild and absurd?

819
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,260
It's quite impressive actually.

820
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,780
Stop crying!

821
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,660
I suck at dealing with girl's tears.

822
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,940
If you stop crying,

823
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,020
I'll help you set the trap, OK?

824
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,540
I'll also cover for you in front of my mother.

825
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,820
You said that on purpose.

826
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,940
You love the Princess of Qingqiu secretly,

827
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,900
but your love is not responded,

828
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,900
so you hope that everyone in the world

829
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,820
can end up alone

830
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,700
and unaccompanied like you are.

831
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,740
Stop talking nonsense!

832
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,180
You're the one who talked nonsense!

833
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,860
Noble and unsullied as master is,

834
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,180
how could he do that?

835
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,220
I don't believe you!

836
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,660
Not a word!

837
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,180
Why is Her Highness crying?

838
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,740
Unbelievable!

839
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,220
The Princess of Qingqiu?

840
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,900
I didn't expect that in such a remote place,

841
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,020
there's still a young man so dejected

842
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,580
because of my aunt!

843
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,820
Awesome!

844
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,580
Jiuge,

845
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,620
come here.

846
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,300
Meng, what's up?

847
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:38,860
What's wrong?

848
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,020
You told me you're quite familiar with

849
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,700
setting traps.

850
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:42,940
Help me check this out.

851
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,740
To me,

852
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,460
Jielu's sketch has many flaws.

853
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,780
Now that she wants to set a trap,

854
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,820
we'd better make sure
the substitute teacher won't be able to get out

855
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,740
for two or three days to give the lecture

856
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,220
once he falls into the trap.

857
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,820
Let me see!

858
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,540
Look.

859
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,380
Here.

860
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,980
It's too rough.

861
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,660
Just remove it.

862
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,500
Also, here.

863
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,860
Practice a magic art here

864
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,900
to link it with the Sixing River,

865
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,300
and then just cover it up.

866
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,220
Later when he falls into the trap,

867
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,820
we won't be able to see him for over ten days.

868
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,660
Is that too ruthless?

869
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,100
If he blames us after going back,

870
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,660
what should we do?

871
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,540
What about this?

872
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,860
Fill the bottom of the pit with lethargy formula.

873
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,020
Make sure to cover it up tightly.

874
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,180
Once he falls into the pit,

875
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,540
he can sleep for as long as three days and three nights.

876
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,540
But it's also troublesome when he condemns us after waking up.

877
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,780
What can we do?

878
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,620
What about making him drift down

879
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,140
the Sixing River?
