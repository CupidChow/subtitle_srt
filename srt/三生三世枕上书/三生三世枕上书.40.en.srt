1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 40

3
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,940
They really dance well.

4
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,460
Right.

5
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,180
Would you like to have a taste of anything beside you?

6
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,260
No.

7
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,500
I've had too many walnuts.

8
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,820
Shen Ye,

9
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,060
shall not we have a drink

10
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,020
at such a good night?

11
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,300
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

12
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,860
Let's have it.

13
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,340
Why isn't Lord Xi Ze here tonight?

14
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,260
And Changdi isn't here, either.

15
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,620
Is it because she doesn't dare to see me?

16
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,940
Lord Xi Ze has something important to do,

17
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,900
so he is out for one day.

18
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,060
As for Changdi...

19
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,020
She's coming while we're talking about her.

20
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,220
Father. Mother.

21
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,740
Since we're admiring the moon and stars,

22
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,420
I'd like to play a song.

23
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,740
I wish father and mother

24
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,660
can live a happy life ever after.

25
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,540
Third Princess's filial piety is rare and commendable.

26
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,980
How sweet she is!

27
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,340
Shen Ye,

28
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,180
it's the Yueling-flower-made cake
especially baked by the imperial cook.

29
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,500
Have a taste.

30
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,860
No need.

31
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,460
You don't like it?

32
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Then try this one.

33
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,220
Plum-made cake.

34
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,620
No need.

35
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,820
It's so boring here.

36
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,060
It occurred to me that I have something else to deal with.

37
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,260
I'm leaving first.

38
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,700
Take a message to His Majesty for me.

39
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,740
Shen Ye.

40
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,980
Shen Ye.

41
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,340
What's wrong with Lord Shen Ye tonight?

42
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,620
He may have something to brood over.

43
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,540
Changdi played the Guqin very well.

44
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,540
Aranya,

45
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,780
come here.

46
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,020
Mother.

47
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,460
Why isn't Lord Xi Ze here?

48
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,260
I have no idea

49
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,620
where Lord Xi Ze is going.

50
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,900
Maybe he's delayed

51
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,220
by something on his way,

52
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,140
which happens all the time.

53
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,780
You don't have to worry about him, mother.

54
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,660
Mother,

55
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,060
I know where Lord Xi Ze is going.

56
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,020
Lord Xi Ze is going to the Mount Shikong
to take Herb of Michel Galingale.

57
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,860
Aranya has no idea about where Lord Xi Ze is going,

58
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,380
while you know it clearer than she does.

59
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,300
Mother,

60
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm worrying that Junuo hasn't yet been cured,

61
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,300
so I asked Lord Xi Ze

62
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,180
to go to the Mount Shikong for Herb of Michel Galingale.

63
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,180
Lord Xi Ze said I rarely asked him for something,

64
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,700
so he would go there to fulfill my wish.

65
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,340
Maybe he's gone there in a hurry,

66
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,820
so he forgot to say goodbye to Aranya.

67
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,340
That's the reason why Aranya doesn't know.

68
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,100
Since it's for taking the medicine for Junuo,

69
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
it doesn't matter whether or not I know it.

70
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,180
It's so rare for you to be so generous for once.

71
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,940
But the Mount Shikong is steep,

72
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,100
and the spiritual beasts
that guard Herb of Michel Galingale are extremely fierce.

73
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,020
If Lord Xi Ze got hurt,

74
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,980
I would feel sorry for you.

75
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,300
Lord Xi Ze always has strong magic power,

76
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,460
so he shouldn't be hurt by one or two spiritual beasts.

77
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,060
You've worried too much.

78
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:33,940
You...

79
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,700
It's fine.

80
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,260
It'll be enough for us to wait for Lord Xi Ze to come back.

81
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,140
I've heard that pharmacist seems to

82
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,940
have some treasure to present.

83
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,340
Report to you, Your Majesty.

84
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,740
I've heard from Your Majesty that

85
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,020
the three princesses' constitution is cold and cool.

86
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,700
I've got some Jibai fruits recently,

87
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,940
and requested medical apprentices to make congee with them.

88
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,180
I intend to present the congee to princesses
to help condition their cold and cool constitution.

89
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,220
Please make the decision

90
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,380
whether to present it right now or not, Your Majesty.

91
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,460
Jibai fruits?

92
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,060
Aranya can't eat them these days.

93
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,260
It's windy at night.

94
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,580
You didn't even wear a coat.

95
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,340
Your Majesty, I come back late.

96
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,420
Lord Xi Ze,

97
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,940
is everything okay all along the way?

98
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,140
It's fine.

99
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Then my wife and I will be relieved.

100
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,140
Aranya's just been hurt in the serpentine cage,

101
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,980
so she can't be on her knees for too long.

102
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,940
Well,

103
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,940
you help Aranya back to her seat.

104
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,140
Changdi, go back to your seat.

105
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,540
This is my tea cup.

106
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,140
Yours is also mine.

107
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,860
I see no difference.

108
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,660
Come on.

109
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,500
Drink it off.

110
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,500
What's it?

111
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,620
You made it?

112
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,100
You can really cook, can't you?

113
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,500
I watched Chacha

114
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,460
cooking it in the kitchen.

115
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,540
Lord Xi Ze, you've said just now that

116
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,620
Aranya can't eat Jibai fruits recently.

117
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,020
Why is it?

118
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,060
Aranya's been using Herb of Michel Galingale

119
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,220
whose effect exactly goes against that of Jibai fruits.

120
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,060
She can't bear it.

121
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,540
Why don't I know that I'm using Herb of Michel Galingale?

122
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,980
It's in your bowl.

123
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,620
Isn't it the fish soup with ginger slices?

124
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,660
Herb of Michel Galingale is located
where Yin Qi is extremely prime,

125
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
and it's fishy.

126
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,860
So you use the fishy smell of fishes

127
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,740
to cover the smell of Herb of Michel Galingale.

128
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,260
And then you use ginger slices
to counteract the fishy smell of fishes.

129
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,780
Almost.

130
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,460
But I think if you want to

131
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,460
cover the fishy smell of Herb of Michel Galingale,

132
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,300
you can also use the smell of mutton.

133
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,180
Fine,

134
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
I'll try next time.

135
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,340
Your Highness,

136
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,820
it's not merely a cuisine

137
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,620
but an extremely valuable medicine.

138
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,940
Then it means you didn't

139
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,020
get Herb of Michel Galingale for Junuo,

140
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,500
did you?

141
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,580
If it weren't for Aranya,

142
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,460
why should I go all the way to the Mount Shikong

143
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,620
that is precipitous

144
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,620
and far away from here?

145
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,300
I've checked on Elder Princess.

146
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,340
She's almost cured.

147
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,460
It's Aranya whom

148
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,940
I'm worried too much about.

149
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,060
So that's it.

150
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,460
Are you out of your mind?

151
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,900
We were almost strangers to each other days ago.

152
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,020
Have you really lost your mind?

153
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,940
It's because

154
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,980
I tried that hard to go down the mountain

155
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,220
while you didn't come to me.

156
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,220
It's you who didn't come to me.

157
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,500
You were accompanying Junuo.

158
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,500
I did come to you,

159
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,980
but you seemed as if

160
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,300
you hadn't noticed me at all.

161
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,100
You were always by the side of your master, Su Moye,

162
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,220
so I ignored you on purpose.

163
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,660
Aren't you...

164
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
I'm jealous.

165
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,500
Lord Xi Ze,

166
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,180
you can't blacken my name.

167
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,500
Meteors. There're meteors.

168
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,340
See.

169
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,220
Meteors!

170
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,100
Meteors?

171
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,460
Meteors!

172
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,060
It's a good omen.

173
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,780
It's so beautiful.

174
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,380
Aranya,

175
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,660
I want to see meteors like this with you so much.

176
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,700
But

177
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,700
I always think she's not you.

178
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,460
Now,

179
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,380
both Xi Ze and Su Moye care so much for her.

180
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,140
She doesn't even notice me.

181
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,260
Moye,

182
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,180
do you find

183
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,020
there's anything wrong with several persons today?

184
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,300
What do you mean?

185
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,740
Such as Changdi,

186
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,500
who always values her fame so much,

187
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
why did she blacken her name on her own

188
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,980
in front of all?

189
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,540
If she does love Lord Xi Ze,

190
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,300
won't it be better that

191
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,580
she says it out to His Majesty directly?

192
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm afraid Changdi had already mentioned it to His Majesty,

193
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,380
but she didn't make it.

194
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,340
Either

195
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,620
His Majesty didn't mention it to Xi Ze,

196
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,580
or His Majesty mentioned,

197
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,300
but Xi Ze refused.

198
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,500
What happened today

199
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,660
might be the scam Changdi made,

200
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,660
since she is so eager to get married.

201
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,420
How hard she schemed!

202
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,420
However,

203
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,100
she dishonored me in front of everyone,

204
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,620
which exactly solved the problem for me.

205
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,980
What do you mean?

206
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,940
I'm worrying

207
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,900
if there's one day

208
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,740
when Lord Xi Ze requests to sleep with me,

209
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,060
how can I refuse him?

210
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,180
But now, I won't need to

211
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,020
worry about it anymore,

212
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,580
if Lord Xi Ze marries Changdi.

213
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,380
Don't you think

214
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,820
Lord Xi Ze treats you with all his heart,

215
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,060
since he ventured into taking Herb of Michel Galingale for you?

216
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,900
It's true.

217
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,900
I've never imagined

218
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,180
that he treated Aranya so well.

219
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,260
It seemed how you thought of him before

220
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,740
isn't all right.

221
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,180
But I'm wondering

222
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,340
why Lord Xi Ze left so fast

223
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,540
when the banquet was over.

224
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,500
He's

225
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,860
going to learn to cook congee for someone.

226
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,620
It's so strange of him!

227
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,180
Let it go. Leave him alone.

228
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,060
Let's go.

229
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,100
Please go to the painted pleasure boat
between seven to nine o'clock in the morning.

230
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,180
I have something to talk with you.

231
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,740
From Aranya.

232
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,900
Between seven to nine o'clock in the morning?

233
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,620
How does it go?

234
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,940
Her Highness Aranya and Su Moye

235
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,180
have returned to their places respectively.

236
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,780
That's great.

237
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,060
Are you clear what I've asked you to do?

238
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,940
Yes, I am.

239
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,500
Then take action separately.

240
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,700
Yes.

241
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,860
You don't have to keep watching tonight.

242
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,300
Have a good sleep.

243
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,580
Your Highness,

244
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,740
you can finally get what you want.

245
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,380
Have a sleep,

246
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,260
Xiaobai.

247
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,380
Lord Xi Ze.

248
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,700
It's strange.

249
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,660
Why do I smell the fragrance of sandalwood incense?

250
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,700
Chacha.

251
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Chacha.

252
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,580
You Highness, you wake up.

253
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,860
You Highness, have a cup of tea to rinse your mouth.

254
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,260
Your Highness,

255
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,100
where is Lord Xi Ze?

256
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,540
Lord Xi Ze?

257
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,580
He's in his room.

258
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,900
No. No. No.

259
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,740
Lord Xi Ze did come here yesterday night,

260
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,260
and accompanied Your Highness to sleep.

261
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,260
It's I who welcomed him.

262
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,020
What?

263
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,660
He stayed here last night?

264
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,380
Of course, he did.

265
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,260
Wasn't there anything

266
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,300
happening to you?

267
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,060
What should happen?

268
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,500
It's just...

269
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,060
when I looked at Lord Xi Ze,

270
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,460
I thought

271
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,820
he'd like to

272
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,340
sleep...

273
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,420
sleep with Your Highness.

274
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,940
What?

275
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,740
Wasn't there anything happening to you indeed?

276
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,060
What's wrong with you, Your Highness?

277
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,940
How come I feel dizzy in a sudden?

278
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Are you okay?

279
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,180
Junuo, time's up.

280
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,300
Be patient.

281
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,100
It's like brewing tea,

282
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,860
which needs perfect duration and degree of heating,

283
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,660
and right timing.

284
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,300
It won't work either too early or late.

285
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,060
What I need is to make everything perfect.

286
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,260
I worked so hard to make her poisoned
with the acacia-made liquid.

287
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,780
Why shouldn't I be in a hurry?

288
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,620
I truly don't understand

289
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,220
why Lord Xi Ze treats Aranya so specially.

290
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,300
Isn't she a dirty pussy

291
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,660
born in the snake pit?

292
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,820
If he were to see

293
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,860
Aranya hook up with someone else,

294
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,700
do you think he would still
give the special treatment to her anymore?

295
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,780
You're right.

296
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,980
As long as Aranya is convicted of the crime of adultery,

297
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,420
I will wait and see how she'll defend herself

298
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,580
under such a great sin.

299
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,660
If we want to beat her down,

300
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,300
and give her no chance

301
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,740
to turn the table but die forever,

302
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,140
it'll be the best move.

303
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,780
Your Highness.

304
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,620
Chacha.

305
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,180
Mr. Su.

306
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,060
Is Her Highness all right?

307
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,500
I don't know.

308
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,540
Her Highness fell in a faint in a sudden.

309
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,660
It's almost the time.

310
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,780
You leave first.

311
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,540
It's in public

312
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,940
that she humiliated us yesterday night.

313
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,820
How is it enough that just two of us go there?

314
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,100
Someone, come here.

315
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,980
You guys, follow me.

316
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,500
Yes.

317
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,580
What are you coming for?

318
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,940
Someone, come here.

319
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,580
Take the maid down.

320
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,780
Seal her mouth. Don't let her shout.

321
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,660
Yes.

322
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,500
You.

323
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,380
Your Highness.

324
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,980
It seems it's the right timing you have mentioned.

325
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,940
Aranya, Aranya,

326
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,820
you won't expect that you can have the ending like today.

327
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,060
Aranya.

328
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,900
Aranya.

329
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,660
Junuo,

330
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,980
isn't this the outfit of Mr. Su?

331
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,020
It looks like his.

332
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,900
Is Mr. Su

333
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,940
behind the bed curtain?

334
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,820
Aranya, come out.

335
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,700
How dare you hook up

336
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
with your master in broad daylight?

337
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,780
Even nonentities know better to protect their name than you do.

338
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,380
Don't you know how much your acts
will disgrace the name of the imperial family?

339
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,060
Junuo, what should we do?

340
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,660
Someone, come here.

341
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,660
Go invite His Majesty and Lord Xi Ze here.

342
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,100
You should say that something important is happening,

343
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,100
so you go invite them.

344
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,100
Yes.

345
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,180
You surround the boat,

346
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,820
and don't allow anyone to leave.

347
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,740
Yes.

348
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,460
How dare they!

349
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,780
Father.

350
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,500
- What's up? - Father,

351
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,100
I don't want to bother you indeed,

352
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,100
but Aranya and Mr. Su have a secret affair

353
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,380
and illicit intercourse

354
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,660
regardless of the master-apprentice ethic.

355
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,140
They're on the bed now.

356
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,180
Father,

357
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,780
it's the first time Junuo and I
come across the situation like this.

358
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,900
We're too scared

359
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,020
to do anything.

360
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,980
What's happening?

361
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,460
Why are you all

362
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,380
gathering in the our room so early in the morning?

363
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,620
I...

364
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
It's too noisy.

365
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,460
Aranya hasn't woken up.

366
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,260
I'll take her away first.

367
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,020
I'll give you a detailed result

368
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,340
after I fully investigate the whole thing.

369
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,900
He's not Xi Ze.

370
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,140
He's definitely Su Moye.

371
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,740
Su Moye's transformation skill is so excellent

372
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,620
that even you may not be able to recognize him.

373
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,900
You have to trust me.

374
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,900
Stop saying.

375
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,060
Lord Xi Ze,

376
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,860
what's wrong with Her Highness Aranya?

377
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,420
There may be

378
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,580
some misunderstanding.

379
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,060
I'll take Aranya to my place first.

380
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,100
Your Majesty,

381
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,420
I haven't expected

382
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,220
you're also here.

383
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,860
Mr. Su,

384
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,780
why do you come here?

385
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,940
Here is the thing.

386
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,940
I received a letter yesterday,

387
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,980
the signature of which is Aranya.

388
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,820
It says I'm invited to the painted pleasure boat
between seven to nine o'clock in the morning.

389
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,380
But it's I who taught Aranya to write.

390
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,900
Others may not be able to

391
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,020
recognize whether it's her handwriting,

392
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,980
but I can definitely distinguish the difference.

393
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,340
So I intend to inquire Aranya

394
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,900
when it's proper.

395
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I didn't expect that Your Majesty

396
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,860
has come to visit her with the two princesses.

397
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,260
It's I who didn't come at the right timing.

398
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,220
Father, don't trust him.

399
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,340
He's talking nonsense.

400
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,860
On this kind of thing...

401
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,660
Your Highness, you... you can't treat me unjustly.

402
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,660
I have another letter

403
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,500
written by you.

404
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,380
Go back.

405
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,900
You wake up so soon.

406
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,820
Do you feel well?

407
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,020
Why do you ask me like this, Moye?

408
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,580
What happened?

409
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,380
Changdi and Junuo

410
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,780
wrote a letter to me in your handwriting.

411
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,580
It says to invite me to your painted pleasure boat.

412
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,780
But I found the truth later.

413
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,380
What do you mean?

414
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,100
Although they tried so hard to imitate Aranya's handwriting,

415
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,060
I can still identify

416
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,820
the extremely subtle difference.

417
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,300
Later Chacha came to me,

418
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,420
and she said there's something wrong with you.

419
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,180
Then I finally knew that you were poisoned
with the acacia-made liquid.

420
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,380
The acacia-made liquid?

421
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,780
Exactly.

422
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,460
I didn't expect they'd have played

423
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,940
such a dirty trick.

424
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,500
What happened later?

425
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,100
Later,

426
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,940
I went to Lord Xi Ze's place.

427
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,260
Since it happened,

428
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,820
we should just countermine it.

429
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,180
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

430
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,140
What they want to see is that you and Aranya stay together,

431
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,860
but what if the one they see is me?

432
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,180
So,

433
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,420
you mean that

434
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,380
we should exchange

435
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,260
to make their scheme fail,

436
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,340
which can be counted as a punishment.

437
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,620
We should exchange,

438
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,380
but it's not enough.

439
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,820
Do you know how to act perfect?

440
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,260
So...

441
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,780
when Changdi and Junuo came to catch us

442
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,380
with His Majesty,

443
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,220
they found the one in your room

444
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,820
was Lord Xi Ze.

445
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,820
This is the whole story.

446
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,700
You mean, you went to find Xi Ze for help,

447
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,140
and told him the whole story.

448
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,060
Then he countermined to pretend to be you

449
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,540
and played along with them.

450
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,140
Exactly.

451
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,740
And he also

452
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,420
decocted a dose of medicinal herbs for you

453
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,740
to steady your soul,

454
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,020
which can help you defend the poison of the acacia-made liquid.

455
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,940
But how can Xi Ze

456
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,220
fight against Junuo and Changdi for me?

457
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,740
It's too perplexing.

458
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,260
But

459
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,100
it's the first time

460
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,300
I've been wronged over and over since I grew up.

461
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,220
Everything is fine.

462
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,900
I heard that Changdi and Junuo

463
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,220
were grounded by His Majesty,

464
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,500
which is what they deserve.

465
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,620
But why am I in the room of Xi Ze?

466
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,060
The situation was too complicated at that time,

467
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
and your poison hadn't been detoxicated.

468
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,180
So he hugged you to his place for a rest.

469
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
That's it.

470
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,260
We finally return to the capital city.

471
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,780
I'm going to my mansion first to deal with some business.

472
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,340
Tell me

473
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,260
if you don't feel well. Understand?

474
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,700
Sure.

475
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,660
Don't worry too much about me.

476
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Well, I'm leaving first.

477
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,060
Let's go.

478
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,340
Excuse me. Excuse me.

479
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,980
Lord Shen Ye.

480
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,100
Your Highness, are you okay?

481
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,860
I'm fine.

482
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,500
They deserve the punishment.

483
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,980
His Majesty should punish them severely,

484
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,500
since they bullied us.

485
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,820
It will be the same whether
they make mistakes or not.

486
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,980
There won't be severe results for them this time,

487
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,260
since they are beloved daughters of His Majesty.

488
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,740
Forget it.

489
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,380
Let's go.

490
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,380
Certainly

491
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,060
it's the most comfortable place for me.

492
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,540
It's so lucky that Lord Xi Ze has dealt with Qing.

493
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,060
I have nothing else to worry about.

494
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,140
Your Highness.

495
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,180
Your Highness.

496
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,660
Have you bought plum wine that I asked for?

497
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,700
Your Highness,

498
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,100
there's something wrong in the imperial palace.

499
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,980
What's going on?

500
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,420
Princess Junuo was sentenced to a penalty of decapitation.

501
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,660
while Princess Changdi was condemned to exile.

502
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,100
How...

503
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,980
How could it happen?

504
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,180
Haven't they just been grounded?

505
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
His Majesty and Her Majesty favor them so much.

506
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,260
Your Highness,

507
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,460
they're not sentenced because of the acacia-made liquid thing.

508
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,020
So what's for?

509
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,140
Rumor from the imperial palace has it that

510
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,900
Princess Junuo broke the code of conduct that
women should abide by,

511
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,380
and she had an affair with the master who taught her to write.

512
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,100
She concealed the fact of her pregnancy until now.

513
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,820
His Majesty was furious

514
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
so that Princess Junuo was sentenced
to a penalty of decapitation,

515
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,420
and she was also eliminated from the book of merits.

516
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,900
She will be executed soon.

517
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,420
Commit adultery?

518
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,580
But Princess Junuo had been engaged

519
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,540
with Shen Ye long before, hadn't she?

520
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,260
Why did she have an affair with her master?

521
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,660
It's no longer a secret

522
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,060
that Princess Junuo has been pregnant,
although she isn't married.

523
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,100
That's the reason why Immortal Lord Xi Ze was invited
to go downhill to take care of her in person,

524
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,020
when Princess Junuo was hurt earlier.

525
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,340
I haven't figured it out

526
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,300
why they say her pregnancy is due to committing adultery,

527
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,420
and the infant to-be-born isn't the next archmage.

528
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,620
What about Changdi?

529
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Princess Changdi

530
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,740
was exiled to a wasteland

531
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,340
to ponder upon her faults by His Majesty,

532
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
because she broke one of His Majesty's favorite lamps days ago.

533
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,220
But His Majesty favors Changdi so much,

534
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,420
how could he exile her

535
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,660
just because she broke a lamp?

536
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,020
It's too weird.

537
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,820
It happened in a sudden,

538
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
so the situation wouldn't be so simple.

539
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,940
Chacha, go investigate it deeper.

540
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,900
Yes.

541
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,940
The adultery thing of Junuo

542
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,580
was exposed on 17th, April earlier.

543
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,660
But it's 27th, March,

544
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,180
which is twenty days sharp earlier than before.

545
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,660
Isn't it...

546
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,220
Your Majesty,

547
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,620
you come in time.

548
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,420
The news from the imperial palace

549
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,820
is too surprising.

550
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,700
I dare guess that

551
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,740
what happened to Junuo

552
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,180
is because you want to take advantage of Xiangli Que

553
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,020
to punish Junuo severely.

554
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,460
You're right.

555
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,100
So it's the perfect action

556
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,260
that Your Majesty mentioned earlier.

557
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,660
Your Majesty, I mean, you've already known

558
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,060
the secret of the imperial family

559
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,620
of the inseparable king birds of this generation.

560
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,140
The secret of the imperial family,

561
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,140
does it matter

562
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,940
whether I know it or not?

563
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,420
I need to return to the immortal palace
to deal with some business.

564
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,700
Please take care of Xiaobai for me

565
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,060
during the days when I'm not here.

566
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,420
Add these to her daily diet

567
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,180
and nurse her carefully.

568
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,260
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

569
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,140
I don't deserve the name

570
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,820
of being the most brilliant one all over the West Sea,

571
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,660
since I failed to take Emperor Dong Hua into account,

572
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,100
though I have pondered it over and over.

573
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,020
No,

574
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,580
Junuo can't die.

575
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,660
I can only

576
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,380
count on Fengjiu.

577
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,340
Your Highness,

578
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,220
have the congee.

579
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,940
Your Highness.

580
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,660
Moye,

581
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,420
you come in time. Let's have the meal together.

582
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,260
Mr. Su.

583
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,660
No, thanks.

584
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,620
I have something important

585
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,140
to discuss with you.

586
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,500
Chacha,

587
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,460
you leave first.

588
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
What are you doing?

589
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,260
What's it?

590
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,580
Lord Xi Ze asked me

591
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,060
to make you have it.

592
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,340
It's Xi Ze again.

593
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,620
Have you told me that

594
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,260
he and Aranya were a couple in name only, haven't you?

595
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,220
They were less a couple

596
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,660
than friends between generations.

597
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,100
Lord Xi Ze desired nothing,

598
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,620
but how he treated Aranya

599
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,540
better deserved the name of a master

600
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,620
than how I did.

601
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,260
Are you sure?

602
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,980
Is the one you mentioned

603
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
the same Xi Ze who had entangled relationships with

604
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,860
both Changdi and Junuo,

605
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,700
but acted nice to me recently?

606
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,820
Now that the place is the rebuilt one,

607
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,700
there may occur some problems during the process.

608
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,980
It's possible that there may exist some problems

609
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,500
that lead to some changes

610
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,700
in the personality of Xi Ze.

611
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,980
But the previous Xi Ze

612
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,940
did desire nothing.

613
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,860
Then do you have some methods

614
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,660
to make him be whom he used to?

615
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,980
I really don't like how he acts now.

616
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,140
No, I don't.

617
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,420
Well,

618
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,180
come on. Eat up the congee.

619
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,260
I have something important to tell you.

620
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,060
Why can I taste the smell of blood again?

621
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,700
Let it go.

622
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,020
I feel better

623
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,580
after I have the congee for days.

624
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,580
Well,

625
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,220
what do you want to tell me?

626
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,660
You've heard that

627
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,700
Junuo will be sentenced to a penalty of decapitation,
haven't you?

628
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,540
Yes, I have.

629
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,060
No matter what mistakes Junuo has made,

630
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,900
as her parents,

631
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,980
shouldn't His Majesty and Her Majesty cover up for her?

632
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,900
Why does His Majesty

633
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,420
guillotine her directly?

634
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,380
In fact,

635
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,060
Junuo isn't His Majesty Xiangli Que's biological daughter.

636
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,540
Don't you always want to know the story

637
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,780
of the siblings?

638
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,940
I can tell you now.

639
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,940
It's said that

640
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,940
Xiangli Que got the throne by killing his brother.

641
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,780
His beloved Madam Qing Hua

642
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,300
was originally the wife of his brother, Xiangli Yin.

643
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,380
Madam Qing Hua was supposed to suicide after her husband died,

644
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,220
but she had already conceived Junuo.
She couldn't bear to do that.

645
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,580
Besides, Xiangli Que worshiped Qing Hua so much

646
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,820
that he spared Junuo.

647
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,140
Then Madam Qing Hua remarried Xiangli Que.

648
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,860
So Junuo's biological father is Xiangli Yin?

649
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,900
Exactly.

650
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,020
Sparing Junuo

651
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,060
was the last thing

652
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,300
that Xiangli Que expected to do that very year.

653
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,020
Xiangli Que wanted to kill Junuo long before.

654
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,140
It's disappointing that Junuo unexpectedly

655
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,780
had illicit intercourse with her master.

656
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,060
Although Madam Qing Hua had tried her best

657
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,100
to cover up for Junuo

658
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,580
and schemed to make the baby she was conceiving

659
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,620
pretend to be the next archmage.

660
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,020
But what happened between

661
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,500
you and Xi Ze this time

662
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,500
hindered the plan of Junuo and Madam Qing Hua,

663
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,180
which gave the chance to Xiangli Que

664
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,500
to find the proof.
