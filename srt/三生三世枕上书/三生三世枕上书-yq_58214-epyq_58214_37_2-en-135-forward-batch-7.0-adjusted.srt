1
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 2

3
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,040
Are you going to place it or not?

4
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,360
A complete stick of incense has burnt out.

5
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
Greetings, Your Majesty!

6
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,560
Greetings, Your Majesty!

7
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
No regret about a placed chess piece.

8
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Third Prince,

9
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,600
wouldn't it be a bit disgraceful for you

10
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,000
to play with such a rummy trick?

11
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,880
Playing chess is just like leading an army for a fight.

12
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,120
The essence of military strategy is
to be ever-changing and unpredictable.

13
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,520
You lose!

14
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,440
Alright!

15
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,200
You mentioned His Majesty just now.

16
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,880
I was wondering if you have any idea

17
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,000
why His Majesty visited the Imperial Kitchen

18
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,400
so frequently in recent days?

19
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,440
So there are things in Tai Chen Palace

20
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
that you don't know.

21
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,880
Yeah!

22
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,200
Quite a lot!

23
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
I can tell you the things

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
about His Majesty.

25
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,080
What about Lord Cheng Yu?

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,720
Let's exchange what we know. I'm all ears now.

27
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,920
OK.

28
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,560
Do you know that

29
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,160
His Majesty has fallen in love with
cooking skills recently?

30
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,000
Cooking skills?

31
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,880
What a hobby it is for His Majesty!

32
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,000
I suppose His Majesty

33
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,520
must have extraordinary cooking skills.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,080
Not quite!

35
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,760
His Majesty's cooking skills

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,950
must be surprisingly stunning!

37
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,600
No Emperors in history ever stepped into the kitchen.

38
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,240
His Majesty is so outstanding.

39
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
But it is indeed his style.

40
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
The lotus flower will bloom

41
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,840
in a few days.

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,880
The Emperor wants everyone to gather at Tai Chen Palace

43
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,240
and discuss the scriptures together.

44
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,520
We'll be able to

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,040
observe His Majesty's cooking skills by then.

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,960
However,

47
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,240
we need to wait for some more days.

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
But His Majesty has invited me

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,560
to Tai Chen Palace

50
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,200
to have a taste in advance.

51
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,280
How about you going together with me

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
so that you can have a try

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,520
of His Majesty's cooking beforehand?

54
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,760
Thank you for that, Third Prince!

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,760
No problem!

56
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,680
I should be thankful to you.

57
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,360
Let's go!

58
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,200
Thank me?

59
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,360
Si Ming was so excited to

60
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
have tasted His Majesty's cooking

61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
that he passed out!

62
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,960
I didn't want him to come, but he insisted.

63
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,560
Look how impolite you are

64
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,520
in front of His Majesty!

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm so speechless to you!

66
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,640
Come and help!

67
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,840
Don't you know His Majesty's cooking?

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,900
Don't just stand there and watch!

69
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,380
Guards!

70
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,480
Hurry up!

71
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,520
Help Si Ming stand up!

72
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
So the early bird does catch the worm.

73
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,360
I surprisingly came across His Majesty
early in the morning!

74
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
He...

75
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,600
He...

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,360
He smiled.

77
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,000
What are you looking at?

78
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
His Majesty just smiled.

79
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
Who's got the bad luck?

80
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,560
Bad luck?

81
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,600
Just remember

82
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,200
nothing good will happen

83
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
if His Majesty smiles.

84
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,320
No way!

85
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,800
That's not true for someone as good as His Majesty.

86
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,280
Go!

87
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,320
You'll get scolded if you don't wait on them.

88
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,920
Si Ming!

89
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,440
Si Ming!

90
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
Poisonous! Poisonous!

91
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,040
Si Ming!

92
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,560
Third Prince!

93
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,720
We've been on good terms

94
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,960
for hundreds of thousands of years.

95
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,480
Why would you harm me like this?

96
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,720
Si Ming,

97
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,320
you have to go to hell.

98
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,160
See?

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,160
Si Ming deserves to be the NO. 1 follower

100
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,800
under the King of Longevity from the south pole.

101
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,360
He is greatly discerning and apprehending

102
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
and can deliver all living creatures from torment.

103
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,360
Third Prince,

104
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,200
His Majesty only invited you.

105
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,560
It suddenly occurred to me that
I haven't finished my Buddhist scriptures yet,

106
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,560
so I need to go back for that.

107
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,320
Don't spoil His Majesty's lotus banquet.

108
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,280
Eh...

109
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,160
Cheng...

110
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,480
Cheng Yu!

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Cheng Yu!

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
I need to check out Cheng Yu's Book of Fate.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,240
I'll check it carefully.

114
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Check it out! Check it out!

115
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,670
Lift up your spirit!

116
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,960
June 15th is a day off.

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,120
Every corner of the palace

118
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,910
must be thoroughly cleared.

119
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,560
You!

120
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Go to the tea garden and pick all the tea leaves!

121
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Yes!

122
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,400
You!

123
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,040
Clean up the pavilions in the corridor!

124
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,080
Yes!

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
You clean up the side palace.

126
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes!

127
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,400
Side palace

128
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,840
is the living palace for Princess Zhihe.

129
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,320
What's coming will come!

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,040
Let's go!

131
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Why do you come so late?

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,160
Even the side palace of the Tai Chen Palace

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,040
is so elegantly decorated!

134
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
His Majesty has set up

135
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,040
every corner of the Tai Chen Palace.

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,920
Of course, it is elegant and beautiful!

137
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,040
His Majesty is indeed good at everything.

138
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,240
What are you waiting for?

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Send this Mufeng Butterfly inside.

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,280
Mufeng Butterfly?

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,320
Zhe Yan ever said that

142
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,360
this kind of butterfly usually dances in the wind

143
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
and it creates hurricane once it touches water.

144
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,960
Take it now!

145
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,000
Sister,

146
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
we're new here.

147
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,040
The Mufeng Butterfly is really something we can't control.

148
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,680
If anything bad happens and offends the Princess,

149
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,440
you will be implicated in it.

150
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,720
Do as you're requested!

151
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
You may not be familiar with it now,

152
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,480
but you'll naturally become familiar

153
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,800
after a few more times.

154
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,360
Take it and leave!

155
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Yes!

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,920
Why could you accept it?

157
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,760
It is obviously a hot potato handed to you

158
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,000
as nobody else wants it.

159
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,240
Don't worry!

160
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,760
I used to catch butterflies in my hometown
when I was little.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm fine with it.

162
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
It's a piece of cake.

163
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,480
I've climbed up the Sky Kingdom.

164
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,200
This won't be a challenge to me.

165
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
It's dust everywhere

166
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,520
and it stinks.

167
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,960
What if foster brother visits my palace?

168
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Spray some flower dew!

169
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,040
Yes!

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,880
Why is the Mufeng Butterfly still not delivered yet?

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,480
Here it comes!

172
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Go now!

173
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
You should only pay back the favor.

174
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,800
Don't ever expose your identity

175
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,280
as the Princess of Qingqiu.

176
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,560
Who are you?

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,720
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

178
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,800
It's my fault

179
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
not to have taken care of it well.

180
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
Please forgive me!

181
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
So careless you were!

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,440
It almost hurt the Her Highness.

183
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,040
There is no room for you in Tai Chen Palace!

184
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Mercy please, Your Highness!

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Please have mercy on me!

186
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,640
Raise up your head!

187
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
Foster brother has asked us

188
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,520
to treat the fairy maids in palace with generosity.

189
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,160
So your punishment is to clean up the lotus pond.

190
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,600
Get your personality ground.

191
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,320
Her Highness is merciful.

192
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,800
Take your punishment and leave!

193
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:22,960
Yes!

194
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,680
Thank you, Your Highness!

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Excuse me please!

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,840
Butterfly!

197
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,280
How miserable you are!

198
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
It's so unlucky of you

199
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,040
to get implicated into this undeserved catastrophe.

200
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,840
Alright!

201
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,400
We're sort of destined.

202
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,520
Wait a minute!

203
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,720
I'll find some tools

204
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
before I apply the medicine for you.

205
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,280
This one it is!

206
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,320
It is itchy, isn't it?

207
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,840
I have been...

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,320
the No. 1 troublemaker in Qingqiu since I was young.

209
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
I always get my buddies injured.

210
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,200
As a result,

211
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,560
I have acquired the techniques
for medicine application.

212
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,640
This is my voice of experience.

213
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,760
Done!

214
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,920
Gosh!

215
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,320
His Majesty's stuff

216
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,160
must be returned in intact condition.

217
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
What do I do now?

218
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,520
I've got an idea.

219
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,440
A good brush pen can be made

220
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,600
with the softest fur at the tip of the nine-tailed fox.

221
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,800
It's said that Your Majesty made

222
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,360
all the tea set that he uses daily by himself.

223
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,760
Besides,

224
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
he is good at the four arts

225
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,560
and he is a rarely elegant scholar.

226
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,920
All the incenses burned in the Tai Chen Palace

227
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,720
are made by him in person.

228
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
No one in the Sky Kingdom

229
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,440
can imitate him.

230
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,560
I got that.

231
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,360
You helped me only because

232
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,960
you don't want me to give myself
away in front of His Majesty, right?

233
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,400
Thank you!

234
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,440
Now even the smell is the same as that of here.

235
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

236
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,680
You're usually calm!

237
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,240
Why are you so panicked today?

238
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:42,920
Your Majesty!

239
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,480
I've got news about Meng Hao.

240
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,320
He's been missing for so many years.

241
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
Where did he go?

242
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,040
Baishui Mountain!

243
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,960
The Baishui Mountain at the southern suburb of the demons?

244
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,640
Yes!

245
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,110
Come out!

246
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
Don't you recognize my sword?

247
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Greeting from Meng Hao, Your Majesty!

248
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,480
Rise!

249
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,280
Why did you end up like this?

250
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,760
Your Majesty,

251
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,200
the previous Chi Demon Lord used his Queen as a bait

252
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,400
to trap me in Baishui Mountain.

253
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
They impaled my bones with dragon-hunt lock

254
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,520
and sealed my power.

255
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I guarded the cinnamomum camphora
in the pond year in and year out.

256
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
I don't believe it

257
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,360
considering your magic arts.

258
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,840
Love is deeply rooted

259
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,560
into my bones.

260
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,880
My cultivation is not enough

261
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,400
to help me through this tragic romance.

262
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
It is my own willingness

263
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,480
to be trapped here.

264
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,600
Your own willingness?

265
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't have to do that.

266
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,520
I was seduced by the demons.

267
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
I feel guilty to Your Majesty,

268
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,640
so I'm willing to stay here as an atonement

269
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,400
for my guilt.

270
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,200
If it bothered me,

271
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,640
I wouldn't have come.

272
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,600
Please allow me to stay, Your Majesty!

273
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,360
Is there anything

274
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,360
you're still concerned about?

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,480
I

276
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,400
dare not to hold anything back from Your Majesty.

277
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
I do have some concerns.

278
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,880
Is it worth it?

279
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,080
It is a destined tragedy

280
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,160
in the eyes of others,

281
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,640
but it's as sweet as candies

282
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,280
to me.

283
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,640
Your Majesty is most concerned about
the people in general in the world

284
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,760
and never get indulged in personal romance.

285
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,280
So it's hard for Your Majesty
to understand the feeling in it.

286
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,160
If so,

287
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,080
I'll leave you to it.

288
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,480
Conduct yourself well in future.

289
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,440
Wherever I am, you can find me.

290
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,640
Here you are!

291
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
Take the fruit and make some tea with it.

292
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,320
Even though Your Highness cultivates water magic,

293
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,840
this fruit is cold in property,

294
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,680
so it's better for you not to eat too much of it.

295
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,920
As you wish then.

296
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
The Demon Lord summons you.

297
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,080
Brother!

298
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,240
Why does he summon me so suddenly?

299
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
The demon officer who spread the word
said there was something important.

300
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,800
Alright then!

301
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm going to the Chihong Hall.

302
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Mind your words

303
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,160
when you visit Ji Heng.

304
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Don't get me embarrassed.

305
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,920
Sure!

306
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,040
I've been studying the four arts for a long time.

307
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
This time, I have to win Ji Heng's affection.

308
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,760
I believe I can do it!

309
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,360
I...

310
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,960
Who is it?

311
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,240
Nie Chuyin!

312
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Yes, I am!

313
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,920
Your Highness,

314
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,760
calm down!

315
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,600
Wait a minute!

316
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,720
What are you doing here?

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,400
Are you into Ji Heng as well?

318
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,600
Your Highness,

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
I am Mr. Nobody!

320
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,600
I dare not to covet Her Highness.

321
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,240
That's more like it.

322
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,920
Prepare the necklace that I'll give Ji Heng
as a gift.

323
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,440
Yes!

324
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,480
The Princess is not in the palace.

325
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,840
How do you know?

326
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,160
You're very familiar with Ji Heng's whereabouts.

327
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,080
What's your intention?

328
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Your Highness,

329
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,560
I don't dare to have any intention

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,560
with your presence.

331
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
It was the Demon Lord who asked me
to find the Princess,

332
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,360
but I didn't even meet her.

333
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,640
Fine! Then I'm going to Chihong Hall now.

334
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,160
Brother!

335
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,920
Brother! Are you looking for me?

336
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,040
Heng,

337
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,080
do you know the Emperor Dong Hua?

338
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,560
Emperor Dong Hua?

339
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,400
Everyone knows him!

340
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,720
Why do you ask?

341
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,360
I want you

342
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,880
to get engaged with him.

343
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,120
What?

344
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
You want to marry Ji Heng

345
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,240
to Dong Hua?

346
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,240
Heng,

347
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,480
this arrangement is critically important.

348
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,680
It determines the future of the demons.

349
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
Think it over before you give my any replies.

350
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,280
Anyway, only my sister can be matched

351
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,880
with a husband as noble as him.

352
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,840
Xu Yang,

353
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,480
you don't even care about

354
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,520
the marriage of your sister!

355
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,560
Yan Chiwu,

356
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,280
this is the domestic affair for my clan.

357
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,800
It's none of your business.

358
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,680
You!

359
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,040
Xu Yang,

360
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,720
I... I am a demon lord after all.

361
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,040
Marrying Ji Heng to me

362
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
is also for the sake of overall interests.

363
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,520
If you do it otherwise,

364
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll rise in rebellion.

365
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,200
Overall interest goes first!

366
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,560
Overall interest goes first!

367
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,680
When can the cleaning be finished

368
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,200
without using magic arts?

369
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,760
Here comes His Majesty!

370
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,640
So long, Your Majesty!

371
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,200
Off you go!

372
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,640
Your Majesty!

373
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,160
Yu Ru!

374
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,800
Jiu, you're just too ignorant.

375
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,360
How dare you stand in front of the Princess!

376
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,120
Foster brother!

377
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,280
Foster brother!

378
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,680
You're finally back!

379
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,120
Foster brother!

380
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
The Heavenly King endowed me
with a Kuwu Qin the other day.

381
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
The Shang string and Zhi string
always have some sort of flaws.

382
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,200
I hope you can help me with this.

383
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,040
It's still early now.

384
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm fine to check it out!

385
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Don't try to covet my foster brother

386
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,400
with your good look.

387
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,680
I know what you're thinking in your heart.

388
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,840
You're so rude and obtrusive

389
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,800
and you offended His Majesty!

390
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,320
Get out of the palace now!

391
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,600
Guards!

392
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,560
Zhihe!

393
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,800
Foster brother!

394
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,000
I'll come in a minute.

395
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't have time for you now.

396
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,160
If you are able to clean up
the Bodhi tree leaves by the pond in today,

397
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
I'll allow you to stay.

398
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,840
Foster brother!

399
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,920
Wait for me!

400
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:30,880
Go!

401
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,560
How ridiculous!

402
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,040
How dare you irritate the Princess!

403
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,560
Intentional obstruction!

404
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,720
That's outrageous!

405
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,960
So, you got any ideas?

406
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,520
You're awesome!

407
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,920
Your Highness,

408
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,680
the yard is cleaned up.

409
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,000
Shall we release Jiu back?

410
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
So soon?

411
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,240
Jiu!

412
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,240
Your Highness!

413
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,240
I gave you the chance out of mercy,

414
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
but you just loafed on the job.

415
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,280
And you used the Mufeng Butterfly.

416
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,480
So it should be your accomplice.

417
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,320
Guards!

418
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,720
Flog them in the buttocks for 20 times each

419
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,720
and drive them out of palace.

420
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
Yes, Your Highness!

421
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,680
Let me go!

422
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,120
I've already cleaned up the yard

423
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,320
as requested by the Princess.

424
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,840
Why do you drive me out?

425
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,600
Bizarre wind blows everywhere.

426
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,440
How can you make it clean?

427
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,320
Your Highness have been in the palace the whole time.

428
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,800
How do Your Highness know
there is bizarre wind everywhere?

429
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,120
Stop the far-fetched defense!

430
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,440
Verbal resistance is another conviction.

431
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,240
You'll be punished with both convictions.

432
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,400
That's 40 times of flogging on the buttock.

433
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,560
Let me go!

434
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,160
And what kind of immortal realm creature

435
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,640
Let me go!

436
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,280
is this Mufeng Butterfly?

437
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,840
The Mufeng Butterfly is innocent.

438
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,440
Please have mercy, Your Highness!

439
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,120
I must banish it to the mortal realm

440
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,720
and let it cultivate from the start.

441
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,560
Mufeng Butterfly did nothing.

442
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
Why did you do that?

443
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,720
It looks like this girl

444
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,960
just wants to work against me today.

445
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,160
This is intolerable!

446
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,000
Who is making so much noise here?

447
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,520
I heard a lot of noise

448
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
that disturbed His Majesty's rest.

449
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,960
So I came here to check out,

450
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,280
only to find that it is Your Highness!

451
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
It's not my intention to disturb
the foster brother's rest,

452
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,680
but this fairy maid is just too annoying!

453
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,240
It made me so angry!

454
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,400
Don't tell foster brother about this.

455
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,200
Now that the fairy maid is unfamiliar
with the manners,

456
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,520
ground her into the Imperial Kitchen to repent

457
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,520
about her own guilt.

458
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,280
Eh...

459
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,040
Leave now!

460
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,080
What about Mufeng...

461
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,760
Go!

462
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Leave now!

463
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,160
Yes!

464
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,560
Your Highness!

465
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,000
Your Highness!

466
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,120
It's too late at night.

467
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,560
Please take a rest for the day!

468
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,280
You!

469
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,880
What a pity for the Mufeng Butterfly!

470
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
It did nothing wrong.

471
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,440
Zhihe is to blame for this.

472
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,200
She beat the butterfly nowhere!

473
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,120
Forget it!

474
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,320
The sorrowless flower has bloomed.

475
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Sorrowless! Sorrowless!

476
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,160
It matches so well with the occasion.

477
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
I should make a wish.

478
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,160
I wish Tai Chen Palace

479
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,040
can stay sorrowless and disaster-free

480
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,640
and always remain beautiful.

481
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
Prayer is done.

482
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,280
You can't be wasted, right?

483
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,960
Something seems to be missing.

484
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,660
Yushi Flower Root,

485
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,560
East Sea Rime,

486
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,640
and the Zijin Honeydew!

487
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
This is more like it.

488
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,560
Hurry! Hurry up!

489
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,440
Get moving!

490
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,840
Jiu, get out of the way!

491
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,240
His Highness Lian Song and Si Ming

492
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
are coming to the palace to discuss
the scriptures with His Majesty.

493
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,720
It's not common for His Majesty to hold
a banquet in the palace to enjoy the flowers.

494
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,080
We should be careful

495
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
not to spoil it.

496
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,680
Yes!

497
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,920
Third Prince and Si Ming came here

498
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,000
to enjoy flowers and discuss scriptures.

499
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm taking out the frosted liquor that
was brewed many years ago in particular.

500
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,600
Hope you don't mind my lousy brewing skill.

501
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,520
Frosted liquor is refreshing
and turns bitterness into sweetness.

502
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,760
It's uncommon among fairies

503
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
to have such an elegant taste.

504
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,920
Zhihe,

505
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,560
I heard that you formally acknowledged
the Doumu Lord as your master.

506
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
Do you have any gain?

507
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,960
I do have some gain.

508
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,280
The scroll given by my foster brother yesterday

509
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,720
matches very well with my heartfelt emotion.

510
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,640
These two people

511
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
have met

512
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,120
or haven't met.

513
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,200
They miss each other.

514
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,000
They miss each other so deep

515
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
that even death won't tear them apart.

516
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,200
Serve the sweet and sour fish.

517
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,800
It is made with a new cooking skill.

518
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,240
Try it!

519
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,480
It's so shameful that

520
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,880
I forgot myself

521
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,800
when I tried this sweet and sour fish

522
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,320
for the first time.

523
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,160
I went into meditation right
where I was before I even sat down

524
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
and perceived the truth to a lot of
problems that puzzled me in the past.

525
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,960
It's hard to forget

526
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,480
in retrospect.

527
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,920
How about Third Prince having a try first today

528
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,480
so that you could teach me to taste

529
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,040
the Thoughts of Zen from His Majesty.

530
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,720
You flattered me.

531
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,280
I've tried it once.

532
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,680
It was impressive.

533
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
It's unnecessary to try it twice.

534
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
I smoked it with sandalwood.

535
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,720
It must taste differently.

536
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,400
Third Prince,

537
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,200
please!

538
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Exaggerating!

539
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,000
Amazing!

540
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,160
Amazing?

541
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,480
This dish you made is indeed delicious.

542
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
You are the only one in the Sky Kingdom

543
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,040
who has such an extraordinary skill.

544
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,400
What do you think of it, Third Prince?

545
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,280
This Glass fish

546
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,920
smells fishy in the first place.

547
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,680
After smoked by sandalwood,

548
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,600
it's both bitter and fishy.

549
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,800
This is as bad

550
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,840
as how it is in my heart.

551
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,040
I've gotta think about

552
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,720
Your Majesty's meaning behind it.

553
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,800
Where are the desserts?

554
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,720
Serve the Third Prince with some desserts.

555
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,240
Yes, Your Highness!

556
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,120
What are you waiting for?

557
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,360
Hurry! Hurry!

558
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Where is the almond cake?

559
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,720
Make it quick!

560
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,040
Here it goes! Here it goes!

561
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,040
Help me with this.

562
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,960
Hurry up!

563
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,440
Coming!

564
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,000
OK!

565
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,320
Help me serve this.

566
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
Don't make it too cold.

567
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,160
Jiu, serve the dishes!

568
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,160
Move! Move!

569
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,480
But I can't go out.

570
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,480
What are you waiting for? Go!

571
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
This is really a blessing in disguise!

572
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,000
I can finally see His Majesty!

573
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,640
Oh my god!

574
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,640
I screwed up this time!

575
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,440
Jiu served it!

576
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,360
The desert hasn't come yet.

577
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,000
Please allow me to check it out.

578
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,440
Please wait a second, foster brother and you all.

579
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,320
Your Highness!

580
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,080
Why are you here

581
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,280
but not in the Imperial Kitchen to repent?

582
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,480
There is not enough manpower in the Imperial Kitchen

583
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,160
and they are afraid to keep the guests
waiting for too long,

584
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,960
so I'm appointed to serve the dessert.

585
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,520
Leave it!

586
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,320
I'll take over from here.

587
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,720
You get back immediately!

588
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,880
Remember!

589
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,600
You can't step out of the Imperial Kitchen
without my permission.

590
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,560
But I didn't...

591
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,120
No!

592
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,080
I've been here for so long.

593
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,320
I must meet His Majesty today!
