00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 51

3
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,540
So Chenxiang ran away from home

4
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,540
to save San Sheng Mu

5
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,300
who was pinned under the mountain.

6
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,740
Some people run away from home to fulfill filial duty,

7
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,380
while some send no messages back

8
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,500
after running away for more than half a year

9
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
which makes their families worry.

10
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,260
Li,

11
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,540
when you grow up,

12
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,900
you should never follow this bad example.

13
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,340
Sister Fengjiu is back after running away from home!

14
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,580
Good boy!

15
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,300
Is your uncle telling you stories?

16
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,220
These are just stories from the script.

17
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,020
I'd like to hear something fresh.

18
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,660
Can you tell me?

19
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,980
I like to hear new stories the most.

20
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,620
Sister Fengjiu,

21
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,420
I didn't tell them that

22
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,620
you fell into the Fanyin Valley...

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,220
Li,

24
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,100
just go somewhere to play.

25
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,380
I've got something serious to talk to your elder sister.

26
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,940
I'm really tight-lipped.

27
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,140
Though I learned from Third Grandpa

28
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,020
that Sister Fengjiu and Brother Dong Hua kissed each other,

29
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,660
I didn't tell them.

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,260
Uncle,

31
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
why are you still here?

32
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,060
Why didn't you go back to Qingqiu?

33
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,900
I'm waiting for you.

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Without taking you back, how to handle

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,700
the great event in Qingqiu?

36
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,660
No need to wait for me.

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,540
After all, I often go out to play.

38
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,420
It's not a big deal in Qingqiu.

39
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,100
If you stay here because of me,

40
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,620
God Zhe Yan will surely be angry at me.

41
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,260
It seems you've forgotten about

42
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,660
an important event concerning you recently.

43
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,660
What is it?

44
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,140
So you've really forgotten about it.

45
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Then let me remind you.

46
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,060
Your Weapon Hiding Ceremony

47
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,700
is right after 15 days.

48
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,900
Right! I've really forgotten about it.

49
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,060
Uncle,

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
just pretend you haven't seen me today.

51
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll be back 15 days later.

52
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,500
Originally, I could transform into you

53
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,220
and fulfill the ceremony on your behalf.

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,300
Now that you're back,

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,580
you should fulfill your own duty.

56
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,340
I...

57
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,660
There're still 15 days left.

58
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,900
If you sleep four or six hours less every day,

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,740
you'll have enough time to prepare for it.

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,260
But I only sleep eight hours a day.

61
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,100
Poor girl!

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,580
But young as you are,

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,140
you'll be fine even
if you only sleep two or four hours a day.

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,300
You're not asked to stay all night long.

65
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,620
Just be content with it.

66
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,980
I see.

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,580
I'll get ready for it.

68
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,780
Though the formalities of Qingqiu

69
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,580
are not so heavy as those of the Sky Kingdom,

70
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,340
the major formalities shall not be missed.

71
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,380
Fine.

72
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,900
Both of them have returned safely.

73
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,220
You can finally stop pulling a long face.

74
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,900
Thanks to you,

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
they're back safely this time.

76
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,020
Without me,

77
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,740
Fengjiu can still come back safely.

78
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,980
That was Emperor Dong Hua.

79
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,660
Would he let any harm come to her?

80
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,900
Right.

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,740
You just worry too much.

82
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,540
Didn't you also lose much cultivation

83
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,860
guarding for them?

84
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,740
Only when they returned safely

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,620
did you feel relieved to come back
to the Sky Kingdom, right?

86
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,540
I'm probably influenced by you.

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,060
What?

88
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,300
I feel uncomfortable

89
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,620
with you staring at me like that.

90
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,220
I wonder why you haven't visited Fengjiu yet.

91
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,780
When she was in the Sky Kingdom previously,

92
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,980
you hung out every day.

93
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
Now she's got no time to play with me.

94
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,820
Are they so intimate that they don't even

95
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,100
want to part with each other?

96
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,380
Well,

97
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,500
she's bothered about how to persuade

98
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,460
her family into accepting His Majesty.

99
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,580
However, the Weapon Hiding Ceremony is also coming.

100
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,660
Now, she's even more bothered.

101
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,780
The Weapon Hiding Ceremony?

102
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,540
It's a ceremony which must be held

103
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,700
after a new monarch of Qingqiu succeeds to the throne.

104
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,180
The new monarch must forge

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,140
a handy weapon in person

106
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
and hide it in the Holy Land under his or her rule

107
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,340
in front of immortals from the Eight Deserts
on the very day of the ceremony,

108
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,420
so that the future generations can use it.

109
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,940
I remembered.

110
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,060
I also participated in Bai Qian's
Weapon Hiding Ceremony back then.

111
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,540
In the Four Seas and the Eight Deserts,

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,620
it's really a great event.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,380
Is she ready?

114
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,340
She forged the Hexu Sword

115
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,300
long ago,

116
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,060
but as to the sword box...

117
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,940
Unfinished?

118
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,380
She thought

119
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,300
there was still time.

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,740
Even if she played for two months
after Bai Qian's wedding banquet,

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,180
she still got time to make the box.

122
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,780
However, she fell into the Fanyin Valley

123
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,700
and forgot about the whole thing.

124
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,100
Now,

125
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,380
she is surely sparing no efforts in

126
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,260
choosing the material

127
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,740
and style of the sword box

128
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,780
and dares not get distracted.

129
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,380
She's careless,

130
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,980
just like you.

131
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,340
No wonder you're friends.

132
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,740
But she has Emperor Dong Hua

133
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,340
who excels at making sword boxes.

134
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,460
With the help of Dong Hua,

135
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,340
the sword box can be finished in a day or two for sure.

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,780
At such a critical moment,

137
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,260
if Fengjiu doesn't

138
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,300
turn to him for help,

139
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,740
she really wastes a great talent.

140
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,620
Perhaps with a few soft words,

141
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,100
Dong Hua will make the box for her to save her the trouble.

142
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,860
Why should she be bothered?

143
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,140
Such a romantic trick does sound like your style.

144
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,420
No wonder you can't become friends.

145
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,220
Fengjiu said that

146
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,940
surely nothing could go wrong with the help of His Majesty,

147
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,740
but if she relied on him all the time,

148
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,060
she would be too unmotivated.

149
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,380
Moreover,

150
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,220
His Majesty also doesn't want her to be

151
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,460
a loser who can only rely on him.

152
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,620
He will only help her arrange the schedule

153
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,180
of making the sword box.

154
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,420
As to the rest,

155
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,900
he probably won't help.

156
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Let's make a bet.

157
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm also curious whether His Majesty

158
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,700
will make the sword box for her or not.

159
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,500
Back then, Bai Qian's Weapon Hiding Ceremony was so grand.

160
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,460
Fengjiu can't lose.

161
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,860
If I win,

162
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,580
you should attend Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony

163
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,380
to support her and bring attention to the event.

164
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,260
If you win,

165
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,140
I'll personally fetch some fat fish in the Pundarika Pond

166
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,980
and have Fengjiu cook sweet and sour fish
for you for half a month.

167
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,220
She's really good at cooking.

168
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,740
The wagers are fairly good,

169
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,100
but given Fengjiu's situation,

170
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,540
it's better that I win.

171
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,300
No.

172
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,140
It's not so good if I win.

173
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,580
If I eat the sweet and sour fish cooked by Fengjiu,

174
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,340
jealous as Dong Hua is,

175
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,100
he will definitely make me spit it out.

176
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,900
That's it.

177
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,820
I originally wanted to apologize to aunt,

178
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,540
but I didn't expect that

179
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,780
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony is only 15 days away.

180
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,020
I haven't finished my sword box yet.

181
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,140
= From the 1st day to the 5th day
making a 1.3-m Han Nanmu box =

182
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,860
= From the 5th day to the 10th day making patterns at joints,
at the bottom and on both sides of the box =

183
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,660
= From the 10th day to the 15th day inlaying two pieces
of Yufu-jade-carved Foling flowers at the top =

184
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,900
According to the progress chart,

185
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,980
without accident,

186
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,180
the sword box can be made in 15 days.

187
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,500
Dong Hua, just wait.

188
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,420
I will get back at you.

189
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,060
Your Majesty,

190
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,820
you...

191
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,820
Nie Chuyin,

192
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,220
go and get me some demons to eat.

193
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,340
Demons?

194
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,580
Hurry up!

195
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,420
Yes!

196
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:40,900
Go.

197
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,020
Yes.

198
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,580
Your Highness!

199
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,580
Your Highness!

200
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,260
Bad news!

201
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,500
Why are you in such a hurry?

202
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:00,860
Bad...

203
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,100
Bad news!

204
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,380
Her Majesty...

205
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,020
Your Majesty!

206
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,340
Your... Your Majesty!

207
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,220
Your Majesty,

208
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,980
by making such a fuss,

209
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,420
how can we hide from others?

210
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,820
They're nothing but a dozen losers.

211
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,100
I need more.

212
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,820
Right.

213
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,580
Your Majesty, you're extremely powerful,

214
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,620
but to help you recover your power,

215
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm afraid there won't be many demons left in our clan.

216
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,740
How can we fight the gods then?

217
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,340
Are you questioning me?

218
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,140
I beg your pardon.

219
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,180
I dare not.

220
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,260
Majestic and powerful as Your Majesty is,
you're fearless to heaven and earth.

221
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
It's a supreme glory for our clan.

222
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,580
The Miaoyi Chasm keeps being strengthened.

223
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,300
I need to get the blood tear as soon as possible.

224
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,820
From today on,

225
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,180
send one hundred demons for me to eat every day.

226
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,380
Act without fail.

227
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,260
One hundred demons?

228
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,900
Yes!

229
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,420
Your Majesty!

230
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,260
Your Majesty,

231
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,900
how about this?

232
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,180
Yes.

233
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,180
Your Majesty,

234
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,180
how about this?

235
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,420
Your Majesty,

236
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,580
this time...

237
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,020
This place is nice.

238
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,300
Your Majesty, the cool breeze is blowing outside.

239
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Her Highness Fengjiu's desk is not put in the right place

240
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
to enjoy the cool breeze.

241
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,100
Let me also move Her Highness's desk.

242
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,180
Good idea.

243
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,300
Yes.

244
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,580
I remember that last year

245
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,500
when I was also playing the game of go
with you in Tai Chen Palace,

246
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,900
I advised you that

247
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,980
if one day,

248
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,540
you come round and want to marry an Empress,

249
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,860
Zhihe might be a good choice.

250
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
But now, it seems that

251
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,500
Zhihe is not a match for you.

252
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,700
As to my foster sister,

253
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,940
her heart was pure.

254
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,260
Moreover, I was indebted to her parents,

255
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,900
so I would naturally look after her all the time.

256
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,420
Maybe because I cared for her too much,

257
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,460
she was too spoiled.

258
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,780
So you sent her to the Lord of the West Sea

259
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,700
to discipline her.

260
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,740
Upright and righteous,

261
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,580
the Lord of the West Sea makes an excellent teacher.

262
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,580
If Zhihe can learn a thing or two from him,

263
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,340
she is bound to make some progress.

264
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,260
You do worry a lot about her.

265
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,460
But after years' waiting, you've found Fengjiu.

266
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,620
It's worth it.

267
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,820
Only she

268
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,620
deserves to be your Empress.

269
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,820
Are you drunk today?

270
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,220
I rarely hear you say something nice.

271
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,380
I didn't drink today.

272
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,180
I just heard something from Cheng Yu.

273
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,540
Cheng Yu asked Fengjiu

274
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,500
why not ask you to make the sword box for her.

275
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,140
But she answered that

276
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,660
she wanted to do everything on her own.

277
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,500
And that she didn't want to rely on you all the time
and become a loser in the end.

278
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,260
When I heard it,

279
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,700
I thought she didn't mean it.

280
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,820
Little girls

281
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,740
always want to feel cared and loved.

282
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,380
But you didn't help her,

283
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,180
and she's fine with that.

284
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,100
She did mean

285
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,740
what she said.

286
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,060
Xiaobai is sensible all the time.

287
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,740
Your Majesty!

288
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,700
Your Highness!

289
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,780
What's up?

290
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,780
The inseparable king birds and night owls

291
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,740
have been resettled properly.

292
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,500
I've made inquiries in person today.

293
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,140
Is it too cautious

294
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,860
to make inquiries every day?

295
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,500
However,

296
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,500
there are many people in the Sky Kingdom
and they gossip with one another.

297
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,500
Fairy maids and servants will surely talk about it.

298
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,660
I'm afraid Her Highness Fengjiu

299
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,660
will notice that sooner or later.

300
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,060
Never mind.

301
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,580
Now she's busy preparing for the Weapon Hiding Ceremony

302
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,900
and has no time for distraction.

303
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,260
After the ceremony,

304
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,540
I'll take her to Bihai Cangling

305
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,340
and we won't be back until the wedding.

306
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,820
You're too protective of her.

307
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,300
She's still a little girl.

308
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,860
She deserves to enjoy

309
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,220
the happy hours before the wedding.

310
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,980
Do you want some cakes?

311
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,420
No.

312
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,860
What about the porridge?

313
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,300
No.

314
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,660
Yes. Good.

315
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,860
When will you take me back to Qingqiu to meet your parents?

316
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,980
After I persuade grandma and father.

317
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,300
How come I spoke out my mind?

318
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,420
Will His Majesty get angry?

319
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,820
Are you tired?

320
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,020
Get some sleep if you feel tired.

321
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,380
I'm not tired. Just lean on me.

322
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,700
Please be patient these few days.

323
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,620
After I persuade grandma and father,

324
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll take you back to Qingqiu.

325
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,500
Fine.

326
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,420
Your Highness,

327
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,740
for these days,

328
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,180
Her Majesty ate one hundred demons

329
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,980
every day to improve her power.

330
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,380
I'm afraid if it goes on,

331
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,140
demons will be exterminated.

332
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,140
I'm also aware of that,

333
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,780
but if I don't follow

334
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,620
Her Majesty's order,

335
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm afraid I'll also be killed.

336
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,260
Your Highness,

337
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,580
forgive me for being outspoken and disrespectful.

338
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,940
I forgive you.

339
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,260
Go ahead.

340
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,940
In my opinion,

341
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,420
Her Majesty is bent on having her own way.

342
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm afraid she doesn't take

343
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,420
your wish seriously.

344
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,220
You mean...

345
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,780
If Her Majesty keeps doing so,

346
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,340
the foundation of demons will collapse.

347
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,620
What if gods and demons go to war

348
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,460
or Her Majesty turns mad and bloodthirsty in future?

349
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,620
We might as well trick other clans

350
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,860
into feeding Her Majesty.

351
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,860
In this way, we might be able to protect our clan.

352
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,420
The Weapon Hiding Ceremony is in less than two days.

353
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,820
Finally, it won't be long before the whole thing ends.

354
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,340
I remember you've finished sketching the sword box.

355
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,980
It's so late. What are you drawing?

356
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,820
So you're drawing a house.

357
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,740
Why do you remain silent?

358
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,740
I've finished the sword box.

359
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,300
I couldn't fall asleep for the moment,

360
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,100
so I began to draw the picture.

361
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,060
Actually, I'm not used to living in the fox cave

362
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,340
left by aunt in Qingqiu.

363
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,420
I've long wanted to build a small bamboo house

364
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,660
in the bamboo forest outside.

365
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,100
And I've drawn the house before,

366
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,420
but it didn't have bedrooms for you and fox cubs,

367
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,980
so I want to draw the picture again

368
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,180
and ask Mi Gu to build it for me.

369
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,020
Though in one year, you may only

370
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,580
live in Qingqiu for half of the year,

371
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,020
I still feel...

372
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,380
Is this one for me?

373
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,860
I'm unoccupied actually.

374
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,300
Tai Chen Palace and Qingqiu are no difference to me.

375
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,580
I can live in Qingqiu all the time.

376
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,660
But I think

377
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,140
I should share a room with you.

378
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Why did you get me another room?

379
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,820
I've been thoughtful.

380
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,340
If we quarrel with each other,

381
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,540
where can you sleep?

382
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,340
If you don't have your own room,
should you sleep in the study?

383
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,220
I think

384
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,300
no matter how angry you're at me,

385
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,260
you should not kick me out.

386
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,340
Let's talk about these things later.

387
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
These are all minor details.

388
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,460
What's the most important now

389
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,900
is to figure out how many rooms

390
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,220
we shall leave for the fox cubs.

391
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,460
What do you think?

392
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,220
The number of rooms equals the number of fox cubs.

393
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,300
Is that right?

394
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,180
Well,

395
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,100
let's leave one room.

396
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,740
But I want to leave two rooms.

397
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,340
Because with two fox cubs, it can be fun and lively.

398
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,740
But I'm also thinking that

399
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,180
if they're too close to each other,

400
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,580
they may not be close to me.

401
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,340
What if they don't play with me by then?

402
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
Then let's have two cubs.

403
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,340
No need to change this picture.

404
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,860
Leave my room to them.

405
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,900
That's a deal.

406
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,540
But...

407
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,580
I haven't finished yet!

408
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,740
If we don't go to bed,

409
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,580
how can we have fox cubs?

410
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,420
But, have you seen my sword box?

411
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,620
Have I done a good job?

412
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,780
I've seen it! It's wonderful!

413
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,580
You have to get some sleep.

414
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,980
You've worked hard for days. Aren't you tired?

415
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,060
But...

416
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,620
I...

417
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,660
Many people have come.

418
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,140
When holding ceremonies,
Qingqiu never sends out invitations.

419
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,820
Immortals from the Eight Deserts having time
and feeling interested

420
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,060
are all our guests if they come.

421
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,900
For those who are not free or interested,
we won't force them to come.

422
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,700
Well said.

423
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,660
This is the Qingqiu's style.

424
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,260
However,

425
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,980
despite that,

426
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,820
we can still estimate

427
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,540
the size of the event,

428
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,540
the occasion of the event,

429
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,220
and the famous immortals from heaven and earth

430
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,500
who would actually come.

431
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,140
Your Majesty!

432
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,860
Your Majesty!

433
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,900
Have a seat!

434
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,500
God Zhe Yan,

435
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,420
His Majesty seldom attends ceremonies.

436
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,700
Why would he attend Xiaojiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony today?

437
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,620
Well,

438
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,780
you'll see later.

439
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,980
What's special about the Weapon Hiding Ceremony?

440
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,460
Today,

441
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,540
Her Highness Fengjiu will pass the formation

442
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,100
with the newly forged Hexu Sword.

443
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,380
Only after she passes the formation can she set foot
on the one hundred grass steps

444
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,220
and hide the sword into the Holy Mountain.

445
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,060
If she fails, there will be another divination,

446
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,180
and the Weapon Hiding Ceremony will be held again

447
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,060
one hundred years later.

448
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,940
Who set this formation?

449
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,700
This formation was a magic trick
planted by Emperor Bai Zhi in person

450
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,300
when initiating the Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

451
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,900
When the ceremony platform opens,

452
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,380
the magic trick works automatically

453
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,380
to form unpredictable formations.

454
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,580
Since it's set by Emperor Bai Zhi in person,

455
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,140
it must be hard to pass.

456
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,620
The Ceremony is a grand event

457
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,860
because it's a demanding task for the new monarch.

458
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
If she fails,

459
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,180
her efforts in forging the sword

460
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,660
in the previous one hundred years will be wasted completely.

461
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,140
Moreover, she will lose face.

462
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,260
Competitive as Xiaobai is,

463
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,580
no wonder she stayed up all night.

464
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,540
You're lucky to see

465
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,660
Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony with your own eyes.

466
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,340
In Qingqiu,

467
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
they rarely wear fancy clothes and hold grand ceremonies.

468
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,620
This is the most important ceremony

469
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,100
in her life.

470
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,180
A few days ago,

471
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,900
Ye Hua drank with me.

472
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,180
He found it a pity that

473
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,940
he was unable to see God Bai Qian's

474
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,900
Weapon Hiding Ceremony in person.

475
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,180
He could only imagine what she was like

476
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,100
according to book records.

477
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,540
Well,

478
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,060
what was Xiaobai like when she was born?

479
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,540
Never let Ye Hua hear what you just said.

480
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,020
He may think you're trying to piss him off.

481
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,220
You're both son-in-laws of Qingqiu,

482
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,820
but having tasted love earlier than you,

483
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,140
he's really experienced.

484
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,940
Be careful if he tricks you.

485
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,020
What's in your hand?

486
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,140
You mean this?

487
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,700
These are snacks that Xiaobai made for me.

488
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,900
I'm afraid they might melt in the sun,
so I keep them in a glass box.

489
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,780
She is going to have a grand ceremony

490
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,580
in front of thousands of immortals from the Eight Deserts.

491
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,700
You actually asked her to make snacks for you!

492
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,460
Are you a bit shameless?

493
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,220
Don't do me wrong.

494
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,860
The second time I saw Xiaobai,

495
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,140
she kicked a flowerpot toward my head,

496
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,940
but she calmly made Mi Gu the scapegoat.

497
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,220
It's not a big occasion.

498
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,740
Do you think she'll get nervous easily?

499
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,940
According to rank,

500
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,060
her grandpa also has to sit in your right hand seat.

501
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,140
She actually dares to make you love her.

502
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,780
In such an occasion,

503
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,980
she certainly won't be nervous.

504
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,340
Now that you're ready,

505
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,900
it should be easy for you

506
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,980
to handle several formations of

507
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,300
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

508
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,620
How come you're so nervous?

509
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,180
Uncle, I'm not nervous about that.

510
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,620
I...

511
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
Is my father here?

512
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,700
Are you kidding?

513
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,340
Your father will host
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony for you today.

514
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,980
Can he miss it?

515
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,420
What about mother?

516
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,620
What about the other uncles?

517
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,140
It's important to you. Of course they've all come.

518
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,700
Those who should come are here,

519
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,940
and the one who shouldn't come

520
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,100
is also here.

521
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,740
The one who shouldn't come?

522
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,860
Who?

523
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,500
Emperor Dong Hua.

524
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,340
Why is he here?

525
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,660
How come I didn't know?

526
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,300
Well, didn't you know he would come?

527
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,580
Uncle,

528
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,020
I've got something to tell you.

529
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,340
What?

530
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,340
After the Weapon Hiding Ceremony,

531
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,220
I'd like to introduce someone to father.

532
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,420
Can you go with me?

533
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,660
Hold it.

534
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,980
Let's talk about it

535
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,940
after the Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

536
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,460
It's time.

537
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,100
Distinguished guests, please enjoy the ceremony.

538
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,580
The Weapon Hiding Ceremony starts now.

539
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,460
If I keep fighting to stall for time,

540
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,460
I won't be able to break out of the formation for sure.

541
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,700
Though the formation

542
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,620
cast by grandpa changes constantly,

543
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,420
the number of immortals forming the formation
remains to be ten all along.

544
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,300
In this case,

545
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,580
the other shadows

546
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,260
can only be illusions.

547
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,900
Good! Good! Good!

548
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,460
Awesome!

549
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,100
Terrific!

550
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,860
Good! Good!

551
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,140
Wonderful!

552
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,460
Exchange love glances

553
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,980
with the one you love in public.

554
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,340
I've never done that actually.

555
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,460
How I failed to live up to my reputation as a playboy!

556
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,660
Finally, I can show off the sword box

557
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,540
I've worked so hard to make these days.

558
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,740
Hide Hexu

559
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,940
in the hall!

560
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,020
Long live the martial virtue!

561
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,940
May Heaven bless the East Desert!

562
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,900
A magic weapon is forged

563
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,820
by our virtuous young monarch!

564
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,780
Hide Hexu

565
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,740
in the hall!

566
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,620
Long live the martial virtue!

567
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,780
May Heaven bless the East Desert!

568
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,380
What a feast shared by the gods!

569
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,660
But to me,

570
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,420
it seems that one step is missing

571
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,860
in Her Highness Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

572
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,660
Showing up now

573
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,860
and saying those words,

574
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,500
Nie Chuyin obviously wants to cause trouble.

575
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,620
I wonder how Qingqiu will deal with him.

576
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,420
I heard that demons are natural

577
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,540
and unrestrained by rituals.

578
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,340
I didn't expect that Demon Lord Xuan
actually values rituals so much.

579
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,940
Today in Qingqiu, we hold

580
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,860
an ancient ceremony on our own land,

581
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,860
but we still have to trouble you to teach us the procedures.

582
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,140
How embarrassed we are!

583
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,380
God Bai Yi,

584
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,700
I'm wronged.

585
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,460
How dare I teach you?

586
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,340
But luckily, I've seen

587
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,700
two Weapon Hiding Ceremonies in the primitive time,

588
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,260
which I admired a lot.

589
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,980
I remember that

590
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,780
after the sword testing, it was the sword competition.

591
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,900
How come in Her Highness Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony,

592
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,060
the sword hiding follows the sword testing directly?

593
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,580
What's going on?

594
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,940
I heard that the Weapon Hiding Ceremony of Qingqiu

595
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,940
does include sword competition.

596
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,900
Immortals of the same generation
can all challenge the new monarch.

597
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,820
It's fine if you lose,

598
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,300
but if you win, the new monarch will give you a promise.

599
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,180
Why have the recent Weapon Hiding Ceremonies

600
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,860
cancelled the sword competition?

601
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,220
I heard that Emperor Bai Zhi

602
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,820
set the sword competition

603
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,420
to motivate the descendants of the Bai's family
to work hard since childhood

604
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,900
so as to stand out among their generations.

605
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,660
But when it came to God Bai Qian,

606
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,260
given that she's a girl,

607
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,260
the Empress pitied her so much
that she cried before Emperor Bai Zhi every day.

608
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,820
Later, Emperor Bai Zhi

609
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,660
also felt sympathetic,

610
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,020
so the sword competition in the Weapon Hiding Ceremony

611
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,260
was cancelled automatically.

612
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,700
It's tacitly assumed that

613
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,220
if Qingqiu has another female monarch in future,

614
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,980
the sword competition will also be cancelled automatically.

615
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,860
If so,

616
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,380
Nie Chuyin has broken the rule

617
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,060
by requiring a sword competition today, right?

618
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,260
Unfortunately,

619
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,500
it's not recorded in the Ritual Book of Qingqiu,

620
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,900
so it doesn't count.

621
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,580
By coming here today,

622
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,020
he can get some benefits.

623
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,740
Anyway, he makes perfect sense.

624
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,900
Since the rules for

625
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,180
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony in Qingqiu remain the same,

626
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,060
there should be a competition.

627
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,940
I've long heard that Her Highness Fengjiu
is extremely good at sword skills.

628
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,660
I'd like to compete with her.

629
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,020
Even if there should be a sword competition,

630
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,180
you and my daughter are not of the same generation.

631
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,980
How can you compete with her?

632
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,780
Please be self-dignified.

633
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,620
God Bai Yi, you wronged me again.

634
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,340
In Qingqiu,

635
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,060
Fengjiu belongs to the third generation.

636
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm also a third-generation demon lord.

637
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,740
In this case,

638
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,980
Fengjiu and I are of the same generation.

639
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,660
God Bai Yi,

640
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,260
I'm deeply engrossed in sword skills.

641
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,140
I want to compete with Her Highness Fengjiu sincerely.

642
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,460
I'm a demon,

643
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,860
but I'm not afraid to lose.

644
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,620
Her Highness Fengjiu is a goddess.

645
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,260
Is she afraid to lose?

646
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,700
It's supposed to be a competition within your clan.

647
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,740
After he said that,

648
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,500
it actually becomes a competition
between the descendants of the two clans.

649
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,260
Though gods and demons are on good terms
with each other these years,

650
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,500
there's actually animosity deep down.

651
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,780
Provoked by Demon Lord Nie

652
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,260
and watched by immortals
from the Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

653
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,620
Xiaojiu has no choice but to compete with him.

654
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,020
I just don't get it!

655
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,020
Why doesn't he fulfill his duty as a demon lord

656
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,860
instead of adding trouble to the event

657
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,820
and gaining the reputation of bullying the weak?

658
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,500
Father,

659
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,420
since Demon Lord Nie insists on competing with me

660
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,980
and it's hard to meet such a highly skilled sword master,

661
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,580
I'd like to have a try.

662
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,220
I can learn a lot for sure.

663
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,820
Your Highness, you're straightforward.

664
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,460
Well,

665
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,100
good!
