00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 47

3
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,580
Is it delicious?

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,260
The sugar fox that you made tastes the best.

5
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,220
If you like it, I'll cook some more for you.

6
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,380
I also like the purple potato cakes.

7
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,140
No, I won't cook them for you.

8
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,300
Why?

9
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,940
His Excellency and Her Highness

10
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,660
are really deeply attached to each other!

11
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,460
Yeah!

12
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
They love each other so much

13
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,140
that we all admire them.

14
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,860
It's really admiring!

15
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
Just seeing this, they admire us.

16
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,940
Hanging out during the day

17
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,620
is not as free as that in the evening.

18
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,700
I know somewhere quiet.

19
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,140
I can take you there.

20
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,700
Where?

21
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,940
Just go with me, then you will know.

22
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,580
You know I'm scared of snakes the most.

23
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,980
Why do you still take me here?

24
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,740
With my company,

25
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,660
they can't hurt you!

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,260
You are Aranya here.

27
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,020
It was with their care that you grew up!

28
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,460
Since Aranya was born,

29
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,700
she had been staying there.

30
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,420
Maybe they still know you.

31
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,100
Even if they know me, I dare not go inside.

32
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,660
Why do you take me here?

33
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
Do you still remember,

34
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,540
in the Fanyin Valley,

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,260
it was through this Python Formation that

36
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
we entered the Dream of Aranya by accident?

37
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,580
I'm wondering

38
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,820
if there is something secret in the Python Formation.

39
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,460
Really?

40
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,380
Can we get out?

41
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,900
After all, the Python Formation was made artificially,

42
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,860
which is different from the real one.

43
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,620
After you entered the dream,

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,020
I heard

45
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,660
the Dream of Aranya

46
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,580
accidentally drifted to

47
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,340
the Python Formation near the Jieyou Spring.

48
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,820
According to my observation,

49
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,940
the Dream of Aranya

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,700
is similar to the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

51
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,700
both of which are magic wards.

52
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,380
Since you could easily

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
break the Ten-evil Lotus Land to get out,

54
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,980
it may not be difficult to get out
of the Dream of Aranya, either.

55
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,660
Right?

56
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,260
As for this...

57
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,740
Unless you are injured.

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,780
So

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,820
you had been injured before entering the dream.

60
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,500
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Tell me the truth.

62
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
I don't think

63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,020
here you are as powerful as you are outside.

64
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,940
How did you get injured?

65
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,580
In order to enter the Dream of Aranya with you

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,380
without breaking it,

67
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,300
I had to discharge ninety percent of my power

68
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,140
to enter it in the flesh.

69
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,620
Discharge ninety percent of your power?

70
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,900
Then it must be...

71
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,700
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,340
you risked your life for me.

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,340
It's nothing.

74
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,020
I have gone through so many battles related to life and death.

75
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,500
Don't do such silly things any more.

76
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,460
I was not badly injured.

77
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,140
If you really don't want me to do silly things,

78
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,020
the only way is

79
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,740
to prevent yourself from silly behaviors.

80
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,780
How could you turn the topic to me again?

81
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,140
The Dream of Aranya

82
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,380
is different from the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

83
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
It's much bigger

84
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
and more powerful here.

85
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,020
I'm not sure that I can avoid hurting you

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,780
while using magic power to break it.

87
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,100
So

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,860
let's try to find out

89
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,540
something strange of the Python Formation.

90
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,660
How is it?

91
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,580
How?

92
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,620
If we want to get out of the Python Formation

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,740
and the Dream of Aranya,

94
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,340
we have to take the course of Aranya's life

95
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,140
to continue our way.

96
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,180
We can only do this for the time being.

97
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,140
Let's go.

98
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Moye once told me that

99
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,740
he left the Fanyin Valley

100
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,940
after the event of Quanyin Beast happened.

101
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,780
Shen Ye and Aranya stayed in the mansion.

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,620
Although they didn't show their heart to each other,

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,460
they were deeply attracted to each other

104
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,740
with a sweet life.

105
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,940
Really?

106
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,700
If I have to

107
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,860
take the life course of Aranya,

108
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,900
then I have to...

109
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,340
Naturally, you can't do that.

110
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,180
Then just do as what we said before.

111
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,180
I can keep a distance with Shen Ye.

112
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,820
Moye also told me that

113
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,060
I didn't need to care much about the details.

114
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,780
When I have to make any choices for the big events,

115
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
if I do the same as Aranya did, that's OK.

116
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,580
Did Su Moye tell you

117
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,940
what the next big event was?

118
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
His Majesty's demise.

119
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,460
It seems to be a long time before that.

120
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,980
Let's go back now.

121
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Having walked for a whole day, I even have blisters on my feet.

122
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,780
Really?

123
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,140
I will give you a foot massage.

124
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,780
What's wrong?

125
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,820
It's nothing.

126
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,180
You can go back first.

127
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,260
What are you going to do?

128
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,700
Don't worry.

129
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,260
I'll be back soon.

130
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,900
Who sent the letter here?

131
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,860
It turned out that you went to take the cotton rose ointment.

132
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Was it necessary for you to behave so secretly?

133
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,660
There isn't cotton rose here.

134
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,980
So I can't make cotton rose ointment.

135
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,100
Then I just took this.

136
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,340
Are you going to

137
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,700
hide everything from me?

138
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,580
Why do you think so?

139
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,900
What about this?

140
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,180
How can you explain it?

141
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,580
It's not worth mentioning.

142
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,820
No need to let it disturb you.

143
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,980
It says in the letter that

144
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,340
this is the fifth letter.

145
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,020
No wonder that

146
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,540
I can always smell the flavor of ink.

147
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,020
You have burnt all the letters, right?

148
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,300
It doesn't matter.

149
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,780
I know what to do.

150
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,140
The magic instrument that you asked him to make

151
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,860
has come to the last stage.

152
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,340
As for such masterly magic instrument,

153
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,300
it is the most dangerous when it comes into being.

154
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,140
If it can't be made successfully,

155
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,340
all the efforts will be in vain.

156
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,660
There may also be backfire.

157
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,460
So you'd better go back quickly.

158
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,380
As for Shen Ye...

159
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,300
I know how to behave properly with Shen Ye.

160
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm sure to deal with him well.

161
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,500
But I'll be out for a very long time.

162
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,580
Very long?

163
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,340
How long is it?

164
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,740
Several months?

165
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,820
Several years?

166
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,220
Well...

167
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,140
At least several days.

168
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,380
It's just several days.

169
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,220
You said as if you were away for a long time.

170
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Absence sharpens love.

171
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,220
Isn't it long enough?

172
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,380
How could you say that

173
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,300
you were not good at talking?

174
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,740
Your Highness.

175
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,620
Your Excellency.

176
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,420
What's wrong? Chacha.

177
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,140
Tell me!

178
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,100
Here is message from the palace that

179
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,940
His Majesty and Her Majesty haven't seen you for a long time,

180
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,220
so they asked you to go to the palace

181
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,660
to relieve their lovesickness.

182
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,740
I pay respects to father and mother!

183
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,740
Rise!

184
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,700
Thank you, father.

185
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,500
How are you doing these days?

186
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,100
Father, I'm fine.

187
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,940
I heard that Lord Xi Ze had been living
in your mansion these days.

188
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,420
How do you get on with each other?

189
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,300
We get on peacefully

190
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,140
with each other.

191
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,500
It's good.

192
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,700
Just peacefully?

193
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,740
Rumor has it that

194
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,100
Lord Xi Ze and you are closely attached to each other,

195
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,780
which is very admiring.

196
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,540
Mother,

197
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,020
I did go out with Lord Xi Ze

198
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,420
to the fair,

199
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,940
but we didn't do anything that degraded
the decency of the imperial family.

200
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,940
Never mind.

201
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,820
Xi Ze used to be cold.

202
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,860
Since he is kind to you,

203
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,260
we feel very happy for you.

204
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,380
Thank you for caring about me.

205
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,580
If you don't have anything to say, you can leave now.

206
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,420
OK.

207
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,060
By the way,

208
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,060
Shen Ye is making swords in your mansion, isn't he?

209
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,380
How is it going?

210
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,860
Though I don't know much about making swords,

211
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
yet I have never heard

212
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,220
he had any worries

213
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,460
or troubles.

214
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,780
So I think

215
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,180
his work goes smoothly.

216
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
You think it's smooth?

217
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,940
Such important weapons are being forged in your mansion.

218
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,140
Shouldn't you go to ask something about them?

219
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,660
You're right, mother.

220
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,180
I'm going back to see how it is going.

221
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,380
Well,

222
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,300
I can go back with her

223
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,420
to see how it is going.

224
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,220
Good.

225
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,420
As mother and daughter, you hardly have chances
to talk with each other.

226
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,700
Go ahead.

227
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,220
Then you can have a talk with your father

228
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,220
and wait for me for a while.

229
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,180
I will.

230
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,260
Mother, you know how to make swords, right?

231
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,740
No.

232
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,980
Could it be that you want to take the chance

233
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,940
to talk something with me personally?

234
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,420
Why did Xi Ze have a fancy for you suddenly?

235
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,620
Mother, you are so strange.
How could you ask me such a question?

236
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,100
Lord Xi Ze has been my husband for a long time.

237
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,780
But I heard that

238
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,620
Lord Xi Ze always lived on the Qi Nan Mountain.

239
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,620
Your marriage just existed in the name only.

240
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,300
Mother,

241
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
those are just rumors.

242
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,580
Lord Xi Ze and I are always attracted to each other.

243
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,940
Could it be that

244
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
you prefer to believe the slanders of the evil people

245
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,340
rather than believe your daughter?

246
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,180
How dare you talk to me like this?

247
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,700
Please calm your anger, mother.

248
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,900
I was just telling the truth.

249
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,380
I'm wondering why you suddenly mentioned Xi Ze.

250
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,540
Could it be that you are worried

251
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,980
after hearing we love each other?

252
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,820
Relying on Xi Ze's favor,

253
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
you dare to talk with me like this.

254
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,380
I dare not.

255
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,740
Aranya's mother

256
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,460
really hates her so much.

257
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,460
Mother.

258
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,020
Let me take you to the sword forging room.

259
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,420
No need. I can go there myself.

260
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,780
It's so strange today.

261
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,060
Your Majesty, it's not a long time after your last visit.

262
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,740
Aren't you afraid of His Majesty's suspicion?

263
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,500
Don't worry.

264
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,420
He allowed me to come here.

265
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,740
I don't need to worry about anything.

266
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,220
I'm not the one who is to rebel.

267
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,380
Anyhow,

268
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,860
I won't get you involved in it.

269
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,660
You are not as calm as before.

270
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,540
Today I come here

271
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,500
to ask you again.

272
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,700
If you'd like to join me,

273
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,780
tell me your opinions.

274
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,460
If not,

275
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,820
just tell me directly.

276
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,700
Even without you,

277
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,580
I will still take actions.

278
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,740
Your Highness.

279
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,020
Your Highness.

280
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,660
What's wrong?

281
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,260
The steward said that

282
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,740
Lord Shen Ye invited you to the Mengchun Courtyard.

283
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,940
What?

284
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,700
He invited me to the Mengchun Courtyard?

285
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,700
Yes.

286
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,340
Did he tell you why?

287
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,420
I asked steward and he said he didn't know.

288
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,060
I got it.

289
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,380
I'll be there soon.

290
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,500
Do you know what that is?

291
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,220
It seems to be a magic instrument.

292
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,500
What is it used for?

293
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,940
It is the Glaze Lamp,

294
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,940
which can collect primordial spirit and memories.

295
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,860
Collect primordial spirit?

296
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,980
Inside of it

297
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
is Aranya's primordial spirit.

298
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,820
I made this dream

299
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,260
to bring Aranya back to life.

300
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,540
It was you

301
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
who made the Dream of Aranya!

302
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,660
Didn't you say that

303
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,220
you felt pity for Aranya?

304
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,260
I don't want to know who you are.

305
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,620
But

306
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,020
I want to tell you

307
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,300
I'm not as ruthless as you said.

308
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,340
My heart is in the dream.

309
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,380
This place

310
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,420
was made to bring Aranya back to life.

311
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,180
I have been using the Glaze Lamp

312
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,820
to collect her primordial spirit,

313
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,620
hoping that

314
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,700
she could come back to me.

315
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,180
So

316
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,140
the demon is not in Aranya's heart

317
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,260
but yours.

318
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,660
Yeah.

319
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Since she died,

320
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,380
I have been in this dream

321
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,940
experiencing her life with her

322
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,900
and collecting her primordial spirit

323
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,100
the moment she died.

324
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,100
Aranya

325
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,060
will know

326
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,660
you have such deep love for her.

327
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,620
After the Earth Immortals die,

328
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,180
can they come back to life again?

329
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,420
With natural death,

330
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,820
the same as ordinary people, the Earth Immortals

331
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,900
can use Spirit-Forming Lantern or other ways

332
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,380
to come back to life again.

333
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,140
Even if the primordial spirit is vanished without trace

334
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,220
and the Spirit-Forming Lantern can do nothing,

335
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,540
as long as this dream is made,

336
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,780
everything can start from the very beginning

337
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,060
and even the dead can come back to life.

338
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,660
Moye and I missed a play.

339
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,980
I am still guilty about it.

340
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,180
Unexpectedly, you were also acting.

341
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,180
Why do you tell me now?

342
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,220
I didn't want to tell you,

343
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,260
but because of your appearance,

344
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,180
you have occupied Aranya's body,

345
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,740
everything has been different!

346
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,420
Xi Ze has changed.

347
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,860
The Stone Formation of Quanyin Beast has gone.

348
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,380
Even Qing Hua came to see me in advance.

349
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,260
Originally, in each life,

350
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,500
I can collect some part of

351
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,700
Aranya's primordial spirit.

352
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,180
Clearly I'm going to make it in this life.

353
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
But unexpectedly...

354
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,900
Beyond your expectation, maybe because of me,

355
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,740
all your efforts will be in vain.

356
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,340
I know

357
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,580
there must be someone secretly instructing you

358
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,260
to take Aranya's life course

359
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,020
to go on your performance.

360
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,380
He

361
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,900
is Su Moye, right?

362
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,620
Yeah, it's him.

363
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,980
He also wants to know what happened.

364
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,980
Why does he want to know it?

365
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,740
He is not qualified to know it.

366
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,300
Because of his appearance,

367
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,180
Aranya left me.

368
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,100
But in the last two years of Aranya's life,

369
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,820
he went to the West Sea.

370
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,940
What does he know?

371
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,700
He doesn't know Aranya's last choice.

372
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,700
If you want to get out of here,

373
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,660
you can only listen to me.

374
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,660
Because of you,

375
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,220
everything is changing.

376
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,380
Only by going back to the original course

377
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
can I finish collecting her primordial spirit.

378
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,580
You want to bring Aranya back to life.

379
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,140
Is it because you want to make up for your past mistakes?

380
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,780
What I have done wrong can't be changed.

381
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,660
I never wanted to cheat her.

382
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,860
Anyhow,

383
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,300
I must bring her back.

384
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,940
At that time, either she resents me

385
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,940
or regards me as a stranger,

386
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,700
I will tell her face to face that

387
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,500
there were too many misunderstandings between us

388
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,460
and we missed a lot.

389
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,980
I love her.

390
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,660
I don't want to lose her again.

391
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,260
OK.

392
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,260
I can help you.

393
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
It's not because of you

394
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
but Aranya.

395
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,020
She really had a miserable life.

396
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,340
I want her to come back to life again

397
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,020
and know that

398
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,420
someone is so deeply attached to her.

399
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,940
Who are you?

400
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,900
You wanted to kill me the moment you saw me.

401
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,100
Then don't blame me for breaking your plan.

402
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,340
Stay here.

403
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,820
What's wrong with you?

404
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,900
I've seen everything.

405
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,980
What did you see?

406
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,620
Aranya's memories.

407
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,140
Lingshu Stage.

408
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,980
Letters.

409
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,740
Quanyin Beast.

410
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,420
Both Aranya's primordial spirit and memories

411
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,740
have been in your body.

412
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,740
You're right.

413
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,860
Let me take you back.

414
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,940
Don't you always want to know what happened?

415
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Go to see it yourself!

416
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,940
Most are very trivial things.

417
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,380
Too many things happened.

418
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Just choose a time randomly.

419
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,940
You moved the Solanum pseudocapsicum trees
to the courtyard that day.

420
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,220
They have blossomed and born fruits by now.

421
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,740
There are also Solanum pseudocapsicum trees
in the Python Formation.

422
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,260
I used to eat such fruits when I was young.

423
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,660
It was said that there weren't such trees
in the Python Formation in the past.

424
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,260
But they rooted, sprouted

425
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
blossomed and fruited over a night.

426
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,500
Maybe the God also had compassion for me.

427
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,460
You did have true love with Aranya.

428
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,220
Aranya's love for you

429
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,060
was sincere and pure.

430
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,060
But you were

431
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,060
not that sincere to her.

432
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,180
Yeah.

433
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,620
Aranya loved me so deeply,

434
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,220
but I was too coward

435
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,780
and I didn't cherish her.

436
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,940
The period when Aranya stayed with you

437
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,220
was the happiest time in her life.

438
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,940
If everything had stopped at that moment,

439
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,940
it would be good.

440
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,380
It seemed that all the things happened later

441
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,140
made her feel sad.

442
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,980
Actually,

443
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,340
you can choose not to know her.

444
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,980
What did you see?

445
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,020
You and...

446
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,940
You and Aranya were playing chess.

447
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,860
And then?

448
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,860
Chacha came in.

449
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,780
Your Highness.

450
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,660
Your Excellency.

451
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,860
His Majesty...

452
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

453
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,460
Take it easy.

454
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Here comes the news from the palace that

455
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,940
His Majesty died of illness.

456
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,460
My father was always in good health.

457
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
How could he suddenly...

458
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:34,900
Wait for a moment.

459
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,420
Wait for me.

460
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,940
Leave the game as it is.

461
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,140
Wait for me to come back.

462
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,140
Go ahead.

463
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,380
I still remember these things.

464
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:36,860
What happened later?

465
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,220
Then Aranya went to the imperial palace,

466
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,780
seeing his father who was in the bed

467
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,260
without breath.

468
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,340
Although her father never liked Aranya,

469
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,620
she cried with deep sorrow.

470
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,660
I thought

471
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,820
she didn't like her father.

472
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,540
And then?

473
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,180
Aranya wanted to help Xiangli He

474
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,060
to deal with the funeral of her father.

475
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,980
But she was refused by her mother.

476
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,860
So she returned to her mansion alone.

477
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,300
Your Highness.

478
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,260
Where is Shen Ye?

479
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,260
Prince Xiangli He invited him

480
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,660
to return to the Qi Nan Palace moments ago

481
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,620
to host the funeral of His Majesty.

482
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,780
I was about to send someone to inform you of it

483
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,140
when you came back.

484
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,180
The archmage left just minutes ago.

485
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,820
I think he hasn't gone far.

486
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,820
You can leave now.

487
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,380
Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,300
It turns out that,

489
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,660
compared with me,

490
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,900
you care more about yourself.

491
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,900
You sent me this that day

492
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,620
to say goodbye to me.

493
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,060
Unexpectedly, I didn't feel it.

494
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,660
Aranya was eager to see you,

495
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,740
but you just left without a word

496
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,340
and didn't wait to see her for the last time.

497
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,820
Shen Ye.

498
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,860
What did you go for?

499
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,820
How can you be so selfish?

500
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,940
I couldn't control the situation,

501
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,140
which was beyond my expectation.

502
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,380
If it's possible,

503
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,060
could you please tell me

504
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,100
what Aranya was thinking in the end?

505
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,180
For example,

506
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,980
did she resent me?

507
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,940
No.

508
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,340
She didn't resent you.

509
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,380
She just felt a little regretful.

510
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Your farewell to her

511
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,860
was so veiled.

512
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,180
Later she was put into prison, right?

513
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,780
You, go over there.

514
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,340
Yes.

515
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,900
Guards.

516
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,780
Arrest Aranya!

517
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,020
Take her to the palace!

518
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,580
You...

519
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,060
What are you doing?

520
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,860
What did I commit?

521
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,860
Why do you arrest me?

522
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,620
Don't talk nonsense.

523
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,380
Take her away!

524
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:07,980
Yes.

525
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,260
Hurry up.

526
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,140
Uncle.

527
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,940
Aranya.

528
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,100
Do you confess your sin?

529
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,820
I don't know what I have committed.

530
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,700
Regicide!

531
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,780
How dare you say that you don't know your sin?

532
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,260
He who has a mind to beat his dog

533
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,340
will easily find a stick.

534
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,460
How stubborn you are!

535
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,100
If it goes on like this,

536
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,500
you're sure to be condemned to death.

537
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,420
Guards! Take Aranya away.

538
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,300
Put her into the prison to wait for punishments.

539
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,180
- Yes. - Yes.

540
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,860
Take her away!

541
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,540
This part

542
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,780
is too miserable!

543
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,220
How heartrending it is!

544
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,620
How could a mother

545
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,820
be so cruel to her biological daughter?

546
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,220
I didn't expect that

547
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,220
Qing Hua put Aranya to death behind me.

548
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,020
The biggest mistake I made in my life

549
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,140
was that I misread her.

550
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,460
Aranya did believe Qing Hua's mischief

551
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,860
and intended to die.

552
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,260
With thousands of arrows penetrating her heart,

553
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,780
living is no better than dying,

554
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,860
which is such a feeling!

555
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,340
I have told you that

556
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,860
what I did is to cheat Qing Hua.

557
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,980
No matter what you said is true or false, just put it aside.

558
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,980
Even if it's true,

559
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,180
how could Aranya know it then?

560
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,700
Aren't the incontestable evidence

561
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,980
and words more reliable?

562
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,620
I remember Moye ever told me that

563
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,180
he asked Aranya

564
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,780
if she resented you some day,

565
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,460
what the reason would be.

566
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,820
Do you know her answer?

567
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,660
Aranya said

568
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,140
it must be the reason that she got you

569
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,620
but lost you again.

570
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,580
For example, you fell in love with her

571
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,060
but gave up her later

572
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,860
and loved another person.

573
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,460
I pay my respect to Your Majesty.

574
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,660
Why are you in a panic?

575
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,780
Leave us alone.

576
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,460
Yes.

577
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:44,940
Sister.

578
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,620
It was reported that

579
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,900
they had made it.

580
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,460
Was it big enough?

581
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,340
I'm wondering if the night owls clan will dispatch troops.

582
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,060
Don't worry, sister.

583
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,580
The place attacked

584
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,540
happened to be under the administration
of the Eldest Prince of the night owls clan,

585
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,420
who has a hot temper

586
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,660
and is a born fighter.

587
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,900
It's unreasonable that he won't be tricked.

588
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,580
Sounds good!

589
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,740
As for me,

590
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,620
I have well-prepared

591
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,020
and am ready to dispatch troops anytime.

592
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,420
It's done!

593
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,180
The magic instrument that you want to forge

594
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,500
turns out to be a mirror.

595
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,420
This is

596
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,940
the Miaohua Mirror.

597
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Miaohua Mirror?

598
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,260
As for the Miaohua Mirror in the Sky Kingdom,

599
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,780
I have heard of it.

600
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,740
The two...

601
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,900
It was modeled on that one.

602
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,100
But I have made some changes.

603
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,940
Although it's small,

604
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,180
as for the dead people's previous life and present life,

605
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,300
we can see all of them through this mirror.

606
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,380
You mean,

607
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,220
through this mirror,

608
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,420
we can see

609
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,500
how Aranya died.

610
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,780
Yeah.

611
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,260
I never knew

612
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,980
there was such a magic instrument in the world,

613
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,020
which can show the previous and present life of an immortal.

614
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,260
It's really fantastic!

615
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,860
I infer that

616
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,460
it was Shen Ye

617
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,180
who made the Dream of Aranya.

618
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,380
Shen Ye?

619
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,620
Then,

620
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,140
what did he want to do?

621
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,580
I don't know.

622
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,140
Well,

623
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,140
let's see what he did

624
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,820
and then find out the relationship

625
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,700
between Xiaobai and Aranya.

626
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,340
Then

627
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
let's start from the first time that

628
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,020
Shen Ye met Aranya.

629
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,100
I remember Aranya said

630
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,260
the first time she saw Shen Ye

631
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,820
was when she was young.

632
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,340
It was Shen Ye's birthday.

633
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,940
Are you sick?

634
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,900
There is no medicine in the Fanyin Valley

635
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,340
better than the blood of the archmage.

636
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,540
Let me save you.

637
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,900
It appeared that

638
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,380
the real first meeting

639
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,660
was much earlier than she knew.

640
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,580
Although you live in the snake nest,

641
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,220
you are not a snake.

642
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,460
You are the princess of the inseparable king bird clan.

643
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,980
So you must have a name.

644
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,420
Since your parents don't want to give you a name,

645
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,340
let me give you a name, OK?

646
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,380
Aranya.

647
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,140
This is your name.

648
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,140
If I say this word,

649
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,180
it means I am calling you. Understand?

650
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,900
Aranya.

651
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,620
Are you OK?

652
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,060
It turned out that

653
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,060
Shen Ye ever raised Aranya with his blood

654
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,740
when he was young.

655
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,940
And the words on Aranya's arm

656
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,540
were also carved by Shen Ye.

657
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,340
According to this,

658
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,580
their fate

659
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,940
was much deeper than mine

660
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,860
from the very beginning.

661
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,180
Fate

662
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,260
is always marvelous.

663
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,060
I always thought

664
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,220
it was Aranya herself

665
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,300
who desired for the fate with Shen Ye.

666
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,900
Clearly,

667
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,540
it's not true.

668
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,380
Shen Ye didn't seem to

669
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,500
be sincere to Aranya.

670
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,580
If not, how could he stand by and see her go die?

671
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,900
Could it be that Shen Ye changed his mind

672
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,900
after he grew up?

673
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,420
Do you want to go on watching it?

674
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,940
As for what happened later,

675
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,980
I know it generally.

676
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,100
Your Majesty.

677
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,940
Can we start watching from His Majesty's demise

678
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,460
and the time when Aranya was put into prison?

679
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,700
I want to know

680
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,540
if Shen Ye tried to save her.

681
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,260
OK.
