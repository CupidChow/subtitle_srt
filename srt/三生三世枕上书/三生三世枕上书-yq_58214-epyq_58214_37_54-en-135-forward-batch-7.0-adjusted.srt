00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 54

3
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,660
You're finally back.

4
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,620
Have you seen Dong Hua?

5
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,180
I waited for him for so long.

6
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,020
Why didn't he come back?

7
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,100
Why did he lie to me?

8
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,860
I waited for him for so long like a fool.

9
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,060
Which word he said is true?

10
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,580
Fengjiu,

11
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,020
you're pregnant.

12
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,500
Feel relieved.

13
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,100
Your uncle and I will be here for you.

14
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,780
Your Majesty!

15
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,980
I pay respect to Your Majesty!

16
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,380
I still need to cultivate in reclusion

17
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,900
to refine and blend the dark energy inside my body.

18
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,020
Your Majesty, I'm willing
to serve you at the expense of my life.

19
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,420
When I'm not around,

20
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,780
you shall be the one

21
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,980
to lead the demons.

22
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,140
Yes!

23
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,300
This is how it feels to have power.

24
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,340
Gods,

25
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,900
just wait!

26
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,340
Xiaojiu!

27
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,260
Xiaojiu!

28
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,140
Yan,

29
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,220
why are you here?

30
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,220
Aren't the demons...

31
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,180
I've got something urgent to attend to.

32
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,540
Do you know where Xiaojiu is?

33
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,060
Today is their wedding day.

34
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,380
How come they are both missing?

35
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,060
That's why I'm here.

36
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,780
For the demons, the ice face...

37
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,780
Your Highness!

38
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,900
- Chong Lin! - Chong Lin, how come you're...

39
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,620
Something bad has happened in the Fanyin Valley.

40
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,740
His Majesty asked you to meet him
at the entrance right away.

41
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,020
Your Majesty!

42
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,580
Miao Luo has broken out of the Miaoyi Chasm.

43
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,780
Please maintain the ward. I'm going inside.

44
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,220
The valley is filled with dark energy.

45
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,140
How can you go inside?

46
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,700
Protected by the golden blood,

47
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,900
the dark energy can't hurt me,

48
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,820
I'll leave it to you.

49
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,100
Miao Luo is out?

50
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,380
How are the demons now?

51
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,260
What about Xu Yang?

52
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,140
Didn't he stop Miao Luo from stealing the blood tear?

53
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,100
Demon Lord Xu Yang is dead.

54
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,100
Miao Luo!

55
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,980
I'm gonna kill you!

56
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,900
Yan,

57
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,300
His Majesty is the only one
who can handle Miao Luo in the whole word.

58
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,660
If you go inside now, you'll get yourself killed.

59
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,540
So what?

60
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,820
I'll never spare her!

61
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,780
Calm down!

62
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,780
The royal members
of the inseparable king birds are probably dead.

63
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
If the Fanyin Valley opens,

64
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,100
all the living creatures
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts will suffer.

65
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,260
Guarding this place

66
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,140
is the first step to restrain Miao Luo.

67
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,060
All you know is to draw out your sword.
What's the use of that?

68
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,180
As a demon lord,

69
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,980
the last lesson you need to learn is that

70
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,940
putting away your sword is
for drawing out your sword better.

71
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,620
Fengjiu, are you OK?

72
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,660
How are you?

73
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,460
Haven't heard from you in the Sky Kingdom,

74
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,740
I came to visit you in Qingqiu.

75
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,740
His Majesty didn't come.

76
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,380
I've given him time,

77
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,900
but he still stays in the demon clan.

78
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,660
There's no one else here.

79
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,500
If you feel sad deep in your heart,

80
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,260
just have a good cry.

81
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,420
I don't want to cry.

82
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,300
I just can't understand it.

83
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,980
Fengjiu,

84
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,900
feel relieved.

85
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,140
No matter what happens, His Majesty is sure to come back.

86
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
By then, we'll definitely ask him

87
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,820
to explain to you until you're satisfied.

88
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,020
Cheng Yu,

89
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,340
His Majesty loved me a lot

90
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,580
in the Dream of Aranya.

91
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,380
If he finds Ji Heng pitiful

92
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,420
and wants to stay by her side,

93
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,820
he just needs to tell me.

94
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,140
I won't force him to marry me.

95
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,100
Even if I'm...

96
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,860
I won't force him to stay.

97
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,300
Fengjiu...

98
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,340
I dare not tell my father, either.

99
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,900
I'm afraid that if he knows, he'll get mad

100
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,660
and go to argue with His Majesty.

101
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,060
After all,

102
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,340
love must be mutual.

103
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Fengjiu, wait for me.

104
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,580
I'll go and find Lian Song.

105
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,740
He surely knows where His Majesty is.

106
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,300
I'll definitely help you.

107
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,340
Having been refined by Miao Luo,
the dark energy in the Miaoyi Chasm

108
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
is harder to purify than that of the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

109
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,620
I have to find a way to suppress it.

110
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,420
I should find Miao Luo right away
and destroy her with the dark energy.

111
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,580
Send another one hundred demon soldiers
to the Baishui Mountain.

112
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,660
Yes!

113
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,620
Demon Lord Nie,

114
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,260
we haven't started a war against the gods yet.

115
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,340
Is it too...

116
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,620
You should figure out the current situation.

117
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,180
Who is the leader of the demons?

118
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,140
I'm calling the shots now.

119
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,620
You!

120
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,940
We're both demon lords. How can you...

121
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,700
Just leave.

122
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,060
Yes!

123
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,460
It's been three days.

124
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,860
Here are one fetus protection pill

125
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,300
and one abortion pill.

126
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,180
I'll keep your secret

127
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,580

His Majesty and I

160
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,220
have really gone a long way.

161
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,940
In the first half of the journey,
I was the one who kept chasing after him.

162
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,940
It was hard,

163
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,500
but luckily, I was blessed by heaven

164
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,540
and I finally caught up with him.

165
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,140
Because I was the one who wanted him from the very start,

166
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,580
however tired I was,

167
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,700
I felt OK.

168
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,940
He does love me,

169
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,180
but he may also have feelings for Ji Heng.

170
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,740
When I fell into the Dream of Aranya

171
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
and struggled between life and death,

172
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,900
he chose me.

173
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,460
But now Ji Heng is in danger,

174
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,340
so he chooses Ji Heng.

175
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,340
Having failed

176
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
to keep his word,

177
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,700
he's ashamed to meet me in Qingqiu.

178
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,580
This love was hard-earned,

179
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,500
and I've always wanted to treasure it.

180
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,020
But I'm really too tired.

181
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,340
Your Majesty, I've tried.

182
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,180
I've given you enough time.

183
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,380
As long as you can come,

184
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,300
I'll believe anything you say,

185
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,820
but you didn't come.

186
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,820
Now that I'm also pregnant,

187
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,340
♪ Hide the hopeless dream in the bedside sleeve. ♪

188
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,260
I can't stay in Qingqiu anymore.

189
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,420
Your Majesty,

190
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,940
♪ That's my craving for all my life. ♪

191
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,580
from now on,

192
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,940
I'll live my life without you.

193
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,940
♪ ...so torturous. ♪

194
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,180
I can't fully purify the dark energy inside.

195
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,900
On the opening date of the Fanyin Valley,

196
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,620
we won't be able to stop the dark energy
from leaking outside.

197
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,580
What shall we do?

198
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,140
We have to find a magic instrument

199
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,100
to seal the Fanyin Valley,

200
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,300
thus resolving future trouble once and for all.

201
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,220
Why are you all here?

202
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,020
Who's accompanying Xiaobai?

203
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh, gosh!

204
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,500
I forgot to visit Xiaojiu on my way.

205
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:45,980
Your Majesty!

206
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,300
Ice face!

207
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:47,860
Your Majesty!

208
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,140
When he wakes up,

209
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,540
please teach him

210
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,180
some cultivation tips.

211
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,980
When he's ready to ascend to heaven,

212
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,900
I'll help him wash away the mortal dust
in the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool,

213
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,900
so that he can become an immortal.

214
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,860
You...

215
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,660
I'm fine.

216
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,100
I've thought through everything these days,

217
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,900
and I'm all set.

218
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,900
When I come back from the mortal realm,

219
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,260
I'll drink with you again.

220
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,820
You're going to the mortal realm?

221
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,220
According to the rituals of Qingqiu,

222
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,620
once I become the monarch,

223
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,300
I have to experience the mortal realm.

224
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,620
I was delayed by many things,

225
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,260
but it's not too late to go now.

226
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,260
Well,

227
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,740
I've got a charm for you. Put it away first.

228
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,700
If I'm still not back

229
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,900
when Qingti is about to ascend to heaven,

230
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,820
use it to inform me,

231
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,380
and then I'll come back to find you.

232
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:06,820
OK.

233
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,820
I loved to eat sweet food the most,

234
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,740
but now I love to eat salty food.

235
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,780
Gungun, you like salty food, right?

236
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,260
Gungun,

237
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,820
you must be white and chubby.

238
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,100
After you grow up,

239
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
I'll take you to Qingqiu to meet our family.

240
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,500
But what I fear the most is that

241
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,900
your grandpa and grandma will force

242
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,580
your father to take his responsibilities.

243
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,220
So I have no choice but to act first and report afterwards.

244
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,340
Sorry to make you go through all this.

245
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,180
What to do now?

246
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,980
No wonder I couldn't find you however hard I tried.

247
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,060
Fengjiu went to experience the mortal realm

248
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,500
without leaving a message.

249
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,620
Who knew they would miss each other like that.

250
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,340
One day in heaven equals one year on earth.

251
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,620
How sad she will be when she stays in the mortal realm.

252
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,420
No!

253
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,380
I'll find Si Ming

254
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,380
and see if he's got some other ways.

255
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,260
Your Highness, please decide as early as possible.

256
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,620
Later,

257
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,220
the Sky Kingdom may not be so stable.

258
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,340
Though His Majesty is busy looking for Her Highness Fengjiu,

259
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,700
he still remembers to find a new place

260
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,140
for us to settle down.

261
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,180
Inseparable king birds are caring and loyal.

262
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,220
Your royal members sacrificed themselves in the valley

263
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,820
for the safety of the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

264
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,700
His Majesty won't forget the favor.

265
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,580
Leave the tragedy of the Fanyin Valley in the Fanyin Valley.

266
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,580
That's the wish of our royal members.

267
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,220
Immortal Official Chong Lin,

268
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,700
please tell His Majesty.

269
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,660
Since it's a disaster for the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

270
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
the inseparable king birds

271
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,580
certainly have no reason to avoid it.

272
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,140
I'd like to lead the inseparable king birds

273
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,580
to fight alongside the gods.

274
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,100
Your Highness.

275
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,180
All my families are gone.

276
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,660
I'm the only royal member left.

277
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
The inseparable king birds
have chosen me to be their monarch.

278
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Your Majesty.

279
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,060
My decision is the common decision of my people.

280
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,140
Miao Luo owes us a huge debt of blood.

281
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,180
We must make her pay.

282
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,340
If she's not killed,

283
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,140
no place is safe for us in the world.

284
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,780
I request His Majesty to keep us

285
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
to resist the enemies with gods.

286
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,420
However, Immortal Official Chong Lin,

287
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,740
please take the old, the weak, women,
and children of our clan somewhere safe

288
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,420
for they don't have the power to fight.

289
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,580
Yes.

290
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,620
I'll definitely report your resolution

291
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,940
to His Majesty.

292
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,580
Demon Lord Yan asked His Majesty

293
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,900
to send you a message.

294
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,340
He said that

295
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,020
now the demon clan is not stable.

296
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,740
After Miao Luo is killed,

297
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,900
he'd like to share his land

298
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,700
with the inseparable king birds.

299
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,340
Demon Lord Yan was always a good friend to my elder brother,

300
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,220
but the demon clan is not a good place
for the inseparable king birds.

301
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Immortal official Chong Lin, if there are still

302
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,420
inseparable king birds left after Miao Luo is killed,

303
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,220
please take them to Qingqiu.

304
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,660
My elder brother always

305
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,300
wanted to visit there.

306
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,580
Yes.

307
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,780
Elder brother,

308
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,700
did you have any regret in your heart?

309
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,380
Just let everything miserable come to end
after the tragedy of Aranya and the end of your life.

310
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,860
Though your love was not responded to,

311
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,060
you died for what you believed.

312
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,660
The tragedy of the Fanyin Valley won't repeat itself.

313
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,460
From today on,

314
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,300
I'll become a monarch of indomitable spirit!

315
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,100
Gungun has gone to school.

316
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,580
Life in the mortal realm is really boring.

317
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,380
I might as well find a quiet place

318
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,860
and live in reclusion for a while.

319
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,260
Mother! Mother! I'm back!

320
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,340
Gungun, you're back!

321
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,380
Your hair turns white.

322
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,700
Come on, it needs dyeing.

323
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,780
Sit down.

324
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,540
Mother,

325
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,700
why do other students at school

326
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,140
have black hair,

327
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,380
while my hair is born silver?

328
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,900
Because we're immortals.

329
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,220
The color of our hair is certainly different.

330
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,060
Do other little immortals look like me?

331
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,620
Of course not.

332
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,180
Of course, some of them do look like you.

333
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,820
When you go back

334
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,060
and see Li, you'll see.

335
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,980
Mother, who is Li?

336
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,180
He's also a little immortal.

337
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,100
You should call him "Uncle".

338
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,780
Does he also have silver hair?

339
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,180
No, his hair is black.

340
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,420
We're both little immortals.

341
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,020
How come we have different hair colors?

342
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,140
Actually, as immortals, we don't

343
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,780
care much about our hair colors,

344
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,300
but since we're in the mortal realm,

345
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,180
we have to follow the mortal rules.

346
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,260
Sit still. It's time to dye your hair.

347
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,300
Let's go back to the Sky Kingdom.

348
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,420
Then I don't have to dye my hair.

349
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,340
OK. We'll go back.

350
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,580
But I want to

351
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,220
take you around to see the mortal realm.

352
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,940
OK, as you wish.

353
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,900
Fengjiu is really good at cooking.

354
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,060
There's no dish she can't make in the world,

355
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,860
but there's only one dish that she doesn't make,

356
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,420
and that's the qilin plant.

357
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,020
It's not because

358
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,660
she hates it

359
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,540
due to its taste or property.

360
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,460
It's just that the qilin plant

361
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,260
only grows in the Sukhavati,

362
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,140
and it can't grow anywhere else.

363
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,820
As a child, she loved to eat the qilin plant,

364
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,500
so she wanted to grow one in Qingqiu.

365
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,780
It took her three hundred years.

366
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,460
She missed many classes

367
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,860
and was beaten cruelly by her father several times.

368
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,180
It really took a lot of work.

369
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,980
She felt so tired,

370
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,500
so she gave it up completely.

371
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,540
From then on,

372
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,740
she never ate the qilin plant,

373
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,020
let alone using it to make dishes.

374
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,940
She can be really stubborn

375
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,900
sometimes.

376
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,500
Cold-hearted as Bai Qian is,

377
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,420
she's actually warm-hearted

378
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,980
compared to Fengjiu.

379
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,260
What's more,

380
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,140
Fengjiu is not aware that

381
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,660
she's somewhat heartless.

382
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,060
Instead, she always finds herself sentimental and emotional.

383
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,220
It's just like she has never noticed that

384
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,500
she wouldn't eat the qilin plant any more.

385
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,500
What a great metaphor!

386
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,780
Now His Majesty

387
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,900
is another qilin plant abandoned by her.

388
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
As the Emperor of the Three Realms,

389
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,420
His Majesty has his own difficulties.

390
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,740
If the vast universe becomes unstable...

391
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,500
In our family, we don't restrain our children.

392
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,020
She can go anywhere she wants

393
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,540
to experience the world.

394
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,500
We never stop her.

395
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,780
If you ask me,

396
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,940
I really don't know where she has gone.

397
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,900
Actually, if His Majesty really wants to

398
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,420
find her, he should have a way.

399
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,020
However, I'm just worried that

400
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,620
His Majesty has given the last chance

401
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,740
to Her Highness Fengjiu.

402
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,740
Like His Majesty,

403
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,540
Gungun loves to eat the cakes I make.

404
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,540
Mother! Mother!

405
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,780
I'm back.

406
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,740
Look what I've made for you.

407
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
The chestnut cake!

408
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,100
Wash your hands before you eat.

409
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,300
Mother,

410
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,820
why do you have four pieces,

411
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,940
while I just have three?

412
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,580
Because I'm an adult,

413
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,020
and you're a little boy.

414
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,900
I can eat one more piece than you.

415
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,620
Mother,

416
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,580
my schoolmates' mothers

417
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,060
never grab their cakes.

418
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,620
But we're immortals.

419
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,020
As to such things, we certainly should

420
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,300
follow the immortal rules.

421
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,900
Is that so?

422
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,460
But you once said

423
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,980
we were in the mortal realm,

424
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,700
so we should follow the mortal rules.

425
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,540
Did I say that?

426
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,180
Under this circumstance,

427
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,220
we still have to follow the immortal rules.

428
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,940
Otherwise, what if we forget about the immortal rules

429
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,860
when we're back to the fairy land?

430
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,780
Fine.

431
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,740
We'll move to another place in a few days.

432
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,780
Mother,

433
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,100
we're fine living in the publishing house.

434
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,660
Why should we move?

435
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,660
If we move,

436
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,540
I won't be able to play with my friends.

437
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,740
Because you're a little immortal.

438
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,900
Your appearance

439
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
remains the same

440
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,100
for a very long time.

441
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,460
If we stay here

442
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,780
all the time,

443
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,980
those mortals will get suspicious.

444
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,100
So we have to keep moving.

445
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,940
I see.

446
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,780
Then after we move,

447
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,060
I'll go

448
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,620
wherever you go.

449
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,420
Eat another one!

450
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,740
In the mortal realm,

451
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,900
you saved Her Highness Fengjiu once.

452
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,540
To repay your favor,

453
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,020
Her Highness Fengjiu brought you back to life
with the pimpon fruit

454
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,580
and gave you half of her cultivation.

455
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,380
Time shifts and things change.

456
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,900
I suppose the mortal realm is completely different.

457
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,140
I should've been dead for a long time,
but now I'm an immortal.

458
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,460
Many mortal emperors have failed

459
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,460
to be immortal despite all their efforts.

460
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,180
By then,

461
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,060
according to the rules of Immortal Record Book,

462
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,060
the baptizing ceremony must be performed

463
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,300
by the one who gave you the body.

464
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,420
Her Highness Fengjiu will go to the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool

465
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,740
in person to baptize you

466
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,820
and help you ascend to heaven.

467
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,660
Get prepared.

468
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,140
What was my relationship
with Her Highness Fengjiu back then?

469
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,140
Reborn as an immortal, you forgot about

470
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,860
everything when you woke up.

471
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,700
It's good for you.

472
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,260
Why do you have to remember your dream

473
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,580
and add to your trouble?

474
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,460
Why did I have such a dream?

475
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,460
His Majesty is the Emperor of the Three Realms.

476
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,860
This won't happen to him for sure.

477
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,820
I suppose

478
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,940
he's fishing in Tai Chen Palace now.

479
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,540
What are you playing?

480
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,740
The spinning top. Haven't you played it before?

481
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,020
No.

482
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,500
It's so pretty.

483
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,420
Did you make it yourself?

484
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,500
No, my father made it.

485
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,780
Your father?

486
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,940
Yes, my father is awesome.

487
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,860
He can make not only spinning tops but kites.

488
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,060
If you like it,

489
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,660
you can ask your father to make one for you.

490
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,260
But I only have a mother. I don't have a father.

491
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,300
Why don't you have a father?

492
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,900
Isn't it enough to have a mother only?

493
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,580
But everyone has a mother and a father.

494
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,500
Everyone has a father?

495
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,500
Mother! Mother!

496
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Gungun, what's up?

497
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,620
Do I have a father?

498
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,700
No.

499
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,140
I gave birth to you myself.

500
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,900
But my schoolmates

501
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,620
all have their own father.

502
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,060
But you're a little immortal.

503
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,860
In the immortal realm,

504
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,300
it's possible for someone to have a mother but no father.

505
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,420
Why is the fairy land so different from the mortal realm?

506
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,060
In the mortal realm, adults don't grab kids' cakes.

507
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,220
Adults get up at midnight

508
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,100
to tuck their kids in.

509
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,860
Every kid must have their father.

510
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,860
Mother,

511
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,540
are you using the fairy land as an excuse

512
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,060
because I can't seek confirmation?

513
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Gungun, you must be too stressful due to your schoolwork.

514
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,300
You're not obedient now.

515
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,580
How about this?

516
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,780
Cut class tomorrow.

517
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,260
I'll take you to the mountains

518
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,020
to absorb the essence of the nature.

519
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,300
Mother, don't threaten me with food

520
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,260
every time you're in the wrong.

521
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,260
Ordinary magic instruments won't be able
to suppress the dark energy

522
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,500
of the Miaoyi Chasm, let alone

523
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,180
the entire Fanyin Valley.

524
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,180
Even God Zhe Yan can't...

525
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,940
I found it!

526
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,740
Where?

527
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,700
There's actually a way to seal the dark energy.

528
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,220
Are you OK?

529
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,180
Be careful when you're back.

530
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,060
Remember.

531
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,980
You said each race has closed their gate.

532
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,780
What does that mean?

533
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,260
Well,

534
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,780
Your Highness,

535
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,020
no race can send demons

536
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,020
to feed Her Majesty any more.

537
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:27,980
Please...

538
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,980
Let's wait and see.

539
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,060
Ye Hua and Bai Qian are out travelling.

540
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,620
I've sent people to look for them.

541
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,940
In a few days,

542
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,660
God Zhe Yan and God Bai Zhen
will also come to the Sky Kingdom

543
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,740
to discuss the important matter.

544
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,380
The Fanyin Valley is about to open.

545
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,980
We can't wait.

546
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,980
The starlight ward is so dangerous.

547
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,380
Plus, Bihai Cangling is closely linked to you.

548
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,220
If anything goes wrong with Bihai Cangling,

549
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,700
will you be in danger?

550
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,300
We'll know by then.

551
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,620
Dong Hua!

552
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,180
I'm all set.

553
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,580
I just...

554
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,420
Just what?

555
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,300
I just want to see her again.

556
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,420
You...

557
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,580
What on earth did His Majesty say?

558
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,140
Go back now and keep looking.

559
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,300
So he still wants to use Bihai Cangling

560
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,140
to seal the Fanyin Valley?

561
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,580
Over tens of thousands of years,

562
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,620
no one has ever opened the starlight ward.

563
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,700
As to the consequences...

564
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,540
Let's go!

565
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,620
It's time to eat.

566
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,660
Stop reading. Let's eat.

567
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,780
= Please come back to the Nether World =

568
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,020
Mother, what's this?

569
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,820
Gungun, it's time for us to go back to the fairy land.

570
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,140
Since you refuse to send any demon,

571
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,860
I may send you instead.

572
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,860
Demon Lord Yan,

573
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,260
why are you here?

574
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,140
Are you kicked out by the gods?

575
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,700
Nie Chuyin,

576
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,780
today will be your day to die.

577
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,380
I'm here to avenge Xu Yang's death.

578
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,940
Today,

579
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,300
I'll bury you with Xu Yang.

580
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,300
Tomorrow, when His Majesty decides the titles and ranks of

581
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,620
the immortals just ascending to heaven,

582
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,620
the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool will be opened for the last time.

583
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,740
In future, the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool
will be sealed forever.

584
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,260
The Sky Kingdom will no longer

585
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,900
list those who become immortals by rare chance

586
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,700
on the Immortal Record Book.

587
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,220
His Majesty wants to see you,

588
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,820
and he's finally thought of a good way

589
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,220
to find you.

590
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,060
If he had wanted to find me,

591
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,420
he would have found me long ago.

592
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,180
Now by doing so,

593
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,340
he's really cold-hearted.

594
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,300
He is...

595
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,900
Gungun is my son. His Majesty is his father.

596
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,100
He's the reason why you don't want to come back?

597
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,060
I'll go to the Sky Kingdom first.

598
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,100
As to him, could you

599
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,140
look after him for a couple of days?

600
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,660
Your Highness Fengjiu, please feel relieved.

601
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,940
Mother, can you take me with you?

602
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,500
I've never parted with you

603
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,420
my whole life.

604
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,780
Gungun, be a good boy.

605
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,220
I've really got something important to deal with.

606
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,820
I can't take you with me.

607
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,980
When it's finished,

608
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,500
I'll come back and pick you up right away.

609
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,580
Then promise me.

610
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,860
Make a promise. Keep it for one hundred years.

611
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,100
Please take care of him.

612
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,820
Thank you.

613
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,620
Yan,

614
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,100
see?

615
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,700
With your current cultivation,

616
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,220
you're no match for me.

617
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,660
Just go to hell!

618
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,460
No way!

619
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,340
I can

620
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,980
still fight!

621
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:49,940
Yan,

622
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,300
be reasonable.

623
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,700
As demons, we've been suppressed by gods
for tens of thousands of years.

624
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,100
Now,

625
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,260
after Dong Hua and Miao Luo are weakened by each other,

626
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,380
demons can

627
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,020
develop and flourish.

628
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,420
I'm afraid it'll be your golden opportunity

629
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,780
to replace the demon king.

630
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,860
If I can help demons develop and flourish,

631
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,220
why can't I replace her?

632
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,460
Don't chase rainbows!

633
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,940
Yan,

634
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,060
I'll give you one last chance.

635
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,020
Acknowledge allegiance to me,

636
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,780
and I'll guarantee the safety of your race.

637
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,300
Otherwise,

638
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,980
you'll die today.

639
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,660
Why are you laughing?

640
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,780
I'm laughing at you.

641
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,340
You're just a puppet.

642
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,540
You have no future.

643
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,820
Go to hell!

644
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,100
I've told you if you're disloyal,

645
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,420
you will come to no good end.

646
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,180
Your Majesty!

647
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,460
No! No!

648
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,500
Your Majesty!

649
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,140
No!

650
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,380
Miao Luo, I know Dong Hua's secret.

651
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,100
I'll tell you if you kill him.

652
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,260
Your Majesty, don't trust him.

653
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,940
He was close to Dong Hua in the Fanyin Valley.

654
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,020
They're on the same side.

655
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,420
Now it's your turn.

656
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,540
What's Dong Hua's secret?
