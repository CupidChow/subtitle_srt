1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 55

3
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,300
Qingti.

4
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,580
Your Highness.

5
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,500
We're still friends,

6
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,740
right?

7
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,780
Yes.

8
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:32,820
Your Highness.

9
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,420
How do you feel now?

10
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,420
Good. I'm almost back to normal.

11
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,420
Your Highness, thank you

12
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,700
for giving me an immortal body.

13
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,300
You died for me in the mortal realm.

14
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,140
I should thank you.

15
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,140
Immortal Qingti.

16
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm listening.

17
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,580
You are an immortal now

18
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,140
and you will be ranked

19
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,780
to serve your duty as an immortal official.

20
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
You were dead

21
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,620
and your former life was ended.

22
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,900
From now on, you should obey the rules of the immortals

23
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,420
and be a dutiful immortal.

24
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,420
I will.

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,260
Now I will cleanse away your mortal dust.

26
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,020
This is the holy water from the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool.

27
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,260
Spirits of heaven and earth
are concentrated in every drop of the water.

28
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,100
It takes a hundred year to collect just one drop.

29
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,700
Only the pure and clean water

30
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,780
can cleanse away your mortal dust.

31
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,660
Immortal Qingti.

32
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,220
Your ablution is over.

33
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

34
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,180
His Majesty wants to see you

35
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,740
in the side hall near the Qingyun Hall.

36
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,300
Immortal Qingti.

37
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,060
Go to the Qingyun Hall to receive your rank.

38
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,820
You are my peer now.

39
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,140
It'll be a pleasure working with you.

40
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,260
Me, too.

41
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,540
Waking up in spring, I find it boring reading.

42
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,340
Leaning against the railing,
I drink tea that is bitter-tasting.

43
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,620
The tea is not bitter though.

44
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,700
Old friends meet again.

45
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,300
How is the reunion scene

46
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,580
performed in opera?

47
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,820
There might be such a line.

48
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,420
"I haven't seen you for years.

49
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,500
Have you been doing well?"

50
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,780
You are the only one among these immortals

51
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,220
who's not ranked yet.

52
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,500
You didn't go through the cultivation process,

53
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,660
so you probably can't do anything well.

54
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,820
I think you should be the successor of emperor

55
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,380
of the Tai Chen Palace.

56
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,780
Among these jobs,

57
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,140
only the management of immortal books

58
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,460
is easier.

59
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,220
Chong Lin.

60
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,020
Yes.

61
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,660
Immortal Qingti, please go to the Tai Chen Palace with me.

62
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
You'd better start talking.

63
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,900
I've forgot about that.

64
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,100
I'll tell you when I remember.

65
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
The demons are so degenerated to end up with

66
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,980
you being the only demon lord left.

67
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,180
How pathetic!

68
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,340
While you were sealed in the Miaoyi Chasm,

69
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,540
it was we, the degenerating demon lords,

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,500
that ruled the demons for over 30 thousand years.

71
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,180
You don't have to feel sorry about it.

72
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,740
Glib talker.

73
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,660
Loser.

74
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,780
What?

75
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,420
I lost to Dong Hua

76
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,740
and got contained by the gods

77
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,180
because of you.

78
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,700
As a demon king, you were subjected to everywhere.

79
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,780
Now Dong Hua has recovered himself.

80
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,220
He will seal you again very soon.

81
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,660
I'd rather be killed by you once and for all

82
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,860
than deal with the mess after you are sealed.

83
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,860
Dong Hua can't regain his cultivation so soon.

84
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,580
The gods. They have all kinds of magic weapons.

85
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
The minor injury is not a big deal for him.

86
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,140
He has not only regained his cultivation,

87
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,100
but also sealed the Fanyin Valley.

88
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,660
He has sealed the Fanyin Valley?

89
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,220
I once fell into the Fanyin Valley by accident.

90
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,060
When I got out, I found that my power had increased.

91
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,260
That's when I knew that
the unique terrain in the Fanyin Valley

92
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,660
could help with recovering power.

93
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,060
Now the valley is full of

94
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,620
dark energy brought by you
for breaking out of the Miaoyi Chasm.

95
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,260
In order to keep dark energy from spilling out,

96
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,020
Dong Hua sealed the Fanyin Valley.

97
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,860
I didn't expect him to recover
so soon after leaving the valley.

98
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,060
So the Fanyin Valley played a key role here.

99
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,620
You said you fell into the Fanyin Valley by accident.

100
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,700
Do you still remember how to enter the valley?

101
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,580
Of course.

102
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,540
Why is His Majesty bringing herbal scents here?

103
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,180
He seems to lose a lot of weight.

104
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,740
And he looks so pale.

105
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,580
He's not in a good state.

106
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,620
It would be inappropriate for me

107
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,940
to ask him if he's doing well.

108
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,540
Would you like to have some tea?

109
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,180
Actually, you didn't have to
go to all that trouble of looking for me.

110
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I went to the mortal realm just to experience myself.

111
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,900
Eventually,

112
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,540
we would meet again in heaven.

113
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,220
You shouldn't have sealed

114
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,220
the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool.

115
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,540
If I hadn't,

116
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,060
would you show up?

117
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,460
I just wanted to see you.

118
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,060
Xiaobai.

119
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,740
I learned a saying in the mortal realm.

120
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,740
"It is better to forget about each other
than to live on each other."

121
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,980
That's so true.

122
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,180
It has been so many years.

123
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,620
How are you and she doing?

124
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,140
Who?

125
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,180
You are still the same.

126
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,580
You still can't tell

127
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,380
what you truly want.

128
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,580
I don't like her much.

129
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,900
But since you chose to stay with her

130
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,940
in the demons,

131
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,260
I have nothing else to say.

132
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,420
I've gone through the hardest time.

133
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,140
I'm doing well now.

134
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,380
And I hope the same for you.

135
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,420
It was my fault

136
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,580
that I didn't make it back in time.

137
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,220
I let Ji Heng go back to the demons.

138
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,660
I did all I could for her.

139
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,180
Is it my departure

140
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,660
that makes you feel like

141
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,900
I matter more than her to you?

142
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,380
Actually I didn't leave out of anger.

143
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,740
You don't need to be like this.

144
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,740
No one matters more than you.

145
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,740
No one matters more than you, Xiaobai.

146
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,660
I waited for so long for you.

147
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,340
You didn't make it to the wedding.

148
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,300
So I thought something happened to you.

149
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,620
I was in a panic.

150
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,780
But my father told me that you were with...

151
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, I didn't believe everything they said.

152
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,700
But I was waiting for you to come back

153
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,740
and explain to me.

154
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,460
I would believe

155
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,380
whatever you said.

156
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,100
If you had made it back,

157
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,540
and had told me that no one mattered more than me,

158
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
I would have believed it.

159
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,220
But now...

160
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,420
Xiaobai.

161
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,780
I was thinking about what you had said to me

162
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,260
when I was in Qingqiu.

163
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,540
Were they true or not?

164
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,980
But later I understood that

165
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,860
if you like him, whatever he says is true,

166
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,820
and if you don't like him any more,

167
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,060
whatever he says becomes a lie.

168
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,580
In fact, it's unnecessary to hold on to

169
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,980
the details.

170
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
I guess

171
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
you used to like me, right?

172
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,660
Fate is nothing

173
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,340
I can ask for.

174
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,740
I'm the female monarch of Qingqiu.

175
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,020
I have been trapped in love

176
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,460
for too long.

177
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,940
Now it seems like

178
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,060
we are both doing very well.

179
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,420
Your Majesty,

180
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,660
I guess that's it.

181
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
I am not doing well.

182
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,500
Are the people from Qingqiu making trouble with you

183
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,820
because of my relationship with you?

184
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,500
You don't have to be responsible for my reputation.

185
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,420
Why don't we go to Nuwa Empress's place
to divorce each other?

186
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,340
I will not divorce you, Xiaobai.

187
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,300
You are my wife

188
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,900
till the day I die.

189
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,740
You're...

190
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,540
I'm kind of scary today, right?

191
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,860
Don't be afraid.

192
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,140
In Bihai Cangling,

193
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,620
the pavilion you were asking for has been built.

194
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,660
And the fruit trees have been planted.

195
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,420
As for the spiritual birds in the immortal mountain,

196
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,220
I've had them dance on the sight-viewing stage

197
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,980
at the end of every month.

198
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,980
You can go there anytime you want.

199
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,460
I...

200
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,020
Don't drink cold water.

201
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,140
Don't kick off your blanket while asleep.

202
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,660
Why are you telling me these?

203
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,540
Go.

204
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,660
What's this?

205
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,220
So we're even now?

206
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,460
I don't want your stuff.

207
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,020
You don't need to give me anything.

208
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,580
We are even now.

209
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,540
Actually our former relationship with each other

210
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,380

211
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,580

until the time comes.

244
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,500
Cast the spell.

245
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
I will enter the valley.

246
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,100
You forged the sword for me.

247
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,780
And you made Xiaojiu a ring with half of your heart.

248
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,420
How are you going to fight against
Miao Luo with your cultivation decreased?

249
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,140
The key point in containing Miao Luo does not lie in me.

250
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,820
Instead,

251
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,060
Bihai Cangling is the key point.

252
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,660
Bihai Cangling?

253
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,460
It grows with you in sync.

254
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,700
And your immortal life comes from it.

255
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,940
It's indeed easier to deal with Miao Luo there.

256
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,100
Bihai Cangling is born from chaos.

257
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,180
It's powerful enough to seal the Fanyin Valley.

258
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,820
I will then open starlight ward,

259
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,860
purify dark energy and wipe out Miao Luo.

260
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,780
Starlight ward seems unbreakable.

261
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,300
If dark energy can't be removed,

262
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,260
it will never be broken.

263
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,820
But how will Miao Luo get into starlight ward?

264
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,380
She has been the most dreadful and malicious demoness

265
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,540
formed by dark energy since the creation of world.

266
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,340
If she's alive,

267
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,700
starlight ward will never be broken.

268
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,580
She won't be stupid enough to follow you there.

269
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,540
As long as she enters the Fanyin Valley,

270
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,140
I will seal her with Bihai Cangling

271
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,140
and lure her into starlight ward.

272
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,060
So I need you to put on a show.

273
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,260
Dong Hua,

274
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,780
when I finish absorbing power, you will crash and burn.

275
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,420
I will see to it that your life comes to an end.

276
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,980
Wait for me here.

277
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,380
Do you know what official rank

278
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,700
Ye Qingti is designated by His Majesty?

279
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,740
You made him an immortal.

280
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,460
So for your sake,

281
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,820
he's probably given the position of

282
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,180
assisting you.

283
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,140
His Majesty designated Ye Qingti,

284
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,420
who's a new immortal with no experience yet,

285
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,820
the next emperor of the Tai Chen Palace.

286
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,940
He said after he died,

287
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,620
Chong Lin would assist Ye Qingti

288
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,620
to manage the name book of immortals from Eight Deserts.

289
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,700
What did you say?

290
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,420
I didn't catch you.

291
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,580
You heard me loud and clear.

292
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,580
You just wouldn't believe it.

293
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,300
Usually an immortal's successor

294
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,860
won't be designated

295
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,940
till the last moment of his life.

296
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,020
Normally speaking,

297
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
if an immortal designates a successor,

298
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,980
it implies that the immortal

299
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
is probably going to die soon.

300
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,580
Usually, immortals

301
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,980
will designate someone

302
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,700
who relates to them the most.

303
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,980
His Majesty designated Ye Qingti
to be the successor of emperor

304
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,020
because most of his immortal life

305
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,540
comes from your cultivation.

306
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,940
He chose the one who relates to you the most.

307
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,260
I don't believe it.

308
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,420
I'll go to the Tai Chen Palace and ask him about it.

309
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,020
In Bihai Cangling,

310
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
the pavilion you were asking for has been built.

311
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,500
And the fruit trees have been planted.

312
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,060
As for the spiritual birds in the immortal mountain,

313
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,700
I've had them dance on the sight-viewing stage

314
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,420
at the end of every month.

315
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,780
You can go there anytime you want.

316
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,300
I...

317
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,580
Don't drink cold water.

318
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,780
Don't kick off your blanket while asleep.

319
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,860
Why are you telling me these?

320
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,940
Where's His Majesty?

321
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,900
I want to see him.

322
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,780
Your Highness.

323
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,580
His Majesty has left the Tai Chen Palace.

324
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,660
What about Chong Lin?

325
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,620
Where is he?

326
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,220
Immortal Official Chong Lin
has gone to the Yuan Ji Palace for Third Prince.

327
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,700
He's not here.

328
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,060
Go tell him!

329
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,860
Yes.

330
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,860
Cheng Yu, Si Ming.

331
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,820
You're finally back. I was so worried.

332
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,780
Do you know what's going on with His Majesty?

333
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,860
Why did he make Ye Qingti his successor?

334
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,380
It's a long story.

335
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,460
There are so many misunderstandings.

336
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,260
It's the crucial time to deal with Miao Luo now.

337
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,940
I'm afraid...

338
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,260
Afraid of what?

339
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,060
Don't worry.

340
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,700
Let's wait in the hall first.

341
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,660
We only know that what happened in the Miaoyi Chasm

342
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,020
has something to do with the demons and Miao Luo.

343
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
We'll have to ask Chong Lin about it

344
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,140
when he comes back.

345
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,500
So beautiful!

346
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,500
It's so beautiful here.

347
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,820
It's way more beautiful than the Sky Kingdom!

348
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,540
Why don't you live here?

349
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,220
It's too spacious here.

350
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,260
I feel lonely living here alone.

351
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
I'll live with you.

352
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,580
I want to build a small lotus pond here.

353
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,300
Then

354
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,420
we can also build a small pavilion.

355
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,420
We'll be able

356
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,700
to watch the stars while enjoying the cool.

357
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,100
What's wrong?

358
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,140
Nothing.

359
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,620
I suddenly realized that

360
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,540
we were actually discussing how to decorate our future home.

361
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,900
I found it surreal for a moment.

362
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,060
Home?

363
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,260
Though we may not stay here for long every year,

364
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,780
it's still our home.

365
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,780
Xiaobai.

366
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,340
I like to hear you say "our home".

367
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
I've always liked it.

368
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,140
Greetings, Third Prince.

369
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,100
Chong Lin.

370
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,540
What's the matter with His Majesty?

371
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,620
Why would he appoint Ye Qingti as his successor?

372
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,220
His Majesty felt that he related to

373
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,020
Immortal Qingti the most.

374
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,820
Your Highness, your concern is misplaced.

375
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,260
That's a sign of something.

376
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,500
Chong Lin.

377
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,540
Are you going to try to keep it from me?

378
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,260
His Majesty didn't make it back to marry me.

379
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,780
It's fine. I can live with that.

380
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,700
But the next thing I heard about him

381
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,500
is that he's going to die.

382
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,140
It's too much for me.

383
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,220
You are in charge of things in the Tai Chen Palace.

384
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,580
How could you not know anything?

385
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,220
Even an ordinary man

386
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,580
can't just die suddenly with no reason.

387
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,860
Chong Lin.

388
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,580
After all the twists and turns

389
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,620
Fengjiu and His Majesty have been through,

390
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,980
she deserves to know the result.

391
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,860
If you know anything,

392
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,540
please tell her.

393
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,500
Chong Lin.

394
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,660
Tell her all about it.

395
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,860
I'll begin with the big war

396
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,380
thirty thousand years ago.

397
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,060
Back then, the Demon King Miao Luo was a rebel

398
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,540
against His Majesty who dominated the universe.

399
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,100
So she started killing recklessly,

400
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,740
which triggered the war between the gods and the demons.

401
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,980
When His Majesty was sealing Miao Luo,

402
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,580
she left two wisps of Red Qi.

403
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,060
One turned into primordial spirit blood tear

404
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,740
and was sealed in the Forbidden Land in the demons.

405
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,100
While the baby born in

406
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
the war between the gods and the demons

407
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,020
was stained with the other Red Qi in her divine sense.

408
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,940
The baby born in that war was....

409
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,140
...was me.

410
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,980
But

411
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,220
what does it have to do with His Majesty's end?

412
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,820
His Majesty found out about your relationship with Miao Luo

413
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,380
in the Dream of Aranya.

414
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,100
Young punk.

415
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,580
You think you can seal me?

416
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,420
Dong Hua.

417
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,420
It's time for us to end this.

418
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,860
Come out!

419
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,100
You finally show up.

420
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,300
Since you want to end this,

421
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,900
I'll put an end to it.

422
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,860
His Majesty knew he couldn't suppress Miao Luo for long.

423
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,100
So for all these years,

424
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,780
he had to reinforce the seal

425
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,260
to prolong the time.

426
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,660
However,

427
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,140
Miao Luo got her power back

428
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,940
way quicker than expected.

429
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,780
Miao Luo was greatly weakened with her power

430
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
and sealed by His Majesty.

431
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,540
How did she recover so quickly?

432
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,340
Miao Luo worked her way out step by step.

433
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,460
She first got Lingbi Stone.

434
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,740
Then she got Red Qi back in Fengjiu's body

435
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,940
while the Dream of Aranya was being broken.

436
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,820
Finally, she managed
to get back the demons' holy item, blood tear.

437
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,100
That's why she could break the seal.

438
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,740
At first,

439
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,620
His Majesty and I didn't know about that.

440
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,860
Before the wedding,

441
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,700
Ji Heng coerced His Majesty to meet her

442
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,540
with her father's dragon scale.

443
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,540
Ji Heng wanted to force His Majesty out of marrying you

444
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,460
with dragon scale, which His Majesty couldn't stand.

445
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,940
In the end, he transferred Ji Heng's Qiushui Cold Toxin

446
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,060
all to himself,

447
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,500
so that she could never leave the demons.

448
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,700
But things went wrong with the demons right then.

449
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,140
So His Majesty stayed at the demon clan

450
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,500
not for Ji Heng,

451
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,660
but for Miao Luo.

452
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,540
His Majesty has only loved you

453
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,860
for the whole time.

454
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,780
Your Highness.

455
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,060
Do you know how to remove the Qiushui Cold Toxin quickly?

456
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,900
The quickest approach is to

457
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,660
transfer the toxin all to himself

458
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,260
and then take medicine while cultivating.

459
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,300
That's the approach His Majesty chose.

460
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,220
He'd rather live with toxin

461
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,460
than let the demon princess

462
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,460
bother you in any way.

463
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,940
His Majesty went down to the mortal realm for misfortune

464
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,980
because he spent too much cultivation

465
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,860
when sealing the Miaoyi Chasm.

466
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,980
You know how it went.

467
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,900
His Majesty failed to get all his cultivation back

468
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,380
till the end.

469
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,620
From the day he woke up,

470
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,060
he's been preparing for

471
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,060
purifying the Miaoyi Chasm completely.

472
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,780
The dark energy was gathered
for hundreds of thousands of years.

473
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,860
His Majesty had to give out all his immortal cultivation

474
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,460
and at least half of his immortal spirit for that.

475
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,020
But later, he gave away ninety percent of his power

476
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,420
to get into the Dream of Aranya for you.

477
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,300
He was hit even harder for bringing you back in one piece.

478
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,340
And then,

479
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,500
he transferred the Qiushui Cold Toxin

480
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,220
to himself.

481
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,220
The Qiushui Cold Toxin is not the hardest to contain.

482
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,580
The hardest part is that

483
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,340
the immortal who gets the Qiushui Cold Toxin

484
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,860
will have to spend five times the time it normally takes

485
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,780
to recover the lost immortal power.

486
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,660
Since Miao Luo broke the seal,

487
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,580
she's been practicing her demonic magic,

488
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,220
and absorbing others' immortal power.

489
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,900
However, since His Majesty came back from the Fanyin Valley,

490
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,500
he's been getting hurt.

491
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,900
He've got no time for recovery at all.

492
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,860
So he has no choice but to fight back

493
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,060
with the remaining power and immortal spirit.

494
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,220
It's so hard.

495
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,020
Your Highness, you must have been disappointed that

496
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,460
His Majesty didn't show up.

497
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,860
You said you would wait until

498
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,820
His Majesty came back and explained to you.

499
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,140
But you might think

500
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,500
His Majesty was so carried away

501
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,020
that he didn't actually care about you.

502
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,620
You said you would wait for his reply,

503
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,740
but deep down, you were thinking about

504
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,940
going separate ways in the future.

505
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,780
Your Highness, have you ever thought that

506
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,980
His Majesty might have unspeakable reasons?

507
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,740
To be honest, after getting out of the Dream of Aranya,

508
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,540
His Majesty summoned Fate Stone

509
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,900
to ask about his destiny with you.

510
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,980
Fate Immortal told him that

511
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,660
you and he

512
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,220
were not meant to be

513
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,060
and not supposed to see each other forever.

514
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,500
But what caused the change then?

515
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,140
It was Fengjiu's obsession with His Majesty

516
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,860
that touched the Heaven.

517
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,900
So Fate Stone managed to make you destined for each other

518
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,380
with your shadows.

519
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,220
However, Second Prince
from the West Sea accidently got involved.

520
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,140
So the shadow couple
that should have been destined for each other

521
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,380
didn't work out.

522
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,980
Do you mean Shen Ye and Aranya?

523
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,020
Shadows have no afterlife.

524
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,260
So the Fate Stone has transferred the destiny
that failed in the shadow couple

525
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,620
to you two.

526
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,460
That's why you could meet each other decently.

527
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,500
But there's one thing...

528
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,700
What is it?

529
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,500
Well, according to common rules,

530
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,340
your fates should be revised
because His Majesty asked the Fate Stone about it.

531
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,900
It's such a pity that

532
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,020
your hard-earned destiny with each other

533
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,820
had to be revised due to the inquiry.

534
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,340
What did His Majesty say?

535
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,380
His Majesty did not fear fate

536
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,900
nor need its charity.

537
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,500
He just tried his best to keep his relationship with you.

538
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,540
But unexpected thing happened

539
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,140
before the wedding.

540
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,060
Fate Immortal was right.

541
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,060
We were just not meant to be.

542
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,700
Not meant to be.

543
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,860
His Majesty was keeping his relationship with you

544
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,740
with his own way.

545
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,620
Maybe he didn't use the right way.

546
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,980
But he has been committed to it,

547
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,020
right?

548
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,100
It's just that no one can win over fate.

549
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,180
But why didn't he tell me?

550
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,260
Right.

551
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,420
Why didn't His Majesty say a word about it?

552
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,260
His Majesty is so much wiser than us.

553
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,500
Of course he knows it's better for him

554
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,060
to tell you.

555
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,580
But why didn't he say a word?

556
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,860
Before leaving, he was worried that without his help

557
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,300
you might not pass the test of

558
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,700
heavenly advance.

559
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,460
There are many misunderstandings.

560
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,020
I guess His Majesty didn't want you to get worried.

561
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,980
If he had explained everything,

562
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,900
you could have felt guilty.

563
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,020
If not,

564
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,380
he knew

565
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,660
you would complain and be pissed,

566
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,740
but still

567
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,700
be doing well.

568
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,460
It was not the time for him to tell you those things.

569
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,740
And he can't tell you.

570
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,740
Your Highness, you have a long life ahead you.

571
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,380
His Majesty didn't want you to live with guilt forever

572
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,100
if he couldn't make it back.

573
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,500
Do you know how...

574
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,540
how hard it is?

575
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,020
When His Majesty said
he was having a tough life these years,

576
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,260
what did you reply to him?

577
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,020

to hand you this after he dies.

591
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,460

His Majesty has known that he's heavily injured.
