00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 3

3
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Foster brother.

4
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,120
Here are the cakes and pastries.

5
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,200
Your Majesty!

6
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,280
Your cooking skill is...

7
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,840
You'd better have something else for fun.

8
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,800
Tasty?

9
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,520
Want to have some?

10
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Yeah.

11
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,360
Let me feed you.

12
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,400
OK.

13
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Third Prince, there is an illusion here,

14
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,680
isn't it?

15
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
The pastries

16
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
look simple but elegant

17
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,270
with fascinating stuffing.

18
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,720
Between lips and teeth is the taste
of sorrowless flower's fragrance

19
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,560
and

20
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
the sweetness of Zijin Honeydew.

21
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,200
It's surprising that it can make people get such a realm.

22
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,960
Awesome!

23
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,120
Fantastic!

24
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
The fishy smell is gone!

25
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,200
Have a taste.

26
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,960
Who made it?

27
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,000
Seeing you're addicted to cooking these days,

28
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
I also have a try.

29
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,800
Have you named it?

30
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,720
Not yet.

31
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,320
Please give it a name.

32
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
Since it's made from sorrowless flower,

33
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
just call it sorrowless pastry.

34
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,360
Taste is good.

35
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
Thank you, foster brother.

36
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
His Majesty praised me for my pastry.

37
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,320
Your Majesty,

38
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,280
how do you know my pastry is called sorrowless pastry?

39
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,720
Great minds think alike.

40
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
Do you guys

41
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,160
take turns to trick me?

42
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,760
Is that...

43
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,720
Unexpectedly, I understand the following sufferings like

44
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,360
birth, senility, illness, death,

45
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
apriya-samprayoga-duhkha,

46
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,680
farewell to the beloved,

47
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,400
pursuing devotionally for something
yet keeping out of reach for ever

48
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
and the five skandhas.

49
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Just in an instant,

50
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
by tasting the sweet and sour fish,

51
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
I seemed to experience them all.

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Your Majesty, your heart is full of leniency,

53
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,280
incomparable.

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,840
He ate it up?

55
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
Foster brother, you're really good at cooking.

56
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Unexpectedly, you could make Si Ming
have such feelings and thoughts.

57
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,960
Your Highness, why are you here?

58
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,880
Tails, tails.

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
Your tails appear.

60
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
Si Ming.

61
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Si Ming.

62
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,880
Why did you go there?

63
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
I just found

64
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
there was a cute fox here.

65
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,920
I thought I could play with it for fun.

66
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,680
It has gone.

67
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
Is there really a little fox?

68
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,640
It was here just now.

69
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,280
It has gone.

70
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
You're carrying it, right?

71
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,520
Show me.

72
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,880
Maybe I can use it to make a smooth tippet.

73
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,680
Third Prince is really detestable.

74
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,600
How could he think of using me to make a tippet?

75
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,240
Third Prince.

76
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,400
Third Prince.

77
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,200
Third Prince.

78
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,120
The immortal animal in my Tai Chen Palace is well trained.

79
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,320
It's certain that it won't behave so impolitely.

80
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,240
If the Heavenly King had been as attentive as me,

81
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
You wouldn't have been so smart.

82
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
It's true!

83
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,880
Your Majesty.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
How could you compare me

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
with your little fox?

86
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,960
You really push me too far.

87
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,720
His Majesty let you off lightly.

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
Anyhow, His Majesty saved me again.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,520
One more debt.

90
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,680
It's really hard for me to pay the debt.

91
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,000
As there is no end in the world,

92
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,440
so is my gratitude to him.

93
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,550
Turn up.

94
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,360
How do you think?

95
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Although Lian Song is not kind-hearted,

96
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,160
he has a good taste.

97
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,160
I just put three drops of Zijin Honeydew,

98
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
he could even taste it.

99
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Zijin Honeydew?

100
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,160
How bold you are!

101
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
Although we get on well with each other like Damon and Pythias,

102
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,280
if you keep being so reckless,

103
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,400
I can not ensure you safety.

104
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,000
What if you were discovered by them someday?

105
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
How can you account for it to Qingqiu?

106
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,920
How can I explain it to the Sky Kingdom?

107
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,120
I can't help it.

108
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,760
Having been in Tai Chen Palace for such a long time,

109
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,880
it's the first time for me to see His Majesty today.

110
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,840
I almost expose myself.

111
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
Daily routines make me tired every day.

112
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,500
Without a comfortable place to rest,

113
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,980
I have to stay in the Imperial Kitchen all the time.

114
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,280
I don't even have a room of myself.

115
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,040
I have told you not to come here.

116
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Is it worthy?

117
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,920
Si Ming.

118
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,400
You...

119
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,160
Don't be fooled by the little fox.

120
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,320
Lord Cheng Yu.

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
You should be in the Lord Mansion.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,720
Why are you here?

123
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,280
You little girl,

124
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,400
why didn't go to see me since you were in the Sky Kingdom?

125
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,720
You just bully Si Ming here.

126
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm here to pay a debt of gratitude.

127
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
It's a secret.

128
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,760
Sounds interesting!

129
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,720
Why didn't you turn to me? I can help you.

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm afraid to dishonor Qingqiu.

131
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:51,960
Tell me

132
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,960
what your trouble is.

133
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,540
My father told me that I must repay others' kindness.

134
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,340
But they didn't tell me how to repay it?

135
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,120
It's not difficult.

136
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,960
Do you know what is the most important in repaying kindness?

137
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,640
That is to provide timely help.

138
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,640
It makes no sense by adding brilliance to the present splendor.

139
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,720
You should share the cares and burdens of His Majesty.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,800
Only in this way can you match his kindness.

141
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,680
Share cares and burdens of His Majesty?

142
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
But how?

143
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,720
Just as told in the play,

144
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,840
an elegant young man was in trouble

145
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,240
and saved by a miss.

146
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,440
Then...

147
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,760
I remember my aunt also told me

148
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,280
the same.

149
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,920
It's true that you know much more.

150
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
So it is.

151
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
If there's something that you can't deal with,

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,000
don't be afraid,

153
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,120
just come to my mansion

154
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,920
and I can support you.

155
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,680
Don't support her anymore.

156
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
She is bold enough now.

157
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
If you keep...

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,680
Lord Cheng Yu.

159
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,960
You're really kind to me.

160
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,560
Si Ming.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,480
I haven't blamed you yet.

162
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,760
Who told my secrets to Lian Song?

163
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,080
Lian Song?

164
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,200
Lian Song is really not kind-hearted.

165
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,760
He said he would use me to make

166
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,080
a fox tippet.

167
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,600
I nearly turned up

168
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
to fight with him.

169
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,600
He is a playboy.

170
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,600
Keep away from him.

171
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,800
He

172
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,400
is splenetic,

173
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,440
getting close to you

174
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,160
to irritate you to offend him.

175
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,840
Then he will take the chance to deeply offend you.

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,520
-He is really so bad. -You're right.

177
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,560
Luckily, you wasn't trapped.

178
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,280
Well,

179
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,360
Lord Cheng Yu.

180
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,440
Tell me

181
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,720
how to repay kindness?

182
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,280
Listen,

183
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,680
as for this kind of thing,

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,080
you'd better capture his stomach first.

185
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,840
For man,

186
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,400
get it?

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,680
Princess,

188
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm sorry. I won't make that mistake again.

189
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,040
Please forgive me.

190
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,680
The last pastry was made by you, right?

191
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,820
Yes.

192
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,100
It was overturned carelessly.

193
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,540
So I use my hometown pastry to take place of it.

194
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,420
I won't do that again.

195
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,880
Well done.

196
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,160
I know it!

197
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,200
His Majesty even praised me.

198
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
You must teach me every step

199
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,440
of making the pastry.

200
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,640
Since foster brother praised me,

201
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
I will do well every time.

202
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Why are you still here in a daze?

203
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,960
It's done so quickly?

204
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,640
Where is the flower core?

205
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,760
And where isn't there any stuffing?

206
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,160
Naturally, the sorrowless flower

207
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,880
was used

208
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
to make the shuck of the sorrowless pastry.

209
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,320
Since it's called sorrowless pastry,

210
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,280
its stuffing

211
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,440
is certainly made from the feelings and thoughts of the maker.

212
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,440
Then it can be finished.

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,160
Feelings and thoughts?

214
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
Since it's called sorrowless pastry,

215
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
it's sorrowless.

216
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,360
You'd better suit the remedy to the case.

217
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
As for the flower core,

218
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,240
then

219
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
you can choose any flower core you like.

220
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
Then I will put the tea that foster brother like most in it.

221
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,880
Quickly.

222
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
Serve the tea.

223
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,240
What kind of tea to serve?

224
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,240
All kinds.

225
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,160
OK.

226
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,720
Go to

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
prepare as the princess ordered.

228
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,520
OK.

229
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,760
What can I do?

230
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,440
As for the lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy
and painting that Ji Heng likes,

231
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,040
I'm good at none of them.

232
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm not likely to learn them in a short period of time.

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,800
When Ji Heng marries Dong Hua,

234
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,360
then it's too late for me to learn.

235
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,520
Demon Lord, the dishes have been ready for a long time.

236
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,680
I won't have anything.

237
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm busy now.

238
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,760
How about my serving them here?

239
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
The kitchen has specially made braised demon beast today.

240
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,560
Braised demon beast?

241
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,120
It's so inelegant!

242
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Ji Heng won't like it.

243
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,560
Tell the kitchen

244
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,560
not to cook it any more.

245
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,560
Besides,

246
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,520
If I can't marry Ji Heng,

247
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,440
I will braise you.

248
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,640
I don't mind anything.

249
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,120
We demons advocate for force.

250
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,480
I will beat Dong Hua first

251
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
to stop their marriage,

252
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,440
which,

253
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,360
I think, will amaze the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

254
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,920
Then Ji Heng will think highly of me.

255
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,240
At that time, I will propose a marriage.

256
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm sure that I can make it then.

257
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,840
Min Su.

258
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,920
Do you still remember

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,520
we often came to play in this forest when we were young?

260
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,440
As the princess of the demons,

261
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,960
I have to practise many lessons daily

262
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,360
so that I will be lazy sometimes.

263
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,160
Among all the demon generals,

264
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,900
only you dare to accompany me playing in this forest.

265
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Because of this,

266
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,280
you are always blamed by my elder brother.

267
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
Only in this forest

268
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,720
can you laugh happily.

269
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,520
As long as you are happy,

270
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,000
it's nothing

271
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,600
for me to be punished.

272
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
But do you know that

273
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,920
the reason why I laugh is not that I can play in this forest

274
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,000
but

275
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
that you are with me.

276
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,280
I only want

277
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
to stay with you.

278
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,680
Xuan Yue.

279
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
Greet to you, Demon Lord.

280
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,240
Find a reliable person

281
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,920
to send this battle letter to the Sky Kingdom.

282
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
As for the close relationship,

283
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,520
I think Zilan from the Kunlun Mountain...

284
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,040
Shut up.

285
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
I've told you

286
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,800
not to mention

287
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
my shameful twin brother.

288
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,400
He can go to anywhere to learn skills

289
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,520
except Kunlun.

290
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,440
Isn't there anyone powerful enough among our demons?

291
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,640
Then I will go to find mother of all stars.

292
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,000
Ask her to send it to the Sky Kingdom!

293
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,960
Yes.

294
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,760
Braised demon beast.

295
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
I saw you liked these pastries.

296
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
So I make some for you today.

297
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,800
Please have a taste.

298
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,840
Even Third Prince

299
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,200
saw you at the party,

300
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,080
praising you for your good skills.

301
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,040
After you.

302
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

303
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,880
What's up?

304
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,120
Isn't it tasty?

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,400
Princess.

306
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
Th sorrowless pastry is as tasty as usual.

307
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,520
But...

308
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,600
But what?

309
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,440
But why I can still feel the sorrow.

310
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,080
Jiu.

311
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,680
Jiu.

312
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
P...Princess.

313
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
Why can't I make the pastry tasty?

314
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,640
How dare you play tricks on me?

315
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,240
Your Highness, please detect it carefully.

316
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,000
I dare not play tricks on you.

317
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,440
The flower core of the sorrowless pastry

318
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
varies from person to person.

319
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
I don't know it's such a result.

320
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,560
It varies from person to person.

321
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,560
Since foster brother like those made by you,

322
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
I will make the same pastry as you.

323
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,640
Dare you disobey the order of the princess?

324
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,520
I dare not.

325
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,920
Actually, my sorrowless pastries

326
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,760
are made from very common materials,

327
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,880
including East Sea Rime and Zijin Honeydew.

328
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,240
Only the root of Yushi Flower is different.

329
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
It's just the root of Yushi Flower.

330
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
I don't think it's hard to get it.

331
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,340
The common roots of Yushi Flower

332
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,900
is not good enough for you, Your Highness.

333
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,920
In my opinion,

334
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,080
naturally

335
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,240
the root of Yushi Flower King in the center of Rebirth Sea

336
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,760
is the best for you.

337
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,400
In this way, your precious heart

338
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,400
can be felt by His Majesty.

339
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
Good idea!

340
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,720
Yu Ru.

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
Get prepared

342
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,880
to Rebirth Sea.

343
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes.

344
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,280
Go with me.

345
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,760
Yes.

346
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,880
Princess.

347
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,680
Hope you can discern and apprehend as early as possible.

348
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,160
Just be a good immortal.

349
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,280
My waist!

350
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,760
I need to have a good rest.

351
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,960
Jiu.

352
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,960
What are you doing?

353
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,520
Is there a law in heaven that being lazy is forbidden?

354
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Why are you still in a daze?

355
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,680
Go with me.

356
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,960
I myself

357
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,120
will supervise your picking up it.

358
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,360
Since the root of Yushi Flower is at the bottom of the sea,

359
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,120
Jiu,

360
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,520
go to dig it out for me.

361
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,840
Are the tea and pastries ready?

362
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
Let's have a rest first.

363
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,040
Yes.

364
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,720
Yes.

365
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,160
Your Majesty.

366
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,800
Mother of all stars sent you the battle letter
of Demon Lord, Yan Chiwu,

367
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
asking for a fight with you.

368
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
Your Majesty, how to reply to it.

369
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,360
Chong Lin.

370
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
How do you like the tea leaves?

371
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,120
Your Majesty,

372
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,240
I can't see the difference.

373
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Do you know

374
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,960
what is the most important thing to tea leaves?

375
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,560
Your Highness, you have ever said that

376
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,840
the most important thing to tea leaves
is that it should be picked timely.

377
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,800
Time.

378
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,360
I see.

379
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,680
It's really bright and brilliant.

380
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,160
Let's go back to Tai Chen Palace.

381
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,880
Don't leave.

382
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,440
Princess.

383
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,800
It's the princess that should be punished.

384
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,720
How unlucky I am!

385
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,800
Stop.

386
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Is it true that even heaven can't stand me

387
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,200
because I am not well-behaved,

388
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,160
so it punishes me?

389
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,560
Congratulations! Your Highness!

390
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,160
Finally you make it. Your effort is worth.

391
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,640
His Majesty must like it.

392
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,320
Have you cooked fish?

393
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,560
It's already in the pot,

394
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,960
waiting to be cooked by you.

395
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,280
I will go back to the palace to change my bead hairpin first.

396
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,920
Foster brother will be back soon.

397
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,920
You.

398
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,920
Stay here.

399
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,160
Help to watch the degree of heating in the Imperial Kitchen.

400
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,640
Yes.

401
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,320
Sweet and sour fish is a delicious food in the earth,

402
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,360
which must be cooked with the cooking skill of the earth.

403
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,360
Help me to watch the fire carefully.

404
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,480
Don't use magic arts.

405
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,840
If there is any error,

406
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
you are to blame.

407
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,400
Yes.

408
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,100
Did mother of all stars

409
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,960
send the battle letter to His Majesty?

410
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
Long time has passed.

411
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Didn't I ask mother of all stars

412
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,760
to send the battle letter to the Sky Kingdom by herself?

413
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
How has there been no news since she left?

414
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,760
Demon Lord.

415
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,320
I have a friend

416
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,040
who can help to Yi Shi San Heaven to find some information.

417
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Go quickly.

418
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:19,800
OK.

419
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,200
OK.

420
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,360
Violet clothes and white hair.

421
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,560
His Majesty Dong Hua.

422
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,840
What's wrong?

423
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,280
If I ask Zhe Yan to help me now,

424
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,720
will he laugh at me?

425
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,640
Xuan Yue.

426
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,440
Demon Lord.

427
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,040
Is your friend reliable?

428
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
When can the ice-face fight with me?

429
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,680
He hasn't replied yet.

430
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
Long time has passed.

431
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

432
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,160
My friend has a special way

433
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
to ask to see Demon Lord's steward Chong Lin.

434
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
He is a carp spirit.

435
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Carp spirit?

436
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,080
Your Majesty.

437
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,800
Am I dreaming?

438
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,760
His Majesty helped me to pick up my hair clasp.

439
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,440
Right.

440
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
Your bead hairpin really looks beautiful.

441
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
What is so fragrant?

442
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,800
Glad to see you, Your Highness.

443
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,760
Chong Lin.

444
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Where is foster brother now?

445
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,280
He has gone to the Imperial Kitchen.

446
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,120
Is it true that my sweet and sour fish
is so fragrant that it can spread for tens of miles.

447
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Princess.

448
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,720
Only Jiu is in the kitchen.

449
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,040
If she receives the award instead of you...

450
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,120
How dare she?

451
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,200
Your Majesty!

452
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,720
Glad to see you, Your Majesty.

453
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,040
Leave quickly.

454
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,600
Yes.

455
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,760
Wait.

456
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
Fry it in hot oil.

457
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,640
Then add some grape-fruit to make it tasty.

458
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,240
And the last is

459
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
the root of the sorrowless flower?

460
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,080
Yes.

461
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,160
Foster brother.

462
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,760
I specially went to Qingqiu to pick up
the root of the sorrowless flower

463
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,800
in preparation for making sweet and sour fish.

464
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,520
Stay in Tai Chen Palace to make dishes.

465
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,800
Foster brother.

466
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,240
What is

467
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,800
the flower on the hair clasp?

468
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,760
I have never seen it in the Sky Kingdom.

469
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,520
Is it from the earth?

470
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,720
No.

471
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,320
It's the sky

472
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,200
and stars of Qingqiu.

473
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,560
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

474
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,880
who can tell how many years it has been through?

475
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,800
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

476
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,480
who can tell how many years it has been through?

477
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,680
What does it mean?

478
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,120
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

479
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,040
who can tell how many years it has been through?

480
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,640
Your Majesty.

481
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,080
Your Majesty.

482
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,760
It's the first time that we have talked with each other.

483
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,480
What a wild fox,

484
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,840
shouting so joyfully?

485
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,040
Demon Lord,

486
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,020
here is the letter in reply.

487
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,440
Read it.

488
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,280
It says that

489
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,000
it's time for picking tea-leaves in
the tea garden of Tai Chen Palace.

490
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,520
So he doesn't have time to meet the challenge.

491
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,160
Picking tea-leaves?

492
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,280
Unexpectedly, because of picking tea-leaves,

493
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,800
he refused to fight with me.

494
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,680
Does he think of me as a fool?

495
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,620
Your Majesty.

496
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,820
Yan Chiwu from the demons...

497
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,280
Ice-face.

498
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,230
I have picked up all the tea leaves for you.

499
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,800
When can you fight with me?

500
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,800
Chong Lin.

501
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,520
Yes.

502
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,000
Why don't you look at me?

503
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,460
Thanks a lot.

504
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,780
No need.

505
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,040
Let's go!

506
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,080
Where to fight?

507
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
I have got several fragrant trees recently.

508
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,920
Having put them in the garden for a long time,

509
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,600
I'm afraid I still need time to plant them.

510
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,400
You ice-face!

511
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,360
As for planting flowers, the best time is the most important.

512
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,520
Wait.

513
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,160
I will go to plant the flowers for you.

514
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
Then you won't have any excuses.

515
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,440
Demon Lord Yan.

516
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,080
Demon Lord Yan.

517
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,800
You can't enter.

518
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
Get out of the way.

519
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,200
Demon Lord Yan.

520
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,800
Demon Lord Yan.

521
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,160
Don't stop me.

522
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,640
Demon Lord Yan.

523
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,560
What's wrong?

524
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,560
Can't I drink some tea?

525
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,120
It's so hot.

526
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to stop him.

527
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,960
It's...

528
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,920
It doesn't matter.

529
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,240
I have planted the trees for you.

530
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,880
When can we fight?

531
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,520
Chong Lin.

532
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,700
Is there still sludge in the two mus of lotus pond

533
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,440
that needs to be got rid of?

534
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,720
When will you deal with it?

535
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,320
The lotus pond hasn't been cared for a long time.

536
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,200
As for the sludge in it,

537
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm afraid it needs a lot of time to get rid of it.

538
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,760
Your Majesty, if you want to deal with it,

539
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,120
I will issue orders soon.

540
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,280
No need.

541
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,520
I can do it by myself.

542
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
You want to find an excuse again?

543
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,120
Wait a moment.

544
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,480
Demon Lord Yan.

545
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,480
Demon Lord Yan.

546
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,400
Demon Lord Yan.

547
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,600
There is so much work in the Sky Kingdom.

548
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,580
It's not easy for Ice-face.

549
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,580
As His Majesty, the Emperor of the Three Realms,

550
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,460
unexpectedly, he does everything by himself.

551
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,080
Surprisingly!

552
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,160
In Tai Chen Palace,

553
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
if His Majesty smiles, there must be something wrong.

554
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,160
Chong Lin, why did you laugh just now?

555
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,120
Si Ming.

556
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,320
You don't know that

557
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,560
the Demon Lord Yan Chiwu asked to challenge His Majesty.

558
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,040
His Majesty has excused himself from the challenge.

559
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,920
Unexpectedly, Yan Chiwu is so stubborn that

560
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,840
he insisted on fighting with His Majesty.

561
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,460
He even did all the chores in Tai Chen Palace.

562
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,960
How could it be?

563
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,900
When His Majesty plays tricks on others,

564
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,000
he really enjoys himself.

565
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,680
How long has he been working here?

566
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,500
The Demon Lord has cleaned up the whole Tai Chen Palace

567
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,340
both inside and outside.

568
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,400
He was fooled by His Majesty.

569
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,240
So far, the only chores in Tai Chen Palace

570
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,240
is the apricots in Yinxing Forest waiting to be picked.

571
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,680
I'm afraid

572
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,160
the demon King might pick the apricots as well.

573
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,160
When he finds he was fooled,

574
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,880
I don't know what he will do.

575
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,400
What will he do?

576
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,720
Will he pull down Tai Chen Palace?

577
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,000
Anytime His Majesty plays a trick on someone else,

578
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,440
he doesn't cause himself any trouble.

579
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,400
Just worry about the demon king.

580
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Well, I have something else to do.

581
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm leaving.

582
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,840
After I pick all the apricots,

583
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,200
the ice-face can't have any excuses.

584
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,640
How could there be a basket of apricots here?

585
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Tai Chen Palace has many rules.

586
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,180
How could they put things so randomly?

587
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,440
It means that

588
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,320
they are mine.

589
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,480
They don't need you.

590
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,720
I need you.

591
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,840
So sweet!

592
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,920
It must be tasty to make apricot sauce by them.

593
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,880
By the way,

594
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,160
His Majesty also likes the fragrance of apricots.

595
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
His Majesty is in a good mood today.

596
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,440
If I can make delicious apricot sauce

597
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,280
and present it to His Majesty,

598
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm sure to make it better

599
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,080
for His Majesty to have a better mood.

600
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,760
Let's go, apricots.

601
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,000
What?

602
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,960
Where are the apricots that I picked just now?

603
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,800
There are so many tricks in the Sky Kingdom!

604
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,760
Are the apricots able to be invisible?

605
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,800
No wonder the ice-face can't deal with it by himself

606
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,560
but ask me for help.

607
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,120
I will find out

608
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,280
whether the apricots disappeared by themselves

609
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,280
or someone else wanted to trick me.

610
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,960
Why should I help to catch the thief for Tai Chen Palace?

611
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,360
I should pick all the apricots as quickly as possible

612
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,480
and then have a fight with the ice-face. That's it.

613
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,120
Ice-face.

614
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,320
Have I finished all the chores in the palace?

615
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,700
I'm here to remind you that

616
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,620
it's time for you to fulfill your promise of

617
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
fighting with me.

618
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,600
When did I promise you?

619
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,800
You told me by yourself.

620
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,000
You said if I could help you do something,

621
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,800
then you would agree to fight with me.

622
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
I have considered it.

623
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,000
I won't fight.

624
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,920
You played tricks on me from the beginning to the end?

625
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,160
I...

626
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,560
I helped you pick tea-leaves, plant trees,

627
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,680
clear the lotus pond,

628
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,080
mend the tiles and pick apricots.

629
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
How could you turn hostile, denying all that I did now?

630
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
I...

631
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,440
do turn hostile.

632
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,760
So what?

633
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,120
Dong Hua.

634
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,600
I will fight with you with my full strength.

635
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,320
Dong Hua.
