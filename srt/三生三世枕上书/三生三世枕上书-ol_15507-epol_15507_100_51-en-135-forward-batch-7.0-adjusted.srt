00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 51

3
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,540
So Chenxiang ran away from home

4
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,540
to save San Sheng Mu

5
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,300
who was pinned under the mountain.

6
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,740
Some people run away from home to fulfill filial duty,

7
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,380
while some send no messages back

8
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,500
after running away for more than half a year

9
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
which makes their families worry.

10
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,260
Li,

11
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,540
when you grow up,

12
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,900
you should never follow this bad example.

13
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,340
Sister Fengjiu is back after running away from home!

14
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,580
Good boy!

15
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,300
Is your uncle telling you stories?

16
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,220
These are just stories from the script.

17
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,020
I'd like to hear something fresh.

18
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,660
Can you tell me?

19
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,980
I like to hear new stories the most.

20
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,620
Sister Fengjiu,

21
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,420
I didn't tell them that

22
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,620
you fell into the Fanyin Valley...

23
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,220
Li,

24
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,100
just go somewhere to play.

25
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,380
I've got something serious to talk to your elder sister.

26
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,940
I'm really tight-lipped.

27
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,140
Though I learned from Third Grandpa

28
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,020
that Sister Fengjiu and Brother Dong Hua kissed each other,

29
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,660
I didn't tell them.

30
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,260
Uncle,

31
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,620
why are you still here?

32
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,060
Why didn't you go back to Qingqiu?

33
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,900
I'm waiting for you.

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Without taking you back, how to handle

35
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,700
the great event in Qingqiu?

36
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,660
No need to wait for me.

37
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,540
After all, I often go out to play.

38
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,420
It's not a big deal in Qingqiu.

39
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,100
If you stay here because of me,

40
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,620
God Zhe Yan will surely be angry at me.

41
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,260
It seems you've forgotten about

42
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,660
an important event concerning you recently.

43
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,660
What is it?

44
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,140
So you've really forgotten about it.

45
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Then let me remind you.

46
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,060
Your Weapon Hiding Ceremony

47
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,700
is right after 15 days.

48
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,900
Right! I've really forgotten about it.

49
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,060
Uncle,

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,900
just pretend you haven't seen me today.

51
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,940
I'll be back 15 days later.

52
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,500
Originally, I could transform into you

53
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,220
and fulfill the ceremony on your behalf.

54
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,300
Now that you're back,

55
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,580
you should fulfill your own duty.

56
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,340
I...

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,660
There're still 15 days left.

58
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,900
If you sleep four or six hours less every day,

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,740
you'll have enough time to prepare for it.

60
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,260
But I only sleep eight hours a day.

61
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,100
Poor girl!

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
But young as you are,

63
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,140
you'll be fine even
if you only sleep two or four hours a day.

64
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,300
You're not asked to stay all night long.

65
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,620
Just be content with it.

66
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,980
I see.

67
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,580
I'll get ready for it.

68
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,780
Though the formalities of Qingqiu

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,580
are not so heavy as those of the Sky Kingdom,

70
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,340
the major formalities shall not be missed.

71
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,380
Fine.

72
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,900
Both of them have returned safely.

73
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,220
You can finally stop pulling a long face.

74
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,900
Thanks to you,

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
they're back safely this time.

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,020
Without me,

77
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,740
Fengjiu can still come back safely.

78
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,980
That was Emperor Dong Hua.

79
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,660
Would he let any harm come to her?

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,900
Right.

81
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,740
You just worry too much.

82
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,540
Didn't you also lose much cultivation

83
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,860
guarding for them?

84
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,740
Only when they returned safely

85
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,620
did you feel relieved to come back
to the Sky Kingdom, right?

86
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,540
I'm probably influenced by you.

87
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
What?

88
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,300
I feel uncomfortable

89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,620
with you staring at me like that.

90
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,220
I wonder why you haven't visited Fengjiu yet.

91
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,780
When she was in the Sky Kingdom previously,

92
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,980
you hung out every day.

93
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,180
Now she's got no time to play with me.

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,820
Are they so intimate that they don't even

95
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,100
want to part with each other?

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,380
Well,

97
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,500
she's bothered about how to persuade

98
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,460
her family into accepting His Majesty.

99
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,580
However, the Weapon Hiding Ceremony is also coming.

100
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,660
Now, she's even more bothered.

101
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,780
The Weapon Hiding Ceremony?

102
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,540
It's a ceremony which must be held

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,700
after a new monarch of Qingqiu succeeds to the throne.

104
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,180
The new monarch must forge

105
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,140
a handy weapon in person

106
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
and hide it in the Holy Land under his or her rule

107
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,340
in front of immortals from the Eight Deserts
on the very day of the ceremony,

108
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,420
so that the future generations can use it.

109
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,940
I remembered.

110
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,060
I also participated in Bai Qian's
Weapon Hiding Ceremony back then.

111
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,540
In the Four Seas and the Eight Deserts,

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,620
it's really a great event.

113
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,380
Is she ready?

114
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,340
She forged the Hexu Sword

115
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,300
long ago,

116
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,060
but as to the sword box...

117
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,940
Unfinished?

118
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,380
She thought

119
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,300
there was still time.

120
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,740
Even if she played for two months
after Bai Qian's wedding banquet,

121
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,180
she still got time to make the box.

122
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,780
However, she fell into the Fanyin Valley

123
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,700
and forgot about the whole thing.

124
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,100
Now,

125
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,380
she is surely sparing no efforts in

126
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,260
choosing the material

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,740
and style of the sword box

128
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,780
and dares not get distracted.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,380
She's careless,

130
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,980
just like you.

131
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,340
No wonder you're friends.

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,740
But she has Emperor Dong Hua

133
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,340
who excels at making sword boxes.

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,460
With the help of Dong Hua,

135
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,340
the sword box can be finished in a day or two for sure.

136
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,780
At such a critical moment,

137
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,260
if Fengjiu doesn't

138
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,300
turn to him for help,

139
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,740
she really wastes a great talent.

140
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,620
Perhaps with a few soft words,

141
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,100
Dong Hua will make the box for her to save her the trouble.

142
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,860
Why should she be bothered?

143
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,140
Such a romantic trick does sound like your style.

144
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,420
No wonder you can't become friends.

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,220
Fengjiu said that

146
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,940
surely nothing could go wrong with the help of His Majesty,

147
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,740
but if she relied on him all the time,

148
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,060
she would be too unmotivated.

149
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,380
Moreover,

150
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,220
His Majesty also doesn't want her to be

151
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,460
a loser who can only rely on him.

152
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,620
He will only help her arrange the schedule

153
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,180
of making the sword box.

154
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,420
As to the rest,

155
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,900
he probably won't help.

156
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Let's make a bet.

157
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,340
I'm also curious whether His Majesty

158
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,700
will make the sword box for her or not.

159
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,500
Back then, Bai Qian's Weapon Hiding Ceremony was so grand.

160
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,460
Fengjiu can't lose.

161
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,860
If I win,

162
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,580
you should attend Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony

163
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,380
to support her and bring attention to the event.

164
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,260
If you win,

165
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,140
I'll personally fetch some fat fish in the Pundarika Pond

166
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,980
and have Fengjiu cook sweet and sour fish
for you for half a month.

167
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,220
She's really good at cooking.

168
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,740
The wagers are fairly good,

169
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,100
but given Fengjiu's situation,

170
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,540
it's better that I win.

171
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,300
No.

172
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,140
It's not so good if I win.

173
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,580
If I eat the sweet and sour fish cooked by Fengjiu,

174
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,340
jealous as Dong Hua is,

175
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,100
he will definitely make me spit it out.

176
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,900
That's it.

177
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,820
I originally wanted to apologize to aunt,

178
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,540
but I didn't expect that

179
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,780
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony is only 15 days away.

180
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,020
I haven't finished my sword box yet.

181
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,140
= From the 1st day to the 5th day
making a 1.3-m Han Nanmu box =

182
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,860
= From the 5th day to the 10th day making patterns at joints,
at the bottom and on both sides of the box =

183
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,660
= From the 10th day to the 15th day inlaying two pieces
of Yufu-jade-carved Foling flowers at the top =

184
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,900
According to the progress chart,

185
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,980
without accident,

186
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,180
the sword box can be made in 15 days.

187
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,500
Dong Hua, just wait.

188
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,420
I will get back at you.

189
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,060
Your Majesty,

190
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,820
you...

191
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,820
Nie Chuyin,

192
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,220
go and get me some demons to eat.

193
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,340
Demons?

194
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,580
Hurry up!

195
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,420
Yes!

196
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:47,900
Go.

197
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,020
Yes.

198
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,580
Your Highness!

199
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,580
Your Highness!

200
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,260
Bad news!

201
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,500
Why are you in such a hurry?

202
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:07,860
Bad...

203
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,100
Bad news!

204
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,380
Her Majesty...

205
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,020
Your Majesty!

206
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,340
Your... Your Majesty!

207
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,220
Your Majesty,

208
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,980
by making such a fuss,

209
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,420
how can we hide from others?

210
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,820
They're nothing but a dozen losers.

211
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,100
I need more.

212
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,820
Right.

213
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,580
Your Majesty, you're extremely powerful,

214
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,620
but to help you recover your power,

215
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm afraid there won't be many demons left in our clan.

216
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,740
How can we fight the gods then?

217
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,340
Are you questioning me?

218
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,140
I beg your pardon.

219
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,180
I dare not.

220
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,260
Majestic and powerful as Your Majesty is,
you're fearless to heaven and earth.

221
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,300
It's a supreme glory for our clan.

222
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,580
The Miaoyi Chasm keeps being strengthened.

223
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,300
I need to get the blood tear as soon as possible.

224
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,820
From today on,

225
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,180
send one hundred demons for me to eat every day.

226
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,380
Act without fail.

227
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,260
One hundred demons?

228
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,900
Yes!

229
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,420
Your Majesty!

230
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,260
Your Majesty,

231
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,900
how about this?

232
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,180
Yes.

233
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,180
Your Majesty,

234
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,180
how about this?

235
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,420
Your Majesty,

236
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,580
this time...

237
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,020
This place is nice.

238
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,300
Your Majesty, the cool breeze is blowing outside.

239
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Her Highness Fengjiu's desk is not put in the right place

240
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
to enjoy the cool breeze.

241
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,100
Let me also move Her Highness's desk.

242
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Good idea.

243
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,300
Yes.

244
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,580
I remember that last year

245
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,500
when I was also playing the game of go
with you in Tai Chen Palace,

246
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,900
I advised you that

247
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,980
if one day,

248
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,540
you come round and want to marry an Empress,

249
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,860
Zhihe might be a good choice.

250
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
But now, it seems that

251
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,500
Zhihe is not a match for you.

252
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,700
As to my foster sister,

253
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,940
her heart was pure.

254
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,260
Moreover, I was indebted to her parents,

255
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,900
so I would naturally look after her all the time.

256
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,420
Maybe because I cared for her too much,

257
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,460
she was too spoiled.

258
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,780
So you sent her to the Lord of the West Sea

259
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,700
to discipline her.

260
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,740
Upright and righteous,

261
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,580
the Lord of the West Sea makes an excellent teacher.

262
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,580
If Zhihe can learn a thing or two from him,

263
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,340
she is bound to make some progress.

264
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,260
You do worry a lot about her.

265
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,460
But after years' waiting, you've found Fengjiu.

266
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,620
It's worth it.

267
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,820
Only she

268
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,620
deserves to be your Empress.

269
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,820
Are you drunk today?

270
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,220
I rarely hear you say something nice.

271
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,380
I didn't drink today.

272
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,180
I just heard something from Cheng Yu.

273
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,540
Cheng Yu asked Fengjiu

274
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,500
why not ask you to make the sword box for her.

275
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,140
But she answered that

276
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,660
she wanted to do everything on her own.

277
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,500
And that she didn't want to rely on you all the time
and become a loser in the end.

278
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,260
When I heard it,

279
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,700
I thought she didn't mean it.

280
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,820
Little girls

281
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,740
always want to feel cared and loved.

282
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,380
But you didn't help her,

283
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,180
and she's fine with that.

284
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,100
She did mean

285
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,740
what she said.

286
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,060
Xiaobai is sensible all the time.

287
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,740
Your Majesty!

288
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,700
Your Highness!

289
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,780
What's up?

290
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,780
The inseparable king birds and night owls

291
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,740
have been resettled properly.

292
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
I've made inquiries in person today.

293
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,140
Is it too cautious

294
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,860
to make inquiries every day?

295
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,500
However,

296
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,500
there are many people in the Sky Kingdom
and they gossip with one another.

297
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,500
Fairy maids and servants will surely talk about it.

298
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,660
I'm afraid Her Highness Fengjiu

299
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,660
will notice that sooner or later.

300
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,060
Never mind.

301
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,580
Now she's busy preparing for the Weapon Hiding Ceremony

302
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,900
and has no time for distraction.

303
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,260
After the ceremony,

304
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,540
I'll take her to Bihai Cangling

305
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,340
and we won't be back until the wedding.

306
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,820
You're too protective of her.

307
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,300
She's still a little girl.

308
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,860
She deserves to enjoy

309
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,220
the happy hours before the wedding.

310
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,980
Do you want some cakes?

311
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,420
No.

312
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,860
What about the porridge?

313
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,300
No.

314
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,660
Yes. Good.

315
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,860
When will you take me back to Qingqiu to meet your parents?

316
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,980
After I persuade grandma and father.

317
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
How come I spoke out my mind?

318
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,420
Will His Majesty get angry?

319
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,820
Are you tired?

320
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,020
Get some sleep if you feel tired.

321
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm not tired. Just lean on me.

322
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,700
Please be patient these few days.

323
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,620
After I persuade grandma and father,

324
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll take you back to Qingqiu.

325
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,500
Fine.

326
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,420
Your Highness,

327
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,740
for these days,

328
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,180
Her Majesty ate one hundred demons

329
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,980
every day to improve her power.

330
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,380
I'm afraid if it goes on,

331
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,140
demons will be exterminated.

332
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,140
I'm also aware of that,

333
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,780
but if I don't follow

334
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,620
Her Majesty's order,

335
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,980
I'm afraid I'll also be killed.

336
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,260
Your Highness,

337
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,580
forgive me for being outspoken and disrespectful.

338
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,940
I forgive you.

339
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,260
Go ahead.

340
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,940
In my opinion,

341
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,420
Her Majesty is bent on having her own way.

342
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm afraid she doesn't take

343
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,420
your wish seriously.

344
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,220
You mean...

345
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,780
If Her Majesty keeps doing so,

346
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,340
the foundation of demons will collapse.

347
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,620
What if gods and demons go to war

348
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,460
or Her Majesty turns mad and bloodthirsty in future?

349
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,620
We might as well trick other clans

350
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,860
into feeding Her Majesty.

351
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,860
In this way, we might be able to protect our clan.

352
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,420
The Weapon Hiding Ceremony is in less than two days.

353
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,820
Finally, it won't be long before the whole thing ends.

354
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,340
I remember you've finished sketching the sword box.

355
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,980
It's so late. What are you drawing?

356
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,820
So you're drawing a house.

357
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,740
Why do you remain silent?

358
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,740
I've finished the sword box.

359
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,300
I couldn't fall asleep for the moment,

360
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,100
so I began to draw the picture.

361
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,060
Actually, I'm not used to living in the fox cave

362
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,340
left by aunt in Qingqiu.

363
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,420
I've long wanted to build a small bamboo house

364
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,660
in the bamboo forest outside.

365
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,100
And I've drawn the house before,

366
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
but it didn't have bedrooms for you and fox cubs,

367
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,980
so I want to draw the picture again

368
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
and ask Mi Gu to build it for me.

369
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,020
Though in one year, you may only

370
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,580
live in Qingqiu for half of the year,

371
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,020
I still feel...

372
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,380
Is this one for me?

373
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm unoccupied actually.

374
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,300
Tai Chen Palace and Qingqiu are no difference to me.

375
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,580
I can live in Qingqiu all the time.

376
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,660
But I think

377
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,140
I should share a room with you.

378
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Why did you get me another room?

379
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,820
I've been thoughtful.

380
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,340
If we quarrel with each other,

381
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,540
where can you sleep?

382
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,340
If you don't have your own room,
should you sleep in the study?

383
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,220
I think

384
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,300
no matter how angry you're at me,

385
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,260
you should not kick me out.

386
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,340
Let's talk about these things later.

387
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,460
These are all minor details.

388
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,460
What's the most important now

389
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,900
is to figure out how many rooms

390
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,220
we shall leave for the fox cubs.

391
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,460
What do you think?

392
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,220
The number of rooms equals the number of fox cubs.

393
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,300
Is that right?

394
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,180
Well,

395
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,100
let's leave one room.

396
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,740
But I want to leave two rooms.

397
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,340
Because with two fox cubs, it can be fun and lively.

398
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,740
But I'm also thinking that

399
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,180
if they're too close to each other,

400
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,580
they may not be close to me.

401
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,340
What if they don't play with me by then?

402
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
Then let's have two cubs.

403
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,340
No need to change this picture.

404
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,860
Leave my room to them.

405
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,900
That's a deal.

406
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,540
But...

407
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,580
I haven't finished yet!

408
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,740
If we don't go to bed,

409
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,580
how can we have fox cubs?

410
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,420
But, have you seen my sword box?

411
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,620
Have I done a good job?

412
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,780
I've seen it! It's wonderful!

413
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,580
You have to get some sleep.

414
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,980
You've worked hard for days. Aren't you tired?

415
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,060
But...

416
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,620
I...

417
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,660
Many people have come.

418
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
When holding ceremonies,
Qingqiu never sends out invitations.

419
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,820
Immortals from the Eight Deserts having time
and feeling interested

420
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,060
are all our guests if they come.

421
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,900
For those who are not free or interested,
we won't force them to come.

422
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,700
Well said.

423
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,660
This is the Qingqiu's style.

424
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,260
However,

425
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,980
despite that,

426
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,820
we can still estimate

427
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,540
the size of the event,

428
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,540
the occasion of the event,

429
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,220
and the famous immortals from heaven and earth

430
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,500
who would actually come.

431
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,140
Your Majesty!

432
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,860
Your Majesty!

433
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,900
Have a seat!

434
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,500
God Zhe Yan,

435
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,420
His Majesty seldom attends ceremonies.

436
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,700
Why would he attend Xiaojiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony today?

437
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,620
Well,

438
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,780
you'll see later.

439
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,980
What's special about the Weapon Hiding Ceremony?

440
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,460
Today,

441
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,540
Her Highness Fengjiu will pass the formation

442
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,100
with the newly forged Hexu Sword.

443
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,380
Only after she passes the formation can she set foot
on the one hundred grass steps

444
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,220
and hide the sword into the Holy Mountain.

445
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,060
If she fails, there will be another divination,

446
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,180
and the Weapon Hiding Ceremony will be held again

447
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,060
one hundred years later.

448
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,940
Who set this formation?

449
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,700
This formation was a magic trick
planted by Emperor Bai Zhi in person

450
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,300
when initiating the Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

451
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,900
When the ceremony platform opens,

452
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,380
the magic trick works automatically

453
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,380
to form unpredictable formations.

454
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,580
Since it's set by Emperor Bai Zhi in person,

455
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,140
it must be hard to pass.

456
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,620
The Ceremony is a grand event

457
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,860
because it's a demanding task for the new monarch.

458
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
If she fails,

459
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,180
her efforts in forging the sword

460
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,660
in the previous one hundred years will be wasted completely.

461
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,140
Moreover, she will lose face.

462
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,260
Competitive as Xiaobai is,

463
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,580
no wonder she stayed up all night.

464
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,540
You're lucky to see

465
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,660
Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony with your own eyes.

466
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,340
In Qingqiu,

467
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,700
they rarely wear fancy clothes and hold grand ceremonies.

468
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,620
This is the most important ceremony

469
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,100
in her life.

470
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,180
A few days ago,

471
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,900
Ye Hua drank with me.

472
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,180
He found it a pity that

473
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,940
he was unable to see God Bai Qian's

474
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,900
Weapon Hiding Ceremony in person.

475
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,180
He could only imagine what she was like

476
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,100
according to book records.

477
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,540
Well,

478
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,060
what was Xiaobai like when she was born?

479
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,540
Never let Ye Hua hear what you just said.

480
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,020
He may think you're trying to piss him off.

481
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,220
You're both son-in-laws of Qingqiu,

482
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,820
but having tasted love earlier than you,

483
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,140
he's really experienced.

484
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,940
Be careful if he tricks you.

485
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,020
What's in your hand?

486
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,140
You mean this?

487
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,700
These are snacks that Xiaobai made for me.

488
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm afraid they might melt in the sun,
so I keep them in a glass box.

489
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,780
She is going to have a grand ceremony

490
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,580
in front of thousands of immortals from the Eight Deserts.

491
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,700
You actually asked her to make snacks for you!

492
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,460
Are you a bit shameless?

493
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,220
Don't do me wrong.

494
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,860
The second time I saw Xiaobai,

495
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,140
she kicked a flowerpot toward my head,

496
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,940
but she calmly made Mi Gu the scapegoat.

497
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,220
It's not a big occasion.

498
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,740
Do you think she'll get nervous easily?

499
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,940
According to rank,

500
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,060
her grandpa also has to sit in your right hand seat.

501
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,140
She actually dares to make you love her.

502
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,780
In such an occasion,

503
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,980
she certainly won't be nervous.

504
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,340
Now that you're ready,

505
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,900
it should be easy for you

506
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,980
to handle several formations of

507
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,300
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

508
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,620
How come you're so nervous?

509
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,180
Uncle, I'm not nervous about that.

510
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,620
I...

511
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Is my father here?

512
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,700
Are you kidding?

513
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,340
Your father will host
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony for you today.

514
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,980
Can he miss it?

515
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,420
What about mother?

516
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,620
What about the other uncles?

517
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,140
It's important to you. Of course they've all come.

518
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,700
Those who should come are here,

519
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,940
and the one who shouldn't come

520
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,100
is also here.

521
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,740
The one who shouldn't come?

522
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,860
Who?

523
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,500
Emperor Dong Hua.

524
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,340
Why is he here?

525
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,660
How come I didn't know?

526
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,300
Well, didn't you know he would come?

527
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,580
Uncle,

528
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,020
I've got something to tell you.

529
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,340
What?

530
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,340
After the Weapon Hiding Ceremony,

531
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,220
I'd like to introduce someone to father.

532
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,420
Can you go with me?

533
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,660
Hold it.

534
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,980
Let's talk about it

535
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,940
after the Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

536
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,460
It's time.

537
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,100
Distinguished guests, please enjoy the ceremony.

538
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,580
The Weapon Hiding Ceremony starts now.

539
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,460
If I keep fighting to stall for time,

540
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,460
I won't be able to break out of the formation for sure.

541
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,700
Though the formation

542
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,620
cast by grandpa changes constantly,

543
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,420
the number of immortals forming the formation
remains to be ten all along.

544
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,300
In this case,

545
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,580
the other shadows

546
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,260
can only be illusions.

547
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,900
Good! Good! Good!

548
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,460
Awesome!

549
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,100
Terrific!

550
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,860
Good! Good!

551
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,140
Wonderful!

552
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,460
Exchange love glances

553
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,980
with the one you love in public.

554
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,340
I've never done that actually.

555
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,460
How I failed to live up to my reputation as a playboy!

556
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,660
Finally, I can show off the sword box

557
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,540
I've worked so hard to make these days.

558
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,740
Hide Hexu

559
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,940
in the hall!

560
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,020
Long live the martial virtue!

561
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,940
May Heaven bless the East Desert!

562
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,900
A magic weapon is forged

563
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,820
by our virtuous young monarch!

564
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,780
Hide Hexu

565
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,740
in the hall!

566
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,620
Long live the martial virtue!

567
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,780
May Heaven bless the East Desert!

568
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,380
What a feast shared by the gods!

569
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,660
But to me,

570
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,420
it seems that one step is missing

571
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,860
in Her Highness Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony.

572
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,660
Showing up now

573
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
and saying those words,

574
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,500
Nie Chuyin obviously wants to cause trouble.

575
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,620
I wonder how Qingqiu will deal with him.

576
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,420
I heard that demons are natural

577
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,540
and unrestrained by rituals.

578
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,340
I didn't expect that Demon Lord Xuan
actually values rituals so much.

579
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,940
Today in Qingqiu, we hold

580
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,860
an ancient ceremony on our own land,

581
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,860
but we still have to trouble you to teach us the procedures.

582
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,140
How embarrassed we are!

583
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,380
God Bai Yi,

584
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,700
I'm wronged.

585
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,460
How dare I teach you?

586
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,340
But luckily, I've seen

587
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,700
two Weapon Hiding Ceremonies in the primitive time,

588
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,260
which I admired a lot.

589
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
I remember that

590
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,780
after the sword testing, it was the sword competition.

591
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,900
How come in Her Highness Fengjiu's Weapon Hiding Ceremony,

592
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,060
the sword hiding follows the sword testing directly?

593
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,580
What's going on?

594
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,940
I heard that the Weapon Hiding Ceremony of Qingqiu

595
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,940
does include sword competition.

596
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,900
Immortals of the same generation
can all challenge the new monarch.

597
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,820
It's fine if you lose,

598
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,300
but if you win, the new monarch will give you a promise.

599
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,180
Why have the recent Weapon Hiding Ceremonies

600
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,860
cancelled the sword competition?

601
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,220
I heard that Emperor Bai Zhi

602
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,820
set the sword competition

603
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,420
to motivate the descendants of the Bai's family
to work hard since childhood

604
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,900
so as to stand out among their generations.

605
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,660
But when it came to God Bai Qian,

606
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,260
given that she's a girl,

607
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,260
the Empress pitied her so much
that she cried before Emperor Bai Zhi every day.

608
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,820
Later, Emperor Bai Zhi

609
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,660
also felt sympathetic,

610
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,020
so the sword competition in the Weapon Hiding Ceremony

611
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,260
was cancelled automatically.

612
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,700
It's tacitly assumed that

613
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,220
if Qingqiu has another female monarch in future,

614
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,980
the sword competition will also be cancelled automatically.

615
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,860
If so,

616
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,380
Nie Chuyin has broken the rule

617
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,060
by requiring a sword competition today, right?

618
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,260
Unfortunately,

619
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,500
it's not recorded in the Ritual Book of Qingqiu,

620
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,900
so it doesn't count.

621
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,580
By coming here today,

622
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,020
he can get some benefits.

623
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,740
Anyway, he makes perfect sense.

624
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,900
Since the rules for

625
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,180
the Weapon Hiding Ceremony in Qingqiu remain the same,

626
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,060
there should be a competition.

627
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,940
I've long heard that Her Highness Fengjiu
is extremely good at sword skills.

628
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,660
I'd like to compete with her.

629
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,020
Even if there should be a sword competition,

630
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,180
you and my daughter are not of the same generation.

631
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,980
How can you compete with her?

632
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,780
Please be self-dignified.

633
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,620
God Bai Yi, you wronged me again.

634
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,340
In Qingqiu,

635
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,060
Fengjiu belongs to the third generation.

636
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,380
I'm also a third-generation demon lord.

637
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,740
In this case,

638
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,980
Fengjiu and I are of the same generation.

639
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,660
God Bai Yi,

640
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,260
I'm deeply engrossed in sword skills.

641
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,140
I want to compete with Her Highness Fengjiu sincerely.

642
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,460
I'm a demon,

643
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,860
but I'm not afraid to lose.

644
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,620
Her Highness Fengjiu is a goddess.

645
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,260
Is she afraid to lose?

646
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,700
It's supposed to be a competition within your clan.

647
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,740
After he said that,

648
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,500
it actually becomes a competition
between the descendants of the two clans.

649
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,260
Though gods and demons are on good terms
with each other these years,

650
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,500
there's actually animosity deep down.

651
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,780
Provoked by Demon Lord Nie

652
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,260
and watched by immortals
from the Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

653
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,620
Xiaojiu has no choice but to compete with him.

654
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,020
I just don't get it!

655
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,020
Why doesn't he fulfill his duty as a demon lord

656
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,860
instead of adding trouble to the event

657
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,820
and gaining the reputation of bullying the weak?

658
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,500
Father,

659
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,420
since Demon Lord Nie insists on competing with me

660
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,980
and it's hard to meet such a highly skilled sword master,

661
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,580
I'd like to have a try.

662
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,220
I can learn a lot for sure.

663
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,820
Your Highness, you're straightforward.

664
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,460
Well,

665
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,100
good!
