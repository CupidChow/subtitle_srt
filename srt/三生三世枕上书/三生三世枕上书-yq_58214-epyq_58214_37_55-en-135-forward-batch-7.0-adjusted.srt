1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 55

3
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,300
Qingti.

4
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,580
Your Highness.

5
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,500
We're still friends,

6
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,740
right?

7
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,780
Yes.

8
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,820
Your Highness.

9
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,420
How do you feel now?

10
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,420
Good. I'm almost back to normal.

11
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,420
Your Highness, thank you

12
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,700
for giving me an immortal body.

13
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,300
You died for me in the mortal realm.

14
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,140
I should thank you.

15
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,140
Immortal Qingti.

16
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm listening.

17
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,580
You are an immortal now

18
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,140
and you will be ranked

19
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,780
to serve your duty as an immortal official.

20
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,100
You were dead

21
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,620
and your former life was ended.

22
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,900
From now on, you should obey the rules of the immortals

23
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,420
and be a dutiful immortal.

24
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,420
I will.

25
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,260
Now I will cleanse away your mortal dust.

26
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,020
This is the holy water from the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool.

27
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,260
Spirits of heaven and earth
are concentrated in every drop of the water.

28
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,100
It takes a hundred year to collect just one drop.

29
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,700
Only the pure and clean water

30
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,780
can cleanse away your mortal dust.

31
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,660
Immortal Qingti.

32
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,220
Your ablution is over.

33
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

34
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,180
His Majesty wants to see you

35
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,740
in the side hall near the Qingyun Hall.

36
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,300
Immortal Qingti.

37
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,060
Go to the Qingyun Hall to receive your rank.

38
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,820
You are my peer now.

39
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,140
It'll be a pleasure working with you.

40
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,260
Me, too.

41
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,540
Waking up in spring, I find it boring reading.

42
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,340
Leaning against the railing,
I drink tea that is bitter-tasting.

43
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,620
The tea is not bitter though.

44
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,700
Old friends meet again.

45
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,300
How is the reunion scene

46
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,580
performed in opera?

47
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,820
There might be such a line.

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,420
"I haven't seen you for years.

49
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,500
Have you been doing well?"

50
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,780
You are the only one among these immortals

51
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,220
who's not ranked yet.

52
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,500
You didn't go through the cultivation process,

53
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,660
so you probably can't do anything well.

54
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,820
I think you should be the successor of emperor

55
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,380
of the Tai Chen Palace.

56
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,780
Among these jobs,

57
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,140
only the management of immortal books

58
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,460
is easier.

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,220
Chong Lin.

60
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,020
Yes.

61
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,660
Immortal Qingti, please go to the Tai Chen Palace with me.

62
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
You'd better start talking.

63
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,900
I've forgot about that.

64
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,100
I'll tell you when I remember.

65
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,020
The demons are so degenerated to end up with

66
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,980
you being the only demon lord left.

67
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,180
How pathetic!

68
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,340
While you were sealed in the Miaoyi Chasm,

69
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,540
it was we, the degenerating demon lords,

70
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,500
that ruled the demons for over 30 thousand years.

71
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,180
You don't have to feel sorry about it.

72
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,740
Glib talker.

73
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,660
Loser.

74
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,780
What?

75
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,420
I lost to Dong Hua

76
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,740
and got contained by the gods

77
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,180
because of you.

78
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,700
As a demon king, you were subjected to everywhere.

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,780
Now Dong Hua has recovered himself.

80
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,220
He will seal you again very soon.

81
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,660
I'd rather be killed by you once and for all

82
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,860
than deal with the mess after you are sealed.

83
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,860
Dong Hua can't regain his cultivation so soon.

84
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,580
The gods. They have all kinds of magic weapons.

85
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
The minor injury is not a big deal for him.

86
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,140
He has not only regained his cultivation,

87
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,100
but also sealed the Fanyin Valley.

88
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,660
He has sealed the Fanyin Valley?

89
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,220
I once fell into the Fanyin Valley by accident.

90
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,060
When I got out, I found that my power had increased.

91
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,260
That's when I knew that
the unique terrain in the Fanyin Valley

92
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,660
could help with recovering power.

93
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,060
Now the valley is full of

94
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,620
dark energy brought by you
for breaking out of the Miaoyi Chasm.

95
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,260
In order to keep dark energy from spilling out,

96
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,020
Dong Hua sealed the Fanyin Valley.

97
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,860
I didn't expect him to recover
so soon after leaving the valley.

98
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,060
So the Fanyin Valley played a key role here.

99
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,620
You said you fell into the Fanyin Valley by accident.

100
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,700
Do you still remember how to enter the valley?

101
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,580
Of course.

102
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,540
Why is His Majesty bringing herbal scents here?

103
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,180
He seems to lose a lot of weight.

104
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,740
And he looks so pale.

105
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,580
He's not in a good state.

106
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,620
It would be inappropriate for me

107
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,940
to ask him if he's doing well.

108
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,540
Would you like to have some tea?

109
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,180
Actually, you didn't have to
go to all that trouble of looking for me.

110
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I went to the mortal realm just to experience myself.

111
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,900
Eventually,

112
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,540
we would meet again in heaven.

113
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,220
You shouldn't have sealed

114
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,220
the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool.

115
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,540
If I hadn't,

116
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,060
would you show up?

117
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,460
I just wanted to see you.

118
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,060
Xiaobai.

119
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,740
I learned a saying in the mortal realm.

120
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,740
"It is better to forget about each other
than to live on each other."

121
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,980
That's so true.

122
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,180
It has been so many years.

123
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,620
How are you and she doing?

124
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,140
Who?

125
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,180
You are still the same.

126
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,580
You still can't tell

127
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,380
what you truly want.

128
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,580
I don't like her much.

129
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,900
But since you chose to stay with her

130
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,940
in the demons,

131
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,260
I have nothing else to say.

132
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,420
I've gone through the hardest time.

133
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,140
I'm doing well now.

134
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,380
And I hope the same for you.

135
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,420
It was my fault

136
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,580
that I didn't make it back in time.

137
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,220
I let Ji Heng go back to the demons.

138
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,660
I did all I could for her.

139
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,180
Is it my departure

140
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,660
that makes you feel like

141
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,900
I matter more than her to you?

142
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,380
Actually I didn't leave out of anger.

143
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,740
You don't need to be like this.

144
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,740
No one matters more than you.

145
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,740
No one matters more than you, Xiaobai.

146
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,660
I waited for so long for you.

147
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,340
You didn't make it to the wedding.

148
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,300
So I thought something happened to you.

149
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,620
I was in a panic.

150
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,780
But my father told me that you were with...

151
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,300
Well, I didn't believe everything they said.

152
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,700
But I was waiting for you to come back

153
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,740
and explain to me.

154
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,460
I would believe

155
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,380
whatever you said.

156
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,100
If you had made it back,

157
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,540
and had told me that no one mattered more than me,

158
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
I would have believed it.

159
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,220
But now...

160
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,420
Xiaobai.

161
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,780
I was thinking about what you had said to me

162
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,260
when I was in Qingqiu.

163
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,540
Were they true or not?

164
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,980
But later I understood that

165
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,860
if you like him, whatever he says is true,

166
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,820
and if you don't like him any more,

167
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,060
whatever he says becomes a lie.

168
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,580
In fact, it's unnecessary to hold on to

169
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,980
the details.

170
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,380
I guess

171
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
you used to like me, right?

172
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,660
Fate is nothing

173
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,340
I can ask for.

174
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,740
I'm the female monarch of Qingqiu.

175
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,020
I have been trapped in love

176
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,460
for too long.

177
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,940
Now it seems like

178
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,060
we are both doing very well.

179
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,420
Your Majesty,

180
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,660
I guess that's it.

181
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
I am not doing well.

182
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,500
Are the people from Qingqiu making trouble with you

183
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,820
because of my relationship with you?

184
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,500
You don't have to be responsible for my reputation.

185
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,420
Why don't we go to Nuwa Empress's place
to divorce each other?

186
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,340
I will not divorce you, Xiaobai.

187
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,300
You are my wife

188
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,900
till the day I die.

189
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,740
You're...

190
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,540
I'm kind of scary today, right?

191
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,860
Don't be afraid.

192
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,140
In Bihai Cangling,

193
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,620
the pavilion you were asking for has been built.

194
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,660
And the fruit trees have been planted.

195
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,420
As for the spiritual birds in the immortal mountain,

196
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,220
I've had them dance on the sight-viewing stage

197
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,980
at the end of every month.

198
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,980
You can go there anytime you want.

199
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,460
I...

200
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,020
Don't drink cold water.

201
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,140
Don't kick off your blanket while asleep.

202
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,660
Why are you telling me these?

203
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,540
Go.

204
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,660
What's this?

205
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,220
So we're even now?

206
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,460
I don't want your stuff.

207
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,020
You don't need to give me anything.

208
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,580
We are even now.

209
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,540
Actually our former relationship with each other

210
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,380

211
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,580

until the time comes.

244
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,500
Cast the spell.

245
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
I will enter the valley.

246
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,100
You forged the sword for me.

247
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,780
And you made Xiaojiu a ring with half of your heart.

248
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,420
How are you going to fight against
Miao Luo with your cultivation decreased?

249
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,140
The key point in containing Miao Luo does not lie in me.

250
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,820
Instead,

251
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,060
Bihai Cangling is the key point.

252
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,660
Bihai Cangling?

253
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,460
It grows with you in sync.

254
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,700
And your immortal life comes from it.

255
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,940
It's indeed easier to deal with Miao Luo there.

256
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,100
Bihai Cangling is born from chaos.

257
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,180
It's powerful enough to seal the Fanyin Valley.

258
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,820
I will then open starlight ward,

259
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,860
purify dark energy and wipe out Miao Luo.

260
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,780
Starlight ward seems unbreakable.

261
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,300
If dark energy can't be removed,

262
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,260
it will never be broken.

263
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,820
But how will Miao Luo get into starlight ward?

264
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,380
She has been the most dreadful and malicious demoness

265
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,540
formed by dark energy since the creation of world.

266
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,340
If she's alive,

267
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
starlight ward will never be broken.

268
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,580
She won't be stupid enough to follow you there.

269
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,540
As long as she enters the Fanyin Valley,

270
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,140
I will seal her with Bihai Cangling

271
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,140
and lure her into starlight ward.

272
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,060
So I need you to put on a show.

273
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,260
Dong Hua,

274
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,780
when I finish absorbing power, you will crash and burn.

275
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,420
I will see to it that your life comes to an end.

276
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,980
Wait for me here.

277
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,380
Do you know what official rank

278
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,700
Ye Qingti is designated by His Majesty?

279
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,740
You made him an immortal.

280
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,460
So for your sake,

281
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,820
he's probably given the position of

282
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,180
assisting you.

283
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,140
His Majesty designated Ye Qingti,

284
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,420
who's a new immortal with no experience yet,

285
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,820
the next emperor of the Tai Chen Palace.

286
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,940
He said after he died,

287
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,620
Chong Lin would assist Ye Qingti

288
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,620
to manage the name book of immortals from Eight Deserts.

289
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,700
What did you say?

290
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,420
I didn't catch you.

291
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,580
You heard me loud and clear.

292
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,580
You just wouldn't believe it.

293
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,300
Usually an immortal's successor

294
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,860
won't be designated

295
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,940
till the last moment of his life.

296
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,020
Normally speaking,

297
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,460
if an immortal designates a successor,

298
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,980
it implies that the immortal

299
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,540
is probably going to die soon.

300
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,580
Usually, immortals

301
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,980
will designate someone

302
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,700
who relates to them the most.

303
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,980
His Majesty designated Ye Qingti
to be the successor of emperor

304
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,020
because most of his immortal life

305
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,540
comes from your cultivation.

306
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,940
He chose the one who relates to you the most.

307
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,260
I don't believe it.

308
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,420
I'll go to the Tai Chen Palace and ask him about it.

309
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,020
In Bihai Cangling,

310
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,500
the pavilion you were asking for has been built.

311
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,500
And the fruit trees have been planted.

312
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,060
As for the spiritual birds in the immortal mountain,

313
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,700
I've had them dance on the sight-viewing stage

314
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,420
at the end of every month.

315
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,780
You can go there anytime you want.

316
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,300
I...

317
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,580
Don't drink cold water.

318
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,780
Don't kick off your blanket while asleep.

319
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,860
Why are you telling me these?

320
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,940
Where's His Majesty?

321
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,900
I want to see him.

322
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,780
Your Highness.

323
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,580
His Majesty has left the Tai Chen Palace.

324
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,660
What about Chong Lin?

325
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,620
Where is he?

326
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,220
Immortal Official Chong Lin
has gone to the Yuan Ji Palace for Third Prince.

327
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,700
He's not here.

328
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,060
Go tell him!

329
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,860
Yes.

330
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,860
Cheng Yu, Si Ming.

331
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,820
You're finally back. I was so worried.

332
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,780
Do you know what's going on with His Majesty?

333
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Why did he make Ye Qingti his successor?

334
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,380
It's a long story.

335
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,460
There are so many misunderstandings.

336
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,260
It's the crucial time to deal with Miao Luo now.

337
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm afraid...

338
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,260
Afraid of what?

339
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,060
Don't worry.

340
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,700
Let's wait in the hall first.

341
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,660
We only know that what happened in the Miaoyi Chasm

342
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,020
has something to do with the demons and Miao Luo.

343
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,340
We'll have to ask Chong Lin about it

344
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,140
when he comes back.

345
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,500
So beautiful!

346
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,500
It's so beautiful here.

347
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,820
It's way more beautiful than the Sky Kingdom!

348
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,540
Why don't you live here?

349
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,220
It's too spacious here.

350
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,260
I feel lonely living here alone.

351
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
I'll live with you.

352
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,580
I want to build a small lotus pond here.

353
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,300
Then

354
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,420
we can also build a small pavilion.

355
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,420
We'll be able

356
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,700
to watch the stars while enjoying the cool.

357
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,100
What's wrong?

358
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,140
Nothing.

359
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,620
I suddenly realized that

360
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,540
we were actually discussing how to decorate our future home.

361
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,900
I found it surreal for a moment.

362
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,060
Home?

363
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,260
Though we may not stay here for long every year,

364
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,780
it's still our home.

365
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,780
Xiaobai.

366
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,340
I like to hear you say "our home".

367
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
I've always liked it.

368
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,140
Greetings, Third Prince.

369
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,100
Chong Lin.

370
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,540
What's the matter with His Majesty?

371
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,620
Why would he appoint Ye Qingti as his successor?

372
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,220
His Majesty felt that he related to

373
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,020
Immortal Qingti the most.

374
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,820
Your Highness, your concern is misplaced.

375
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,260
That's a sign of something.

376
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,500
Chong Lin.

377
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,540
Are you going to try to keep it from me?

378
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,260
His Majesty didn't make it back to marry me.

379
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,780
It's fine. I can live with that.

380
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,700
But the next thing I heard about him

381
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,500
is that he's going to die.

382
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,140
It's too much for me.

383
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,220
You are in charge of things in the Tai Chen Palace.

384
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,580
How could you not know anything?

385
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,220
Even an ordinary man

386
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,580
can't just die suddenly with no reason.

387
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,860
Chong Lin.

388
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,580
After all the twists and turns

389
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,620
Fengjiu and His Majesty have been through,

390
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,980
she deserves to know the result.

391
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,860
If you know anything,

392
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,540
please tell her.

393
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,500
Chong Lin.

394
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,660
Tell her all about it.

395
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,860
I'll begin with the big war

396
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,380
thirty thousand years ago.

397
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,060
Back then, the Demon King Miao Luo was a rebel

398
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,540
against His Majesty who dominated the universe.

399
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,100
So she started killing recklessly,

400
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,740
which triggered the war between the gods and the demons.

401
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,980
When His Majesty was sealing Miao Luo,

402
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,580
she left two wisps of Red Qi.

403
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,060
One turned into primordial spirit blood tear

404
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,740
and was sealed in the Forbidden Land in the demons.

405
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,100
While the baby born in

406
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
the war between the gods and the demons

407
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,020
was stained with the other Red Qi in her divine sense.

408
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,940
The baby born in that war was....

409
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,140
...was me.

410
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:05,980
But

411
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,220
what does it have to do with His Majesty's end?

412
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,820
His Majesty found out about your relationship with Miao Luo

413
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,380
in the Dream of Aranya.

414
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,100
Young punk.

415
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,580
You think you can seal me?

416
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
Dong Hua.

417
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,420
It's time for us to end this.

418
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,860
Come out!

419
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,100
You finally show up.

420
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,300
Since you want to end this,

421
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,900
I'll put an end to it.

422
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,860
His Majesty knew he couldn't suppress Miao Luo for long.

423
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,100
So for all these years,

424
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,780
he had to reinforce the seal

425
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,260
to prolong the time.

426
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,660
However,

427
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,140
Miao Luo got her power back

428
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,940
way quicker than expected.

429
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,780
Miao Luo was greatly weakened with her power

430
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
and sealed by His Majesty.

431
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,540
How did she recover so quickly?

432
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,340
Miao Luo worked her way out step by step.

433
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,460
She first got Lingbi Stone.

434
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,740
Then she got Red Qi back in Fengjiu's body

435
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,940
while the Dream of Aranya was being broken.

436
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,820
Finally, she managed
to get back the demons' holy item, blood tear.

437
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,100
That's why she could break the seal.

438
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,740
At first,

439
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,620
His Majesty and I didn't know about that.

440
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,860
Before the wedding,

441
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,700
Ji Heng coerced His Majesty to meet her

442
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,540
with her father's dragon scale.

443
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,540
Ji Heng wanted to force His Majesty out of marrying you

444
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,460
with dragon scale, which His Majesty couldn't stand.

445
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,940
In the end, he transferred Ji Heng's Qiushui Cold Toxin

446
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,060
all to himself,

447
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,500
so that she could never leave the demons.

448
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,700
But things went wrong with the demons right then.

449
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,140
So His Majesty stayed at the demon clan

450
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,500
not for Ji Heng,

451
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,660
but for Miao Luo.

452
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,540
His Majesty has only loved you

453
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,860
for the whole time.

454
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,780
Your Highness.

455
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
Do you know how to remove the Qiushui Cold Toxin quickly?

456
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,900
The quickest approach is to

457
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,660
transfer the toxin all to himself

458
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,260
and then take medicine while cultivating.

459
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,300
That's the approach His Majesty chose.

460
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,220
He'd rather live with toxin

461
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,460
than let the demon princess

462
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,460
bother you in any way.

463
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,940
His Majesty went down to the mortal realm for misfortune

464
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,980
because he spent too much cultivation

465
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,860
when sealing the Miaoyi Chasm.

466
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,980
You know how it went.

467
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,900
His Majesty failed to get all his cultivation back

468
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,380
till the end.

469
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,620
From the day he woke up,

470
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,060
he's been preparing for

471
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,060
purifying the Miaoyi Chasm completely.

472
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,780
The dark energy was gathered
for hundreds of thousands of years.

473
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,860
His Majesty had to give out all his immortal cultivation

474
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,460
and at least half of his immortal spirit for that.

475
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,020
But later, he gave away ninety percent of his power

476
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,420
to get into the Dream of Aranya for you.

477
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,300
He was hit even harder for bringing you back in one piece.

478
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,340
And then,

479
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,500
he transferred the Qiushui Cold Toxin

480
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,220
to himself.

481
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,220
The Qiushui Cold Toxin is not the hardest to contain.

482
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,580
The hardest part is that

483
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,340
the immortal who gets the Qiushui Cold Toxin

484
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,860
will have to spend five times the time it normally takes

485
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,780
to recover the lost immortal power.

486
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,660
Since Miao Luo broke the seal,

487
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,580
she's been practicing her demonic magic,

488
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,220
and absorbing others' immortal power.

489
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,900
However, since His Majesty came back from the Fanyin Valley,

490
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,500
he's been getting hurt.

491
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,900
He've got no time for recovery at all.

492
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,860
So he has no choice but to fight back

493
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,060
with the remaining power and immortal spirit.

494
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,220
It's so hard.

495
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,020
Your Highness, you must have been disappointed that

496
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,460
His Majesty didn't show up.

497
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,860
You said you would wait until

498
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,820
His Majesty came back and explained to you.

499
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,140
But you might think

500
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,500
His Majesty was so carried away

501
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,020
that he didn't actually care about you.

502
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,620
You said you would wait for his reply,

503
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,740
but deep down, you were thinking about

504
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,940
going separate ways in the future.

505
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,780
Your Highness, have you ever thought that

506
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,980
His Majesty might have unspeakable reasons?

507
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,740
To be honest, after getting out of the Dream of Aranya,

508
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,540
His Majesty summoned Fate Stone

509
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,900
to ask about his destiny with you.

510
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,980
Fate Immortal told him that

511
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,660
you and he

512
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,220
were not meant to be

513
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,060
and not supposed to see each other forever.

514
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,500
But what caused the change then?

515
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,140
It was Fengjiu's obsession with His Majesty

516
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,860
that touched the Heaven.

517
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,900
So Fate Stone managed to make you destined for each other

518
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,380
with your shadows.

519
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,220
However, Second Prince
from the West Sea accidently got involved.

520
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,140
So the shadow couple
that should have been destined for each other

521
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,380
didn't work out.

522
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,980
Do you mean Shen Ye and Aranya?

523
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,020
Shadows have no afterlife.

524
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,260
So the Fate Stone has transferred the destiny
that failed in the shadow couple

525
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,620
to you two.

526
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,460
That's why you could meet each other decently.

527
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,500
But there's one thing...

528
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,700
What is it?

529
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,500
Well, according to common rules,

530
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,340
your fates should be revised
because His Majesty asked the Fate Stone about it.

531
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,900
It's such a pity that

532
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,020
your hard-earned destiny with each other

533
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,820
had to be revised due to the inquiry.

534
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,340
What did His Majesty say?

535
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,380
His Majesty did not fear fate

536
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,900
nor need its charity.

537
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,500
He just tried his best to keep his relationship with you.

538
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,540
But unexpected thing happened

539
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,140
before the wedding.

540
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,060
Fate Immortal was right.

541
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,060
We were just not meant to be.

542
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Not meant to be.

543
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,860
His Majesty was keeping his relationship with you

544
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,740
with his own way.

545
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,620
Maybe he didn't use the right way.

546
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,980
But he has been committed to it,

547
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,020
right?

548
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,100
It's just that no one can win over fate.

549
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,180
But why didn't he tell me?

550
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,260
Right.

551
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,420
Why didn't His Majesty say a word about it?

552
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,260
His Majesty is so much wiser than us.

553
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,500
Of course he knows it's better for him

554
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,060
to tell you.

555
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,580
But why didn't he say a word?

556
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,860
Before leaving, he was worried that without his help

557
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,300
you might not pass the test of

558
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,700
heavenly advance.

559
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,460
There are many misunderstandings.

560
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,020
I guess His Majesty didn't want you to get worried.

561
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,980
If he had explained everything,

562
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,900
you could have felt guilty.

563
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,020
If not,

564
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,380
he knew

565
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,660
you would complain and be pissed,

566
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,740
but still

567
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,700
be doing well.

568
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,460
It was not the time for him to tell you those things.

569
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,740
And he can't tell you.

570
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,740
Your Highness, you have a long life ahead you.

571
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,380
His Majesty didn't want you to live with guilt forever

572
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,100
if he couldn't make it back.

573
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,500
Do you know how...

574
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,540
how hard it is?

575
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,020
When His Majesty said
he was having a tough life these years,

576
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,260
what did you reply to him?

577
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,020

to hand you this after he dies.
