00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 12

3
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,460
Greetings, Your Highness.

4
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,820
Is there anything wrong in the palace?

5
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,140
Your Highness,

6
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,260
there are two weird things.

7
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,780
Tell me.

8
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,660
One is that His Majesty has a thing
for the woman that fell into water.

9
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,700
The other is that Bai Xiaojiu seems to be valued highly.

10
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,500
His Majesty had Ye Qingti bring him

11
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,300
to Praetorian Guard's unit to practice.

12
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,020
Praetorian Guard.

13
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,380
Woman.

14
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,500
Your Highness.

15
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
He ruined your plans for several times.

16
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,740
I think we have to be careful of him.

17
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,340
My brother has been

18
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,940
staying away from women.

19
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,260
And now he has a man by his side

20
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,940
whose identity is unknown.

21
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,020
If they do it on purpose

22
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,740
just to cover up their true intention,

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
I need to be wary of that.

24
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,980
Go check

25
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,580
Bai Xiaojiu's background.

26
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:07,580
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,100
Your Majesty,

28
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,780
aren't you going to paint a painting

29
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,980
for the beauty in water?

30
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,500
Why haven't you started yet?

31
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,860
She is so elegant and refined

32
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,820
that I don't know how to start.

33
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,300
She

34
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,860
seems like a lady that doesn't belong to the mortal realm.

35
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,500
She seems like

36
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,700
a fairy in the heaven.

37
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,740
Lord, slow down.

38
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,820
Please hear me out.

39
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,700
I'll go visit Her Highness with you.

40
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,260
Fengjiu is wrong to descend to the earth and use magic arts.

41
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,820
But she got backfire as her punishment.

42
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,100
Now she descended the earth again,

43
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
and you didn't stop her.

44
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,420
Instead, you told her to find Zhou Mengxi.

45
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,940
to experience Dong Hua's love misfortune.

46
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,940
Si Ming,

47
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,620
you will get Fengjiu killed.

48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Don't be mad, Lord.

49
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Hear me out first.

50
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,580
I'm going to bring her back now.

51
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,340
Just save it.

52
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,020
Lord is really bad-tempered.

53
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,620
Third Prince...

54
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,980
Cheng Yu.

55
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,900
Si Ming.

56
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Why are you here?

57
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,580
Go back to Qingqiu with me.

58
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,620
Talk some senses into her, Cheng Yu.

59
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,420
What's wrong?

60
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,180
Bai Fengjiu,

61
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,860
can't you just be the princess?

62
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,900
Why come here and suffer?

63
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,900
Didn't you suffer enough last time?

64
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,500
Where do you get your courage?

65
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,660
You have a lot of nerve to help Dong Hua with his misfortunes.

66
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,980
Work on your cultivation first.

67
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,900
I...

68
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,820
Do you forget about

69
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,020
being cheated out of your cultivation by the demons

70
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,900
and almost turning into a wild fox?

71
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,900
I...

72
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,860
Cheng Yu, can you calm down?

73
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,060
Don't look at me.

74
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,100
I can't help you with this.

75
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,740
Lord Cheng Yu would not listen

76
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,580
to me even if I speak for you.

77
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,620
Lord Cheng Yu,

78
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,980
don't worry.

79
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,820
I won't go reckless.

80
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,500
I experience misfortunes with His Majesty

81
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,580
because I want to make things right.

82
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,020
The changes were made because of me.

83
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,740
Once I find Zhou Mengxi

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,820
and have her experience misfortunes with His Majesty,

85
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,100
I will go back to Qingqiu.

86
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,260
And I will forget His Majesty once and for all.

87
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,980
This is the only way

88
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,180
to get His Majesty's misfortunes back on track.

89
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,380
And she promised that

90
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,420
she would not use magic arts in the mortal realm.

91
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,260
I won't.

92
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,820
But Fengjiu.

93
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,860
I'm afraid the same thing will happen again.

94
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
You said you were in Tai Chen Palace

95
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,780
repaying your debt,

96
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,860
but you ended up getting yourself hurt.

97
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

98
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,340
Was the backfire severe?

99
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,140
You really scared me out.

100
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,660
Well,

101
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,180
I will come visit you every now and then.

102
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,700
If you notice anything wrong in the palace,

103
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,740
let me know,

104
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,780
and I will be there to help you out.

105
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,180
Okay.

106
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,580
Oh, and I saw Ji Heng.

107
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,300
Princess Ji Heng of the demons?

108
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,420
But she is called Chu Wan now.

109
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,620
She is here for a peace-making marriage with His Majesty.

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,700
Now she lives in Wan Yun Palace.

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,620
But how come Ji Heng is in the mortal realm?

112
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,220
Si Ming,

113
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,340
go for Immortal Hanshan

114
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,220
and find out how it is recorded in the book of fate.

115
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,820
You think it's as easy as listening to stories
in the mortal realm

116
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,420
where you can listen to whatever chapters?

117
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,820
But you checked His Majesty.

118
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Eh, eh... well...

119
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,980
I did not.

120
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,460
I did abuse my power last time.

121
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,420
But it was because of Her Highness

122
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,700
that I asked him for it.

123
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,620
The record concerning Ji Heng is...

124
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,300
Is what?

125
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,460
It's the history between His Majesty and Ji Heng.

126
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,940
Immortal Hanshan would not agree

127
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,620
us to investigate their privacy.

128
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,020
Stop guessing.

129
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,420
Let's check if mortal Chu Wan

130
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,900
is Ji Heng of the demons.

131
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,300
Now you can abuse your power

132
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
and do some checking.

133
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,380
Yeah, I know.

134
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,780
Your Highness, time to take the medicine.

135
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,380
Your Highness,

136
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,940
I've heard something strange lately.

137
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,100
What is it?

138
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,740
I heard that General Ye was looking for a woman.

139
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,900
A woman?

140
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,340
It must have something to do with His Majesty falling into water.

141
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,740
You have to act with caution in the following days.

142
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,620
We don't know if it's true yet.

143
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,420
What if he's up to something else,

144
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,500
and it involves Mr. Nie?

145
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,460
Yes.

146
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,060
How's it going,

147
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,660
Si Ming?

148
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
I went check it secretly.

149
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Chu Wan is really Ji Heng.

150
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,940
But the recording of mortal Chu Wan

151
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,740
in the book of fate is blank.

152
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,740
That's weird.

153
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,980
She was the one who ran out on her wedding.

154
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,300
Now she's also the one who can't get over His Majesty

155
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,460
and comes to suffer with him,

156
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,380
like Fengjiu.

157
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,260
She has got all the best things.

158
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,860
I don't know why Princess Ji Heng
descended into the mortal realm.

159
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,540
But one thing I'm sure about is

160
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,020
the love misfortune His Majesty
is going through has nothing to do with Ji Heng.

161
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,100
Besides, if the demons use magic arts in the mortal realm,

162
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,140
they will also be backfired.

163
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,980
Ji Heng is now a concubine.

164
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,060
It's good if she don't go hard with Fengjiu.

165
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,100
If she goes hard with Fengjiu,

166
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,460
I won't let go of her.

167
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,340
Calm down, Lord.

168
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,820
It involves the demons and the gods,

169
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,220
and the privacy of His Majesty's marriage.

170
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
I suggest you

171
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,740
stay put.

172
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,340
And it's best for us to stay out of it,

173
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,620
if we don't want to affect His Majesty's misfortune.

174
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,660
We'd better sit and wait.

175
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,660
Si Ming,

176
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,020
you are such a committed immortal.

177
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,860
I'm flattered.

178
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,780
Luckily, Fengjiu is your good friend

179
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,300
so that you can be flexible sometimes.

180
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,660
Or if you do your job as you're told to,

181
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,340
we really can't bear with you.

182
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,740
I dare not.

183
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,700
Now it's affecting His Majesty's misfortune.

184
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,020
I don't believe Immortal Hanshan will keep it from me.

185
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,460
I will go for him now.

186
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,500
Cheng Yu.

187
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,900
You're here.

188
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,140
I want to tell you that

189
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,940
I've been really busy looking for

190
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,020
Zhou Mengxi.

191
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,780
Look,

192
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,660
I made a list of

193
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,380
the maids in the palace.

194
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,820
And I've crossed out all the maids

195
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,820
that serve within five years.

196
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,980
And I will look for the rest one by one.

197
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,140
It's good for you to have the patience to do it.

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,220
Luckily, His Majesty asked me to look for

199
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,740
the woman that fell into water.

200
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,540
Or I will be suspected

201
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,100
if I look for them one by one.

202
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,860
Cheng Yu,

203
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,420
you have no idea how commanding I am now.

204
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,340
Oh, do you forget

205
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,940
there's someone of the demons in the palace?

206
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,420
You're right.

207
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,940
I totally forgot it.

208
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,340
Did you find out

209
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,180
anything about Ji Heng?

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,180
Chu Wan really is Ji Heng.

211
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,340
The outcomes are the same according to

212
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,180
Si Ming and Immortal Hanshan.

213
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,700
There's no recording of Ji Heng's future fate at all.

214
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,420
But it involves His Majesty,

215
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,860
so they take it seriously.

216
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,060
But Immortal Hanshan

217
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,740
wouldn't tell me anything about it.

218
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,620
That is weird.

219
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,780
Ji Heng ran out on her wedding

220
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,540
because she didn't like His Majesty.

221
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,740
But why does she appear when

222
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,700
His Majesty is experiencing his misfortunes?

223
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,780
Maybe she regretted it

224
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,580
and found herself in love with him.

225
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,460
That's why she followed His Majesty for his misfortunes.

226
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,540
You are so thoughtful.

227
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,380
Don't forget the pain after the wound is healed.

228
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,620
There are only a few
who know His Majesty's experiencing his misfortunes.

229
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,100
I really wonder how she knew about it.

230
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,540
Maybe she's ill-intended and

231
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780
conspiring something.

232
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,900
It's a big thing that His Majesty's experiencing his misfortunes.

233
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,660
She's in no position to get herself involved.

234
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,740
My guess is

235
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,580
she's a spy of the demons.

236
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,460
Fengjiu,

237
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,020
you've been into so many troubles

238
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,620
and got punished by your father
for so many times since you were a kid.

239
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,540
I'm not worried that you will get hurt.

240
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,980
But I'm worried that you will be silly enough

241
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,300
to have others hurt you before you even know it.

242
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,820
And then all you can do

243
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,020
is tiptoe to your fox cave

244
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,620
and lick the wound yourself.

245
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,140
I'm not silly all the time.

246
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,060
When I was a pet in Tai Chen Palace,

247
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,780
Lian Song brought a drawing of a short knife
that needed to be revised.

248
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,900
He said it was a gift for your birthday.

249
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,340
Did I slip?

250
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,180
I don't even want a short knife.

251
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,700
What happened later?

252
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,420
Then I noticed that there were two places

253
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,060
that were not detailed enough.

254
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,460
So I picked up the brush pen and revised the drawing.

255
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,220
Then Heng Ji happened to come in

256
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,260
and she took the credit from His Majesty.

257
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,100
So I bit her.

258
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,820
Really?

259
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,220
Of course.

260
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,460
That's fair enough.

261
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,140
Have you seen Ji Heng lately?

262
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Has she been harmful to you?

263
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,340
No.

264
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,220
I've been wondering

265
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
if she loses her memory.

266
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,460
She seems to forget her name.

267
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,660
Losing memory?

268
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,060
How do you know if she's faking it or not?

269
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,540
When I walked past her

270
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,300
in the court,

271
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,540
I called her name in a low voice.

272
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,220
But she had no reaction.

273
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,500
She didn't seem to be faking it.

274
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,820
Ji Heng.

275
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,380
If she's faking it,

276
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,820
I'm afraid it won't work if you just call her name.

277
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,060
I have one way to find out.

278
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,420
What is it?

279
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,460
You mentioned the design drawing of a short knife.

280
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,020
Ji Heng doesn't know that you are little fox.

281
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,220
She thinks

282
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,900
only she and His Majesty know about the design drawing.

283
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,860
If you test her with it,

284
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,260
she will give herself away

285
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,820
as long as she still has her memory.

286
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,740
Cheng Yu,

287
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,020
I have to bother you to get me the design drawing.

288
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Don't worry about it.

289
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,380
And one more thing.

290
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,180
Could you bring me some sorrowless flowers

291
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,620
when you come here next time?

292
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,220
The food here is not really to my taste.

293
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
I want to make Sorrowless Cake for myself.

294
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,940
I must owe you in my former life.

295
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,340
Your Majesty,

296
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,860
this is the ginseng soup the Empress Dowager brought to you.

297
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,060
She's worried that you get too tired

298
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,620
from numerous affairs.

299
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,060
Please take good care of yourself.

300
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,020
Put it there.

301
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,860
I'll drink it with the meal.

302
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,340
Oh,

303
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,060
did General Ye get any information about

304
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,460
the lady that fell into water that night?

305
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,540
No.

306
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,700
I'm going to Emperor's Tomb today.

307
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,780
Tell Ye Qingti to prepare for it.

308
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,860
Yes.

309
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,100
It's so good that General Ye takes Praetorian Guard

310
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,260
out for mission today.

311
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,100
I can finally kick back and relax.

312
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,020
Cotton rose.

313
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,260
I never knew there are

314
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,860
cotton rose in the palace.

315
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,740
It's a good medicine for Ye Qingti's scar.

316
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,420
It's rare for you to come here.

317
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,300
You finally come around?

318
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,380
I heard that you wanted to give me a short knife.

319
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,540
How do you know that?

320
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
You don't need to know.

321
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,580
Lend me the design drawing. I want to do a copy of it.

322
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,460
No.

323
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,940
I can't show you the design drawing.

324
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,820
If you know all about the mechanism,

325
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,580
there will be no surprise.

326
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,020
I can pretend to be surprised

327
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,380
when you give it to me.

328
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:24,740
No.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,380
Are you going to give it to me or not?

330
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,380
Fine, then I'll go.

331
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,820
Wait a minute.

332
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,980
You're so childish.

333
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,900
I can give you the design drawing.

334
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,380
But you have to make a promise to me.

335
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,700
I'm listening.

336
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,380
Take some time to

337
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,380
enjoy the flowers with me.

338
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,500
No way.

339
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,900
Fine.

340
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,940
Only once.

341
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,620
No problem.

342
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,580
Once.

343
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,420
What are you doing?

344
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,460
Here you are, Cheng Yu.

345
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm making cotton rose ointment.

346
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,820
I don't want to delay your thing.

347
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,660
So I got the design drawing of short knife from Lian Song

348
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,020
and made a copy of it.

349
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,820
Here it is.

350
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Thank you so much, Cheng Yu.

351
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,860
You've been a big help.

352
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,820
Take the jar of sorrowless flowers.

353
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
I will bring you more when it's used up.

354
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,540
I've been missing the smell for so long.

355
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,220
You shouldn't have suffered in the mortal realm.

356
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,740
Your Majesty,

357
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,260
I really can't find any trace of the lady.

358
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,540
I'm so sorry.

359
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,540
Qingti.

360
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,540
Do you think I was having visions?

361
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,980
I dare not.

362
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,420
When you meet the one,

363
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,700
you will understand

364
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,460
what love is.

365
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,260
Let's end the thing.

366
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,900
You don't need to look for her anymore.

367
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,540
Your Majesty, I...

368
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,140
I have another mission for you.

369
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,580
Take a rest for a while.

370
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,380
You may take your leave now.

371
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,140
Yes.

372
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,380
Your Majesty,

373
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,940
Imperial Concubine Wan is here.

374
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,220
Greetings Your Majesty.

375
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,620
What brings you here?

376
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,100
I heard Your Majesty had a poor appetite lately,

377
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,060
so I made you the refreshing lotus seeds soup.

378
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,620
I hope Your Majesty will have a taste.

379
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,380
It's so kind of you.

380
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,780
Put it here.

381
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,380
It's my honor to serve you, Your Majesty.

382
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,500
I have been so busy with political matters

383
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,540
that I haven't got time to visit you.

384
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,580
I hope you don't blame me for that.

385
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,780
I understand.

386
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,580
You're new in State of Chengyu.

387
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,420
Do you get used to it now?

388
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,300
I told them to make sure that

389
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,900
you don't lack anything.

390
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,700
Thanks for your concern, Your Majesty.

391
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm used to it now.

392
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,340
And I don't lack anything.

393
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,860
That's good.

394
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,180
I took the liberty of changing some of the display
in Wan Yun Palace

395
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,740
without Your Majesty's permission.

396
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,780
- If it's inappropriate... - It doesn't matter.

397
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
The palace is a gift to you.

398
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,580
You can do whatever you want with it.

399
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,180
Thanks, Your Majesty.

400
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,620
If Your Majesty is available, please come visit.

401
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:37,980
Okay.

402
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,300
The lotus seeds soup is getting cold.

403
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,420
I'll go heat it up.

404
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,220
It's okay.

405
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,380
Jut put it there.

406
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,380
Your Majesty,

407
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,940
I've been into ancient books since I was little.

408
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,780
I've heard that all the ancient books in the world

409
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,740
are collected in Your Majesty's study

410
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,380
from my first day in State of Chengyu.

411
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,300
Do I have to honor to

412
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,780
visit the study?

413
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,100
Be my guest.

414
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

415
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,820
Xiaojiu.

416
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,540
You came from His Majesty's palace?

417
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:55,980
Yes.

418
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,420
His Majesty has ordered

419
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,780
to stop looking for the lady that fell into water.

420
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,060
I'll spend some time

421
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,220
looking for Zhou Mengxi.

422
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,460
The brothers

423
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,140
said they would help me with it just now.

424
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,100
You fit in well at this place.

425
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,020
Yeah, I think so.

426
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,260
Oh, I have a gift for you.

427
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,180
Reach out your hands.

428
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
I mentioned it to you that

429
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,420
there's a medicine that could cure your scar.

430
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
And I've found the key herb.

431
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,580
This is cotton rose ointment.

432
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,420
Don't you want to open it?

433
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,820
Cotton rose ointment.

434
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,700
Judged by its name,

435
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,260
there must be cotton rose in it.

436
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,220
No wonder I can smell a special fragrance.

437
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,820
That's right.

438
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,020
Apply it three times a day

439
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,740
and it will work in half a month.

440
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,380
Thank you, Xiaojiu.

441
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,180
But the imperial physician said

442
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,140
there's no cure for it.

443
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,180
I'm sorry that you may be disappointed.

444
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,980
You don't know for sure. Just try it.

445
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,060
By the way,

446
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,380
why did His Majesty stop

447
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,260
looking for the lady who fell into water?

448
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,620
Maybe he finally came around.

449
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,820
But he brought up something about love.

450
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,980
Perhaps he fell for someone else.

451
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,540
I saw the peace-maker princess coming in

452
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,180
on my way out.

453
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,260
I didn't...

454
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,380
Wonderful.

455
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,660
Wonderful. Wonderful.

456
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,140
What...

457
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,620
General Ye,

458
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,420
I want to ask for a leave.

459
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,300
I'll be back in the afternoon for my duty.

460
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,740
Your Majesty,

461
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,620
I've wanted to read the two books for so long.

462
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,700
When I was in State of Chong'an

463
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,700
I looked for them everywhere but failed to find them.

464
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,620
I'm surprised

465
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,900
to find them in your study.

466
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,300
You can take them back to read

467
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,660
if you like.

468
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

469
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,540
Your Majesty,

470
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,420
Captain Bai is here to see you.

471
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,220
Xiaojiu.

472
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,420
Come in.

473
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,260
Xiaojiu,

474
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,700
I'm surprised that you're here.

475
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,620
Greetings Your Majesty.

476
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
Greetings Your Highness.

477
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,020
Rise.

478
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,900
Thanks, Your Majesty.

479
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,300
I drew a design of a short knife.

480
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,620
And I hope to hear your advice, Your Majesty.

481
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,180
You know how to draw weapons?

482
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,740
Come here.

483
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,100
Your Highness, why don't you take a look

484
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,340
and give me some advice?

485
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,220
If it was an ordinary picture,

486
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,940
I might come up with some ideas.

487
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,700
But I'm sorry that

488
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,300
I can't help with a short knife drawing.

489
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,700
She has no reaction to it at all.

490
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,500
The weapon in the drawing can be used as a short knife,

491
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,980
a long sword, hidden needles

492
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,100
and also an iron bow.

493
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
It's multifunctional.

494
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,940
How exquisite!

495
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,820
You have a good eye, Your Majesty.

496
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,300
You got the spirit of the drawing so fast.

497
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,700
The mechanism here is very delicate.

498
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,060
That's what I revised and wanted to show you

499
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,260
in Tai Chen Palace.

500
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,700
This is what I'm proud of.

501
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,220
Once the iron sheet is pulled off,

502
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,980
the blade will withdraw automatically.

503
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
With that, the weapon can transform smoothly

504
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,660
without a trace.

505
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,220
If she doesn't remember anything,

506
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,740
what's her real intention

507
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,020
to come to His Majesty?

508
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,020
She fell in love with His Majesty

509
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,300
and wanted to follow him at whatever cost?

510
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,460
Xiaojiu,

511
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,100
can I borrow this

512
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,260
and make a copy of it?

513
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,220
Do as you wish,

514
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,020
Your Majesty.

515
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,860
Imperial Concubine Wan,

516
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,980
you can take your leave.

517
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,820
Yes.

518
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,660
Study is where I discuss important matters

519
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,260
with my deputies.

520
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,900
The concubines don't need to come here

521
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,420
if it's nothing important.

522
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,260
Yes.

523
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,860
Come here, Xiaojiu.

524
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,300
Yes.

525
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,700
How does it

526
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,940
transform?

527
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,100
Pull off the iron sheet

528
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,860
and it can turn into a short knife.

529
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,700
General Ye, watch out.

530
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,940
This is the cotton rose ointment I made for you.

531
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,660
What's wrong with me?

532
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,060
Xiaojiu is my brother.

533
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,060
His Majesty is here.

534
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,340
Your Majesty.

535
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,940
Your Majesty.

536
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,620
Rise.

537
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,300
Qingti.

538
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,300
Xiaojiu, don't hold yourself back.

539
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,340
I really want to have some fun.

540
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,980
I've never expected to have the chance

541
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,100
to spar with His Majesty.

542
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,820
Your Majesty,

543
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,740
I used to hurt myself badly

544
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,940
for trying to find common ground with you.

545
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,500
And now what I'm good at is what you're interested in.

546
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,500
Good moves, Your Majesty.

547
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,820
Good moves, Your Majesty.

548
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,340
I haven't practiced for so long.

549
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,260
Getting a bit rusty with my moves.

550
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,820
Your Majesty, it's so good that you're in the mood today.

551
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,940
You're wrong.

552
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,900
I came here for you.

553
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,260
For me?

554
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,340
And it's not bad to drop by

555
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,420
and see if you're slacking off.

556
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,500
We dare not.

557
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,260
All right, all right.

558
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm making you uncomfortable here.

559
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,980
General Ye, would you do the honors

560
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,460
and go with me?

561
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,420
Yes.

562
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,300
Tell Imperial Kitchen to prepare a banquet for Praetorian Guard.

563
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,020
Yes.

564
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,620
Thanks, Your Majesty.

565
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,340
Thanks, Your Majesty.

566
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,180
You should thank Xiaojiu.

567
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:42,860
Xiaojiu.

568
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,180
What have you done to

569
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,460
make His Majesty so happy?

570
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,340
Right.

571
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,860
Right.

572
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,180
Xiaojiu, you are so incredible!

573
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,700
Yes.

574
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,420
I don't know.

575
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,580
The design of a short knife is so exquisite.

576
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,660
At first glance, it's just a short knife.

577
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,660
But after I looked at it closely, I found it's changeable.

578
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,900
Good vision.

579
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,460
The short knife can be turned into a long sword,

580
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,020
and an iron bow.

581
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,620
And it can even release hidden weapons.

582
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,180
It's magical.

583
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,820
Really stunning.

584
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,860
Who drew this?

585
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,820
Was it

586
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,540
Xiaojiu?

587
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,020
Exactly.

588
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,580
Xiaojiu saves me

589
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,300
from troubles every time.

590
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,500
Your Majesty,

591
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,340
there's something that

592
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm not sure if I should say.

593
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,660
I'm listening.

594
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,180
We don't know anything about

595
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,100
Captain Bai's background.

596
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,460
The short knife drawing came so suddenly.

597
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,380
I think we need to be wary of it,

598
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,660
in case that you get hurt, Your Majesty.

599
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,140
Qingti,

600
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,700
what do you think?

601
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,220
Anyway,

602
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,500
he did save our lives.

603
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,340
Your Majesty, if you don't trust him,

604
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,340
I want to vouch for him.

605
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,860
If something's not right with him,

606
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,780
I will have my head delivered to you.

607
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,980
General Ye,

608
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,980
people are unpredictable.

609
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,220
What if something goes wrong

610
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,020
and His Majesty gets hurt?

611
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,380
Better safe than sorry.

612
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,260
If you give me an inch, I'll get you a mile.

613
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,700
I will trust him with my life.

614
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,380
Your Majesty, if safety is your concern,

615
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,580
I will be right beside you,

616
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
till my death.

617
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,100
Enough.

618
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,580
Qingti's right.

619
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,580
That's what a man should be like.

620
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,540
Do not discuss about

621
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,820
Xiaojiu's background ever again.

622
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,300
Yes.

623
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,020
The drawing

624
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,420
is so precious.

625
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,180
I will make

626
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,060
a copy to you.

627
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,980
And you go find

628
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,180
a skillful craftsman

629
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,380
to forge the weapon according to the design paper.

630
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,540
Be sure to use the finest material.

631
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,620
As you wish, Your Majesty.

632
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,500
He saved His Majesty at war

633
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,180
and then Princess Chu Wan.

634
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,100
And he knows how to make magic weapons.

635
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,900
Your Highness,

636
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,140
you need to be careful of him.

637
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,500
I've sent someone to look him up.

638
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,500
Your Highness.

639
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,780
Did you find anything?

640
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,860
Your Highness,

641
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,940
please forgive my incompetence.

642
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,020
I failed to

643
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,820
find anything about Bai Xiaojiu.

644
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,300
Nothing?

645
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,020
It's like he's coming from the heaven.

646
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,460
I can find nothing about him.

647
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,380
Useless.

648
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,060
Looks like there are others

649
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,260
fighting against us.

650
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,100
Your Highness,

651
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,540
we've got to be really cautious.

652
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,060
I don't believe

653
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,780
there's no information about him.

654
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,060
Looks like Cold Palace is the only place left.

655
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,460
Captain Bai.

656
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,020
Who is it?

657
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,700
His Majesty has asked for you.

658
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,220
But it's so late.

659
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,860
So I'm getting what I want?

660
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,940
Why is this place so creepy?

661
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:25,940
Xiaojiu.

662
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,340
Come on.

663
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,540
You are my imperial bodyguard

664
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,500
How can you be so timid?

665
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,060
Your Majesty, why visit Cold Palace in midnight?

666
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,700
I'm not visiting.

667
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
I'm looking for someone.

668
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,140
I thought you gave it up.

669
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,180
I said it before.

670
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,900
I couldn't forget her.

671
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,900
I fell in love at first sight.

672
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,020
But General Ye said...

673
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,100
Qingti's never been in love.

674
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,140
How could he understand my feeling?

675
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,700
Have you ever had a loved one?

676
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,620
Then you should understand me.

677
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I particularly asked you to protect me.

678
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,180
But I didn't know

679
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,020
you were so timid.

680
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,380
Your Majesty,

681
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,740
this place is kind of scary.

682
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,900
How can a place be so sad and silent?

683
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,260
For hundreds of years,

684
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,340
here have lived the most desperate women.

685
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,780
Those pains

686
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,820
and despair

687
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
are what feed Cold Palace.

688
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,580
But how can the one you like

689
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,060
be in such a place?

690
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,780
This is the only place that Qingti hasn't checked.

691
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,860
And my last hope

692
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,020
is here.

693
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,700
If she is really here,

694
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,460
I will save her out of the lonely place.

695
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,220
Dare to go there with me?

696
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,860
Your Majesty.

697
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,140
I once liked you

698
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,260
for thousands of years.

699
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,700
Sure.

700
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,060
Let's go.

701
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,260
Find me the best blacksmith in the nation.

702
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,060
Yes.

703
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,820
General,

704
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,460
words from the palace that

705
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,500
there's no one called Zhou Mengxi

706
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,140
even including those

707
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,940
who have left the palace.

708
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,220
Go.

709
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,060
Go ask Chief Imperial Bodyguard

710
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,460
to look up the list of the deceased maids.

711
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:03,980
Yes.

712
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,340
Forget it.

713
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,260
I will go to the palace myself.

714
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,420
Why have I become so weak

715
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,100
after coming to the mortal realm?

716
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,620
Cold Palace did this to me?

717
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,180
I didn't know His Majesty could be so in love with someone.

718
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,300
And even if I'm the one,

719
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,540
he can't recognize me.

720
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,220
I guess we're not meant to be together.

721
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,700
Xiaojiu.

722
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,860
Qingti, what's wrong?

723
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,580
The person you're looking for

724
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,020
is dead.

725
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,780
Zhou Mengxi is dead?

726
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,220
Yes.

727
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,500
How come?

728
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,660
Is there a mistake?

729
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,180
Or is it a same name?

730
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,140
Then...

731
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,940
Zhou Mengxi.

732
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,060
Who is she?

733
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,540
How did she pass away?

734
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,140
Zhou Mengxi was a maid guarding Cold Palace.

735
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,980
Later, she got a cold and was confined to bed.

736
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,420
She was too humble to use expensive medicine.

737
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,420
So she died a few days later.

738
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,460
And the former Emperor was gone at that time.

739
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,940
So things went a bit out of order.

740
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,500
No one ever paid attention to

741
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,060
a maid who died of cold.

742
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,220
In the end, she was dragged out and buried quickly.

743
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,380
She just died silently.

744
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,420
No wonder it's called Cold Palace.

745
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
So half a month later,

746
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,460
after I saved His Majesty, she died.

747
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,020
I guess I not only disrupted His Majesty's misfortunes

748
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,100
but also changed Zhou Mengxi's fate.

749
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,380
If His Majesty went back after he got hurt and met Zhou Mengxi,

750
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,460
she wouldn't have got a cold.

751
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,140
Even if she got a cold,

752
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,660
the imperial physician would have cured her.

753
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,500
It was all because of me.

754
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,740
It was all because of me.

755
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,780
If it weren't for me,

756
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,660
you wouldn't have died so miserably.

757
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,020
It was a spur-of -the -moment decision I made

758
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,580
that changed your fate.

759
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,500
I'm sorry.

760
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,660
Your Highness is really a kind person.

761
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,300
Si Ming.

762
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,740
You know about it.

763
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,700
I've known it just now.

764
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,100
Do you think Zhou Mengxi died because of me?

765
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,820
Yes.

766
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,340
But for her,

767
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,460
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

768
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,580
What do you mean?

769
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,140
Even if Zhou Mengxi wasn't dead,

770
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,780
and became the concubine of the man she didn't love,

771
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,540
would she have been happy?

772
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,420
Instead,

773
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,340
she was spared from misery

774
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,740
the moment she died.

775
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,940
But

776
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,020
how did you know that Zhou Mengxi didn't love His Majesty?

777
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,340
His Majesty has to experience

778
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,740
the misfortune of unrequited love.

779
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,900
That means

780
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,100
Zhou Mengxi did not love His Majesty,

781
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,020
but had to stay by his side

782
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,300
like a bird trapped in the cage.

783
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,020
Wasn't that painful

784
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,020
if it went on every day?

785
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,940
It makes sense

786
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,620
since you put it that way.

787
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,460
But the one who experienced misfortunes

788
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,740
with His Majesty is dead now.

789
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,380
Does it mean His Majesty failed to go through his misfortunes?

790
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,900
Seemingly,

791
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,900
His Majesty failed.

792
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,340
If His Majesty fails to go through his misfortunes,

793
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,260
his cultivation won't come back.

794
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,140
When the Demon King breaks the seal,

795
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,780
Eight Deserts and Six Directions

796
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,620
will suffer from a huge misfortune.

797
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,780
The consequences will be terrible.

798
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,060
But

799
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,740
it doesn't mean that there's no remedy.

800
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
What's the remedy?

801
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,020
That's why I'm here this time.

802
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,580
To discuss the matter with you, Your Highness.

803
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,500
Since you disrupted His Majesty's misfortune,

804
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,540
you should be the one

805
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,060
to make remedies.

806
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,340
Song Xuanren fell in love with you at first sight

807
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,540
when he fell into water.

808
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,860
Then you have to be his misfortune in love.

809
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,380
You have to make him experience unrequited love.

810
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,620
You mean

811
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,740
I became His Majesty's misfortune?

812
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,220
Exactly.

813
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,860
And I have to make him experience unrequited love.

814
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,940
How could I do this to him?

815
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,660
Don't overthink.

816
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,500
Song Xuanren is just His Majesty's incarnation
in the mortal realm.

817
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,300
He's not His Majesty,

818
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,340
nor his rebirth.

819
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,300
He is just Song Xuanren.

820
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,620
And you are still Bai Fengjiu.

821
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,700
This is your fate.

822
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,300
Your Highness,

823
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,980
you have to live with that.

824
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,100
Your Highness,

825
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,060
you suffer badly from backfire.

826
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,820
I will go back to Sky Kingdom and make medicine for you.

827
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,620
Si Ming,

828
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
you have to help me.

829
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,020
I didn't win His Majesty's favor

830
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
when I was a pet in Sky Kingdom.

831
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,740
You have to teach me this time.

832
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,740
We have to make Song Xuanren trust you full heartedly.

833
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,980
Song Xuanren fell in love with Zhou Mengxi

834
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,220
because she took care of him so carefully.

835
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,460
You have to stay

836
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,820
by Song Xuanren's side.
