00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 33

3
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,860
Why do you think he chose me?

4
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,060
That's strangely uncommon!

5
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,460
Probably because you're young
and naive without much experience.

6
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,940
Do you notice that two pairs of
eyes have been watching over me

7
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,380
ever since I came out of the Zuilixian Restaurant?

8
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,460
Yes, I surely do!

9
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,860
It's smiling at you

10
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,180
on your shoulder now.

11
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,260
I'm joking.

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,780
Where have you been yesterday night?

13
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,460
Your Majesty gets up really early.

14
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,980
Have you had breakfast?

15
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,460
Do you need me to prepare something for you?

16
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,060
One of my friends was in a bad mood yesterday night.

17
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,940
I brought him to his senses.

18
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,660
Is that so?

19
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
Did I tell you

20
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,660
we're having confined training in these 10 days.

21
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,380
You can't get in touch of the outside

22
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,060
without my permission.

23
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,620
It's Meng.

24
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,820
I can't leave him alone, can I?

25
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,460
It seems you have a lot of friends.

26
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,500
I...

27
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,660
Did you turn a deaf ear to my words?

28
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,340
I don't dare to.

29
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,340
But you breached the ward privately!

30
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,500
You're half-hearted and capricious.

31
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,740
How can you win

32
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,540
like that?

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,180
If you don't want to win,

34
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,740
just tell me

35
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,780
so that I can remove the ward

36
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,940
and stop wasting efforts in teaching you.

37
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,580
My apologies!

38
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,420
Do you mean it?

39
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,340
I should not have sneaked out

40
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,260
without your approval.

41
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,140
I promise

42
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,340
I'll surely train whole-heartedly

43
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,260
and more diligently.

44
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,620
Then why are you still standing here?

45
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,380
Where are you going?

46
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,540
For breakfast!

47
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,940
Not stable enough!

48
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,260
Too slow!

49
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,060
Faster!

50
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,940
Faster!

51
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,340
A sword propping up the sky!

52
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,500
Jump!

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,300
Turn back!

54
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,220
A dragon dipping into the water!

55
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,780
Who told you to stop?

56
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,220
I've trained for a whole day!

57
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,420
His Majesty didn't say a word.

58
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,780
It looks like I really offended him yesterday night.

59
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,820
Now he's avenging his personal
grudge with his position.

60
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,100
However,

61
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,940
it's sort of productive

62
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,860
after a full day's training.

63
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,060
Your Majesty,

64
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
it's no longer a challenge to me

65
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,980
to walk on snowy stakes with eyes covered.

66
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,180
A real warrior can kill

67
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,060
on the snowy stakes with eyes open

68
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,500
and don't get trapped by it.

69
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,820
I think I need to train

70
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,460
on how to treat everything as nothing.

71
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,580
What are you doing?

72
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,980
You're yet to reach the state

73
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,220
of treating everything as nothing.

74
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,100
Whichever way works for a contest of martial art.

75
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,420
But what kind of contest it is for playing qin and flute.

76
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,500
I've tried to persuade Her Majesty,

77
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,260
but Her Majesty insisted on this.

78
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,100
You're the chief examiner.

79
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,940
Don't be too hard on me by then.

80
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,860
But I can't take sides with you too obviously.

81
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,540
Can't you play at all?

82
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,380
You said before

83
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,100
that you'll promise me something

84
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,660
as long as I learn the four arts.

85
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,260
So I studied them for some time,

86
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,740
but got only the surface of it rather than the gist.

87
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,900
Then it's fine!

88
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,140
I can teach you music.

89
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,980
You should be able to make it through

90
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,300
with a simple piece of music.

91
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,220
Great!

92
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,860
How do we contest this time?

93
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,220
This time is about the tutti of qin and flute.

94
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,060
I'll select a piece of qin music by then.

95
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,780
The contestant just needs to play flute along with me.

96
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,180
Do you mean we play together?

97
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,420
That's great!

98
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,020
By then, the acoustic resonance between us

99
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,660
will surely become a story
on everybody's lips in Fanyin Valley.

100
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,260
Try it now

101
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,100
and show me what you got.

102
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,300
Sure!

103
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,340
What about

104
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,500
a simpler one?

105
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,740
Listen up!

106
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,620
You're playing too fast. I can't catch up.

107
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,220
Maybe you should teach me qin first

108
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,100
so that I can find some inspiration.

109
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,500
Fine!

110
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,700
All music is interlinked.

111
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,540
Perhaps it'll be helpful to you.

112
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,220
How did you place your fingers just now?

113
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,060
Let's do it one finger at a time.

114
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,980
Watch carefully!

115
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,820
Sorry!

116
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,660
Did I hurt you?

117
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,140
I'm awake now.

118
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,100
Right on time!

119
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,700
Unlay your clothes.

120
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,700
The neckline is so tightly attached.

121
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,660
I can't daub any other parts.

122
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,580
I will go on with the sleep.

123
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,140
Are you afraid that I will do something to you?

124
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,300
You're so severely injured.

125
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,460
What can I do to you?

126
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,260
If you really care about me,

127
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,380
why don't you let me up in day time?

128
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,780
Considering the time when it's said,

129
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,820
who knows if it's true or false

130
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,900
and not a prank on me?

131
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,500
I won't be taken in.

132
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,500
Cultivation requires you

133
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,980
to fall down

134
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
and crawl up

135
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,460
before it works.

136
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,180
Xiaobai,

137
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,300
I can't stay with you forever

138
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,620
to help you out whenever you need.

139
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,540
That sounds like I'm a pustule.

140
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,860
I survived well enough without you

141
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,940
after I fell into the Fanyin Valley.

142
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,180
You can't talk to me like that.

143
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,380
Moreover,

144
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,340
I barely had any physical suffering

145
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,180
before I met you.

146
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,820
It's all because you tossed me around

147
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,700
that I had so much bruises after I came in here.

148
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,820
You would have been smashed into pieces

149
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
when you fell into the Fanyin Valley

150
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,820
if it hasn't been the protection of my Tiangang Shield.

151
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,340
It doesn't need me to toss you around.

152
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,420
That's because Yan is good enough

153
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,740
to have cushioned me...

154
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,980
So you haven't been indifferent to me.

155
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,740
I've long heard

156
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,500
how important Tiangang Shield is to the gods.

157
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,220
You've put it on me to protect me.

158
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,340
Where is it now?

159
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,260
I mean

160
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,180
I'm very grateful

161
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,540
that it's protected me for so long,

162
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,980
but it's really improper

163
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,260
to put something as valuable as that on me.

164
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,700
It should be taken out and returned to you.

165
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,220
Why is that?

166
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,540
It's nothing but a ramification of my fairy power.

167
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,180
When my eclosion comes,

168
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,220
it'll naturally return to ashes.

169
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,660
Eclosion!

170
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,540
You also have eclosion?

171
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,220
Why do you have it?

172
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,780
If the eclosion

173
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,100
has to come,

174
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,100
when will it be?

175
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,100
Since the opening of the earth and sky,

176
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
no disaster could jeopardize the lives

177
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,180
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

178
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
If there is,

179
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,340
the day will be the time of my eclosion.

180
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,420
But it takes another hundreds of thousands of years

181
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,580
for something like that to happen again.

182
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,420
You don't need to worry about that into tears.

183
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,060
I do not worry.

184
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,420
Now that the back of your hand

185
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,100
doesn't have any cuts,

186
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,780
why do you still carry

187
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,060
the cotton rose ointment with you all the time?

188
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,020
How do you know

189
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I usually have cuts on my hands?

190
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,260
Crap!

191
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,260
His Majesty doesn't know I'm little fox.

192
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,020
Nobody else other than

193
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,180
the servants beside him

194
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,940
and the little fox should know about it.

195
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,060
The cotton rose ointment

196
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,460
cures only chaps, doesn't it?

197
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,340
Your cotton rose ointment is really well-made.

198
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
So even!

199
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,820
I raised a little fox in the past.

200
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,540
This is made by it.

201
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,980
That's a really nimble-clawed fox!

202
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,420
The cotton rose ointment is really fragrant.

203
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,140
Why do you dub it on my face?

204
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,620
It's said that this is good for keeping young.

205
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,140
Don't waste it!

206
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,700
Then let's share it.

207
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,700
You want to dub more on my face?

208
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
Let me see where I should dub it.

209
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,300
Don't move!

210
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,420
This is Emperor Dong Hua,

211
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,540
the most respected god in the world

212
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,340
whom I once admired the most.

213
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,300
Are we not sharing it?

214
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,500
Why do you stop dubbing?

215
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,980
I...

216
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,660
I need to go to bed.

217
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,700
Don't you get washed before that?

218
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,820
I'll wash the quilt directly tomorrow when I get up.

219
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,500
His Majesty is a bit different tonight.

220
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,580
He cleaned up for me before he left.

221
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,420
Why do you change all of a sudden?

222
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,020
The examiner plays qin according to his will
of speed with a lot of changes

223
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,940
to test the examinee's ability to keep in tune.

224
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,100
Examinees should pre-judge
the changes of the qin music.

225
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,620
How to pre-judge?

226
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,180
Knowing the player's heartfelt wishes

227
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,220
can help you better keep in tune with the qin music.

228
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,820
During the exam,

229
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,780
you must keep perceiving the
examiner's emotion and behavior

230
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,380
so as to pre-judge more accurately.

231
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,660
Do you really teach Fengjiu as an apprentice?

232
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,420
Have you asked Fengjiu

233
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,260
why she wants the pimpon fruit so much?

234
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,140
Demon Lord Yan from the demons

235
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
is very intimate to Fengjiu.

236
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,780
It makes sense anyway.

237
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,660
They lived together after they fell into the Fanyin Valley.

238
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,300
Perhaps...

239
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,900
That person has joined the contest on behalf of Ji Heng.

240
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,620
He has nothing to do with Xiaobai.

241
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,980
You lose again!

242
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,300
I really admire your composure

243
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,180
which justifies you as the common ruler
of the sky and earth in Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

244
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,180
I feel flattered!

245
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,740
Your Majesty!

246
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,500
I thought I'm on much better terms

247
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,460
with His Majesty.

248
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
Why does he look at me so apathetically?

249
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,060
Were those happened in the past all my dreams?

250
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,500
Why do you want

251
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,980
the pimpon fruit so much?

252
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,220
Because I haven't had it before.

253
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,060
I want to try it.

254
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,100
To make pimpon cake?

255
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,060
Maybe!

256
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,780
Pimpon fruit is originally used

257
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,140
to bring the dying back to life.

258
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,620
But I haven't studied

259
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,500
if making pimpon fruit into cake

260
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,500
will impact its efficacy.

261
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,260
How to answer His Majesty's question?

262
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,540
Yan Chiwu wants to have pimpon cake lately?

263
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,700
Yan?

264
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,140
Perhaps!

265
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,300
Yan just doesn't like

266
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,180
red beans, green beans or ginger powder.

267
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,580
Everything else should be fine!

268
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,300
He joins the contest for Ji Heng!

269
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,580
What do you think of it?

270
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,260
What does that have to do with me?

271
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,340
Do you mean last time

272
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,500
he helped me stealing pimpon fruit?

273
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,020
It's fine!

274
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,620
We have the deal

275
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,540
to split the pimpon fruit half by half

276
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,860
once we get it.

277
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,740
You'd do it as well

278
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,380
that way?

279
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,260
Of course!

280
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,740
Because whoever wins, I can get the pimpon fruit.

281
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,860
Dividing half by half

282
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,620
is the best way.

283
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,780
What does His Majesty mean?

284
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,940
Why does he keep asking about Yan?

285
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,580
Does he...

286
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,620
I almost forget that

287
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,380
His Majesty and Yan moved to Jifeng Courtyard

288
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,180
to stimulate Ji Heng.

289
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,620
It's far from

290
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,140
what His Majesty wants,

291
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
so he became worried

292
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,420
and concerned about Yan.

293
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
It's so ridiculous that I thought

294
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,620
it's because of me.

295
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,860
Now that I know the cause,

296
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,620
I might as well be the good guy

297
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,660
to do His Majesty a favor.

298
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,420
His Majesty is so proud

299
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,700
that I can't unravel his concern.

300
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:09,980
Your Majesty,

301
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,860
the final is approaching anyway.

302
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,420
How about removing

303
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,620
the ward?

304
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,460
It will be convenient for friends to come by.

305
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,620
We'll be more at ease.

306
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,420
So will the visitors.

307
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,380
It's the best for both worlds.

308
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,100
What are you doing?

309
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,020
Why do you put up two more extra layers?

310
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,740
Is it because I unraveled his concern

311
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,100
which infuriated him?

312
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,700
Jiuge!

313
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,620
You look so great after a few days.

314
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,620
Certainly!

315
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,140
I've thought it over.

316
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
I must cheer up

317
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,900
and keep forging ahead,

318
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
otherwise I won't deserve Princess Fengjiu.

319
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,260
That's right!

320
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,540
I'm not late, am I?

321
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,540
No, right on time!

322
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,620
Xiaojiu, first things first.

323
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,020
Contest goes ahead of friendship today.

324
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,340
Whoever wins the pimpon fruit,

325
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,140
don't be difficult and sulky to the other, alright?

326
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,780
That sounds like you're winning it for sure.

327
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,860
Let's check it out.

328
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,060
Tournament for the inseparable king birds

329
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,180
starts now!

330
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,300
This tournament has two rounds.

331
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,940
Only those who pass the first round
are allowed to the second round.

332
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,940
First round is in the morning.

333
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,380
Second round is in the afternoon

334
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,180
and will be held at Green Plum Cove outside the castle.

335
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,020
In first round, musicians will play qin.

336
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,380
Contestants need to play flute in response.
Music must be in tune.

337
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,180
Those whose music has no distinct mistake

338
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,660
will pass.

339
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,540
The tournament starts now!

340
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,700
Musician, please!

341
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,820
First contestant,

342
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,180
be ready!

343
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,020
Princess Jielu passed!

344
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,860
She is awesome!

345
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,860
She deserves it.

346
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,260
She has the competitiveness.

347
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,780
Jiuge, be ready!

348
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,460
This... this is...

349
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,780
They are both...

350
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,940
Yeah!

351
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,580
Right!

352
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,060
It's pretty difficult!

353
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,580
Your Majesty,

354
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,420
as far as I see,

355
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,820
the difficulty of this music increases suddenly.

356
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,700
This student is hard to pass.

357
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,180
Knowing the player's heartfelt wishes

358
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,500
can help you better keep in tune with the qin music.

359
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,780
During the exam,

360
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,980
you must keep perceiving
the examiner's emotion and behavior

361
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,260
so as to pre-judge more accurately.

362
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,940
The qin music and flute music are harmonious
but aggressive to one another.

363
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,860
It's really awesome!

364
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,780
No mistake for that sudden change.

365
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,500
It's really a surprise that

366
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,980
this student is so good.

367
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,540
Good!

368
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:04,980
Good!

369
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,260
Awesome!

370
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,660
That's awesome!

371
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,100
That's just great!

372
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,420
Jiuge passed!

373
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,260
Next contestant, be ready!

374
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,260
My turn so soon!

375
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,820
I think Yan

376
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,420
will be eliminated in the first round!

377
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,220
That's so careless!

378
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,300
Never mind!

379
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,300
What a contrast it is

380
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,100
that Yan is playing flute so attentively

381
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,780
while he is always care-free in usual.

382
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,100
He does look like

383
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,580
a gentleman now.

384
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,540
The musician trained him well.

385
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,100
He was trained by musician?

386
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,980
Yeah!

387
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,380
The musician has been training him for music.

388
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,100
But this piece of music is much simpler

389
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,060
compared with yours.

390
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,660
Alright!

391
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,540
Yan passed!

392
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,460
The sword contest on snowy
stakes starts in the afternoon.

393
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,580
Contestants can choose your opponent randomly.

394
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,740
Winner will be determined in the end.

395
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,460
The award is pimpon fruit.

396
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,060
Isn't this the Green Plum Cove?

397
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,900
Why is it all barren?

398
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,140
This place used to be planted with green plums

399
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,020
when Fanyin Valley had distinct four seasons,

400
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,500
so it's called Green Plum Cove.

401
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,020
But most of the green plums have been destroyed

402
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,740
by the snow and frost in recent century.

403
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,460
Then Her Majesty ordered to clean up this place

404
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,820
and use it as a competition terrain.

405
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,980
Understood now!

406
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,340
What time is it?

407
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,700
Your Majesty, it's a quarter to 1 pm.

408
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,220
Why is Ji Heng so strange lately?

409
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,460
She wasn't like this in the past.

410
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,100
The contest is about to start
but His Majesty hasn't come yet.

411
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,140
He is still coming, isn't he?

412
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,180
Your Majesty, Emperor Dong Hua has come!

413
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,020
And His Highness Lian Song has also arrived.

414
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,860
Welcome Your Highness!

415
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,700
It's such a surprise

416
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,140
that you're so interested

417
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,380
in the tournament of the inseparable king birds.

418
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,420
I'm here to yell for you in specific.

419
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,180
Don't you find it

420
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,740
a pleasant surprise?

421
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,220
Aren't you here for fun?

422
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,780
Welcome Emperor Dong Hua

423
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,260
and Third Prince's esteemed presence.

424
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,940
I'm a bit late.

425
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,300
When will the contest start?

426
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,860
The students are all ready.

427
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,540
It can start immediately.

428
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,420
Then let it start!

429
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,300
All contestants be ready!

430
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,980
Folks, please calm down!

431
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,100
For today's sword contest on snowy stakes,

432
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,100
all contestants can randomly

433
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,300
choose your opponent.

434
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,140
The last person left on the snowy stake is the winner.

435
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,100
The contest starts now.

436
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,860
I came because you said today's contest is fantastic,

437
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,740
but it's pretty boring so far as I see it.

438
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,620
How about

439
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,380
we play a round,

440
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,660
what do you say?

441
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,940
Sure!

442
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,500
But the contest has just started.

443
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,060
Stay patient!

444
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,420
Please!

445
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,900
Excuse me!

446
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,580
The swordsmanship of the inseparable king birds

447
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,660
is not as good as that of Fengjiu
which has dozens of thousands of years of practice.

448
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,980
As long as she stays careful

449
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,980
and doesn't fall from the snowy stake,

450
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,860
pimpon fruit will be hers to take.

451
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,980
Haven't you figured out why she needs the fruit?

452
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,260
Excuse me!

453
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,980
Excuse me!

454
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,220
Your Highness,

455
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,740
I'll give way to three moves.

456
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,620
Please!

457
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,020
I don't need that.

458
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:57,900
Jiuge,

459
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,060
your swordsmanship is much better than I expect.

460
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,900
This contest is related to the reputation
of the inseparable king birds.

461
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,100
Jiuge,

462
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,620
I'm not going to have mercy.

463
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,380
Please!

464
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,060
Do you want to move on?

465
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,620
I'm going to use the trump card now.

466
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,580
Alright!

467
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,780
I'd love to see that.

468
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,300
Excuse me!

469
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,020
Haven't you figured out why she needs the fruit?

470
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,300
Meng, excuse me!

471
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,980
My mind was drifting

472
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,460
which gives you the chance.

473
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,100
I candidly admit the defeat.

474
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,260
Excuse me, Your Highness!

475
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,460
The final match

476
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,500
will be

477
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,260
between Yan and Princess Jiuge.

478
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,380
It does become more interesting

479
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,980
to the end.

480
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,340
Xiaojiu,

481
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,780
just like I said,

482
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,260
if I win, you'll have half of the fruit.

483
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,780
It's not determined yet.

484
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,300
Jiuge!

485
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,540
Yan, are you crazy?

486
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,460
He is indeed the demons.

487
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,980
Only the demons will make such vicious moves.

488
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,980
It might be difficult for Fengjiu to beat him this time.

489
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,860
Musician!

490
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,100
Dong Hua!

491
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,220
You ruined my plan again.

492
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,180
Are you OK?

493
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,220
It shouldn't be to this extent

494
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,500
of making her pass out suddenly.

495
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,060
The winner of this tournament

496
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,980
is...

497
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,420
Jiuge!

498
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,420
The award is pimpon fruit!

499
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,460
Prior to the picking of pimpon fruit,

500
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,660
His Majesty's blood must be dropped
into the belly of the python.

501
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,740
After the python sleeps for one day and one night,

502
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,420
the fruit can be picked.

503
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,100
So the award will be presented after two days.

504
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,340
Folks, congratulations to Jiuge!

505
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,580
Congratulations!

506
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:39,940
Jiuge,

507
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,020
congratulations to you!

508
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,500
You were awesome just now.

509
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,780
Congratulations! You're great!

510
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,940
What a comeback that was!
Congratulations to you, Jiuge!

511
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,900
Good! Good! Good!
