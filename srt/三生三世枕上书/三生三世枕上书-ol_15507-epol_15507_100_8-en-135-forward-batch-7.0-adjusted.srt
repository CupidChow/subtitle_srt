1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 8

3
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,320
I have one more thing to report, Your Majesty!

4
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,360
The little fox has been missing since the day before yesterday.

5
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,720
You'll be solely in charge

6
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,600
of all the matters in Tai Chen Palace in the future.

7
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
Stay in the Yi Shi San Heaven to look for it carefully.

8
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,560
Yes, Your Majesty!

9
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,600
Greetings to Your Majesty. What can I do for you?

10
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,040
Search the whole fairy mountain

11
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
for a completely red spiritual fox for me.

12
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,800
I'll surely do my best to search for it.

13
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,040
God Zhe Yan,

14
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,080
what on earth do you want?

15
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm not here to calculate the interest with you.

16
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
But somebody is!

17
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,760
Damn you! You'd better remember me well.

18
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,920
Your Highness Fengjiu,

19
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,240
the three-year deadline for entertainment
hasn't become due yet.

20
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
Are you here to remind me that

21
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,280
I'm the Demon Lord betrayed by the gods.

22
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,520
You clearly said to give me half of your cultivation,

23
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
but it lasted less than half a day.

24
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,440
Thanks to His Majesty's purification of the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

25
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
or we'll end up dying there together.

26
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,440
Yes!

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,390
I did promise to give you half of my cultivation,

28
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,070
but I didn't say how long it would be.

29
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,070
You promised to let me use it for three years.

30
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,070
You're almost as shameless

31
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,280
as Dong Hua.

32
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,920
Wait! Wait! Wait!

33
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,280
Why are the gods so shameless

34
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
and always bully us with manpower advantage?

35
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,000
You used Zhe Yan to wear me down first,

36
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,760
and then follow up the victory.

37
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
Speaking of shamelessness,

38
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
do you have any less of it

39
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,440
when you cheated me for my fur?

40
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
It was you who breached the agreement in the first place.

41
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,760
Now you second plan is to kill the Demon Lord, isn't it?

42
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Fine!

43
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Just do it!

44
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,450
You!

45
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,480
Demon Lord Nie, you took advantage of her misfortune first,

46
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
and then acted rudely in front of me.

47
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,440
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

48
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,440
But as you're regretful,

49
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll forgive you for that.

50
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,920
I did breach the agreement.

51
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,840
If you refuse to obey that,

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,080
go to Qingqiu for a decisive battle with me.

53
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
I'll be waiting for you as always.

54
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,480
Let's wait and see!

55
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm still cultivating the Miao Luo magic power right now.

56
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,240
When I find the soul-locking jade...

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,840
The revenge does make me feel much better.

58
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,560
God Zhe Yan,

59
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,480
why do you look upset instead?

60
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,720
Nie Chuyin is a bit strange.

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,240
He used a different magic power

62
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,720
from the last time when I met him.

63
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,440
That shameless jerk

64
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,240
was so argumentative after cheating on us.

65
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
He tried to put the charges on us!

66
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't be so credulous

67
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,200
toward others.

68
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
I can earn your faces back for you.

69
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,920
It is not a problem even if
you want to go to the Yi Shi San Heaven.

70
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,240
But you have to rely on yourself

71
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
to find the lost dignity!

72
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Got that, God Zhe Yan!

73
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
As it always was,

74
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,320
your uncle and I are always your supporters.

75
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,480
I've let Li to stay beside the Fox King!

76
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,840
Remember to apologize when you get back!

77
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,560
As an elder sister,

78
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,800
how can I ask Li to intercede for me?!

79
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,960
Don't worry about that.

80
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,640
Ingratiating is something

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,640
she can easily do,

82
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
just as it is to you.

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,920
Let her stick to the Fox King.

84
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Only by doing so will you
have the chance to be exempted, right?

85
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,480
Fa Luo! Luo!

86
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,760
Se Bai,

87
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,760
a musical instrument in Tai Chang.

88
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,160
It can produce beautiful music that travels several miles.

89
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,400
Several miles...

90
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,600
The Yan's!

91
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,320
The Yan's scripture takes the standardized form of character as Luo.

92
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,600
It follows the pronunciation.

93
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
Very good!

94
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,040
Greetings from Fengjiu, grandpa!

95
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
Sister Fengjiu!

96
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,160
Li, you recited it well today.

97
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
Fengjiu,

98
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,000
you said it will take only several days

99
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,960
to travel to the fairy mountain.

100
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,960
Why are you back so late?

101
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,760
I...

102
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,240
On your knees!

103
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,160
You are the Princess of Qingqiu.

104
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,920
Even though you haven't followed the rite of Bingcang,

105
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,000
you should conduct yourself decently.

106
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,560
Grandpa, it's my fault.

107
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Please don't be mad!

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
She is still too young!

109
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,000
Being playful makes sense.

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,360
However,

111
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,560
you should not have passed the throne to her so early.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,600
No! No!

113
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
Grandpa has his own reasons for that.

114
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,080
It was I who have been too playful!

115
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,360
Grandpa,

116
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
sister Fengjiu must have been too careless and got lost.

117
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,400
She is so pathetic!

118
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,560
Look how skinny she has become!

119
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,040
Grandpa, please forgive sister Fengjiu!

120
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
You're used to find supporters

121
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,040
ever since you're young.

122
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,920
Everyone in Qingqiu

123
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,960
is too tolerant to you

124
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,760
which turns you into an irresponsible troublemaker.

125
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
There is no trouble you dare not make.

126
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Fengjiu,

127
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
you mother had quite a difficult time

128
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,800
when she gave birth to you.

129
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,800
Miao Luo hid the truth from the masses
and did a lot of bad things.

130
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,140
You mother had to fight for Qingqiu Mountain

131
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,640
with you in the belly.

132
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
She survived with great efforts.

133
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,440
In the end, Miao Luo was finally defeated by the Emperor

134
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
and got sealed.

135
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,900
Your birth was considered

136
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
to be a good omen in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

137
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,480
The catastrophe was over

138
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
and peaceful days started.

139
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,200
The Bais had a baby girl

140
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,440
with a red phoenix-feather-flower birthmark

141
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
on the forehead.

142
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
No respected god has ever missed

143
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,520
your first birthday party

144
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,520
or forgot to give you good wishes.

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
You grew up with plenty of love.

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,400
Who is not exceptionally tolerant to you?

147
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Even I took you here from your father

148
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,080
and raised you in person.

149
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,560
If anything happens to you,

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,440
have you ever thought about your mother

151
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,240
or Qingqiu?

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Grandpa, please forgive me.

153
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll surely bear your words in mind in the future

154
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,720
and be a qualified Princess of Qingqiu.

155
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,840
Grandpa, please don't be mad!

156
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,400
Grandpa!

157
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,920
Grandpa!

158
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Alright! Rise!

159
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,920
Thank you, grandpa!

160
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,920
Then I'll take Li to pick loquats.

161
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,960
Let's not waste the time that

162
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,280
God Zhe Yan will spend with grandpa for proper business.

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,320
Fine!

164
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,640
Thank you, grandpa!

165
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,160
Let's go!

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,720
What does His Majesty mean?

167
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,640
A few lives have exchanged in a glimpse!

168
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
His Majesty's will is not for us to know.

169
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,960
It is probably for the search of some kind of treasures.

170
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,480
His Majesty has lost the bride on the day of marriage.

171
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,720
This is presumably for the search of the future Queen!

172
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,200
I also heard that

173
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,800
His Majesty has lost a favorite spiritual fox.

174
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,760
The Earth Immortals in earth realm

175
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,120
have got nothing for His Majesty in the search.

176
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,480
Maybe they are searching for the spiritual fox.

177
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Which is more important between the fox and the bride?

178
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
Isn't that evident?

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,960
Right! That's right!

180
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm just confused.

181
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,080
Take it slowly!

182
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,680
Be careful!

183
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,840
Your Highness!

184
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,280
Come on!

185
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,800
Here you are!

186
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,480
I suppose we'll get to Fanyin Valley

187
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
after climbing over this mountain.

188
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,840
Just call me Ji Heng in the future.

189
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm fine!

190
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,520
Maybe the Qiushui Cold Toxin breaks out again!

191
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,800
Come! Let me take you for recovery!

192
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,240
Go!

193
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,280
Stop it!

194
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,840
Brother!

195
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
Brother!

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,720
Min Su, as the guard for the Princess,

197
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
you're negligent and disrespectful!

198
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,040
You let down the trust I have on you

199
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
over all those years.

200
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,680
Take him down!

201
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,200
Yes!

202
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,240
Hold it!

203
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,480
I did it all on my own.

204
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,520
This has nothing to do with him.

205
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,320
Do you know how severe the crime you committed?

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
Come with me back to the palace!

207
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm determined

208
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,240
not to return to the evil palace again!

209
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,960
The plan for the gods and demons are not for you to decide.

210
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,160
Guard!

211
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,320
Take them back to Chihong Hall!

212
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,240
Yes!

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,920
Min Su!

214
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,730
Min Su!

215
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,320
Kill him!

216
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,070
Princess!

217
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,070
Princess!

218
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,240
Are you sure to do so for him?

219
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,440
Come back with me now!

220
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,720
You may kill me with your sword

221
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,520
than taking me back!

222
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,480
The demons are so ashamed of you.

223
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you think I won't take any actions on you?

224
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
The worst result is death

225
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,920
which is better than being manipulated by you.

226
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,600
Now that you're careless to your own life,

227
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,800
I'd do what I have to.

228
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,160
Demon Lord,

229
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,080
please let go of Princess Ji Heng.

230
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,160
What are you doing?

231
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,280
Let me answer

232
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,600
for all the crimes.

233
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,000
How can a small guard like you

234
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,080
answer for a big crime like this?

235
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,160
Get out of the way!

236
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,240
Get out!

237
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,480
Min Su!

238
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,920
Min Su!

239
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,120
Min Su!

240
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,440
Why are you doing this?

241
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,320
It's all because of me!

242
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
If it hasn't been me,

243
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,880
you won't be killing each other now

244
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,440
and can start it all over again.

245
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
It won't go back!

246
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,200
It will never go back without you.

247
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,480
Hold on!

248
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm taking you to His Majesty.

249
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,480
- He surely will help us. - It's no use.

250
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,560
It's no use.

251
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,840
I'm sorry...

252
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,360
that I can't protect the Princess

253
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
to the Fanyin Valley!

254
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
No!

255
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,440
You...

256
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,480
Don't you leave me alone!

257
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Don't come here!

258
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,240
Your Highness, don't waste your effort.

259
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,160
I have some words to say to you.

260
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
OK! OK!

261
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,760
I shouldn't have cheated on you.

262
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
No!

263
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm...

264
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm actually a girl.

265
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,080
No! That's not possible! How is that possible?

266
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm an orphan since I was young.

267
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
In order to stay alive,

268
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
I have to dress up as a boy!

269
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,800
Fortunately, the Demon Lord took me in

270
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,080
and kept me as a guard for you.

271
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,120
I promised to send you to Fanyin Valley

272
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,880
and planned to tell you the truth there,

273
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,040
but I'm afraid that I can't wait till then.

274
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,680
No!

275
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
We will meet...

276
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,760
again...

277
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
- No! No! - in next life...

278
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Min Su!

279
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,080
Your Majesty!

280
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,920
Your Majesty!

281
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,680
The Princess...

282
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,960
The Princess is your biological sister.

283
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,240
Please don't get your eyes covered by something else.

284
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,040
She should be set free.

285
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,480
Your Majesty!

286
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,000
Min Su!

287
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,600
Min Su!

288
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,400
Min Su!

289
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,880
Don't leave me alone!

290
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,040
Please don't leave me alone!

291
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,080
Your Majesty, play with us, will you?

292
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:19,920
Really?

293
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,760
What are you doing?

294
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,080
Come! Hurry up!

295
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,920
You...

296
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,960
The moonlight is so bright at the bedside.

297
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,840
I toss and turn on bed.

298
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,400
To who?

299
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,600
Ji Heng?

300
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
You don't like writing since you were young.

301
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,000
Now you forget your identity

302
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,800
as a guard for Ji Heng!

303
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
What an idiot!

304
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,600
Tell me all about the actions

305
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,400
of Ji Heng's personal guard, Min Su, in the future.

306
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,680
Tell me how many times he meets Ji Heng in a day,

307
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,800
what words he says,

308
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
and how close he is to Ji Heng while talking.

309
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,040
I need to know all that.

310
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,160
Yes!

311
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,000
Go back!

312
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,400
Xu Yang,

313
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm breaking up all biological relationship with you

314
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,970
from today onwards.

315
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,480
Min Su!

316
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,680
Let's meet again in next life.

317
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,880
Ji Heng!

318
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
Your Majesties,

319
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,680
I've figured out the Emperor's marriage escape.

320
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,560
It was planned by Min Su, the body guard of Ji Heng.

321
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,040
Ji Heng is so young and stubborn

322
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,840
that she got incited

323
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
to run away from the marriage.

324
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,320
As Ji Heng's older brother,

325
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,680
I feel regretful not to have taught her well.

326
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm willing to take any penalty.

327
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,800
Where is Min Su

328
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,760
and Ji Heng now?

329
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,480
I chased them all the way

330
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,080
and caught them.

331
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,840
However...

332
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,000
Min Su committed suicide on site for his own guilt.

333
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,760
Ji Heng fell off the cliff and got missing.

334
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,560
This is done by them alone.

335
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,440
It has nothing to do with the demons.

336
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,320
I hope Your Majesties can have mercy

337
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,160
and don't get others involved

338
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,720
that might do hard to the relationship
between the two clans.

339
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
I'm willing to take up whatever penalty left.

340
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,680
So what do you think, Emperor Dong Hua?

341
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
It can't be helped.

342
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,360
Forget about it for now.

343
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
Thank you, Your Majesty!

344
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,480
Now that the Emperor Dong Hua has forgiven it,

345
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,880
I would also give it a way out.

346
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,800
Hope this won't happen again

347
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,920
in the future!

348
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,160
Otherwise, neither the demons nor the gods will feel ashamed.

349
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,520
Thank you, Your Majesty!

350
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,720
Go get it cleaned up!

351
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,200
Excuse me please!

352
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,360
Greetings, Your Majesties!

353
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,040
External affairs are done. It's time to clean up internal affairs.

354
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,600
Do you two confess?

355
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,640
Goddess Zhihe created trouble at the Emperor's worship of Heaven.

356
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,120
You offended the superior
and will be exiled to the western desert

357
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,640
to take charge of rainfall.

358
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,280
You shall not return without being summoned.

359
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Lian Song failed his duty to host the marriage

360
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,560
which is a great disappointment to His Majesty's trust.

361
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
You shall be exiled to the South Heavenly Gate as a guard.

362
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,640
Wait a minute!

363
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
No blame attaches to the unconscious doer of wrong.

364
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,080
The Third Princess should not be punished so severely.

365
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,360
Now that His Majesty has forgiven you,

366
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,760
you shall be punished to repent in Yuan Ji Palace.

367
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,480
Thank you, Your Majesties!

368
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,600
Your Majesty, you're so cruel!

369
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,640
You interceded for Lian Song

370
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,840
rather than me.

371
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,040
Aren't you concerned about me at all?

372
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,360
The Heavenly King has given you the softest penalty

373
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
for my sake.

374
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,920
Aren't you content with it?

375
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,160
But I'm...

376
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,320
I've pampered you too much

377
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
in your daily matters

378
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,120
which resulted in today's accident.

379
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,880
You should be polished

380
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,280
this time for good.

381
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,280
Your Majesty!

382
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,280
Your Majesty!

383
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,520
Your Majesty!

384
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,200
Your Majesty!

385
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Demon Lord!

386
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,320
Min Su is dead. Ji Heng is left all alone.

387
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
She fell into the mortal realm.

388
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,400
No wonder we didn't find her before.

389
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,800
Bring her back!

390
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,520
Yes!

391
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,680
There you go!

392
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,240
Who are you?

393
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,280
Where...where is this place?

394
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,560
Why am I here?

395
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,160
Who am I?

396
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,040
You don't remember me?

397
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,560
Then do you still remember

398
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,360
how you fell off the cliff?

399
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,800
I seem to remember that...

400
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
that someone is chasing me.

401
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,800
I jumped from a very high place.

402
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,280
I don't remember why they chased.

403
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,680
Don't try to recall then.

404
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
You need to take a good rest.

405
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,120
I'll help you find out your lot.

406
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,040
This is really helpful!

407
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Your Majesty,

408
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,480
I prepared some clean sweet dew

409
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,280
to help you recover your cultivation.

410
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,960
Your Majesty, are you going to Miaoyi Chasm again?

411
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,920
Ever since Miao Luo was imprisoned in Miaoyi Chasm,

412
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,360
she's been breathing the three-poisonous toxin from six realms

413
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,880
and trying to break out from the seal.

414
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,120
She is ever more active in recent days.

415
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,040
She needs to be brought under control urgently.

416
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,760
But your cultivation

417
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,760
was impaired in the Ten-evil Lotus Land

418
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,640
and it hasn't recovered yet.

419
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,180
It is further impaired

420
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,560
when you suppressed the Qiushui Toxin in Ji Heng.

421
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,280
I'm afraid...

422
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,120
Never mind!

423
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,480
I'm afraid your cultivation will be difficult to recover.

424
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,600
Are you here to see me again?

425
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,720
Or are you aware that

426
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
you'll soon be unable to hold me?

427
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,720
You're obsessive.

428
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,960
Don't you feel tired from all the repairing work?

429
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,680
I'll break out sooner or later.

430
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
Dong Hua,

431
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,820
you and I are all prestigious figures

432
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,150
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

433
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,440
You should let me go!

434
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,280
Wouldn't it be much better

435
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,150
if we join hands?

436
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,230
You shameless demon!

437
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,560
What? Getting injured so easily?

438
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,880
Or,

439
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,600
you came with injuries?

440
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,600
Don't be too hard on yourself.

441
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,040
How much longer can you seal me?

442
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,480
Even if I'm injured,

443
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,120
suppressing you is a piece of cake.

444
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,360
Don't you even think about breaking free!

445
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,920
Your Majesty,

446
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
there you come finally!

447
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,280
What happened?

448
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,320
Your Majesty!

449
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,160
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

450
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,720
How come you are so severely injured?

451
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,480
Do I need to summon the Imperial Doctor?

452
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,440
Don't reveal what happened today

453
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,160
to anyone else.

454
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,320
Your Majesty!

455
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,480
Your Majesty!

456
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,520
You're so careless

457
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,400
to your own life,

458
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,960
and yet you can survive this long.

459
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
Don't joke with me, Third Prince.

460
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,260
This is the top priority

461
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,600
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

462
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,240
God Yun Zhuang is waiting outside.

463
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,200
Invite him inside!

464
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,280
Sure!

465
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,200
Please!

466
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,520
Greetings to Third Prince and God Chong Lin.

467
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,640
I invited you here

468
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,920
for a particularly important matter.

469
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,060
I'm all ears to it.

470
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,480
His Majesty fell asleep from the suppression of Miaoyi Chasm.

471
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,320
We both know he has issued a prohibitive edict.

472
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
So this should be held back from anyone outside the palace

473
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,680
in case it will create turmoil in the six realms.

474
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,880
I got it!

475
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,840
By the way,

476
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,000
thanks to your help the other day

477
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,440
to make the change

478
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,520
on the mortal Book of Fate

479
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,600
for Si Ming

480
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,680
so that it can deceive all the immortals.

481
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
What if His Majesty becomes interested

482
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,640
in the dukkha among the mortals

483
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,040
which are birth, aging, illness, death,

484
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,690
association with the unbeloved, separation from the loved,

485
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,520
not getting what is wanted, and the five clinging-aggregates,

486
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,000
and reincarnate into a mortal to observe them?

487
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,200
His Majesty slept in a hurry

488
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,750
and didn't leave any other orders.

489
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,600
But there is a thought lately

490
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
which troubles me a lot.

491
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,320
May I ask what is troubling Your Highness?

492
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,080
Even though His Majesty has visited the Miaoyi Chasm

493
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,200
and imprisoned Miao Luo,

494
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm afraid Miao Luo might create some trouble

495
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,360
if she knows His Majesty

496
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,840
has fallen asleep because of it.

497
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,640
In order to make sure Miao Luo doesn't make any trouble

498
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,160
during His Majesty's one-hundred-year sleep,

499
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,600
I've thought of a way

500
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,280
to fix it recently.

501
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,760
You are extremely good at Nirvana.

502
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,120
If you could use past-life magic

503
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,600
to cast half of His Majesty's shadow

504
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,680
into the Fanyin Valley,

505
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,080
he won't know

506
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,480
he is half of His Majesty's shadow

507
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,800
as long as it's successfully done,

508
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,440
nor will he know

509
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,880
he has the responsibility to protect Miaoyi Chasm.

510
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,880
This shadow has a part of His Majesty's breath

511
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,200
after all,

512
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,480
so as long as it's reborn in Fanyin Valley,

513
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,320
it is a deterrence to Miao Luo.

514
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,160
Eh...

515
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,520
The inseparable king birds

516
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,680
die in the Fanyin Valley.

517
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,600
Once their corpses turn into dusts

518
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,400
and reborn into the shadow in Fanyin Valley,

519
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,040
they will naturally go back to His Majesty.

520
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,600
There is nothing to worry about

521
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,800
to His Majesty!

522
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,840
That's a well-constructed plan.

523
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
I've thought about it for a while just now.

524
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,920
It is indeed the only feasible way.

525
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,040
But in my opinion,

526
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,680
after I get to Fanyin Valley

527
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
and cast the past-life magic,

528
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,640
you and I will need to drink the oblivion water

529
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,000
to forget about this.

530
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes!

531
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,000
You're always prudent.

532
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,280
I'm expecting you to agree on it.

533
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,120
Despite that after the past-life magic,

534
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,000
it is only a thin shadow of His Majesty,

535
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,040
it is a part of His Majesty as well.

536
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,580
It's born with the principal and subsidiary causes,

537
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,800
and so does it change.

538
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,440
If it's taken by someone intentionally,

539
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,900
it won't die with the disappearance of the principal

540
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,640
and subsidiary causes.

541
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,300
Changing His Majesty's principal and subsidiary causes

542
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,560
while he is sleeping

543
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,280
will surely shake his immortal root.

544
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,040
That's right to say!

545
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,280
I'll definitely drink it.

546
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,240
That's good then.

547
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,760
This way please.

548
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,380
I've long heard

549
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,920
that Qingqiu is an immortal and auspicious place

550
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,640
and thought to travel around

551
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
while I am taking the study tour.

552
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,200
Coincidentally, I ran into the Emperor Bai Zhi the other day.

553
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,320
His Majesty said Your Highness is very proficient at sightseeing.

554
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,560
I will have one day off on the day after tomorrow.

555
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,640
I'm wonder if Your Highness

556
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
could show me around the Qingqiu?

557
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,360
I...

558
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,080
One day is not enough for a sightseeing tour.

559
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,320
I heard Your Highness has great cooking skills.

560
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,200
You could come with me to the mortal realm

561
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,720
to enjoy the good food and drink.

562
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,080
I have many favorite restaurants in the mortal realm.

563
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,600
Some of the dishes are even not available in heaven.

564
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,160
I suppose Your Highness must be very interested.

565
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,800
Merrymaking is after all not a decent cause.

566
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,920
I heard Your Highness is well up

567
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,880
in the course of Weapon Forging and Ancient History.

568
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,960
What a coincidence!

569
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,200
I'm not good at either one of those two.

570
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm wondering if Your Highness have the time to help me

571
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,400
make up for the two courses?

572
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,240
I...

573
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,720
Jingwei, come here and have some worms.

574
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,560
Check out

575
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,500
if I have anything on schedule on my rest day.

576
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,320
Your Highness have a lot of things on schedule.

577
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
The Emperor Bai Zhi issued the order that

578
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,480
Your Highness has to check out the injuries

579
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,680
of three gods before noon

580
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,820
whose leg was broken, whose arm was broken

581
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,360
and whose neck was cut by you

582
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,400
when they invited you to play

583
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,480
on the rest day before your last two rest day,

584
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,720
on the one before your last rest day

585
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
and on your last rest day respectively.

586
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,480
After the noon...

587
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,360
Let me see!

588
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,000
His Highness needs to go to
Zhonghu Mountain after the noon

589
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,280
to have a decisive fight against Fairy Zhi Yue.

590
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,480
That'll be a hell of a fight.

591
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,960
In that case,

592
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,400
His Highness will be available only at night.

593
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,000
The fight with Fairy Zhi Yue

594
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,000
is not that serious.

595
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,960
I'll only take nothing more

596
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,480
than one of her arms.

597
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,840
I'll probably come back around five to seven in the evening.

598
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,160
Anyone wants to join it?

599
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,480
Excuse us!

600
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,240
My god!

601
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,080
Get running!

602
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,320
Go! Go! Go!

603
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,800
Sister FengJiu, you're really energetic!

604
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,040
Even though your family arrange your engagement too early,

605
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,400
you don't have to scare them like that.

606
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,080
You just scared off another three!

607
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,040
You may not have the willingness now,

608
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,960
but if you want to get engaged in the future,

609
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,200
they will be helpful to you.
