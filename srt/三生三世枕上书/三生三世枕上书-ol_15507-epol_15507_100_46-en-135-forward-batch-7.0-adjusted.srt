00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 46

3
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,300
Your Highness,

4
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,060
Mr. Su is leaving for the palace.

5
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,460
So soon?

6
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,260
By the way,

7
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,060
I've made a few sugar foxes for the master.

8
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,980
They are in the study.

9
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,420
Fetch them for me.

10
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,260
I noticed a small bag

11
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,660
while I was cleaning up the study last night.

12
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,340
I saw a note on it for Mr. Su.

13
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,180
I came here just to consult Your Highness

14
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,660
if you'd like to hand it over to Mr. Su.

15
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,140
Chacha, you know me best.

16
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:03,980
Your Highness!

17
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,780
You made one portion for me again?

18
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,700
Yeah!

19
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Even the cleaning attendants

20
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,660
in my place have sugar foxes.

21
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,340
You certainly have a portion as well.

22
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,060
But yours are bigger than theirs.

23
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,460
I sent some to Shen Ye as well.

24
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,860
His taste is very different from yours.

25
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,660
I heard he gave them to the boys there.

26
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,740
They all said they were good.

27
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,100
Try one and see how it tastes.

28
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,940
Your Highness,

29
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,340
did you mention this to anyone else?

30
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,260
No!

31
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,860
Only those who are close to me know it.

32
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,900
That's great!

33
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,060
Remember

34
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,380
not to mention it in the future.

35
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,820
It's good to you.

36
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,180
Why?

37
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,380
Because it's against the rule

38
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,940
for you to make sugar in person

39
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,420
and give it to the subordinates and people like us

40
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,580
considering your identity.

41
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
The previous Aranya

42
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,580
wouldn't do such things.

43
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,700
I was too careless and didn't think that much.

44
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,140
That's so considerate of you.

45
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,460
It's fine. Be careful in the future.

46
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,940
By the way,

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,620
in three days, Junuo will come out of the capital city.

48
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,540
Aranya did Shen Ye and Junuo

49
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,180
a favor before

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,620
by arranging them to meet for the last time.

51
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,100
So this time,

52
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,580
I've bribed the prosecutors

53
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,380
to arrange a parting scene for them

54
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,860
by the side of the river outside the city.

55
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,260
Do I need to do anything?

56
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,780
Aranya didn't follow them there at the time.

57
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,580
So, I can't follow there either.

58
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
If you are free,

59
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,900
it's fine to take a look.

60
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,420
Sure!

61
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,300
By the way,

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,620
I thought about the story

63
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,580
you told me about Aranya and Shen Ye

64
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,860
last night before going to bed.

65
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,620
Lord Xi Ze never

66
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,340
went out of the Qi Nan Mountain at the time,

67
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,820
so he had nothing to do with the affair

68
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,220
about Aranya and Shen Ye.

69
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,540
But His Majesty

70
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,020
moved into my place

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,540
with Xi Ze's identity.

72
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,940
I'm afraid

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,820
this is a great change, isn't it?

74
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,940
Yeah!

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,980
I'm thinking about it too.

76
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,020
The part about the Quanyin Beast is definitely gone!

77
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,220
So,

78
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,300
we gotta think of other ways

79
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,740
to push Shen Ye to express his affection.

80
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,980
Well,

81
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,140
don't forget this!

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,860
Oh yeah,

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,340
I almost forgot it!

84
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,660
See you!

85
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,580
It's really another state of mind

86
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,500
to look at Lord Shen Ye

87
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,700
after knowing Aranya's fate.

88
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,620
Archmage,

89
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,500
tomorrow is the day for Junuo to come out of the city.

90
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,220
I've bribed the prosecutors.

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,420
Will you go to see her for the last time?

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

93
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,180
Yeah, I do!

94
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,260
Where will it be?

95
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,860
By the riverside outside the city.

96
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,100
I'll lead the way by then.

97
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,900
Are you going, too?

98
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,420
Definitely! Anything wrong?

99
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,980
No!

100
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,460
It was arranged by you.

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
So you can go as you like.

102
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,900
Well said!

103
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,780
I'd go even if you mind it.

104
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,020
You used to be a person who didn't care about people's business.

105
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,780
Says who?

106
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
I do care about people's business.

107
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,260
Maybe I don't care much about the others' business.

108
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,220
However,

109
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm pretty interested

110
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,900
in your business.

111
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,220
I heard my mother came yesterday.

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,340
She came to check out the progress of the sword.

113
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,100
She's too concerned about this sword.

114
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,620
I'm afraid that was not the only words

115
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,140
she said to you explicitly and implicitly, was it?

116
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,820
As I saved Junuo,

117
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,620
she came to say thanks to me.

118
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,580
I also helped to save Junuo

119
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,460
at the Lingshu Stage.

120
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,980
Why didn't she even come to see me?

121
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,420
She has been behaved like that to you

122
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,420
ever since you were born.

123
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,740
You could put up with it in the past.

124
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,220
Why can't you bear it now all of a sudden?

125
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,340
Why should I keep bearing it now

126
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,020
just as I have borne it in the past?

127
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,020
Prosecutor,

128
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,340
come here!

129
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
What can I do for you, Your Highness?

130
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,500
You just don't understand it, do you?

131
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,900
If you keep staring at them like that,

132
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,540
how could they talk?

133
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,700
Forgive me for my stupidity.

134
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,340
I'll have to disappoint you

135
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,980
for your affection.

136
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm

137
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,020
no match to you now.

138
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,580
I just hope

139
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,260
we can sign a deal for our next life.

140
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,060
If I had the next life,

141
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,460
I would surely not disappoint you.

142
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,420
Do you really think I saved you

143
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,620
because I have feelings for you?

144
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,900
You said that

145
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,420
I was your little sister that grew up together with you,

146
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,100
so you wouldn't leave me alone

147
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,260
even if I made any mistakes.

148
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,980
But you're not a nosy person.

149
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,580
You clearly knew there would be severe consequence

150
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,420
on the day at the execution ground,

151
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,620
but you still took the risk.

152
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,340
Isn't that because you like...

153
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,380
I saved you

154
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,460
just because I wanted to save the only heir of your father.

155
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,420
A man of honor repays his debt.

156
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,620
If you have to thank someone,

157
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,180
thank your father for showing great mercy to me.

158
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,300
Then why are you here today to see me off?

159
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,780
I'm just taking the chance to take a walk outside.

160
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,380
Shen Ye,

161
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,220
you've hated Changdi and Aranya the most ever since we were young.

162
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,860
But you've treated me the best.

163
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,140
Junuo,

164
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,620
your mother's blood is neither pure nor auspicious.

165
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,820
You and Changdi have the same mother.

166
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,220
You are self-abandoned.

167
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,060
There should have been no difference.

168
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,780
I've looked up to you too much in the past.

169
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm not pure or auspicious.

170
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,620
How about Aranya?

171
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,580
We have the same mother.

172
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Now she's married

173
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,940
but she still seduces you.

174
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,660
Isn't she more impure and ominous

175
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,020
and self-abandoned?

176
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Yet, you're still willing to be imprisoned by her.

177
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,420
Yes, I am!

178
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,340
So what?

179
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,900
Prosecutor, time is up!

180
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,700
You should send her on the way.

181
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,060
Yes, Your Highness!

182
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Your Highness!

183
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,580
Lord Shen Ye!

184
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,940
You must be thirsty

185
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,260
after so much talking to Junuo?

186
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,020
Would you like a cup of tea?

187
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,460
Alright, as you wish!

188
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,780
Where is the tea?

189
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,020
Here!

190
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,380
I've just made it.

191
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,260
It might be a bit scalding. Blow it on!

192
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,820
This tea is not of high grade.

193
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,780
However,

194
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
the water comes from the dew

195
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,220
collected from lotus leaves.

196
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,420
I'm not sure if you can get used to it.

197
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,020
It's wide-spread that you and Lord Xi Ze love each other a lot.

198
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,220
You are a paragon for all the royal families.

199
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,940
How come you have the time to be here?

200
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,740
I come here just for fun

201
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,900
and see your attitude to Junuo.

202
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,180
I found that

203
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,740
you were indeed a person of no tenderness to women.

204
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,740
Your Excellency,

205
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,460
Her Highness Aranya should be right up there.

206
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,580
Hold on a second.

207
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,860
Lord Xi Ze,

208
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,420
are these flowers picked particularly for Her Highness?

209
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,180
Sadly, they're not as good as Yueling flowers.

210
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,100
But I can make do with it.

211
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,940
Shen Ye,

212
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,100
do you have to show the poker face to me?

213
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,380
This is how I am!

214
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,260
You don't have to.

215
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,740
What do you mean?

216
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,060
If we are both so arrogant,

217
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,260
we'll have to miss each other.

218
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,500
Why are you so careless?

219
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,300
It's cold water.

220
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,580
You're taken in.

221
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,020
You!

222
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,860
Shen Ye!

223
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,820
I've always been waiting for you to say it.

224
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,700
Aren't you gonna say it now?

225
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,820
What do you want to hear?

226
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,180
You tell me!

227
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,860
Yes!

228
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,540
You helped me save Junuo

229
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,100
and allowed me to make the sword in your place.

230
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,180
I forgot to thank you for that.

231
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,500
That's not it!

232
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,940
Then what should it be?

233
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,140
Shen Ye,

234
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,460
is it so difficult for you

235
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,380
to say it?

236
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,700
I like you.

237
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,580
What did you say?

238
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,140
I said I liked you.

239
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,940
I've been always liking you very much.

240
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,100
Don't you know it?

241
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,300
Your Highness,

242
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,980
you're joking.

243
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,740
Shen Ye,

244
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,140
there is nobody else around here.

245
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Why would I conceal

246
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,340
my heart-felt words?

247
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,420
I know

248
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,540
we all have had our own marriage contracts.

249
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,860
But...

250
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,380
But I can't lie to my own heart.

251
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,460
Enough! Stop talking!

252
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,780
Shen Ye,

253
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,020
I came today

254
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,780
not to see off Junuo

255
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
but to seek for your confession.

256
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,220
As long as you say to me that you don't like me,

257
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,140
I'll leave you alone

258
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,540
from today on.

259
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,740
I won't feel any pain

260
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,540
or have anything to do with you at all.

261
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,500
Aranya,

262
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,500
I love you!

263
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,140
Don't leave!

264
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,820
Don't leave

265
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,540
from now on.

266
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,820
Lord Xi Ze, you are really thoughtful to Her Highness.

267
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,660
Am I?

268
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,020
I've disappointed her so much before.

269
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,900
I just feel sorry for Aranya.

270
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,620
She didn't hear it till the end of her life.

271
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,380
You have known very well that I'm not Aranya,

272
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,620
but Aranya treated you so well.

273
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,380
She loved you so much.

274
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,100
Yet, you never admitted you loved her.

275
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,620
Shen Ye,

276
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,660
you disappointed Aranya so much.

277
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,420
You're not Aranya.

278
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,100
Who on earth are you?

279
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,340
Chacha, why are you here?

280
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,780
Your Highness,

281
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,460
Lord Xi Ze saw it all.

282
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,860
Your Majesty!

283
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,340
Your Majesty!

284
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
Your Majesty!

285
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,420
Is he really jealous?

286
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,580
How come it's raining now?

287
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,700
Your Majesty!

288
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,620
I just feel sorry for Aranya.

289
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,860
She didn't hear it till the end of her life.

290
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,820
You have known very well that I'm not Aranya.

291
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,260
But Aranya treated you so well.

292
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,380
She loved you so much.

293
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,820
Yet, you have never admitted you love her.

294
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,100
Shen Ye, you disappointed Aranya so much.

295
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,460
How do you think of the flowers?

296
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,100
You sit beside me

297
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,380
to interrupt my reading.

298
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,260
It's too dull to read alone.

299
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,180
I accommodate myself to Your Excellency so much

300
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,700
only because Your Excellency

301
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,340
couldn't live without me for a second.

302
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,980
The stem is too long

303
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
and there are a lot of leaves.

304
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,220
Thank you for your appraisal!

305
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,540
All that I can do

306
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,060
is to guess what you want.

307
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,300
If you address me as Your Excellency
and yourself as maid again,

308
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,180
I'd throw you out!

309
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,820
Your Excellency said that many times,

310
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,100
but never did it in reality.

311
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,420
Turn around!

312
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,620
It's just a joke.

313
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,420
Are you really mad

314
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,420
and want to throw me out?

315
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,140
Sometimes, I feel it's not enough.

316
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,340
Sometimes, I feel it's very good.

317
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,540
What is not enough?

318
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,380
Aranya,

319
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,420
you probably meant this

320
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,100
when you said it was not enough.

321
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,820
What are you doing here?

322
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
I should be asking you that.

323
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,060
This is my bed.

324
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,780
Your bed is over there.

325
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,020
You actually came back early, didn't you?

326
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,820
No wonder

327
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,180
I couldn't find you anywhere

328
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,700
for the whole afternoon.

329
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,900
Now you almost got on the wrong bed.

330
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,540
Are you dizzy from too much sleep?

331
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,060
I was walking outside

332
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,660
and forgot the time.

333
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,020
Just got back and carelessly laid on the wrong bed.

334
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,580
What happened to your face?

335
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,460
You...

336
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,140
You...

337
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,860
What on earth were you doing?

338
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,620
Have you been in the rain the whole time?

339
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,180
Why didn't you find a shelter

340
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,260
or create a shelter

341
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,500
with your magic power?

342
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,940
I was thinking about something

343
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,620
so I wasn't aware of the rain.

344
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,820
Chacha is really a good fortuneteller.

345
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,860
Xiaobai,

346
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,060
why did you evade me so worriedly?

347
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,660
To avoid arousing suspicion?

348
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,820
I have already been so weak,

349
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,740
what can I do to you?

350
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,060
I won't do anything to you if I could.

351
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,380
I feel dizzy.

352
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,380
Please stay with me for a while.

353
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,380
What suspicion to avoid?

354
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,020
It's hard not to feel dizzy

355
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
as you've been in the rain for 10 to 12 hours.

356
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,860
I'll get you some warm water to have a dip.

357
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,500
If you can still move,

358
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,340
take off your clothes and get covered up in the quilt.

359
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,220
If you can't, then stay still.

360
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,300
I can't.

361
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,300
Then take the dip with clothes on.

362
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,420
Now I can.

363
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,300
Alright. Go for the dip.

364
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,700
Your body is so hot. You must be extremely sick.

365
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,580
Come on!

366
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,780
I feel dizzy.

367
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,700
Call me if you need anything.

368
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,780
I'll be right here.

369
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,340
Xiaobai,

370
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,700
I thought of the past while walking.

371
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,420
What did you think of?

372
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,940
I've let you down so deeply in the past.

373
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,660
I'll forgive you

374
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,020
whatever you say or do

375
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,980
as I owe you so much.

376
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,140
So, you just need to speak out

377
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,060
the real thoughts in your mind.

378
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,540
I won't be mad

379
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,540
or blame you.

380
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,380
What are you talking about?

381
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,500
It didn't look like acting as to how you treated Shen Ye today.

382
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,860
Since I have to

383
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,340
live as Aranya,

384
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,060
I must act as vividly as it could be.

385
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,660
You said

386
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,700
Aranya's affection to Shen Ye

387
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,500
deeply touched you.

388
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,820
Yeah,

389
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
I did.

390
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:27,980
So what?

391
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,340
So you're just too devoted

392
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,820
to being Aranya

393
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,060
and starting to like him.

394
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,780
What are you talking about?

395
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,340
You're not acting

396
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,660
as Aranya anymore.

397
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,380
You have fallen in love with Shen Ye.

398
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,700
When did it begin?

399
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,060
Was it the time he saved you in the serpentine cage

400
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,700
while I didn't make it there?

401
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,180
You want someone

402
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,060
who can save you when you're in danger.

403
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,540
You think he is the one, don't you?

404
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,780
Don't think too much! Enjoy the bath!

405
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,660
What nonsense is that?

406
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,940
He won't faint in the water, will he?

407
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,020
Your Majesty!

408
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,500
Your Majesty!

409
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,940
Your Majesty!

410
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,940
Why did you hide under the water?

411
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,500
I was thinking.

412
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,420
You're too noisy!

413
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,820
Alright! Go on with it then!

414
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,380
Remember to wear some clothes before coming out.

415
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm going to make the bed for you.

416
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,100
Which part of Shen Ye is better than me?

417
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,500
I haven't made such comparison before.

418
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,260
Will Shen Ye say nifty words to entertain you?

419
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,500
He said you were good-looking and nice

420
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,860
with strong capability.

421
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,580
I didn't say such nifty words,

422
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,900
nor could I.

423
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,140
But are you really unable to see

424
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,980
how well I treat you?

425
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,660
You're really jealous.

426
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,420
I didn't know it's this late

427
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,500
or expect you to treat me like this.

428
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,900
So,

429
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,060
you became jealous and ran out there into the rain?

430
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,940
I was thinking about what to do,

431
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,340
but couldn't come up with a way.

432
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,700
Killing Shen Ye

433
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,820
might be a good idea.

434
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,260
However,

435
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,780
perhaps, you'll be sad about that.

436
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,820
Thank god you still cared about my feeling

437
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,380
and didn't kill him.

438
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,900
Though you made me sad,

439
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,500
how can I make you sad in return

440
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,780
as a man!

441
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,060
I can't believe you said you couldn't say nifty words.

442
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,620
Were these nifty words?

443
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,540
There should be a limit for your jealousy.

444
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,220
It's time to bring it under control.

445
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,180
I like you so much.

446
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,700
How could I like someone else?

447
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,620
Have a good rest tonight!

448
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,260
Is the quilt...

449
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,660
Now that you have no feeling to Shen Ye,

450
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,100
why did you say those words to him in the afternoon

451
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,540
and hug him?

452
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,660
Are you still jealous?

453
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,820
Eh...

454
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,020
I'm going to sleep now.

455
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,340
Do you want to know the consequence of pretending to sleep?

456
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,620
What happened between me and Shen Ye

457
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,820
was no more than an acting of play.

458
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,540
I didn't expect you to be so weak to take it.

459
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,940
Will you be jealous if I talk to someone

460
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
in the future?

461
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,340
Tolerance is a good code of conduct.

462
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,300
You should learn that!

463
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,780
You're still suspicious of me?

464
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,540
I knew you were jealous,

465
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,540
so I went out searching for you for a long time

466
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,180
and stopped it after that.

467
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,380
I was afraid that getting myself wet

468
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,140
would worry you more.

469
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,980
I knew you were wet from the rain.

470
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,620
So I prepared the coldness-dispel soup for you to take a bath.

471
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,220
But you still don't believe me.

472
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,740
Xiaobai,

473
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,540
it's my fault.

474
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,300
What happened to His Majesty?

475
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,060
Why is he incomparably attentive tonight?

476
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,060
What's wrong?

477
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,580
Don't you feel dizzy since you got wet in the rain?

478
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,620
Forget about that!

479
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,460
Why didn't you sleep?

480
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,460
I... I forgot that

481
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,220
I need to get up early in the morning to make sweet potato cakes.

482
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,780
I'm not hungry.

483
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,460
But...

484
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,900
according to the tradition,

485
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,020
a couple

486
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,420
must take purple sweet potato cakes
on the next morning of the consummation.

487
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,700
So, you want everybody to know

488
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,060
we just consummated yesterday.

489
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,780
No...

490
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,740
I didn't mean that.

491
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:00,780
I...

492
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,860
Don't stand

493
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,260
on ceremonies.

494
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,060
Sleep with me for a while.

495
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,780
There you go!

496
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,940
Come!

497
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,100
Have a try of the purple sweet potato pancakes I made.

498
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,220
You made them anyway.

499
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,940
Hush!

500
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,420
Chacha and the others haven't known it yet.

501
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,260
I made them in secret.

502
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,340
Soft, sweet and glutinous. It's just to the point!

503
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,780
You can even make such good purple sweet potato cakes.

504
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,740
You should say something else if you intend to praise me.

505
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,740
That's sort of demanding.

506
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,180
I'm not good at saying nifty words.

507
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,700
It's such a surprise that you attach great importance
to these customs and rituals

508
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,620
as you're generally playful and restless.

509
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,420
I wouldn't care if it was an ordinary day.

510
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,820
I just thought

511
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,220
this had to be done today.

512
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,100
I know the reason to some extent.

513
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,420
It's probably because

514
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,980
we're finally together.

515
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,700
Take it. I feel embarrassed.

516
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,220
The magic instrument is about to be finished.

517
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,980
I can't complete a magic instrument

518
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,220
as masterly as this with my power alone.

519
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,820
I beg Your Majesty to do it in person.

520
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,820
There seems to be some ink smell in the room.

521
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,620
Are you writing?

522
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,540
Is there?

523
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,060
It should be the sandalwood.

524
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,580
Come!

525
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,820
Sit here!

526
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,060
What shall we do in the afternoon?

527
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,820
Where do you want to go?

528
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,020
I want to go to the fair.
