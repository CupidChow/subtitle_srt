00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 32

3
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,660
Try this.

4
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
Here.

5
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,180
Your Highness.

6
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,980
Your Majesty.

7
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,500
To see the fun,

8
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,900
you've used every trick up your sleeve.

9
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,060
It's the most interesting thing

10
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,420
since the creation of the universe, anyway.

11
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,460
I just need to give up a bit of my cultivation.

12
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,020
Now that you can do that,

13
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,620
why can't I?

14
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,740
Take a seat.

15
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,900
Am...

16
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,340
Am I in a dream?

17
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Why did Lian Song

18
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,780
come to Fanyin Valley with Li?

19
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,780
Am I still sleeping?

20
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,300
It's really a dream.

21
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,100
It doesn't hurt at all.

22
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,980
Are you enjoying pinching me?

23
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,940
Your clothes have creased. Let me smooth it.

24
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,540
Princess Jiuge.

25
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,380
I came here

26
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,100
to take an elixir

27
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,380
refined by the Supreme Venerable Lord to Dong Hua,

28
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,300
but Li couldn't pull himself together

29
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,780
since he lost his cousin

30
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,220
who was playing with him,

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,460
so I took him here to cheer him up.

32
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,140
It happens that you're hosting a dinner party,

33
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,540
so we're here without invitation.

34
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,540
No worries.

35
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,820
It's my honor.

36
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,580
I was worried that Dong Hua would suffer

37
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,500
if I came here late,

38
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,820
but it seems he's...

39
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,260
I don't need it at this moment,

40
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,900
but I may need it in the future.

41
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,580
I knew you wouldn't be that polite.

42
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,860
Master.

43
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,540
I told you

44
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,500
not to touch Longevity Vine.

45
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,660
Do you still remember that?

46
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,780
I'm just afraid

47
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,460
you're not used to food prepared by Princess Jiuge.

48
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,540
So I cooked some soup

49
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,820
and took it to you.

50
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,220
I'm also afraid you're not used to

51
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,860
lotus seed soup without Longevity Vine in it.

52
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,100
It's okay.

53
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,860
I just touched a little.

54
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,020
Don't worry about me.

55
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,060
I...

56
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,100
I'll go see if the dishes have been prepared.

57
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I'll go with you.

58
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,420
Me too. Me too.

59
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,700
Just stay here. Don't make trouble.

60
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,820
One more for you.

61
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,380
And you, stop making trouble.

62
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,420
Forget about it.

63
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,980
You're picky. You don't like this.

64
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,780
Here you are.

65
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,620
I'll follow you while eating.

66
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,140
I want to go out for fun with you.

67
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,900
I can eat the cakes while doing that.

68
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,900
Ji Heng didn't cook soup for you,

69
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,980
but she did for Dong Hua.

70
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,740
You're envious and sad, right?

71
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,060
What to do?

72
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,900
I just made mung bean cakes, red bean cakes

73
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,060
and plum pudding

74
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,140
against unexpected needs.

75
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,260
Besides, in plum pudding

76
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,100
I put ginger powder which you don't like.

77
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,700
Fine. Just go with me.

78
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,860
Why didn't you make something I like to eat?

79
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,140
Did you forget what I like?

80
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,340
I remember.

81
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,580
It's plum sorbet.

82
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,020
I'll ask them to get you some of that.

83
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,060
I've heard chefs here are good at cooking.

84
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,820
Let's see if it's to your taste.

85
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,180
Okay.

86
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,580
Let them take some here.

87
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,060
And I like salty food these days.

88
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,100
Don't put liquorice. Put in some salt.

89
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,540
If it's not good,

90
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,140
go back to the old way.

91
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,580
Maybe I can also try egg-yolk puff.

92
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,740
Okay.

93
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
I'll make some salty food for you.

94
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:00,820
Okay.

95
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,780
Master, the soup spilled.

96
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
Princess Jiuge,

97
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,940
I've heard that you're good at cooking.

98
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,140
Among cakes and pastries,

99
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,580
I like red bean and mung bean cakes best.

100
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,460
I wonder if I have a chance

101
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,260
to taste some cakes made by you.

102
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,860
Sure.

103
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,060
I'll wait for you outside.

104
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,060
Okay.

105
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,900
Master,

106
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,220
let me get you more soup.

107
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,700
You know well about what he likes.

108
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,220
Do you want to try the cakes?

109
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,940
But I'm not good at making cakes.

110
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm best at cooking fish.

111
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,860
You tasted it, right?

112
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,340
Do you still want to have cakes?

113
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,180
But they've been given out.

114
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,300
How about this?

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,420
Li still has some.

116
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
Ask him if he wants to share with you.

117
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,100
Grandpa Lian has six cakes.

118
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,940
I have only four.

119
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,540
Grandpa Lian should share with him.

120
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,620
I won't.

121
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,220
Besides, I'm a kid.

122
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,300
My mom said

123
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,500
I should eat more to grow taller.

124
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,180
It seems

125
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,620
Princess Jiuge knows better about Yan Chiwu's taste

126
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,140
and doesn't know much about yours.

127
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,980
These cakes happen to be to my taste,

128
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,100
but I wonder if they're to yours.

129
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,420
Why do you bother to get mad

130
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,300
because of some cakes

131
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,300
you're not sure if you like?

132
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,940
We've been friends for years.

133
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,300
Do you have to do that?

134
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,740
Xiaojiu, are you leaving or not?

135
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,540
If they fail to make cakes for me in time,

136
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,020
you'll have to do that for me.

137
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,620
Who is it?

138
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,060
Who dares to attack me?

139
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,300
Sorry.

140
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,340
It slipped from my hand.

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,660
It slipped so far.

142
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,700
The soup made by Ji Heng.

143
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,380
It's good!

144
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,500
What a waste of my money.

145
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,540
Why are they all unhappy?

146
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,020
The banquet is wasted.

147
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,740
You used so much of your magic arts to enter the valley

148
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,700
just to have a dinner?

149
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,380
And you came back immediately after that?

150
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Don't worry.

151
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,500
With His Majesty in Fanyin Valley,

152
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,620
there is nothing to worry about.

153
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,780
I've underestimated

154
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,300
your interest in gossiping.

155
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,580
I thought you'd go to ask Lord Cheng Yu,

156
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,060
but unexpectedly, you entered the valley directly.

157
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
I won't bother Cheng Yu

158
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,100
because of another man's issue.

159
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,340
She only needs to

160
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,740
worry about me.

161
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,060
I'm convinced.

162
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,940
You hate her,

163
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,140
but you're not her match.

164
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,860
You love him,

165
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,940
but you can do nothing about it.

166
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,780
Who are you?

167
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,660
Who are you?

168
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,380
Where on earth are you?

169
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Who on earth are you?

170
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,140
You're deep in love with Emperor Dong Hua, right?

171
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
How did you know that?

172
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,540
It doesn't matter how I knew that

173
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,100
or who I am.

174
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,220
You just need to tell me

175
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,020
if you want to get him.

176
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,180
What do you mean?

177
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,020
You fell in love with him before you knew it,

178
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,020
but pitifully,

179
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,860
there is another woman.

180
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,420
You hate it,

181
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,300
but you can do nothing about it.

182
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,540
You tried to win his love,

183
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,580
but he didn't pay any attention

184
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,820
to how you felt.

185
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,980
What on earth do you want to do?

186
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,980
Do you dare to change the status quo

187
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,860
and try again to win?

188
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,180
But as you said,

189
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,980
no matter what I did,

190
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,260
he wouldn't care about me.

191
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,860
What if I have an idea?

192
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,860
I've figured out a way

193
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,340
to make them be suspicious of each other.

194
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,660
Suspicious?

195
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,780
If they don't trust each other,

196
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,620
you'll have a chance to get close to him.

197
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,860
Tell me

198
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,580
what your idea is.

199
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,060
It's simple.

200
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,460
To get pimpon fruit.

201
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,140
Pimpon fruit.

202
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,700
Trust me.

203
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,420
For you,

204
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,380
it'll be easy.

205
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,100
Ji Heng,

206
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,980
what's up?

207
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,860
Shall I take you back to your room?

208
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,940
I'm okay.

209
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,540
Yan,

210
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,700
can you do me a favor?

211
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,700
Just go ahead.

212
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,380
No matter what you want me to do,

213
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,020
I'll try my best.

214
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,580
Yan,

215
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,740
why are you here?

216
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,980
Do you want to eat something?

217
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
What's up?

218
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,540
Xiaojiu, I...

219
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,260
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,540
What are you sorry for?

221
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,380
I plan to join the tournament

222
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,580
to get pimpon fruit.

223
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,260
Why?

224
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,700
I want to get pimpon fruit

225
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,580
to help Ji Heng get better.

226
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,860
Did she ask you to do that?

227
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,540
No.

228
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,660
I insisted on it.

229
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,060
She's in poor health.

230
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,420
I've heard pimpon fruit can help to improve cultivation,

231
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,100
so I want to win it.

232
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,260
I thought you're a true man.

233
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,340
You value lover over friend.

234
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,300
I...

235
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,380
I also feel like I've betrayed you,

236
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
but trust me.

237
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,740
If I win by chance,

238
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,260
I'll share the fruit with you.

239
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,220
Alright.

240
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,420
If I win,

241
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
I'll also share it with you

242
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,340
so that you can save your love.

243
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,940
You're not mad at me?

244
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,780
You're a good friend.

245
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,740
Trust me. I'm bound to win.

246
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,460
How about you withdrawing from the tournament?

247
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,820
I'll share the fruit with you after I win.

248
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,060
Don't bother.

249
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,980
I'll be your tutor this time.

250
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,460
Come on in.

251
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,420
Yan,

252
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,780
why are you smiling like a fool?

253
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,260
Ji Heng asked me for a favor.

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,860
She asked me instead of others.

255
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,900
What do you think it means?

256
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,060
What does it mean?

257
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,940
It means you're a good servant.

258
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,780
Come on.

259
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,260
You know nothing about it.

260
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,380
Mind your own business.

261
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,860
I see. Yan.

262
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,220
You're driving me away when my help is not required.

263
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,100
I must go.

264
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,580
I'll try my best to get it for Ji Heng.

265
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,780
Get what?

266
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,180
She wants pimpon fruit.

267
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,660
I'll win it for her.

268
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,180
Pimpon fruit?

269
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,340
Come on.

270
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,860
Do you also want it?

271
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,140
I just promised to Xiaojiu I'd share it with her.

272
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,540
If you want it too,

273
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,660
I'm afraid it's not enough for us.

274
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,300
Does she want pimpon fruit

275
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,460
because Xiaojiu wants it?

276
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,660
Don't say that.

277
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,140
She needs pimpon fruit to recover

278
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,860
from Qiushui Cold Toxin.

279
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,220
Before you came to Fanyin Valley,

280
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,740
her excuse for staying with
master was she's in poor health.

281
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,740
In my opinion,

282
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,460
she came to you

283
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,140
just because he ignored her.

284
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Well...

285
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,780
Actually,

286
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,900
I know nothing about it. I'm just a little girl.

287
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,460
It was just a wild guess.

288
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,380
I said that because I'm jealous.

289
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,820
It's my fault.

290
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,500
I shouldn't have cursed others.

291
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,500
Are...

292
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,260
Are you going to cry?

293
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,420
Jielu,

294
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,700
you...

295
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,860
You know well enough about yourself.

296
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,300
Don't let it happen again.

297
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,500
Now that Ji Heng has me,

298
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,620
she won't have anything

299
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,660
to do with that ice face.

300
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,180
It's okay as long as you're happy.

301
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,500
It's a waste of time

302
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,020
to show mercy to you.

303
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,420
What are you going to do?

304
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,780
I'm going to see my brother.

305
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,420
He's got many things to do recently.

306
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,620
If Meng needs my help, remember to tell me about it.

307
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,420
Why?

308
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,900
We're men.

309
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,660
If he needs help,

310
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,100
it's better for him to talk to me.

311
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,580
You're even not as reliable as Xiaojiu.

312
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,620
I...

313
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,540
Enough.

314
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,940
I'll let you know in case he needs help.

315
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,340
Why is she in a rush?

316
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,380
Ji Heng is waiting for me.

317
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,820
I can't keep her waiting.

318
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,220
It matches perfectly.

319
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,260
Even a fly couldn't come in.

320
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,860
Is it necessary to set up such a ward?

321
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,780
They can't come in

322
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,300
and you can't go out.

323
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,820
I said I'd be your tutor. Do you think I'm kidding?

324
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,460
Are you serious?

325
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,820
Definitely.

326
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,260
What do you want to teach me?

327
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,860
Through closed training of ten days,

328
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,020
from morning to night without rest,

329
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,460
your skills will be taken to a higher level.

330
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,380
I'm happy beyond words

331
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,700
to have you as my tutor.

332
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,380
I've never accepted any apprentice.

333
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,900
Numerous people have dreamed of that.

334
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,060
Then why did you lock me down?

335
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,100
What's the relationship between the two things?

336
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,580
I did it to train you.

337
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,620
Fine.

338
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,940
Now that you said that,

339
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,340
I'm afraid you'll lose face

340
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,340
if I lose in the final.

341
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,500
Do you mean you don't want pimpon fruit?

342
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,660
Yes.

343
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,660
Of course I do.

344
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,980
Then go back and have a good rest.

345
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,260
We'll start from walking on snowy stakes tomorrow morning.

346
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,420
Yes, sir.

347
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,060
His Majesty invested so much

348
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,140
to bask in the sunshine

349
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,420
on the snowfield.

350
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,940
It's nothing.

351
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,060
Today,

352
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,380
you need to practice so that you walk on them
as easily as walking on firm earth.

353
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,460
Try to do it blindfolded tomorrow

354
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,620
and make sure you come and go freely.

355
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,380
On the third day,

356
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,940
you'll practice swordsmanship and master the skills.

357
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,780
Your Majesty,

358
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,700
you've overestimated me.

359
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,060
I've deactivated your magic arts,

360
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,260
but you managed to stand there for a long time.

361
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,980
You're quite competent.

362
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,420
I...

363
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,900
I forgot to tell you.

364
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,620
Without magic arts,

365
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,660
I'm actually afraid of heights.

366
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,700
See?

367
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,220
You asked me to do that on purpose, right?

368
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
You wanted to touch me up when I fell down.

369
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,460
Are you talking in your dream?

370
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Or why are you holding me?

371
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,740
Your hand is still around my waist.

372
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,380
It seems you can keep your feet.

373
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,900
You're narrow-minded.

374
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,740
I'm just kidding.

375
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
Don't be so mean.

376
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,620
How could I come and go freely

377
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,580
on snowy stakes blindfolded in one day?

378
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,500
You're just making a fool of me.

379
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,540
You wouldn't teach me
your unique skills. You're so mean.

380
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,940
I've heard

381
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,180
you should count yourself lucky

382
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,380
if you have a master who
likes to make fun when you're young.

383
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,580
You'll benefit from it the whole life.

384
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
I didn't read much,

385
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,820
but I think it's a strict master.

386
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,940
Really?

387
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,980
I forgot.

388
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,260
Pretty much.

389
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,060
Now that you want pimpon fruit,

390
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,420
then just do as I say.

391
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,380
It's not hard

392
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
to let you win out by playing tricks,

393
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,060
but unfortunately,

394
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,660
they invited me to be the judge.

395
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,140
Do you think

396
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,020
I could let people employ trickery?

397
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,940
You must've done lots of such things.

398
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,340
Just pretend that

399
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,700
I've become cautious suddenly.

400
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,740
Thank you for spending time

401
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,820
on training me.

402
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,860
No problem.

403
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,580
It's rare

404
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,660
to meet someone who's as unpromising as you.

405
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,460
I want to challenge myself.

406
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,700
Zhihe was that hopeless,

407
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,420
but you still taught her.

408
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Zhihe?

409
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,780
Many years ago,

410
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,020
I taught her for some reason.

411
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,700
But she gave up.

412
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,340
She got a new master later.

413
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,860
Do you mind

414
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,580
that thing very much?

415
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,260
Nah.

416
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,100
But she didn't learn a lot

417
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,460
from me.

418
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,620
Do you know why?

419
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,660
Because she thought she didn't need to learn anything

420
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,900
since I was there.

421
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
If I were Zhihe,

422
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,100
I would also think

423
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,620
I don't need to learn anything.

424
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,940
You?

425
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,260
You're different, Xiaobai.

426
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,740
I've placed

427
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,660
great expectations on you.

428
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,500
We've talked a lot. I'm thirsty.

429
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll go brew some tea. You keep practicing.

430
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,420
Would you like a cup?

431
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,980
Come down.

432
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,460
Turn around. Close your eyes.

433
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Did you hear me?

434
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,380
Turn around. Close your eyes.

435
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,100
Cheng Yu, you're in a good mood.

436
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,900
It's rare to see you feed fish leisurely.

437
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,540
What's up?

438
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,540
Nothing special.

439
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,780
I just miss Fengjiu.

440
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,660
I wonder how she's doing in Fanyin Valley.

441
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,140
Don't worry.

442
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,780
She was pretty good

443
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,460
last time when Li and I saw her.

444
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,260
If you're really worried about her,

445
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,820
I'll set up a ward

446
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,020
so that you can have a look at her.

447
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,820
They...

448
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,380
Xiaobai.

449
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
Shouldn't you at least say something like

450
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,900
"sorry for biting you"?

451
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,660
Sorry.

452
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,220
Are you really sorry?

453
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,580
I have no reason to lie to you.

454
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,700
People lie

455
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,740
just to make themselves happy.

456
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,740
See?

457
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,980
Fengjiu is safe and sound.

458
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,700
She's living in Fanyin Valley joyfully,

459
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,660
with His Majesty staying with her.

460
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,420
They're closely associated.

461
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
It's great.

462
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,380
But...

463
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,100
I know what you're worried about.

464
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,380
As for fate,

465
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,780
even Si Ming can do nothing about it,

466
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,900
let alone us.

467
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,580
You're too slow.

468
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,020
Make yourself steady
whenever you step on a snowy stake.

469
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,620
Here. Drink some tea.

470
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,780
You're sweating.

471
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,940
Ji Heng.

472
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,980
Ji Heng.

473
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,900
Yan.

474
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,020
Yan.

475
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,500
Yan.

476
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,060
Yan, get up.

477
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,460
It's late at night. I want to sleep.

478
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,900
Hurry up, Yan.

479
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Stop sleeping.

480
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,180
What are you doing?

481
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,340
Hurry up.

482
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,300
Well. I...

483
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,140
I want to sleep.

484
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,380
I...

485
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,460
Hurry up.

486
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,460
Where are we going?

487
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,420
It's late. Where are you taking me?

488
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,420
Let's go see my brother. He's drunk.

489
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,980
I just went to Jiuge,

490
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,380
but a ward was set up in her yard.

491
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,620
So I have to come to you.

492
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Isn't it common for Meng to be drunk?

493
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,100
Why are you so surprised?

494
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,580
Don't go back.

495
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,580
He's been drinking at Zuilixian Restaurant
for several days and nights.

496
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,700
He wouldn't listen to anyone.

497
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,540
You're the only one I can ask for help.

498
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,100
It's just because of that thing.

499
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,980
In this case, it's a little troublesome.

500
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Keep an eye on Meng.

501
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,860
I'll go there with Xiaojiu.

502
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,980
Okay. Hurry up.

503
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,940
Xiaojiu.

504
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,540
Xiaojiu.

505
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,820
Your Majesty, please don't torture me again.

506
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,140
Let me have some sleep.

507
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,100
You and the ice face

508
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,300
have come so far?

509
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,860
I knew he's not as loyal as I am.

510
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,620
He failed to refuse a beautiful woman like you.

511
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
How did you come in?

512
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,100
I have a chance to get close to Ji Heng.

513
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,020
That's great.

514
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,100
What are you talking about?

515
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,860
Is it a dream?

516
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,420
It's not!

517
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,140
I'm here to take you to cheer a friend up.

518
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,380
What's going on?

519
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,300
Something happened to Meng.

520
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,140
Ever-victorious General.

521
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,340
My Ever-victorious General.

522
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,340
Meng,

523
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,300
let the deceased rest in peace
while the living must move on.

524
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,300
We need to bury it as soon as possible.

525
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,860
You're finally here.

526
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,860
Meng,

527
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,540
don't be too sad.

528
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,220
A dead person couldn't come back to life...

529
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,140
He's so heartbroken although it's just a token of affection.

530
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,380
I can't imagine what he'll do when he loses her.

531
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,860
He's crying bitterly because of a cricket's death.

532
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,420
He's affectionate.

533
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,300
Meng.

534
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,180
It's just a cricket.

535
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I'll get you an invincible one

536
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,740
tomorrow.

537
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,340
You know nothing about it.

538
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,980
The cricket must've absorbed aura of nature

539
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,140
after staying in the valley for a long time

540
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,300
and become a pretty woman at midnight,

541
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,700
or Meng couldn't love it so much.

542
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,500
The cricket did absorb some aura of nature,

543
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,380
but that just made it live a longer life.

544
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,660
It couldn't have turned into anything.

545
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,300
But the one who sent it to Meng

546
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,780
is his crush.

547
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,780
He met a girl many years ago.

548
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,580
He got the cricket and the jar from her.

549
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,660
Since then,

550
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,340
he's been fascinated by her and promised to marry her.

551
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,820
So he's still single nowadays.

552
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,700
For Meng,

553
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,220
the cricket means a lot.

554
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,180
The cricket died the other day.

555
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,700
It made him miss that girl even more.

556
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,420
So he drowned his sorrows in drink.

557
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,940
A member of your clan can only
marry a person from the same clan.

558
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,620
That girl must belong to a different clan

559
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,300
now that Meng can't marry her.

560
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,100
If she's alive,

561
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,300
why doesn't he pluck up the courage to chase her?

562
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,100
It's no big deal to violate the clan rules.

563
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,140
Groaning for a cricket

564
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,380
is not what a real man should do.

565
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,820
I guess that girl is far away from him

566
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,300
and meeting her is impossible,

567
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,580
or he couldn't be crying so bitterly.

568
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,820
Who on earth is his crush?

569
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,660
I know.

570
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
Really?

571
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,420
On the day when His Majesty came here,

572
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,580
I heard Meng talk with his cousin.

573
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,180
I heard it by accident.

574
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,620
It's the Princess of Qingqiu.

575
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,260
Exactly.

576
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,420
But we're far away from Qingqiu

577
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,100
and she'll be the empress of Qingqiu.

578
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,220
I'm afraid Meng couldn't have a chance.

579
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,100
If it's true,

580
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,660
you'd better ask him to give up.

581
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,460
That princess is married.

582
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,340
Has Princess Fengjiu got married?

583
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,540
Why haven't we heard of such a big event?

584
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:53,900
Feng...

585
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,860
The person Meng had a crush on

586
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,420
is Fengjiu?

587
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,660
Yeah.

588
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,060
She is the only possible one.

589
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,260
It couldn't be God Bai Qian, right?

590
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,140
Thank you for saving me.

591
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,740
You saved me today.

592
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,060
I'll definitely pay you back in future.

593
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,940
Oh, no! It's broken!

594
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
Take mine instead.

595
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,460
Here you are.

596
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,060
Let's discuss it.

597
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,420
That explains why the jar looks familiar.

598
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,060
It's really you.

599
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,020
It happened many years ago.

600
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,380
I can't remember.

601
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
Looking at him carefully,

602
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,380
I found he looks like that boy

603
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,460
who blushed when he talked to me.

604
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,460
What to do now?

605
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,180
Shall we tell him the truth?

606
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,980
No. Don't do that.

607
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,980
If you do,

608
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,220
he'll suffer all his life.

609
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,780
Never tell him the truth. Got it?

610
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,860
Let's go.

611
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,340
You said

612
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,340
Princess Fengjiu is married.

613
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,980
It's just hearsay.

614
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,220
That's to say,

615
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,500
she may still be single.

616
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,700
Good. Great.

617
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,420
What do you want to do?

618
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,100
What you said

619
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,060
makes sense.

620
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,940
Do you also think

621
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,220
I should take the risks

622
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,900
to pursue what I love

623
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,420
regardless of the clan rules?

624
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,140
Actually, half a year ago,

625
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,700
I already thought about

626
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,180
surmounting all obstacles

627
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,580
to pursue Princess Fengjiu,

628
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,700
but unexpectedly, you fell down
and made me unconscious

629
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,420
as soon as I got out of town.

630
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,420
I thought

631
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,500
it was the will of heaven

632
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,500
and I was destined never to get close to Princess Fengjiu,

633
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,500
so I gave up.

634
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,740
But what you just said

635
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,780
sounds a little reasonable.

636
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,820
I miss Princess Fengjiu

637
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
but she knows nothing about that.

638
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,940
I should tell her

639
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,220
how I feel about her.

640
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,700
Accepting it or not is up to her.

641
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,820
Destiny let you tell me about that.

642
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,820
I've decided to

643
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,780
break the clan rules...

644
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,460
- ...and pursue what I love. - Hold on.

645
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,420
Hold on.

646
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,220
It's not destiny.

647
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,340
It's not what you're destined to do.

648
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,460
Look.

649
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,780
Your colored glaze jar.

650
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,100
It's still here.

651
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,380
So what?

652
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,660
The cricket is dead

653
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,060
but the jar is unbroken.

654
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,060
It means

655
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,100
it's not time for you to break the rules

656
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,300
and give up everything

657
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,100
to look for Fengjiu.

658
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,820
If heaven thought

659
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,700
it's time for you to do that,

660
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,300
the jar must've been destroyed

661
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,060
when the cricket died.

662
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,300
Is that right?

663
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Exactly.

664
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,900
Speaking of breaking the clan rules,

665
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,380
you may look courageous by doing that,

666
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,460
but your clan members will be heartbroken.

667
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,900
So you'd better not do that easily

668
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,220
to avoid having a guilty conscience.

669
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,100
But you just...

670
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,780
Oh.

671
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,620
Meng,

672
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,620
if you need something to express your feelings,

673
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,100
it doesn't have to be the cricket.

674
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,020
You can turn to...

675
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,260
The colored glaze jar also works.

676
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,100
That's right.

677
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,500
It sounds reasonable,

678
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,820
but why do I

679
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,500
feel so dizzy?

680
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,220
Because you've drunk too much.

681
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,180
You're not sober.

682
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,620
You're not clear-minded.

683
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,260
Go back and lie on your bed.

684
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,820
You'll understand everything when you sober up.

685
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,980
Okay.

686
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,300
Servants.

687
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,820
Take me back to my mansion.
