1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 20

3
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,760
Elope?

4
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,480
What do you mean?

5
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,320
Rumor has it that General Ye disappeared with Her Majesty.

6
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,440
His Majesty was so furious that

7
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,160
he had all the Imperial Guards search for them.

8
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,120
Well...

9
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,600
How could they be together?

10
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Right!

11
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,320
Now ministers are talking.

12
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
Rumor has it that General Ye and Her Majesty

13
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,760
are close to each other in private.

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,240
I also heard that

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,560
letters between them have been found in Yue Hua Palace.

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,440
It seems they've loved each other for quite some time.

17
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,000
Love each other?

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
How dare she!

19
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,680
She shows no respect to the imperial family.

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,680
When they are caught,

21
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,920
I wonder how they will defend themselves.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
Really?

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Now we have to stop all our plans.

24
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,880
The Crowning Ceremony for the empress is called off suddenly.

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,400
We can't find another opportunity
to break into the imperial palace.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Your Highness, take it easy.

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,680
I find it

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,480
to our benefit instead.

29
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
What do you mean?

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Your Highness, think about it.

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,280
Ye Qingti and the new empress have an affair.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Whether he's caught or not,

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,280
will His Majesty still trust him?

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
Your Highness once told me that

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,600
the Imperial Guards under the command of
Ye Qingti are unbreakable.

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,720
What about now?

37
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,920
He's gone.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Your Highness,

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,880
aren't we blessed by the God?

40
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,920
Your Highness, we're waiting for you.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
Everything is ready.

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,360
Shall we take a break?

43
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
How long will it take for us to leave the State of Chengyu?

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,440
Two days and two nights.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,520
It still has to take so long!

46
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,680
Now we're heading north.

47
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,840
We have to pass Hui'an and Luwei to reach the border.

48
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
Only after leaving the State of Chengyu

49
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,120
can we be completely safe.

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,160
Do you regret it?

51
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,480
No.

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,680
I just feel sorry

53
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
to drag you into this.

54
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
No need to be so polite to me.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,400
Well,

56
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,280
hurry up and go.

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,520
Now all the forcing troops in the imperial palace

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
are probably sent out to search for us.

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,360
The longer we stay, the more dangerous it will be.

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,640
OK.

61
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,680
Damn it!

62
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,720
They're here.

63
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,760
General! Your Majesty!

64
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,880
Come back with us.

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,360
Xiaojiu, leave now.

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
I'll handle them.

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,440
General,

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,440
His Majesty's order can't be defied.

69
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,400
Don't make me!

70
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,920
Stop!

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,040
Why don't you leave?

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
I can't watch you die!

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
You should run away.

74
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,120
If I run away,

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,800
I won't be able to forgive myself the rest of my life.

76
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll go with you.

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,600
Fine!

78
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,480
If I can't give you a new life,

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,200
I might as well die with you.

80
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,440
Sorrowless cake?

81
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,280
Is it made by Your Majesty yourself?

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
Certainly, it's made by myself,

83
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,360
but it's not sorrowless cake.

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
Have a taste first.

85
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,360
It's delicious.

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,480
I specially choose lily to make it.

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
According to the secret recipe,

88
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,400
it's elaborately made through three procedures.

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
I'll call it

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
lily cake.

91
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,280
Lily cake?

92
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,720
It's a good name.

93
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,280
The name of sorrowless flower

94
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,720
means one can be carefree,

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
while lily

96
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,680
represents ones who worship each other
can have a harmonious union for a hundred years.

97
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,000
It's a common wish between the two.

98
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Isn't the implied meaning of lily

99
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,640
much better than that of sorrowless flower?

100
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,120
In the future, you don't need to be afraid.

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
In the palace,

102
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,800
my love for you is the most powerful weapon for you.

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,600
You can use it at your free will.

104
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,120
You can do whatever you want to do.

105
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,560
I believe that

106
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,360
one day

107
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
you will entrust me.

108
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,880
You're the first one who treats me this way.

109
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,520
Your wound?

110
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
I happened to get

111
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
an effective ointment for curing scars.

112
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,120
This is cotton rose ointment

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
I specially made for you, Your Majesty.

114
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,160
Please go inside.

115
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,120

116
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,200

Are you fond of what I've awarded you?

122
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,440
I made the incense in person,

123
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,440
and I also selected the censer for you.

124
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,480
Do you like it?

125
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,320
Really?

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Your Majesty made it in person?

127
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,240
I like it.

128
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,200
This kind of reward is enough for me.

129
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,160
I'll protect you from now on.

130
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,000

135
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Tonight,

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,480
I originally planned a big garden tour.

137
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,680
For us,

138
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,760
the entire garden is planted with lilies,

139
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,680
implying that we'll live a harmonious life for a hundred years.

140
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,440
I also had someone

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,040
invite the most famous theatrical troupe in the State

142
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,720
to perform your favorite play.

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,400
What a pity!

144
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,920
You missed the chance.

145
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,600
So did I.

146
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
When did you start with him?

147
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
I know you've been lying to me.

148
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,920
That night,

149
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,920
you told me you lost yourself in the story you heard.

150
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,360
But inside the capital,

151
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,720
no storyteller told a story about

152
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
the emperor and his beauty that day.

153
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,560
You were with him, right?

154
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,840
Yes.

155
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,160
I asked General Ye to take me away.

156
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,520
Why not go away that time?

157
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,760
Why?

158
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,280
Because I didn't want to give up high position and great wealth.

159
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,400
Then what you told me before

160
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
are all lies.

161
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,240
You told me

162
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,640
your feelings for me are real

163
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,240
even if you act against your will.

164
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,080
I don't feel like telling the truth from the false.

165
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,040
Just tell me directly.

166
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,880
What am I to you?

167
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,720
I risked universal condemnation

168
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,680
and made you the Imperial Lady, the Madam, and the empress!

169
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,880
What did you do?

170
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,400
Is this how you pay me back?

171
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,440
Is this how you treat me?

172
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,520
I'm...

173
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,920
I'm sorry!

174
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm sorry!

175
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,760
Don't apologize to me!

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
I should admire you!

177
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,520
Because you really make me feel that

178
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,480
I can't even get a woman.

179
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,080
I made you my empress,

180
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,520
but even that didn't get me your love,

181
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,440
or awake your conscience.

182
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,920
Why did you wait

183
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,800
till the Crowning Ceremony to put on such a show?

184
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,400
Am I

185
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,760
a big joke to you?

186
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,760
You're still thinking about him and worrying about him,

187
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,240
right?

188
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm thinking that

189
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,720
it's a mistake from the start.

190
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,320
You regret meeting me,

191
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,240
right?

192
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,960
Your Majesty, if I didn't meet you,

193
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,600
I wouldn't have been able to save you.

194
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,560
I've never regretted meeting you.

195
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,600
I don't want to see you ever again.

196
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,600

Take her to prison.

220
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,480
Mother!

221
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Your Majesty,

222
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,680
treacherous and adulterous as they are,

223
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,600
they actually did something so shameless.

224
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,760
I beg Your Majesty to kill them

225
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
to show the innocence of our State.

226
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,240
Your Majesty,

227
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,480
you can't be indecisive in this.

228
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,360
Coming from the countryside,

229
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,480
Bai Xiaojiu is of unknown origin.

230
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,640
Now she even made the State of Chengyu a joke!

231
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,640
And she made Your Majesty a joke!

232
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
She's definitely a disaster.

233
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,160
We must kill her!

234
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
Right, Your Majesty!

235
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,680
That's all for today.

236
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,920
The court session is finished.

237
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,240
Your Majesty, see you!

238
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

239
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,440
Go somewhere with me.

240
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,200
Where?

241
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,800
I want to see him

242
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,600
and ask him for the truth.

243
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,000
I want to talk with General Ye.

244
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,640
Leave us alone.

245
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,840
Yes!

246
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,360
Take a seat.

247
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,240
I dare not.

248
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,360
You even dared elope with my empress.

249
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
What else dare you not do?

250
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,880
Won't you explain to me?

251
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,560
What's done is done.

252
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,600
It's useless to explain.

253
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
You're quite honest.

254
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,000
You won't tell me.

255
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,240
Fine.

256
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,280
I'll ask you questions.

257
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,240
Just answer them.

258
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,920
When did you start?

259
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,760
The minute I knew she's a woman,

260
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
I fell in love with her.

261
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,560
However,

262
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,400
she was soon appointed as the empress.

263
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,840
What about her?

264
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,720
I don't know.

265
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
You don't know?

266
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,080
Xiaojiu only told me that

267
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
she preferred to abandon herself to nature

268
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,200
than stay in the imperial palace.

269
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
I was the one who brought her into the imperial palace,

270
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,080
so...

271
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,040
So you took her out

272
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
the day before her Crowing Ceremony.

273
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,720
Ye Qingti,

274
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,480
did you embarrass me

275
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,080
and the State of Chengyu on purpose?

276
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,840
I've made a huge mistake this time.

277
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,880
Death is not sufficient for my sin.

278
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,840
The celestial phenomenon today

279
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,960
is rarely seen over the past decade,
with Yin Qi reaching its prime.

280
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,680
It's the God's will that

281
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,200
the State of Chengyu goes through an upheaval!

282
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,680
How many men have you got me?

283
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,080
Thirty.

284
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,400
Thirty?

285
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,760
Are you kidding me?

286
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
How can I attack the capital with only thirty people?

287
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,280
Your Highness,

288
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,480
don't underestimate them.

289
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,960
They're the first-class martial arts masters

290
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,040
of the State of Chong'an,

291
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
who can withstand a hundred men.

292
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
Let's split up later.

293
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
One team attacks the capital,

294
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,640
and the other takes the treasure.

295
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,320
What about the war inside the capital?

296
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,560
Your Highness,

297
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,600
you only need to open the gate for me.

298
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,680
After that, someone will lead a hundred men
to attack the troops inside the capital.

299
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,520
Isn't Ye Qingti in prison now?

300
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,120
Without Ye Qingti,

301
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,640
the Imperial Guards will be utterly routed.

302
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
Your Highness, you don't have to mind the war inside the capital.

303
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,480
Just go straight to take the treasure.

304
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,560
Also,

305
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,520
we'll make a feint somewhere else to hide our real target.

306
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,800
Nothing can go wrong this time.

307
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,280
Your Highness, I've got something for you.

308
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,760
What's this?

309
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,400
It's the Demon Knife Lanyu.

310
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,800
Lanyu?

311
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
Your Highness, if you're in danger,

312
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
the knife can help you.

313
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
If anyone stands in your way,

314
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,360
just kill him.

315
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,160
Then let's

316
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,880
wait and see.

317
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
I've seen it all high above.

318
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,600
What a silly girl!

319
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,440
Why did you do that?

320
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
His Majesty has to take the romance misfortune.

321
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,640
But by doing so,

322
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,080
my heart really hurts.

323
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Well,

324
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
you shouldn't have come to the mortal realm back then.

325
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,640
What's the point of saying that?

326
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,360
Luckily, it's all gonna end soon.

327
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,120
To be honest,

328
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm really impressed that

329
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,800
you could cause such big trouble this time.

330
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,800
In the mortal realm,

331
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,320
I read many stories.

332
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,640
I tried all the methods

333
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
with which those ladies
successfully hurt those childes' feelings,

334
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,520
but His Majesty still loved me dearly.

335
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,440
Now I failed not only His Majesty,

336
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,960
but General Ye.

337
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,240
You failed His Majesty for Emperor Dong Hua's sake.

338
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,920
What about General Ye?

339
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,280
Actually, we know nothing about

340
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,520
human love in the mortal realm.

341
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,400
But love is a sin.

342
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,680
Meeting and departing are uncertain.

343
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
Perhaps, meeting with you

344
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,360
is a misfortune for him in his life.

345
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
Fine.

346
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll keep you company a little longer.

347
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,080
Well,

348
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,760
this is for you.

349
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,760
What's this?

350
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,080
If His Majesty really wants to kill you,

351
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,520
it can relieve your pain when you go back to the Sky Kingdom.

352
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,480
What did you just say?

353
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,080
Say it again!

354
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,720
Mother, I beg you

355
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,720
to spare Xiaojiu's life.

356
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,200
She betrayed you,

357
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,720
but you still want to protect her.

358
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,680
Are you out of your mind?

359
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,280
Let me ask you.

360
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,800
How are you going to do with them?

361
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,840
Xiaojiu was brought back by me.

362
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,360
She doesn't belong to the imperial palace.

363
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,200
Just remove her title

364
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,520
and demote her to a civilian.

365
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,760
Let her go back to normal.

366
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
What about Ye Qingti?

367
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,640
You also want to spare him, right?

368
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,760
General Ye has fought battles for our State.

369
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,400
Though he has made a big mistake this time,

370
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
the Ye family is loyal and many of its members died as martyrs.

371
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,320
Old General Ye was killed
in the battlefield to protect the late Emperor.

372
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,080
Ye Qingti is the only descendant of the Ye family.

373
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,840
Just take back the General's Mansion.

374
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
Order the Ye family to move back
to their ancestral home to mourn for their ancestors.

375
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,440
Never shall they return to the capital.

376
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,680
Nor shall any member of the Ye family
be appointed as an official.

377
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,680
Song Xuanren! Song Xuanren!

378
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,080
When sister was carrying you,

379
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,960
she told me that

380
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
she had prayed to God every night,

381
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,280
hoping that her child could be kind.

382
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,400
But unexpectedly,

383
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,200
your kindness has made you so weak

384
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,880
and easily bullied!

385
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,080
Ye Qingti shall be spared

386
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,440
for the sake of his ancestors,

387
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,120
but what about that woman?

388
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,840
She has disgraced not only you,

389
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,240
but the entire State of Chengyu.

390
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,200
I must kill her!

391
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,320
Mother!

392
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
What's the point of killing her?

393
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,360
Please spare her life.

394
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,960
If you let her live,

395
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,320
you're asking me to die!

396
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,160
Just leave.

397
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,160
I won't.

398
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,280
Mother, if you don't promise to spare her life,

399
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I won't get up.

400
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
You!

401
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,280
Good for you!

402
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,720
You're actually on your knees for a woman!

403
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,920
Fine!

404
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,800
If you want to kneel down, so be it!

405
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,680
Damn it!

406
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,080
What's wrong?

407
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,960
Something's wrong.

408
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,000
Your Majesty!

409
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,320
Your Majesty!

410
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,840
Bad news!

411
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,920
It's an emergency!

412
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
Send all the Imperial Guards

413
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,960
to the gate of the imperial palace.

414
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,360
Don't let them break in!

415
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,080
Get out of the capital now and transfer some forces

416
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,880
to reinforce the imperial palace directly!

417
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,560
But General Ye was in charge of dispatching forces.

418
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,640
Now you're in charge!

419
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,800
Yes!

420
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,760
Why did they break in so fast?

421
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,720
I heard that an enemy agent has sneaked into the imperial palace.

422
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,080
Release General Ye from the prison

423
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,680
to guard the capital!

424
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,320
Yes!

425
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,280
Report!

426
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,480
What now?

427
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,320
Your Majesty,

428
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,560
word just came from the prison that

429
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,680
Madam Jiu asked to see you.

430
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,400
Did she say why?

431
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,000
Having heard an outburst of civil stifle,

432
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,320
Madam Jiu insisted on seeing Your Majesty.

433
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,640
General Ye, please.

434
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,240
General!

435
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,600
Where are the Imperial Guards?

436
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,400
They're all out guarding the capital!

437
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,800
What's up?

438
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,320
Your Majesty,

439
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,760
I heard today that enemy troops are invading the capital.

440
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Though I don't know the details,

441
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
I do know that

442
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,560
Your Majesty must be deeply troubled.

443
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,280
Then thanks for your care.

444
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,760
Your Majesty, I have a request to make.

445
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,080
Go ahead.

446
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,600
I know I've committed a deadly sin

447
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,160
and got General Ye into trouble,

448
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,160
but right now,

449
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,880
I beg Your Majesty to put the State first

450
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,560
and release General Ye,

451
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,670
so that he can protect thousands of civilians in the capital.

452
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
So you have me here

453
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,670
to intercede for him.

454
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,400
No,

455
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,520
it's not for him,

456
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,230
but for thousands of civilians,

457
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,880
for the State of Chengyu,

458
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,320
and also,

459
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,710
also for you.

460
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Enough!

461
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,000
Your Majesty,

462
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,360
Unblessed and ill-fated as I am,

463
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,120
I don't deserve

464
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,190
everything you've done for me.

465
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,840
I know I shouldn't ask any favor

466
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,040
from Your Majesty now.

467
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm willing to die to atone for my sin.

468
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,710
Please spare General Ye's life

469
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,360
and let him fight the enemy troops.

470
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
Your Majesty, thank you!

471
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Come with me.

472
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,560
The show is finally on.

473
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,040
Your Highness,

474
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,920
it's time for us to move.

475
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,880
Imperial Guards!

476
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,920
Guard the capital with your lives!

477
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,120
Yes!

478
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,280
Charge!

479
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,320
Charge!

480
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,280
Your Highness!

481
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,920
I'm here to take the Lingbi Stone at His Majesty's bidding.

482
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,120
Let us in now!

483
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,560
Your Highness,

484
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,520
His Majesty ordered that

485
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,480
unless he's here in person,

486
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,880
no one is allowed in.

487
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,320
This is...

488
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,040
It leads to the outside of the imperial palace.

489
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,800
I'll send you out.

490
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,760
Wait!

491
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,920
What's up?

492
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,120
Your Majesty, something's wrong.

493
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,840
Just think about it.

494
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,240
Why do the enemy troops invade so smoothly?

495
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
All signs indicate that

496
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,320
there's a spy inside the imperial palace.

497
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,240
But I think

498
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,200
it's not that simple.

499
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,160
Given what Chu Wan did,

500
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,240
plus the current riot,

501
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,800
all these might be set up by the State of Chong'an

502
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,640
to steal the Lingbi Stone.

503
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,360
Yang Shun.

504
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,160
Yes!

505
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,440
Find General Ye now!

506
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Ask him to lead two thousand picked troops
to the Emperor's Tomb immediately.

507
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,400
Ask him not to get too involved in the war.

508
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,360
Yes!

509
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,920
Follow me!

510
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,760
Go!

511
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,320
Go get it.

512
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,200
Emperor Dong Hua!

513
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,400
It's you!

514
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,360
You're also here!

515
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,240
The imperial palace is about to be destroyed,

516
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,920
and your men are about to be wiped out.

517
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,160
Yet, you still can't let go of the Lingbi Stone.

518
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
You colluded with the enemy troops.

519
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Now you even want to steal the Lingbi Stone?

520
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,440
No.

521
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,400
You not only want the Lingbi Stone,

522
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,240
but the throne.

523
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,240
Yes!

524
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,680
You're right.

525
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,920
I'll take both of them today.

526
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,120
The State of Chengyu is supposed to be mine.

527
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,880
So is the Lingbi Stone.

528
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,280
Why should I steal them?

529
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,720
Speaking of stealing,

530
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,320
it should be you.

531
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,440
Song Xuanren!

532
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,120
What're you talking about?

533
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,840
In the imperial palace,

534
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
I'm your elder brother.

535
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,840
Your mother died,

536
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,400
so my mother becomes your mother.

537
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,720
She's favored you all the time since childhood.

538
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,680
She even forgets that

539
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm her natural son.

540
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,640
How come you were made the Crown Prince at birth?

541
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Why do father and mother

542
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,920
favor you all the time?

543
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,320
I've done so many things and tried so hard,

544
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,360
but they just don't see it.

545
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
In their eyes,

546
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,160
I'm just a loser.

547
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,520
But you,

548
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,880
Song Xuanren,

549
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,480
when you were born,

550
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,360
strange celestial phenomenon appeared and your own mother died.

551
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,680
Your birth

552
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,480
would actually bring misfortune to the State of Chengyu.

553
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,080
I brought misfortune?

554
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,320
You colluded with the State of Chong'an

555
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,920
and destroyed our capital.

556
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,320
Which one of us

557
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,880
actually brought misfortune to the State of Chengyu?
