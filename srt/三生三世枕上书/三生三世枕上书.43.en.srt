00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 43

3
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,820
It's just a meal.

4
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,660
Why do you have so many dishes prepared?

5
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,860
Your Highness, you have been badly injured

6
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,180
and shed a lot of blood.

7
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,020
I'm so worried about you.

8
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,740
I hope you can get more nutrition.

9
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,100
Your Highness, let me serve you.

10
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,740
Don't bother. It's okay.

11
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,540
I just need more practice.

12
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,540
Your Highness.

13
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,380
Moye.

14
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,700
Why are you in a hurry?

15
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,660
Is there anything urgent?

16
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
Lord Xi Ze

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,900
asked me to go to Qi Nan Palace at once.

18
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,140
Xi Ze?

19
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,700
What happened?

20
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,740
Here is the thing.

21
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,420
Dong Hua asked me to go there in the early morning,

22
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
so I come here

23
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
to give this to you.

24
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,260
These are letters I mentioned last time.

25
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,140
Aranya wrote them to Shen Ye.

26
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,820
These days,

27
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,380
I've copied some of them.

28
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,940
What?

29
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,500
You've copied them out?

30
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,860
Here is the thing,

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,380
I copied

32
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,260
some letters in Aranya's handwriting.

33
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,460
Others

34
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,940
were just copied out

35
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,060
in my own handwriting.

36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,300
Now that Dong Hua wanted to see me soon,

37
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,340
I have to leave the rest to you.

38
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,620
Okay.

39
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,460
Moye, you're really my bosom friend.

40
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,940
What I hate most is writing.

41
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,180
Remember.

42
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,500
Every two or three days,

43
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,460
send a letter to the Mengchun Courtyard.

44
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,060
No problem.

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Okay.

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,860
I have to rush to Qi Nan Palace.

47
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,260
I'll leave it to you.

48
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,100
Your Highness,

49
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,860
be more careful when you read these letters.

50
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,580
What if others find it out?

51
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,220
Right. Thanks for reminding me.

52
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,620
Put them away.

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,300
Okay.

54
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,900
Take care. I'm leaving.

55
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,620
I heard you just moved to the Mengchun Courtyard,

56
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,540
so I wrote this letter to greet.

57
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,900
I once stayed in the yard for three years.

58
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,060
I was afraid nobody would go there

59
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,220
so that the beautiful view could be wasted.

60
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,100
Now that you're there,

61
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,780
I feel much relieved.

62
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,580
Luckily, Moye gave these letters to me

63
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,020
in advance.

64
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,820
Since I'm not Aranya,

65
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,420
it would be impossible

66
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,900
for me to write such letters.

67
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,380
I like to enjoy tea and make wine in my spare time.

68
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,300
When I was living there,

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,740
I buried some good wine in the yard.

70
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,860
The plum wine under the Mid-Lake Pavilion is the best.

71
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,980
It's a pity I don't have a chance to enjoy it.

72
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,580
I want to send it to you.

73
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,020
You may feel sad when you're alone.

74
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,980
I hope the wine can help you forget bad moments.

75
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,540
Wen Tian.

76
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,100
Wen Tian?

77
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,900
Did Moye get it wrong?

78
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,980
Isn't it a letter

79
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,740
for Shen Ye from Aranya?

80
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,340
Why is it Wen Tian?

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,140
Your Highness.

82
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,740
How is it going?

83
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,460
Your Highness,

84
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,020
for the several days since Shen Ye moved in,

85
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,540
he has never stepped out.

86
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,900
He ate little.

87
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,980
It seems he's a little upset.

88
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,900
Did the food not agree with his stomach?

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
You told us to take care of him,

90
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,900
so I asked people from the Qi Nan Palace about his taste.

91
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,740
All dishes were cooked

92
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,620
according to his flavor.

93
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,380
Got it.

94
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,780
Maybe Shen Ye

95
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,420
hasn't got used to the life here.

96
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,020
How about showing him around?

97
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,300
Don't let him shut himself in the Mengchun Courtyard all day.

98
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,820
Got it.

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,820
Oh.

100
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,820
Take this letter to Shen Ye.

101
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,900
Don't say anything

102
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,020
if he asks where it is from.

103
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,140
I see.

104
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,020
Aranya wrote these letters to comfort Shen Ye

105
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
when she knew he was in a bad mood.

106
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,620
She must've

107
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,540
been in deep love with him.

108
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,100
Those who fall in love may all do similar things.

109
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,260
Back then, to save His Majesty,

110
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,940
I even gave my fur

111
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,340
to Nie Chuyin.

112
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,780
Your Excellency.

113
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,220
Thank you.

114
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,180
Why does she still write letter to me?

115
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,500
We've been in the dream for a long time.

116
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,740
Xiaobai is finally back.

117
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,300
Your Majesty,

118
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,580
I've got a question for you.

119
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,660
Go ahead.

120
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,900
How did you and Fengjiu

121
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,940
fall into the Dream of Aranya together?

122
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,100
Is Fengjiu your...

123
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,060
I know what you want to ask.

124
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,340
You're right.

125
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,500
I like Xiaobai.

126
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,980
You're so straightforward.

127
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,020
Because I've missed much.

128
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,660
I don't want to miss her anymore.

129
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,380
Xiaobai said

130
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
you told her that

131
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,340
she had to experience the whole life of Aranya

132
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,540
to get out of the dream world.

133
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,460
To be honest,

134
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,700
I've never been to the Dream of Aranya.

135
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,580
It's just a guess.

136
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,500
It's also the only way I can figure out.

137
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,660
But I found the dream world is extremely dangerous.

138
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
What will happen is unpredictable.

139
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,860
Besides,

140
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,660
Xiaobai got injured for Aranya.

141
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,980
Her unrecovered primordial spirit was seriously damaged again.

142
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,740
Your Majesty,

143
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,500
Fengjiu got badly injured

144
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,540
because of my negligence.

145
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,540
Please punish me.

146
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,020
I couldn't control

147
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,180
what Xiaobai will go through.

148
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,220
So,

149
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,620
I have to make her primordial spirit recover soon

150
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,940
and leave here with her.

151
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,940
You're right.

152
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,420
I asked you to be here

153
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,700
because I need you to help me with something.

154
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,420
I'll do anything as you say.

155
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Okay.

156
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,020
I'm making a magic instrument.

157
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,780
It's delayed since I need to look for some materials.

158
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,220
With the instrument, I can know Aranya's previous life.

159
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,060
We'll know how to get out of here

160
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,780
when we find out how it was created.

161
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,220
I need you to give me a hand.

162
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,180
I'll try my best.

163
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,860
Good.

164
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,540
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,180
Your Majesty.

166
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,700
Please tell me

167
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,700
the secret of the Dream of Aranya.

168
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,100
If Emperor Dong Hua can't come out,

169
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,340
Lian Song won't let us go.

170
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,900
And Meng will go into the dream world.

171
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,460
By then it'll be too late.

172
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,500
The Dream of Aranya is a taboo in our clan.

173
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,300
It's about the royal family's reputation.

174
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,820
I'll never tell anyone about it.

175
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,300
Jielu, as a member of the royal family,

176
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,660
you broke the rules on purpose. You're doubly guilty.

177
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,860
Your Majesty, it's not the right time

178
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,300
to consider the reputation.

179
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,300
Nothing is more important than life.

180
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,300
If you want to punish me,

181
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,780
just do it and I won't complain.

182
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,740
Please tell me the secret of the Dream of Aranya.

183
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,540
Just kneel here if you want.

184
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,420
Stay here and think about

185
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,260
what's the most important for the royal family.

186
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,340
All of you can go back now.

187
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,980
You don't need to stay here.

188
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,860
I'm worried about Ji Heng,

189
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,860
so I'm going to the Yulin Courtyard.

190
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,260
I'll be here if I can be of any help.

191
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,340
The imperial palace never needs me.

192
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,660
I'll worry too much if I go back there.

193
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,380
It's better to stay here.

194
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,180
I'll keep a distance from you

195
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,340
if you think I'm bothering you.

196
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,340
Never mind.

197
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,820
Xiaojiu is lucky

198
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,060
to have a good friend like you.

199
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,700
From tomorrow on, you don't need to make this for me.

200
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,460
See?

201
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,220
My hand is getting better.

202
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,500
Your Highness,

203
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,620
Lord Shen Ye has got a better appetite

204
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,420
in the past two days.

205
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,140
He also went to the Mid-Lake Pavilion.

206
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,820
It seems he feels much better.

207
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,220
Your Highness,

208
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,620
Lord Shen Ye asked me

209
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,180
to hand this letter over to Wen Tian of the imperial college.

210
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,220
Wen Tian?

211
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,540
Yes.

212
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:01,780
Give it to me.

213
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,540
That letter

214
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,580
was written to him

215
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,100
in the name of Wen Tian.

216
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,140
Don't tell him about it.

217
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,940
Don't let him know.

218
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,500
Keep it a secret.

219
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,100
Got it.

220
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,100
Your Highness,

221
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,620
what did Lord Shen Ye write in his letter?

222
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,020
Nothing special.

223
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,180
Just some words to express his gratitude.

224
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,460
Give this letter to Shen Ye.

225
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,660
Your Highness, you're amazing.

226
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,460
You've even prepared a letter in reply.

227
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,900
Just a coincidence.

228
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,300
This morning,

229
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,420
I thought of some good books

230
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,100
in the Mengchun Courtyard,

231
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,380
so I recommended them

232
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,100
to him to kill time.

233
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,220
You care about Lord Shen Ye so much.

234
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
I'll do all I can

235
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,780
to take care of him.

236
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,980
You may leave now.

237
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,220
Got it.

238
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,060
Your Highness,

239
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,140
you're so nice to Lord Shen Ye.

240
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,340
He's our guest.

241
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,660
We should be thoughtful.

242
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,260
Don't make that again.

243
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,460
Wen Tian.

244
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,700
Wen Tian really exists.

245
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,420
The handwriting is the same.

246
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,940
And even the content has no difference.

247
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,060
But why?

248
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,700
That day on Lingshu Stage,

249
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,420
you said those words to me

250
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,700
as if you were an onlooker who had known the truth.

251
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,020
Are you Aranya or not?

252
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,820
Aranya even set up a puzzle

253
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,980
for Shen Ye to solve.

254
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,980
She has good taste in art.

255
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,980
I didn't expect she's even expert at playing chess.

256
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,180
I have a headache at the sight of the chessboard.

257
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,660
Your Highness,

258
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,660
this is a letter from Lord Shen Ye.

259
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,860
Chacha.

260
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,820
Shen Ye said

261
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,100
he saw a few interesting travel notes

262
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,060
in the study of the Mengchun Courtyard.

263
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,460
Do you know where they are?

264
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,660
You mean

265
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,580
those travel notes you like very much?

266
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,900
I remember

267
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,700
they're put on the bottom shelf.

268
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,940
Why did he mention the travel notes suddenly?

269
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,980
I didn't mention anything about them

270
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,500
in my previous letters.

271
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,780
Is it possible he happened to find them

272
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,100
when he tried to get something to read

273
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,980
and he thought they were interesting after reading?

274
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,540
Maybe.

275
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,180
Oh.

276
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,980
Give this letter to the steward

277
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,660
and ask him to take it to the Mengchun Courtyard.

278
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,260
Yes, Your Highness.

279
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,380
Judging from the letters,

280
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,140
Shen Ye and Aranya have the same interests.

281
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,100
Oh no.

282
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
I've sent almost all the letters copied by Moye.

283
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
What should I do next?

284
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,740
I have to learn to imitate her handwriting.

285
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,380
Mr. Su.

286
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,420
Where is Aranya?

287
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,900
She asked me to send a letter.

288
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,900
She's in the yard.

289
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,100
Your Highness.

290
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,580
You scared me.

291
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,540
You scared me.

292
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,140
How is it going?

293
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,660
How many letters have you sent?

294
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,500
I've sent all letters copied by you.

295
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,580
Well.

296
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,660
You've made no progress on your handwriting.

297
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,420
Didn't you

298
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,860
need to practice calligraphy in Qingqiu?

299
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,220
Yes, I did.

300
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,740
It's...

301
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,220
It's because I injured my hand.

302
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,100
Aranya is the one who got injured.

303
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,900
Your hand is in good condition.

304
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Alright.

305
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,980
Why are you back?

306
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,700
Where is His Majesty?

307
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,540
Well.

308
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,900
He's making a magic instrument.

309
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,860
I'm back to get some necessary materials

310
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,580
and look you up.

311
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,900
That'd be great.

312
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,740
Help me with these.

313
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,940
I can't stay for long this time.

314
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,260
I'm afraid there is not enough time.

315
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,540
Well.

316
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,620
You shouldn't be that lazy.

317
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,540
Oh.

318
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,740
How is it going with Shen Ye?

319
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,700
Have you met each other?

320
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,340
Speaking of him,

321
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,700
he's really a weirdo.

322
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,660
Since he moved to Mengchun Courtyard,

323
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,500
he's never stepped out of

324
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,740
that place.

325
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,740
But,

326
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,540
why is it Wen Tian's signature

327
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,020
in Aranya's letters to Shen Ye?

328
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,460
Who is Wen Tian?

329
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,900
She's

330
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,700
a teacher of the imperial college

331
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,740
who once lived in the Mengchun Courtyard.

332
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,180
At that time,

333
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,260
Aranya thought Shen Ye wouldn't read those letters

334
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,860
if he knew she wrote them,

335
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,780
so she wrote the letters in Wen Tian's name.

336
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,820
That explains it.

337
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,260
She had to write letters in another woman's name.

338
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,220
Aranya was really humble in the relationship.

339
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,540
If I were her,

340
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,340
I'd speak everything out.

341
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,420
In that way, there might be a slim chance.

342
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,740
Aranya

343
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,300
was not overcautious,

344
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,260
but she was afraid

345
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,620
Shen Ye would think it was out of sympathy,

346
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:23,980
so

347
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,300
she maintained

348
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,780
Shen Ye's dignity with great care

349
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,420
like that.

350
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,620
Aranya really had given much thought to it.

351
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,100
Later, I asked her to make a decision

352
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,260
and told him she wrote those letters,

353
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,420
but unexpectedly,

354
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
she chose to

355
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,500
let the real Wen Tian meet Shen Ye.

356
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,860
Did Wen Tian show up?

357
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,020
Yeah.

358
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,860
A lot of things happened between them later.

359
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,500
Moye,

360
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,820
I thought

361
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,500
Aranya was stronger than me

362
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,580
and she was more big-hearted.

363
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,420
But I didn't expect she'd been so pitiful.

364
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,500
She was in love with Shen Ye silently,

365
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,340
but he never knew about that.

366
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,900
Yeah.

367
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
But trust me.

368
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,860
I'll help her achieve her aim

369
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,620
and take good care of Shen Ye.

370
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,900
Oh.

371
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,380
Shen Ye would send you some wine in a few days.

372
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
Don't forget

373
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,340
to find a chance

374
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,060
so that Wen Tian and Shen Ye can meet each other. Got it?

375
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
Your Highness.

376
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,540
You may leave now, Chacha.

377
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,540
He solved the puzzle so quickly.

378
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,260
And he gave one back.

379
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,460
Aranya,

380
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,860
you were so careful and humble in the relationship.

381
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,180
And you didn't dare to tell Shen Ye how you felt.

382
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,140
The only thing I can do

383
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,700
is to tell him your true feelings.

384
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,300
Time flies.

385
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,020
This has already been the 18th letter.

386
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,380
It's time to get the wine.

387
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,460
Aranya,

388
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,700
this is the good wine you mentioned in your letter.

389
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Gather frost-dyed berries to brew wine.

390
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,660
Store it underground for three seasons.

391
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,540
Then dry Fujiezi collected in autumn over a fire

392
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,180
before immersing it in the wine for half a month.

393
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,660
In this way, the wine will get the fragrance
of the herbal medicine.

394
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,620
After that, seal the wine again
and put it underground for two years.

395
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,700
Yeah.

396
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,660
It's time for me to send you some wine.

397
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,620
Your Highness, another letter from Lord Shen Ye.

398
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,820
What's that?

399
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,260
This is the wine.

400
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,060
Lord Shen Ye asked me to bring it to Ms. Wen.

401
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,380
Put it on the table.

402
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,100
Lord Shen Ye even knows how to make wine.

403
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,180
Shen Ye began to

404
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
write longer and longer letters.

405
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,580
He must be in a better mood.

406
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,940
Your Highness,

407
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,580
Lord Shen Ye looks the same as before,

408
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,100
but I guess he's in a better mood.

409
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,420
He plays chess, makes chess playbooks,

410
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,820
or goes to the Mid-Lake Pavilion.

411
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
That's good.

412
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,220
Chacha.

413
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,300
Is there a teacher called Wen Tian in the imperial college?

414
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,140
I remember

415
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,380
she once lived

416
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,100
in the Mengchun Courtyard, right?

417
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,780
Exactly.

418
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,900
Invite her to come here.

419
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,220
Got it.

420
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,620
It's getting

421
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,700
more and more boring.

422
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,020
I wonder how His Majesty is doing.

423
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,500
Oh.

424
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,340
Your Highness, what's up?

425
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,300
Chacha, I need to go out.

426
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
Your Highness, where are you going?

427
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,780
Stay out of it.

428
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,620
Invite Wen Tian to my mansion now.

429
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,660
Got it.

430
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,660
So much honey.

431
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,420
I wonder which kind His Majesty likes.

432
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,180
How are you, young lady?

433
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,340
How are you?

434
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,380
Come have a look. Which kind do you like?

435
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,300
The green one.

436
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,900
The yellow one and the red one.

437
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,180
Put the three of them in one jar.

438
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,220
Okay!

439
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,740
And that one.

440
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,660
The yellow one.

441
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,740
Okay.

442
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,620
Thanks.

443
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,140
Chacha, I'm back.

444
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,940
Your Highness, you're back.

445
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,740
Ms. Wen Tian has been waiting for you for so long.

446
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,020
Rise, please.

447
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,540
What's in your hands?

448
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,380
I found this chess playbook in the study

449
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,380
and was going to take it back and study it.

450
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,060
I met Chacha on my way

451
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,620
and she said you wanted to see me.

452
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,580
Did you have dinner?

453
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,740
Not yet.

454
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,980
Take it.

455
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,180
Have dinner with me.

456
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,780
This way.

457
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,500
To be honest,

458
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,180
I invite you here today

459
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,060
because I want to ask you to do me a favor.

460
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,700
Your Highness, just tell me.

461
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,380
Since that thing happened to Junuo,

462
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,900
Shen Ye has been staying

463
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,420
in my mansion.

464
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,620
Entrusted by someone

465
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,380
to take good care of him,

466
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,740
I've been communicating with him

467
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,860
through letters,

468
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,540
in the name of you.

469
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,860
Do you mean

470
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,940
you wrote letters to Lord Shen Ye

471
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,060
and signed yourself "Wen Tian"?

472
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,140
Yes.

473
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,420
You must know that

474
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
there has been bad blood between him and me.

475
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,380
I was afraid he'd be more resentful

476
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,620
if he found I wrote the letters,

477
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,700
so I did it in your name.

478
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
I see.

479
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,940
I admire you for your kindness.

480
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,180
It's just there have been so many things to deal with recently

481
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,660
that my strength doesn't equal to the will.

482
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,220
And I don't want to let down the one who entrusted me with it,

483
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,420
so I wonder

484
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,300
if you can take it over

485
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,020
and look after Shen Ye for me.

486
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,220
You did me a lot of favors.

487
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,700
Of course, I'll help you in return.

488
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,020
Can you tell me what I should say in the letters?

489
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,380
There is nothing special.

490
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,380
You just need to share with him

491
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,020
some interesting things in daily life.

492
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,740
I wrote these letters

493
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,340
to Shen Ye

494
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,780
in your name.

495
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,340
I've copied them out for you

496
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,220
lest Shen Ye finds anything wrong.

497
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,740
I have to emphasize

498
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,100
one more thing.

499
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,140
Please imitate my handwriting

500
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,740
when you write him letters

501
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
to avoid giving the game away.

502
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Please trust me.

503
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,340
It's not hard for me.

504
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,540
I'll count on you.

505
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Your Highness,

506
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,980
why did you suddenly want to make sugar figurines?

507
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,460
I promised Xi Ze

508
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,020
to make him some other day.

509
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
I'm free today.

510
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,580
So I have made these sugar foxes.

511
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,140
You're really quick-witted and nimble-fingered.

512
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,620
I didn't know

513
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,260
you can even do that.

514
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,500
These sugar foxes are so cute.

515
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,500
Really?

516
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,300
Do you think he'd like it?

517
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,460
Trust me.

518
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,740
His Excellency likes

519
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,220
everything you make.

520
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,300
Alright.

521
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,420
Then,

522
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,540
I'll give Xi Ze ten.

523
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,740
These are for my master.

524
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,380
I'll give him five.

525
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,940
As for the rest...

526
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,540
Oh.

527
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,380
Shen Ye sent me some wine the other day.

528
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,900
It's impolite not to reciprocate.

529
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,420
I'll give him five.

530
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,940
Your Excellency, you've got a visitor.

531
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,900
Come in.

532
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,460
Your Excellency. Mr. Su.

533
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,260
What's up?

534
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,300
Her Highness Aranya

535
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,540
asked me to take this to you.

536
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,660
Mr. Su,

537
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,260
this is for you.

538
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,900
Why...

539
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,700
Why does he have ten

540
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,060
and I have only five?

541
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,340
Did you eat on the way?

542
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,580
Mr. Su, you got me wrong.

543
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,740
Her Highness told me clearly

544
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,620
His Excellency has ten

545
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,460
Mr. Su has five.

546
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,980
I am going.

547
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,740
Come on, Your Majesty.

548
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,580
Don't be so mean.

549
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,580
It's not as good as God Zhe Yan's wine,

550
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,900
but I've never

551
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,980
drunk such refreshing wine

552
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,860
since I left Qingqiu.

553
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,180
Lord Shen Ye, why are you here?

554
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,180
What wine were you drinking?

555
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,820
I've been unoccupied these days,

556
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,780
so I...

557
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,660
Your Highness.

558
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,180
Your Highness.

559
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,540
I think I lost my chess playbook

560
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,260
in your place today.

561
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,940
Wen Tian, it's a good timing.

562
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,420
Let me introduce you to him.

563
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,180
This is Lord Shen Ye.

564
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,700
Lord Shen Ye, this is Wen Tian.

565
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,420
She used to live in the Mengchun Courtyard.

566
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,700
Nice to meet you, Your Excellency.

567
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,420
The wine has strong delayed effect.

568
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,660
I feel dizzy.

569
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,380
I must go. See you.

570
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,940
Your Highness.

571
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,100
Your Highness.

572
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,380
Lord Shen Ye and Wen Tian

573
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,900
wrote a few letters to each other.

574
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,180
Ms. Wen sent him two small gifts.

575
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,020
One is a straw white-headed sparrow

576
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,260
and the other is an embroidered pendant with auspicious patterns.

577
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,820
Lord Shen Ye sent her two books in return.

578
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,140
Their relationship is moving so fast.

579
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,780
They even began to send each other tokens of affection.

580
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,860
Where are they?

581
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
I think they're playing chess by the river.

582
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Leave them alone.

583
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,460
Got it.

584
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,620
She pushed her beloved away

585
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,860
to another woman like that.

586
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,020
If she were more fearless

587
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,020
and dared to tell him her true feelings,

588
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,500
would they have a chance

589
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,500
to stay together?

590
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,020
I've changed my mind.

591
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,940
When the moon shines brightly in the sky

592
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,140
and the wind blows through the bamboo forest,

593
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,820
let's have a hearty drink

594
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,260
and forget all worries.

595
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,180
After today,

596
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,140
it'll be the time for us to fall out.

597
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,860
Xiangli Aranya.

598
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,740
= Xiangli Aranya =

599
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
You're the one who wrote those letters.

600
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,220
You lied to me and made a fool of me.

601
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,420
Do you think it's interesting?

602
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,980
You found it out so soon?

603
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,180
How did you know that?

604
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,940
Oh no. What a fool I am!

605
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,060
I could have denied it.

606
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,460
I wrote back to you

607
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,380
with sincerity.

608
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,980
Does it make you happy

609
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,460
to see me end up like this?

610
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,020
I didn't mean it.

612
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,660
How about having some tea?

613
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,420
Calm down. Take your time.

614
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,140
Actually, you shouldn't have thought like that.

615
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,100
How could I be happy by lying to you?

616
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,180
Fine.

617
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,620
I won't write letters again.

618
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,660
Okay?

619
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,340
What you said to me

620
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
on Lingshu Stage that day

621
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,860
was totally different from before.

622
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,780
Your response today

623
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
was also different.

624
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,380
I've never heard Aranya could make sugar figurines.

625
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,020
And I've never received sugar foxes.

626
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,980
What on earth is going on?

627
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,900
In this dream world,

628
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,740
nothing changed,

629
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,260
except you.

630
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,220
You've changed so much.

631
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,460
I didn't expect Shen Ye would be so angry

632
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,700
after finding out the truth.

633
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,620
It seems he's not

634
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,780
inconstant in love.

635
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,860
Something must've gone wrong.

636
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,620
I can't fall asleep anyway.

637
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,980
I'll go see what's happening in Mengchun Courtyard.

638
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,780
Why are birds twittering at night?

639
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,780
Your Majesty.

640
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,900
Xiaobai.
