1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 20

3
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,760
Elope?

4
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,480
What do you mean?

5
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,320
Rumor has it that General Ye disappeared with Her Majesty.

6
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,440
His Majesty was so furious that

7
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
he had all the Imperial Guards search for them.

8
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,120
Well...

9
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,600
How could they be together?

10
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,680
Right!

11
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
Now ministers are talking.

12
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,680
Rumor has it that General Ye and Her Majesty

13
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,760
are close to each other in private.

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
I also heard that

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,560
letters between them have been found in Yue Hua Palace.

16
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
It seems they've loved each other for quite some time.

17
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,000
Love each other?

18
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
How dare she!

19
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,680
She shows no respect to the imperial family.

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
When they are caught,

21
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,920
I wonder how they will defend themselves.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Really?

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Now we have to stop all our plans.

24
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,880
The Crowning Ceremony for the empress is called off suddenly.

25
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
We can't find another opportunity
to break into the imperial palace.

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
Your Highness, take it easy.

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
I find it

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,480
to our benefit instead.

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
What do you mean?

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Your Highness, think about it.

31
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Ye Qingti and the new empress have an affair.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Whether he's caught or not,

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
will His Majesty still trust him?

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
Your Highness once told me that

35
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,600
the Imperial Guards under the command of
Ye Qingti are unbreakable.

36
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,720
What about now?

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,920
He's gone.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,480
Your Highness,

39
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,880
aren't we blessed by the God?

40
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,920
Your Highness, we're waiting for you.

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,720
Everything is ready.

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,360
Shall we take a break?

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
How long will it take for us to leave the State of Chengyu?

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
Two days and two nights.

45
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,520
It still has to take so long!

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
Now we're heading north.

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
We have to pass Hui'an and Luwei to reach the border.

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,320
Only after leaving the State of Chengyu

49
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,120
can we be completely safe.

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,160
Do you regret it?

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,480
No.

52
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,680
I just feel sorry

53
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,240
to drag you into this.

54
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,360
No need to be so polite to me.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,400
Well,

56
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
hurry up and go.

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,520
Now all the forcing troops in the imperial palace

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,040
are probably sent out to search for us.

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,360
The longer we stay, the more dangerous it will be.

60
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,640
OK.

61
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,680
Damn it!

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,720
They're here.

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,760
General! Your Majesty!

64
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Come back with us.

65
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,360
Xiaojiu, leave now.

66
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
I'll handle them.

67
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,440
General,

68
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,440
His Majesty's order can't be defied.

69
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,400
Don't make me!

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,920
Stop!

71
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,040
Why don't you leave?

72
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,200
I can't watch you die!

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,920
You should run away.

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,120
If I run away,

75
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,800
I won't be able to forgive myself the rest of my life.

76
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll go with you.

77
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Fine!

78
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,480
If I can't give you a new life,

79
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,200
I might as well die with you.

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,440
Sorrowless cake?

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,280
Is it made by Your Majesty yourself?

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,000
Certainly, it's made by myself,

83
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,360
but it's not sorrowless cake.

84
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
Have a taste first.

85
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,360
It's delicious.

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,480
I specially choose lily to make it.

87
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
According to the secret recipe,

88
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,400
it's elaborately made through three procedures.

89
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
I'll call it

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,760
lily cake.

91
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,280
Lily cake?

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,720
It's a good name.

93
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,280
The name of sorrowless flower

94
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,720
means one can be carefree,

95
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
while lily

96
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,680
represents ones who worship each other
can have a harmonious union for a hundred years.

97
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a common wish between the two.

98
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
Isn't the implied meaning of lily

99
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,640
much better than that of sorrowless flower?

100
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,120
In the future, you don't need to be afraid.

101
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,720
In the palace,

102
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
my love for you is the most powerful weapon for you.

103
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,600
You can use it at your free will.

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,120
You can do whatever you want to do.

105
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,560
I believe that

106
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
one day

107
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
you will entrust me.

108
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,880
You're the first one who treats me this way.

109
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,520
Your wound?

110
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
I happened to get

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
an effective ointment for curing scars.

112
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
This is cotton rose ointment

113
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
I specially made for you, Your Majesty.

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
Please go inside.

115
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,120

116
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,200

Are you fond of what I've awarded you?

122
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,440
I made the incense in person,

123
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,440
and I also selected the censer for you.

124
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,480
Do you like it?

125
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,320
Really?

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Your Majesty made it in person?

127
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,240
I like it.

128
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
This kind of reward is enough for me.

129
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,160
I'll protect you from now on.

130
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,000

135
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Tonight,

136
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
I originally planned a big garden tour.

137
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,680
For us,

138
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,760
the entire garden is planted with lilies,

139
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,680
implying that we'll live a harmonious life for a hundred years.

140
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
I also had someone

141
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
invite the most famous theatrical troupe in the State

142
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,720
to perform your favorite play.

143
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,400
What a pity!

144
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,920
You missed the chance.

145
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,600
So did I.

146
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,880
When did you start with him?

147
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,600
I know you've been lying to me.

148
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,920
That night,

149
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,920
you told me you lost yourself in the story you heard.

150
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,360
But inside the capital,

151
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,720
no storyteller told a story about

152
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,480
the emperor and his beauty that day.

153
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,560
You were with him, right?

154
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,840
Yes.

155
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
I asked General Ye to take me away.

156
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Why not go away that time?

157
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,760
Why?

158
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,280
Because I didn't want to give up high position and great wealth.

159
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,400
Then what you told me before

160
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
are all lies.

161
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,240
You told me

162
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,640
your feelings for me are real

163
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,240
even if you act against your will.

164
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,080
I don't feel like telling the truth from the false.

165
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,040
Just tell me directly.

166
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,880
What am I to you?

167
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,720
I risked universal condemnation

168
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
and made you the Imperial Lady, the Madam, and the empress!

169
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,880
What did you do?

170
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,400
Is this how you pay me back?

171
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,440
Is this how you treat me?

172
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm...

173
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm sorry!

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm sorry!

175
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,760
Don't apologize to me!

176
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,440
I should admire you!

177
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,520
Because you really make me feel that

178
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,480
I can't even get a woman.

179
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,080
I made you my empress,

180
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,520
but even that didn't get me your love,

181
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
or awake your conscience.

182
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
Why did you wait

183
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,800
till the Crowning Ceremony to put on such a show?

184
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,400
Am I

185
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,760
a big joke to you?

186
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,760
You're still thinking about him and worrying about him,

187
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,240
right?

188
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm thinking that

189
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,720
it's a mistake from the start.

190
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,320
You regret meeting me,

191
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,240
right?

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,960
Your Majesty, if I didn't meet you,

193
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
I wouldn't have been able to save you.

194
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,560
I've never regretted meeting you.

195
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
I don't want to see you ever again.

196
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,600

Take her to prison.

220
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,480
Mother!

221
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Your Majesty,

222
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,680
treacherous and adulterous as they are,

223
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,600
they actually did something so shameless.

224
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,760
I beg Your Majesty to kill them

225
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
to show the innocence of our State.

226
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,240
Your Majesty,

227
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,480
you can't be indecisive in this.

228
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,360
Coming from the countryside,

229
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,480
Bai Xiaojiu is of unknown origin.

230
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,640
Now she even made the State of Chengyu a joke!

231
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,640
And she made Your Majesty a joke!

232
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
She's definitely a disaster.

233
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
We must kill her!

234
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,640
Right, Your Majesty!

235
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,680
That's all for today.

236
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,920
The court session is finished.

237
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,240
Your Majesty, see you!

238
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

239
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,440
Go somewhere with me.

240
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,200
Where?

241
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,800
I want to see him

242
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,600
and ask him for the truth.

243
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,000
I want to talk with General Ye.

244
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,640
Leave us alone.

245
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,840
Yes!

246
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,360
Take a seat.

247
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,240
I dare not.

248
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
You even dared elope with my empress.

249
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
What else dare you not do?

250
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
Won't you explain to me?

251
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,560
What's done is done.

252
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
It's useless to explain.

253
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,720
You're quite honest.

254
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,000
You won't tell me.

255
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,240
Fine.

256
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
I'll ask you questions.

257
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,240
Just answer them.

258
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,920
When did you start?

259
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
The minute I knew she's a woman,

260
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,960
I fell in love with her.

261
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,560
However,

262
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,400
she was soon appointed as the empress.

263
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,840
What about her?

264
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,720
I don't know.

265
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,320
You don't know?

266
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,080
Xiaojiu only told me that

267
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,000
she preferred to abandon herself to nature

268
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
than stay in the imperial palace.

269
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,960
I was the one who brought her into the imperial palace,

270
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,080
so...

271
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,040
So you took her out

272
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,080
the day before her Crowing Ceremony.

273
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,720
Ye Qingti,

274
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
did you embarrass me

275
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,080
and the State of Chengyu on purpose?

276
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,840
I've made a huge mistake this time.

277
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,880
Death is not sufficient for my sin.

278
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,840
The celestial phenomenon today

279
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,960
is rarely seen over the past decade,
with Yin Qi reaching its prime.

280
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
It's the God's will that

281
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,200
the State of Chengyu goes through an upheaval!

282
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,680
How many men have you got me?

283
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,080
Thirty.

284
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,400
Thirty?

285
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Are you kidding me?

286
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
How can I attack the capital with only thirty people?

287
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,280
Your Highness,

288
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,480
don't underestimate them.

289
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
They're the first-class martial arts masters

290
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,040
of the State of Chong'an,

291
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
who can withstand a hundred men.

292
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,720
Let's split up later.

293
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
One team attacks the capital,

294
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,640
and the other takes the treasure.

295
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
What about the war inside the capital?

296
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,560
Your Highness,

297
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,600
you only need to open the gate for me.

298
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,680
After that, someone will lead a hundred men
to attack the troops inside the capital.

299
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,520
Isn't Ye Qingti in prison now?

300
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
Without Ye Qingti,

301
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
the Imperial Guards will be utterly routed.

302
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
Your Highness, you don't have to mind the war inside the capital.

303
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,480
Just go straight to take the treasure.

304
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,560
Also,

305
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,520
we'll make a feint somewhere else to hide our real target.

306
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,800
Nothing can go wrong this time.

307
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,280
Your Highness, I've got something for you.

308
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,760
What's this?

309
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,400
It's the Demon Knife Lanyu.

310
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,800
Lanyu?

311
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,480
Your Highness, if you're in danger,

312
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
the knife can help you.

313
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
If anyone stands in your way,

314
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
just kill him.

315
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,160
Then let's

316
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
wait and see.

317
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,440
I've seen it all high above.

318
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,600
What a silly girl!

319
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,440
Why did you do that?

320
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,040
His Majesty has to take the romance misfortune.

321
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,640
But by doing so,

322
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,080
my heart really hurts.

323
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Well,

324
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,760
you shouldn't have come to the mortal realm back then.

325
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,640
What's the point of saying that?

326
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,360
Luckily, it's all gonna end soon.

327
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,120
To be honest,

328
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
I'm really impressed that

329
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,800
you could cause such big trouble this time.

330
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,800
In the mortal realm,

331
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,320
I read many stories.

332
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
I tried all the methods

333
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,040
with which those ladies
successfully hurt those childes' feelings,

334
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,520
but His Majesty still loved me dearly.

335
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,440
Now I failed not only His Majesty,

336
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,960
but General Ye.

337
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,240
You failed His Majesty for Emperor Dong Hua's sake.

338
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
What about General Ye?

339
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,280
Actually, we know nothing about

340
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,520
human love in the mortal realm.

341
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,400
But love is a sin.

342
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,680
Meeting and departing are uncertain.

343
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,920
Perhaps, meeting with you

344
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
is a misfortune for him in his life.

345
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,400
Fine.

346
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
I'll keep you company a little longer.

347
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,080
Well,

348
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,760
this is for you.

349
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,760
What's this?

350
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,080
If His Majesty really wants to kill you,

351
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,520
it can relieve your pain when you go back to the Sky Kingdom.

352
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,480
What did you just say?

353
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,080
Say it again!

354
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,720
Mother, I beg you

355
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,720
to spare Xiaojiu's life.

356
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,200
She betrayed you,

357
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,720
but you still want to protect her.

358
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
Are you out of your mind?

359
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,280
Let me ask you.

360
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,800
How are you going to do with them?

361
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,840
Xiaojiu was brought back by me.

362
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,360
She doesn't belong to the imperial palace.

363
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,200
Just remove her title

364
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,520
and demote her to a civilian.

365
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,760
Let her go back to normal.

366
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,640
What about Ye Qingti?

367
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,640
You also want to spare him, right?

368
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,760
General Ye has fought battles for our State.

369
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,400
Though he has made a big mistake this time,

370
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,760
the Ye family is loyal and many of its members died as martyrs.

371
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,320
Old General Ye was killed
in the battlefield to protect the late Emperor.

372
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,080
Ye Qingti is the only descendant of the Ye family.

373
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,840
Just take back the General's Mansion.

374
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,360
Order the Ye family to move back
to their ancestral home to mourn for their ancestors.

375
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,440
Never shall they return to the capital.

376
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,680
Nor shall any member of the Ye family
be appointed as an official.

377
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,680
Song Xuanren! Song Xuanren!

378
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,080
When sister was carrying you,

379
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
she told me that

380
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,080
she had prayed to God every night,

381
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,280
hoping that her child could be kind.

382
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,400
But unexpectedly,

383
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,200
your kindness has made you so weak

384
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,880
and easily bullied!

385
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,080
Ye Qingti shall be spared

386
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,440
for the sake of his ancestors,

387
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,120
but what about that woman?

388
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,840
She has disgraced not only you,

389
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,240
but the entire State of Chengyu.

390
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,200
I must kill her!

391
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,320
Mother!

392
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
What's the point of killing her?

393
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,360
Please spare her life.

394
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,960
If you let her live,

395
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,320
you're asking me to die!

396
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,160
Just leave.

397
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,160
I won't.

398
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,280
Mother, if you don't promise to spare her life,

399
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I won't get up.

400
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
You!

401
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,280
Good for you!

402
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,720
You're actually on your knees for a woman!

403
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,920
Fine!

404
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,800
If you want to kneel down, so be it!

405
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,680
Damn it!

406
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,080
What's wrong?

407
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,960
Something's wrong.

408
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,000
Your Majesty!

409
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,320
Your Majesty!

410
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,840
Bad news!

411
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,920
It's an emergency!

412
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
Send all the Imperial Guards

413
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,960
to the gate of the imperial palace.

414
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,360
Don't let them break in!

415
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,080
Get out of the capital now and transfer some forces

416
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,880
to reinforce the imperial palace directly!

417
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,560
But General Ye was in charge of dispatching forces.

418
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,640
Now you're in charge!

419
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,800
Yes!

420
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,760
Why did they break in so fast?

421
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,720
I heard that an enemy agent has sneaked into the imperial palace.

422
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
Release General Ye from the prison

423
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,680
to guard the capital!

424
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,320
Yes!

425
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,280
Report!

426
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,480
What now?

427
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Your Majesty,

428
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,560
word just came from the prison that

429
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,680
Madam Jiu asked to see you.

430
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,400
Did she say why?

431
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,000
Having heard an outburst of civil stifle,

432
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,320
Madam Jiu insisted on seeing Your Majesty.

433
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,640
General Ye, please.

434
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,240
General!

435
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,600
Where are the Imperial Guards?

436
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,400
They're all out guarding the capital!

437
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,800
What's up?

438
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,320
Your Majesty,

439
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,760
I heard today that enemy troops are invading the capital.

440
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,000
Though I don't know the details,

441
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
I do know that

442
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,560
Your Majesty must be deeply troubled.

443
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,280
Then thanks for your care.

444
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,760
Your Majesty, I have a request to make.

445
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,080
Go ahead.

446
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,600
I know I've committed a deadly sin

447
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,160
and got General Ye into trouble,

448
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,160
but right now,

449
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,880
I beg Your Majesty to put the State first

450
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,560
and release General Ye,

451
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,670
so that he can protect thousands of civilians in the capital.

452
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,960
So you have me here

453
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,670
to intercede for him.

454
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,400
No,

455
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,520
it's not for him,

456
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,230
but for thousands of civilians,

457
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,880
for the State of Chengyu,

458
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,320
and also,

459
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,710
also for you.

460
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
Enough!

461
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,000
Your Majesty,

462
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,360
Unblessed and ill-fated as I am,

463
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,120
I don't deserve

464
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,190
everything you've done for me.

465
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,840
I know I shouldn't ask any favor

466
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,040
from Your Majesty now.

467
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,400
I'm willing to die to atone for my sin.

468
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,710
Please spare General Ye's life

469
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,360
and let him fight the enemy troops.

470
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,560
Your Majesty, thank you!

471
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,080
Come with me.

472
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,560
The show is finally on.

473
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,040
Your Highness,

474
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,920
it's time for us to move.

475
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,880
Imperial Guards!

476
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,920
Guard the capital with your lives!

477
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,120
Yes!

478
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,280
Charge!

479
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,320
Charge!

480
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,280
Your Highness!

481
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,920
I'm here to take the Lingbi Stone at His Majesty's bidding.

482
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,120
Let us in now!

483
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,560
Your Highness,

484
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,520
His Majesty ordered that

485
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
unless he's here in person,

486
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,880
no one is allowed in.

487
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,320
This is...

488
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,040
It leads to the outside of the imperial palace.

489
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,800
I'll send you out.

490
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,760
Wait!

491
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,920
What's up?

492
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,120
Your Majesty, something's wrong.

493
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,840
Just think about it.

494
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,240
Why do the enemy troops invade so smoothly?

495
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
All signs indicate that

496
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
there's a spy inside the imperial palace.

497
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,240
But I think

498
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,200
it's not that simple.

499
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,160
Given what Chu Wan did,

500
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,240
plus the current riot,

501
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,800
all these might be set up by the State of Chong'an

502
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,640
to steal the Lingbi Stone.

503
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,360
Yang Shun.

504
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,160
Yes!

505
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,440
Find General Ye now!

506
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,560
Ask him to lead two thousand picked troops
to the Emperor's Tomb immediately.

507
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,400
Ask him not to get too involved in the war.

508
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,360
Yes!

509
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,920
Follow me!

510
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,760
Go!

511
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,320
Go get it.

512
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,200
Emperor Dong Hua!

513
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,400
It's you!

514
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,360
You're also here!

515
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,240
The imperial palace is about to be destroyed,

516
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
and your men are about to be wiped out.

517
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,160
Yet, you still can't let go of the Lingbi Stone.

518
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,440
You colluded with the enemy troops.

519
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Now you even want to steal the Lingbi Stone?

520
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,440
No.

521
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,400
You not only want the Lingbi Stone,

522
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,240
but the throne.

523
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,240
Yes!

524
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,680
You're right.

525
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,920
I'll take both of them today.

526
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,120
The State of Chengyu is supposed to be mine.

527
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,880
So is the Lingbi Stone.

528
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,280
Why should I steal them?

529
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,720
Speaking of stealing,

530
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,320
it should be you.

531
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,440
Song Xuanren!

532
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,120
What're you talking about?

533
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,840
In the imperial palace,

534
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm your elder brother.

535
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,840
Your mother died,

536
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,400
so my mother becomes your mother.

537
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,720
She's favored you all the time since childhood.

538
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,680
She even forgets that

539
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm her natural son.

540
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,640
How come you were made the Crown Prince at birth?

541
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,360
Why do father and mother

542
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,920
favor you all the time?

543
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,320
I've done so many things and tried so hard,

544
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,360
but they just don't see it.

545
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,600
In their eyes,

546
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,160
I'm just a loser.

547
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,520
But you,

548
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,880
Song Xuanren,

549
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,480
when you were born,

550
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,360
strange celestial phenomenon appeared and your own mother died.

551
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,680
Your birth

552
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,480
would actually bring misfortune to the State of Chengyu.

553
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,080
I brought misfortune?

554
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,320
You colluded with the State of Chong'an

555
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,920
and destroyed our capital.

556
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,320
Which one of us

557
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,880
actually brought misfortune to the State of Chengyu?
