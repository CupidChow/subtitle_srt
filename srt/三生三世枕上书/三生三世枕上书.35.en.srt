00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 35

3
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,820
You're awake?

4
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,900
Do you feel uncomfortable?

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,140
His Majesty!

6
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,300
How come he treats me so gently?

7
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,860
It must be a dream.

8
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,660
Since it is a dream,

9
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,540
I can take this advantage to fulfill
some of my unrealized dreams.

10
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,580
His Majesty is surprisingly real

11
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,700
in the dream.

12
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,700
This is unbelievable!

13
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,860
Do you need me to teach you

14
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,860
how to inhale and exhale at this time?

15
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,220
This has always been the custom in Qingqiu.

16
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,060
Don't be such a bumpkin

17
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,420
and judge me!

18
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,020
You are just

19
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,380
a thirty-thousand-year-old little fox.

20
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,620
Do you really know such custom?

21
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,500
Anyway,

22
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
as a locally born and bred fairy,

23
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,460
I don't even know

24
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,460
what type of custom that is.

25
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,780
His Majesty can't know it either.

26
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,860
Did you just breathe?

27
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
It's a big taboo in Qingqiu.

28
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,460
A cousin of the grey wolf next door

29
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,940
got disengaged by his fiancée

30
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,860
because of this.

31
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,580
It's something disrespectful.

32
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,940
This custom is pretty interesting.

33
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,900
I have never tried it.

34
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,180
It's pretty good

35
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,660
to follow the Qingqiu custom.

36
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,220
That's very shameful of you to say so!

37
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,980
Do you still remember

38
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,740
who embraced first?

39
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,420
Eh...

40
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,820
Admittedly...

41
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,380
Admittedly, it was I who embraced first,

42
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,060
but this is nothing but my dream.

43
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,460
I can do whatever I want.

44
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,260
You are just my imagination.

45
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,940
I can take advantage of you if I like to,

46
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,380
but you can't do otherwise.

47
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,860
There isn't any rule to follow

48
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,100
in my dream anyway,

49
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
so don't reason with me.

50
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,060
My words are the only rule.

51
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,220
So you take this as a dream!

52
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,700
I was wondering

53
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,100
why you became so open all of a sudden

54
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,340
and

55
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,180
didn't get mad.

56
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,300
What do you mean?

57
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,900
Isn't this a dream?

58
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,420
Where am I?

59
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,620
Why would I be mad?

60
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,900
Did I really

61
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
take advantage of you?

62
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,460
Do you still remember

63
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,340
what were you doing before you fell asleep, Xiaobai?

64
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,740
I seem to have lost the memory.

65
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,820
Your hands are so cold.

66
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,420
Are you afraid?

67
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,140
What is there to be afraid of

68
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,020
while I'm here?

69
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,980
You just lost your head from too much sleep.

70
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,260
It happens if you sleep too much.

71
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,940
Do you remember what happened lately?

72
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,580
I don't think it matters

73
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,540
if you lost your memories of everything.

74
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,300
Since

75
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,460
you're not my dream,

76
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,900
this is not the Sky Kingdom either.

77
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,140
So

78
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,660
why are you here with me

79
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,940
as this is not the Sky Kingdom?

80
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,860
And,

81
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,140
how did you get an injury?

82
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,660
Where are we?

83
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,940
It's nothing, Xiaobai!

84
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,420
This place is called the Dream of Aranya.

85
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,580
Do you remember

86
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,540
when you left Tai Chen Palace?

87
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,900
Isn't it a few months before

88
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,980
you married Her Majesty?

89
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,780
She only has the memory

90
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,340
as the spiritual fox in the Sky Kingdom.

91
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,900
That's why she didn't get mad at me.

92
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,300
This is much easier for me.

93
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,260
The Dream of Aranya

94
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,740
can disturb the memories of the severely injured.

95
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,300
The severely injured?

96
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,500
Am I injured again?

97
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,620
What's the Dream of Aranya for?

98
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,700
This is a ward

99
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,900
similar to the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

100
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,980
Yan Chiwu trapped me here.

101
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,260
You worried about me,

102
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,020
so you hurried here to save me.

103
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,300
Yan Chiwu is too powerful.

104
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,220
He trapped you twice!

105
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,940
And he trapped you too!

106
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,500
We couldn't get out of here

107
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,420
and have to stay.

108
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,980
Why is he

109
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,500
so malignant?

110
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,740
So,

111
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,180
how come I don't have any memory

112
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,140
of the part he trapped you again

113
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,940
and I rushed to save you?

114
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,940
Because you slept too much, Xiaobai.

115
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,780
Don't you always come to save me

116
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,020
when I get trapped?

117
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,420
You do know I am that little fox.

118
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,340
Why do you come to know now?

119
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,020
It's my fault.

120
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,620
No big deal anyway.

121
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,460
You had been good to me

122
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,860
before Ji Heng came to the Tai Chen Palace.

123
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,620
You became bad to me

124
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
only after Ji Heng came.

125
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,300
Don't be bothered by that.

126
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,380
Ji Heng

127
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
is the one you love.

128
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,020
But I am nothing more

129
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,420
than a spiritual pet

130
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,380
in the Tai Chen Palace.

131
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,180
I scratched her

132
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,340
and you imprisoned me as a consequence.

133
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,140
That's nothing wrong actually.

134
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,260
It doesn't matter

135
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,860
that you didn't come to see me.

136
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,900
You were preparing for the marriage to Ji Heng.

137
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,980
That involves a lot of red tape

138
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,940
and rituals.

139
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,540
I'm just fine that

140
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,420
you forgot about me at the time.

141
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,900
You need to mind least of all

142
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
for the incident that

143
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,700
your favorite spiritual pet lately almost killed me.

144
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,260
Now

145
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,940
I've figured out a set of logic

146
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,940
to understand it.

147
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,300
If I had let Chong Lin

148
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,460
arrest me that day,

149
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,780
this incident would not have happened.

150
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,300
I can't blame everyone and everything but myself.

151
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,540
It's all destined anyhow

152
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,100
that all the bad luck would fall on me.

153
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,380
Maybe, god wants to use

154
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,860
all the sufferings I had in your palace to show that

155
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,580
our destinies are not tied at all.

156
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,740
So,

157
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,220
I just...

158
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,620
Xiaobai,

159
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,300
so what do you want to do?

160
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,740
It's been an hour since Xiaobai woke up.

161
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,860
She lost all her cultivation

162
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,780
after falling into the Dream of Aranya

163
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,140
and recovered from the primordial spirit injury

164
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,580
with my supply of blood three times a day.

165
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
Her body is still pretty weak.

166
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,580
Even if I make a recovery seal

167
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,540
with my own spiritual power,

168
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,060
Xiaobai's body must be put in it

169
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,580
within two hours

170
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,540
after she wakes up

171
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,380
so that it can work effectively.

172
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,660
The seal is a good place for recovery,

173
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,540
but it's improper to keep the primordial spirit
in there for a long time.

174
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,820
For Xiaobai's case,

175
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,780
it's best to put her primordial spirit

176
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,260
into the body of local clans

177
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,060
so that it can absorb some vitality all the time.

178
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,580
As for the Dream of Aranya,

179
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,220
no hurry to get out of it.

180
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,420
Xiaobai hates me in her heart now.

181
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,460
But there is only one hour left

182
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,260
before putting her into the recovery seal

183
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,860
and she has only one hour to hate me.

184
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,900
It's a waste to everyone

185
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,660
to go through the last hour.

186
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,180
What's up, Your Majesty?

187
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,780
Why do you look so worried?

188
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,260
Xiaobai,

189
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,180
actually, we're already married.

190
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,540
Married?

191
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,300
How is that possible?

192
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,900
Why is that not possible?

193
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,660
Why don't I remember that at all?

194
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Because

195
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,500
you're amnesiac.

196
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,900
I said you slept too much just now

197
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,660
because I was worried you'd be afraid after knowing this.

198
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,100
But in fact,

199
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,460
you're amnesiac.

200
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,780
How unlucky I am!

201
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,380
But how could I have promised the engagement?

202
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,540
I...

203
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,060
Because you liked me, didn't you?

204
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,660
However, it can't be this reason.

205
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,180
If this is the reason,

206
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,500
then what I did before was...

207
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
That's only one of them.

208
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
The major reason is

209
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,140
I kneeled down to beg for your forgiveness.

210
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,180
You...

211
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,340
You kneeled down in front of me?

212
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,500
Why do you marry me?

213
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,340
Did you do something to me already

214
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,860
so you had to?

215
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,380
What about your love, Ji Heng?

216
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,420
Ji Heng?

217
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,540
Why do you think like that?

218
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,700
Ji Heng and I are not in the same age.

219
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,260
There is nothing between us.

220
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,020
Then,

221
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
I...

222
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,580
Actually,

223
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,700
this is still a dream.

224
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,940
I'm not having a dream.

225
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,540
Then we're indeed engaged.

226
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm more and more confused about this.

227
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,100
I have more questions to ask.

228
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,940
If as you said we're already married,

229
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,260
how did my father

230
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,140
come to accept it?

231
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,140
My father has always been

232
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,940
a very earthly immortal.

233
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,340
You are not from a powerful family,

234
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,940
nor do you have any power in hand.

235
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,060
They should not consider you

236
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,180
as the son-in-law.

237
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,420
Qingqiu has such a rule

238
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,660
to choose a son-in-law?

239
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,380
I didn't know that.

240
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,940
Maybe Bai Yi thought even though

241
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,540
I don't have the so-called promising future,

242
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,100
I kneeled down for you

243
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,540
which showed the uprightness and loyalty in my personality

244
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,940
and made myself pathetic, so he accepted it.

245
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,420
Uprightness and loyalty?

246
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,100
Did my father say that?

247
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,860
He also thinks you're pathetic?

248
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,820
Qingqiu has always been soft-hearted

249
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,220
and easily become merciful.

250
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,500
That's true.

251
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,220
It looks like you are indeed not bluffing.

252
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,020
So I am already married with you.

253
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,460
However,

254
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,900
Your Majesty,

255
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,060
other than kneeling down,

256
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,180
you must have done something more humiliating, haven't you?

257
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,580
Don't you cheat on me

258
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,420
just as I no longer remember it.

259
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,580
It's such an underestimation

260
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,300
that you'd think mere kneeling

261
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,540
can make me come round.

262
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,620
I don't believe that.

263
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,100
What should I do

264
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,540
to make you understand it, Xiaobai?

265
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,700
His Majesty must become shy

266
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,940
as he starts to ask me rather than answer my questions.

267
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,900
Anyway,

268
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,620
he must have done a lot of things outside the box

269
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,460
to get me back.

270
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,060
He just doesn't want to recall them now.

271
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,020
What do you want me to do, Xiaobai?

272
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,940
Well,

273
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,140
I heard that

274
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,780
opening of chest can best prove

275
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,620
how a person loves the other.

276
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,460
My aunt told me

277
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,300
chest opening is very popular in the mortal realm

278
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,780
to show your love to someone.

279
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,100
Nothing is more sincere

280
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,820
as the mortal dies once the chest is opened

281
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,260
and death can show their high ideal.

282
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,260
The ideal has to be loyal and thus trustworthy.

283
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,820
Anyway,

284
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,740
this is just for saying,

285
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,060
as you suddenly asked me

286
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,380
what I want you to do.

287
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
I just speak as my mind goes.

288
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,500
That's just a lead-in.

289
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,580
If I really have anything that needs your help,

290
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,340
I'll write that down

291
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,980
and redeem it with you afterwards.

292
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,700
We're engaged anyway.

293
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,140
No worries for that.

294
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,620
Fine!

295
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Let's keep it on record!

296
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,300
Come to me whenever you want.

297
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,780
Your hands are so cold.

298
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,940
I've put nerve soothing incense into this heating stove.

299
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,620
It's good for sleep.

300
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,300
We're indeed engaged.

301
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,420
His Majesty accepted whatever I said today.

302
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,660
And he added incense to my heating stove.

303
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,660
Even the red rain is not this hardly attainable.

304
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,820
Enjoy the heating!

305
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,980
I wanted to know what kind of incense you added.

306
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,860
I don't think

307
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,260
that's what you are thinking.

308
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,380
So it is this!

309
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,380
I... I wasn't thinking about this.

310
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,140
I was thinking that

311
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,900
since we're married,

312
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,980
I should never have been the one to kiss you proactively.

313
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,220
Your Majesty must have taken the initiative

314
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,340
because

315
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,740
I'm a restrained person.

316
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,820
Well said.

317
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,140
I did take the initiative.

318
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,740
When you recover after a few months

319
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,100
and get out of the seal,

320
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,020
will your chaotic memory get corrected

321
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,220
and you hate me more when you recall this?

322
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,060
Xiaobai,

323
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,340
what should I say to cheer you up by then?

324
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Will this really work?

325
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,180
We have no solution

326
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,140
other than waiting.

327
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,340
The risk is unpredictable

328
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,500
to save someone in the Dream of Aranya.

329
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,300
There once was a god

330
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,940
casting a strong spell in it.

331
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,700
No one ever got rescued out of it.

332
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,220
Instead, the ward was broken.

333
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,580
The god and the person to be rescued
all ended up going to the netherworld.

334
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,340
Though His Majesty has enormous magic power,

335
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,300
the Dream of Aranya

336
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,580
doesn't accept great magic power

337
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,940
to work against it.

338
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,100
They've been there for quite some hours.

339
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,860
I'm worried that

340
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,100
His Majesty and Jiuge

341
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,260
may have ended up in disaster.

342
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,140
Whatever happens,

343
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,100
His Majesty will surely protect her.

344
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,500
You protect the Dream of Aranya

345
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,780
like a soft-shelled egg

346
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,020
that allows no touch.

347
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,620
In my opinion,

348
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,620
since every way is ominous,

349
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,380
we might as well smash it with a hammer

350
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,020
so that we can see whether they're still alive.

351
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
The ice face is useless

352
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,140
except his strong magic power

353
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,380
which can be used to protect Xiaojiu

354
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
when the dream breaks.

355
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,900
He has lived for so long anyway.

356
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,140
A few years less

357
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,020
means nothing to him.

358
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,060
Compared with being trapped in the dream,

359
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,820
this idea sounds feasible

360
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,540
even though it's a long shot gamble.

361
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,220
I'm also sort of interested

362
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,940
as to whether the Dream of Aranya

363
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,060
can trap His Majesty!

364
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,020
In all, you have no solution to it.

365
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
Gods like you

366
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,020
are never helpful.

367
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,340
So you have any solutions?

368
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,500
I...

369
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,460
I don't have either.

370
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,060
Yan, where are you going?

371
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,380
Finding out solutions.

372
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,340
Stay obedient while you're here!

373
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,820
I'll return your primordial spirit

374
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,180
after some time.

375
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,860
Dong Hua!

376
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,100
Are you sick?

377
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,740
Which medicine in Fanyin Valley

378
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,540
can match the god's blood?

379
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,540
Let me save you.

380
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,980
Where is this place?

381
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,980
Your Highness!

382
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,500
Your Highness Aranya, you finally wake up!

383
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,980
I'm so scared.

384
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,860
Who are you?

385
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,620
I'm Chacha!

386
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,540
Your Highness Aranya, you've been sleeping for quite a long time.

387
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,980
Aranya?

388
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,460
Go to fetch the porridge in the kitchen

389
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,660
for Her Highness now.

390
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,020
They call me Aranya.

391
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,220
Is my name Aranya?

392
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,460
Why don't I have

393
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,380
any impression

394
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,980
about what happened before?

395
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,500
No impression either

396
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,860
to these people

397
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,900
or this place.

398
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,740
Who is Aranya?

399
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,460
-Your Highness! -Who am I?

400
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,020
Your Highness!

401
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,660
Your Highness, are you alright?

402
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,580
You've been sleeping for so long

403
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,820
that you must be hungry.

404
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,500
This is abalone lotus seed cubilose porridge

405
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,740
made just now by the kitchen.

406
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,180
Please take some, Your Highness!

407
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,740
Put it here!

408
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,820
I'm not so hungry now.

409
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,980
Leave me please!

410
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380
I'll let you know if I need your help.

411
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,540
Yes!

412
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,820
The infant in my dream just now

413
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,180
must be Aranya.

414
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,220
But who is the youngster?

415
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,580
Gosh!

416
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,700
What crime on earth did I commit?

417
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,940
Why don't I have any memory at all?

418
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,880
Aranya

419
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,940
The demons have been silent for more than a century.

420
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Is the demons' gathering

421
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,700
still necessary?

422
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,020
Your Highness,

423
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,100
you said we can make peace through intermarriage

424
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,900
when we started war against the gods.

425
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,900
But what now?

426
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
Intermarriage is screwed.

427
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,700
Even the princess is gone.

428
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,580
Stop talking!

429
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,380
Is that for you to say?

430
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,300
OK. I'll stop!

431
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,340
But why is Demon Lord Yan

432
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,220
missing for so long?

433
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,900
I suppose his Qingxuan Hall

434
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,300
is covered by weed now.

435
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,180
Speaking ill of me?

436
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,700
Aren't you afraid

437
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,660
I'll cut your tongue off?

438
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,500
Yan Chiwu,

439
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,700
where have you been?

440
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,660
Xu Yang, I found Ji Heng now.

441
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,980
She's trapped in Fanyin Valley.

442
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Fanyin Valley?

443
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,980
Why is she there?

444
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,540
She is poisoned by Qiushui Cold Toxin.

445
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,620
Emperor Dong Hua

446
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,140
put her there to rehabilitate.

447
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,300
Before her rehabilitation, she couldn't get out.

448
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,060
Emperor Dong Hua put her there?

449
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,220
Yes!

450
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,220
Only Emperor Dong Hua can take her

451
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,700
to a place as bad as that.

452
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,100
Ji Heng's toxin can only be detoxicated

453
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,020
in the Fanyin Valley.

454
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,780
Now Dong Hua and Fengjiu, the Princess of Qingqiu,

455
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,180
are both trapped in the place called Dream of Aranya.

456
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,860
It's unknown whether they can get out or not.

457
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,780
Ji Heng is so heart-broken

458
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,580
that she insisted on staying there with Dong Hua!

459
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,340
Come with me to get Dong Hua out!

460
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,060
Ji Heng will be assured that way.

461
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,540
Demon Lord Yan,

462
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,380
where did you say they are?

463
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,820
The Dream of Aranya.

464
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,820
Really?

465
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,340
Is that true?

466
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,100
I witnessed Dong Hua

467
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,660
walking in without his magic power.

468
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,220
It's unknown whether he is alive or not.

469
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,940
Even so,

470
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,860
it's a great chance given by god

471
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,940
to the demons.

472
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,020
Great!

473
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,220
It's been over a hundred years

474
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,740
since anything fresh happened.

475
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,900
We should take this chance

476
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,780
to sabotage the gods.

477
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,500
Without Emperor Dong Hua,

478
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,820
I think

479
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,300
they should be very worried.

480
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,980
I promised Min Su

481
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,020
to set Ji Heng free.

482
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,220
Demon Lord,

483
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,260
this is a very rare opportunity!

484
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,140
Don't be worried.

485
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,540
The demons have been idle for so long.

486
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,580
If we really start war with the gods,

487
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,740
how much possibility of winning

488
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,940
do you think we have?

489
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,580
How much possibility of winning?

490
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,300
I want you to rescue someone

491
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,780
not to take advantage of a perilous state.

492
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,380
Have you forgotten the dignity of the demons?

493
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,180
Dignity means nothing now.

494
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,220
Just chill!

495
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,300
Just think that

496
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,380
it's still unknown if Emperor Dong Hua will come back.

497
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,500
We'll conserve strength and store up energy now.

498
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,100
If he really doesn't return,

499
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,460
we'll announce war by then.

500
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,860
Announcement of war

501
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,060
is nothing small.

502
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,500
Let's discuss that later.

503
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,940
Yes!

504
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,540
There you come!

505
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,340
Nie Chuyin pays respects

506
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,620
to Your Majesty!

507
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,220
Enough!

508
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,340
Why do you come to me today?

509
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,820
Yan Chiwu's said that

510
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,100
Emperor Dong Hua is trapped in the Dream of Aranya.

511
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,420
Your Majesty,

512
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,620
this is the perfect chance for you to break the seal.

513
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,100
What did you say?

514
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,500
What happened to Dong Hua?

515
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,860
I said

516
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,740
Emperor Dong Hua is

517
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,820
in the Dream of Aranya in Fanyin Valley.

518
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,660
No wonder I feel my power increased greatly the other days.

519
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,340
It's because you entered the Dream of Aranya.

520
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,860
Dong Hua,

521
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,540
I'll never let you get out alive.

522
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,140
Everything here looks so strange.

523
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,140
Forget it.

524
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,380
I think I have to ask the guy up there

525
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,820
and get out alive anyhow.

526
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,540
Sit down!

527
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,740
Sit down now! I need to ask you something.

528
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,620
What is this?

529
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,700
This is lily cake which you like most.

530
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,580
So I like lily cake most?

531
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Yeah!

532
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,900
What's up, Your Highness?

533
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,300
Nothing!

534
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,620
I just want to see

535
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,220
if you understand me best.

536
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,660
Let me test you again.

537
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,940
What liquor do I like best?

538
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Lotus Dew!

539
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,980
If you get some of my questions right

540
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,820
in future,

541
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,780
I'll give you rewards.

542
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,580
Thank you!

543
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,900
Do you have any other questions?

544
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,060
Why don't you ask altogether?

545
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,340
How greedy you are!

546
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,940
I've rewarded you already!

547
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Stay content!

548
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,620
Aranya must not have stuck to the trifles in usual

549
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,020
and treated her maids pretty well,

550
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,180
otherwise Chacha

551
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,300
wouldn't have dared to speak to me like that.

552
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,300
Come with me to check out on that side.

553
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,220
Why don't you come?

554
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,100
Your Highness,

555
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,300
it's getting late. You should take shower now.

556
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Time for shower?

557
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,420
Fine! Let's get back to the room.

558
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,500
It's actually good to be served with shower.

559
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,100
Chacha, what is that?

560
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,780
Snake oil.

561
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,420
Snake oil?

562
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,740
You have told me before that

563
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
bathing with this snake oil

564
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,300
refreshes the body and drives away dampness.

565
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,860
So you require this to be added

566
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,700
whenever you take shower.

567
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,020
My gosh!

568
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,860
However wrong I am,

569
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,700
you can't torture me like this.

570
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,060
I'm most afraid of snakes.

571
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,060
The 20 years of cultivation is done.

572
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,140
How are you,

573
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,180
Aranya?

574
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,740
Sleep here in future.

575
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,500
Don't sleep on the grassland.

576
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,100
Even though you grew up in the snake nest,

577
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,780
you're not a snake.

578
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,180
You're the princess of the inseparable king birds,

579
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,580
so you must have a name.

580
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,140
Now that your parents didn't give you a name,

581
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,340
let me give you one.

582
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:31,340
Aranya!

583
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,860
This is your name.

584
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,620
If I say these three characters in future,

585
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,700
it means I'm calling you.

586
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Understood?

587
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,540
Aranya.

588
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,980
I'm Shen Ye,

589
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,340
your cousin.

590
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,820
You are Aranya,

591
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,340
Xiangli Aranya!

592
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,260
Aranya!

593
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,060
Aranya!

594
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,180
In a few days, I'm going to start
a long-term cultivation in reclusion.

595
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,820
It has been delayed over and over again,

596
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,740
but it can't be escaped after all.

597
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,420
I must fulfill the duty as an archmage.

598
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,060
Aranya,

599
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,740
after I leave,

600
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,700
no one will be here to take care of you.

601
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,100
If you are hungry,

602
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,780
eat the fruit of the Solanum pseudocapsicum.

603
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,340
If you're thirsty, take the water of Jieyou Spring.

604
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,500
Don't live on snake blood any more.

605
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,700
Do you understand?

606
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,340
I'll be back for sure.

607
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,980
I'll come to save you

608
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,100
when I become the archmage.

609
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,420
Aranya,

610
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,620
I am your only relative.

611
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,900
They may have abandoned you,

612
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
but you have me.

613
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,620
Cousin, wait!

614
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,260
Cousin, are you still busy with the affairs from the palace?

615
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,220
And have you met Aranya?

616
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,460
Last time I was playing with Sister Junuo in the garden,

617
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,180
she wanted to play with us.

618
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,900
Aranya?

619
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,220
She is back?

620
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,100
Don't you know about that?

621
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,740
Father intended to betroth Aranya

622
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,940
to Lord Xi Ze

623
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,380
in the hall today.

624
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
What?

625
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,820
She will marry to my master?
