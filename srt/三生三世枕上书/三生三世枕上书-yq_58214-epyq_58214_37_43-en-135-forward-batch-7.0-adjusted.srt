00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 43

3
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,820
It's just a meal.

4
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,660
Why do you have so many dishes prepared?

5
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,860
Your Highness, you have been badly injured

6
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,180
and shed a lot of blood.

7
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,020
I'm so worried about you.

8
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,740
I hope you can get more nutrition.

9
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,100
Your Highness, let me serve you.

10
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,740
Don't bother. It's okay.

11
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,540
I just need more practice.

12
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,540
Your Highness.

13
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,380
Moye.

14
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,700
Why are you in a hurry?

15
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,660
Is there anything urgent?

16
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,260
Lord Xi Ze

17
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,900
asked me to go to Qi Nan Palace at once.

18
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
Xi Ze?

19
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,700
What happened?

20
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,740
Here is the thing.

21
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,420
Dong Hua asked me to go there in the early morning,

22
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,660
so I come here

23
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,380
to give this to you.

24
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,260
These are letters I mentioned last time.

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,140
Aranya wrote them to Shen Ye.

26
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,820
These days,

27
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,380
I've copied some of them.

28
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,940
What?

29
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,500
You've copied them out?

30
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,860
Here is the thing,

31
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,380
I copied

32
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,260
some letters in Aranya's handwriting.

33
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,460
Others

34
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,940
were just copied out

35
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,060
in my own handwriting.

36
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,300
Now that Dong Hua wanted to see me soon,

37
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,340
I have to leave the rest to you.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,620
Okay.

39
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,460
Moye, you're really my bosom friend.

40
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,940
What I hate most is writing.

41
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,180
Remember.

42
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,500
Every two or three days,

43
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,460
send a letter to the Mengchun Courtyard.

44
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,060
No problem.

45
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,100
Okay.

46
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,860
I have to rush to Qi Nan Palace.

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,260
I'll leave it to you.

48
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,100
Your Highness,

49
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,860
be more careful when you read these letters.

50
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,580
What if others find it out?

51
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,220
Right. Thanks for reminding me.

52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,620
Put them away.

53
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,300
Okay.

54
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,900
Take care. I'm leaving.

55
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,620
I heard you just moved to the Mengchun Courtyard,

56
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,540
so I wrote this letter to greet.

57
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,900
I once stayed in the yard for three years.

58
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,060
I was afraid nobody would go there

59
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,220
so that the beautiful view could be wasted.

60
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,100
Now that you're there,

61
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,780
I feel much relieved.

62
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,580
Luckily, Moye gave these letters to me

63
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,020
in advance.

64
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,820
Since I'm not Aranya,

65
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,420
it would be impossible

66
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,900
for me to write such letters.

67
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,380
I like to enjoy tea and make wine in my spare time.

68
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,300
When I was living there,

69
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,740
I buried some good wine in the yard.

70
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,860
The plum wine under the Mid-Lake Pavilion is the best.

71
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,980
It's a pity I don't have a chance to enjoy it.

72
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,580
I want to send it to you.

73
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,020
You may feel sad when you're alone.

74
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,980
I hope the wine can help you forget bad moments.

75
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,540
Wen Tian.

76
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,100
Wen Tian?

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,900
Did Moye get it wrong?

78
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,980
Isn't it a letter

79
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,740
for Shen Ye from Aranya?

80
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,340
Why is it Wen Tian?

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,140
Your Highness.

82
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,740
How is it going?

83
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,460
Your Highness,

84
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,020
for the several days since Shen Ye moved in,

85
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,540
he has never stepped out.

86
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,900
He ate little.

87
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,980
It seems he's a little upset.

88
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,900
Did the food not agree with his stomach?

89
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,380
You told us to take care of him,

90
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,900
so I asked people from the Qi Nan Palace about his taste.

91
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,740
All dishes were cooked

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,620
according to his flavor.

93
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,380
Got it.

94
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,780
Maybe Shen Ye

95
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,420
hasn't got used to the life here.

96
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,020
How about showing him around?

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,300
Don't let him shut himself in the Mengchun Courtyard all day.

98
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,820
Got it.

99
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,820
Oh.

100
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,820
Take this letter to Shen Ye.

101
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,900
Don't say anything

102
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,020
if he asks where it is from.

103
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,140
I see.

104
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,020
Aranya wrote these letters to comfort Shen Ye

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,380
when she knew he was in a bad mood.

106
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,620
She must've

107
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,540
been in deep love with him.

108
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,100
Those who fall in love may all do similar things.

109
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,260
Back then, to save His Majesty,

110
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,940
I even gave my fur

111
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,340
to Nie Chuyin.

112
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,780
Your Excellency.

113
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,220
Thank you.

114
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,180
Why does she still write letter to me?

115
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,500
We've been in the dream for a long time.

116
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,740
Xiaobai is finally back.

117
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,300
Your Majesty,

118
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,580
I've got a question for you.

119
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,660
Go ahead.

120
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
How did you and Fengjiu

121
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,940
fall into the Dream of Aranya together?

122
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,100
Is Fengjiu your...

123
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,060
I know what you want to ask.

124
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,340
You're right.

125
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,500
I like Xiaobai.

126
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,980
You're so straightforward.

127
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,020
Because I've missed much.

128
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,660
I don't want to miss her anymore.

129
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,380
Xiaobai said

130
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,740
you told her that

131
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,340
she had to experience the whole life of Aranya

132
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,540
to get out of the dream world.

133
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,460
To be honest,

134
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,700
I've never been to the Dream of Aranya.

135
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,580
It's just a guess.

136
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,500
It's also the only way I can figure out.

137
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,660
But I found the dream world is extremely dangerous.

138
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
What will happen is unpredictable.

139
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,860
Besides,

140
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,660
Xiaobai got injured for Aranya.

141
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,980
Her unrecovered primordial spirit was seriously damaged again.

142
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,740
Your Majesty,

143
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,500
Fengjiu got badly injured

144
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,540
because of my negligence.

145
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,540
Please punish me.

146
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,020
I couldn't control

147
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,180
what Xiaobai will go through.

148
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,220
So,

149
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,620
I have to make her primordial spirit recover soon

150
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,940
and leave here with her.

151
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,940
You're right.

152
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,420
I asked you to be here

153
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,700
because I need you to help me with something.

154
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,420
I'll do anything as you say.

155
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Okay.

156
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,020
I'm making a magic instrument.

157
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,780
It's delayed since I need to look for some materials.

158
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,220
With the instrument, I can know Aranya's previous life.

159
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,060
We'll know how to get out of here

160
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,780
when we find out how it was created.

161
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,220
I need you to give me a hand.

162
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,180
I'll try my best.

163
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,860
Good.

164
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,540
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,180
Your Majesty.

166
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,700
Please tell me

167
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,700
the secret of the Dream of Aranya.

168
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
If Emperor Dong Hua can't come out,

169
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,340
Lian Song won't let us go.

170
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,900
And Meng will go into the dream world.

171
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,460
By then it'll be too late.

172
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,500
The Dream of Aranya is a taboo in our clan.

173
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,300
It's about the royal family's reputation.

174
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,820
I'll never tell anyone about it.

175
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,300
Jielu, as a member of the royal family,

176
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,660
you broke the rules on purpose. You're doubly guilty.

177
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,860
Your Majesty, it's not the right time

178
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,300
to consider the reputation.

179
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,300
Nothing is more important than life.

180
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,300
If you want to punish me,

181
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,780
just do it and I won't complain.

182
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,740
Please tell me the secret of the Dream of Aranya.

183
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,540
Just kneel here if you want.

184
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,420
Stay here and think about

185
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,260
what's the most important for the royal family.

186
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,340
All of you can go back now.

187
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,980
You don't need to stay here.

188
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm worried about Ji Heng,

189
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,860
so I'm going to the Yulin Courtyard.

190
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,260
I'll be here if I can be of any help.

191
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,340
The imperial palace never needs me.

192
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,660
I'll worry too much if I go back there.

193
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,380
It's better to stay here.

194
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,180
I'll keep a distance from you

195
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,340
if you think I'm bothering you.

196
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,340
Never mind.

197
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,820
Xiaojiu is lucky

198
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,060
to have a good friend like you.

199
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,700
From tomorrow on, you don't need to make this for me.

200
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,460
See?

201
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,220
My hand is getting better.

202
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,500
Your Highness,

203
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,620
Lord Shen Ye has got a better appetite

204
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,420
in the past two days.

205
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,140
He also went to the Mid-Lake Pavilion.

206
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,820
It seems he feels much better.

207
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,220
Your Highness,

208
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,620
Lord Shen Ye asked me

209
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,180
to hand this letter over to Wen Tian of the imperial college.

210
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,220
Wen Tian?

211
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,540
Yes.

212
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,780
Give it to me.

213
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,540
That letter

214
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,580
was written to him

215
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,100
in the name of Wen Tian.

216
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,140
Don't tell him about it.

217
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,940
Don't let him know.

218
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,500
Keep it a secret.

219
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,100
Got it.

220
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,100
Your Highness,

221
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,620
what did Lord Shen Ye write in his letter?

222
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,020
Nothing special.

223
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,180
Just some words to express his gratitude.

224
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,460
Give this letter to Shen Ye.

225
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,660
Your Highness, you're amazing.

226
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,460
You've even prepared a letter in reply.

227
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,900
Just a coincidence.

228
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,300
This morning,

229
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,420
I thought of some good books

230
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,100
in the Mengchun Courtyard,

231
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,380
so I recommended them

232
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,100
to him to kill time.

233
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,220
You care about Lord Shen Ye so much.

234
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
I'll do all I can

235
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,780
to take care of him.

236
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,980
You may leave now.

237
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,220
Got it.

238
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,060
Your Highness,

239
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,140
you're so nice to Lord Shen Ye.

240
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,340
He's our guest.

241
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,660
We should be thoughtful.

242
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,260
Don't make that again.

243
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,460
Wen Tian.

244
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,700
Wen Tian really exists.

245
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,420
The handwriting is the same.

246
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,940
And even the content has no difference.

247
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,060
But why?

248
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,700
That day on Lingshu Stage,

249
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,420
you said those words to me

250
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,700
as if you were an onlooker who had known the truth.

251
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,020
Are you Aranya or not?

252
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,820
Aranya even set up a puzzle

253
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,980
for Shen Ye to solve.

254
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,980
She has good taste in art.

255
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,980
I didn't expect she's even expert at playing chess.

256
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,180
I have a headache at the sight of the chessboard.

257
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,660
Your Highness,

258
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,660
this is a letter from Lord Shen Ye.

259
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,860
Chacha.

260
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,820
Shen Ye said

261
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,100
he saw a few interesting travel notes

262
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,060
in the study of the Mengchun Courtyard.

263
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,460
Do you know where they are?

264
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,660
You mean

265
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,580
those travel notes you like very much?

266
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,900
I remember

267
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,700
they're put on the bottom shelf.

268
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,940
Why did he mention the travel notes suddenly?

269
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,980
I didn't mention anything about them

270
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,500
in my previous letters.

271
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,780
Is it possible he happened to find them

272
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,100
when he tried to get something to read

273
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,980
and he thought they were interesting after reading?

274
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,540
Maybe.

275
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,180
Oh.

276
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,980
Give this letter to the steward

277
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,660
and ask him to take it to the Mengchun Courtyard.

278
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
Yes, Your Highness.

279
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,380
Judging from the letters,

280
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,140
Shen Ye and Aranya have the same interests.

281
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,100
Oh no.

282
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
I've sent almost all the letters copied by Moye.

283
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,860
What should I do next?

284
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,740
I have to learn to imitate her handwriting.

285
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,380
Mr. Su.

286
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,420
Where is Aranya?

287
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,900
She asked me to send a letter.

288
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,900
She's in the yard.

289
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,100
Your Highness.

290
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,580
You scared me.

291
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,540
You scared me.

292
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,140
How is it going?

293
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,660
How many letters have you sent?

294
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,500
I've sent all letters copied by you.

295
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,580
Well.

296
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,660
You've made no progress on your handwriting.

297
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,420
Didn't you

298
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,860
need to practice calligraphy in Qingqiu?

299
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,220
Yes, I did.

300
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,740
It's...

301
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,220
It's because I injured my hand.

302
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,100
Aranya is the one who got injured.

303
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,900
Your hand is in good condition.

304
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
Alright.

305
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,980
Why are you back?

306
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,700
Where is His Majesty?

307
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,540
Well.

308
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,900
He's making a magic instrument.

309
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,860
I'm back to get some necessary materials

310
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,580
and look you up.

311
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,900
That'd be great.

312
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,740
Help me with these.

313
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,940
I can't stay for long this time.

314
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,260
I'm afraid there is not enough time.

315
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,540
Well.

316
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,620
You shouldn't be that lazy.

317
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,540
Oh.

318
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,740
How is it going with Shen Ye?

319
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,700
Have you met each other?

320
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,340
Speaking of him,

321
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,700
he's really a weirdo.

322
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,660
Since he moved to Mengchun Courtyard,

323
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,500
he's never stepped out of

324
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,740
that place.

325
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,740
But,

326
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,540
why is it Wen Tian's signature

327
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,020
in Aranya's letters to Shen Ye?

328
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,460
Who is Wen Tian?

329
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,900
She's

330
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
a teacher of the imperial college

331
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,740
who once lived in the Mengchun Courtyard.

332
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,180
At that time,

333
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,260
Aranya thought Shen Ye wouldn't read those letters

334
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,860
if he knew she wrote them,

335
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,780
so she wrote the letters in Wen Tian's name.

336
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,820
That explains it.

337
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,260
She had to write letters in another woman's name.

338
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,220
Aranya was really humble in the relationship.

339
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,540
If I were her,

340
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,340
I'd speak everything out.

341
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,420
In that way, there might be a slim chance.

342
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,740
Aranya

343
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,300
was not overcautious,

344
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,260
but she was afraid

345
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,620
Shen Ye would think it was out of sympathy,

346
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:30,980
so

347
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,300
she maintained

348
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,780
Shen Ye's dignity with great care

349
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,420
like that.

350
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,620
Aranya really had given much thought to it.

351
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,100
Later, I asked her to make a decision

352
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,260
and told him she wrote those letters,

353
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,420
but unexpectedly,

354
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
she chose to

355
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,500
let the real Wen Tian meet Shen Ye.

356
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,860
Did Wen Tian show up?

357
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,020
Yeah.

358
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,860
A lot of things happened between them later.

359
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,500
Moye,

360
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,820
I thought

361
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,500
Aranya was stronger than me

362
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,580
and she was more big-hearted.

363
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,420
But I didn't expect she'd been so pitiful.

364
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,500
She was in love with Shen Ye silently,

365
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,340
but he never knew about that.

366
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,900
Yeah.

367
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
But trust me.

368
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,860
I'll help her achieve her aim

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,620
and take good care of Shen Ye.

370
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,900
Oh.

371
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,380
Shen Ye would send you some wine in a few days.

372
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Don't forget

373
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,340
to find a chance

374
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,060
so that Wen Tian and Shen Ye can meet each other. Got it?

375
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Your Highness.

376
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,540
You may leave now, Chacha.

377
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,540
He solved the puzzle so quickly.

378
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,260
And he gave one back.

379
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,460
Aranya,

380
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,860
you were so careful and humble in the relationship.

381
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,180
And you didn't dare to tell Shen Ye how you felt.

382
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,140
The only thing I can do

383
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,700
is to tell him your true feelings.

384
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,300
Time flies.

385
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,020
This has already been the 18th letter.

386
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,380
It's time to get the wine.

387
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,460
Aranya,

388
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,700
this is the good wine you mentioned in your letter.

389
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Gather frost-dyed berries to brew wine.

390
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,660
Store it underground for three seasons.

391
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,540
Then dry Fujiezi collected in autumn over a fire

392
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,180
before immersing it in the wine for half a month.

393
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,660
In this way, the wine will get the fragrance
of the herbal medicine.

394
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,620
After that, seal the wine again
and put it underground for two years.

395
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,700
Yeah.

396
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,660
It's time for me to send you some wine.

397
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,620
Your Highness, another letter from Lord Shen Ye.

398
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,820
What's that?

399
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,260
This is the wine.

400
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,060
Lord Shen Ye asked me to bring it to Ms. Wen.

401
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,380
Put it on the table.

402
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,100
Lord Shen Ye even knows how to make wine.

403
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,180
Shen Ye began to

404
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,380
write longer and longer letters.

405
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,580
He must be in a better mood.

406
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,940
Your Highness,

407
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,580
Lord Shen Ye looks the same as before,

408
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,100
but I guess he's in a better mood.

409
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,420
He plays chess, makes chess playbooks,

410
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,820
or goes to the Mid-Lake Pavilion.

411
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
That's good.

412
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,220
Chacha.

413
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,300
Is there a teacher called Wen Tian in the imperial college?

414
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,140
I remember

415
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,380
she once lived

416
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,100
in the Mengchun Courtyard, right?

417
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,780
Exactly.

418
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,900
Invite her to come here.

419
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,220
Got it.

420
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,620
It's getting

421
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,700
more and more boring.

422
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,020
I wonder how His Majesty is doing.

423
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,500
Oh.

424
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,340
Your Highness, what's up?

425
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,300
Chacha, I need to go out.

426
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,700
Your Highness, where are you going?

427
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,780
Stay out of it.

428
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,620
Invite Wen Tian to my mansion now.

429
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,660
Got it.

430
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,660
So much honey.

431
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
I wonder which kind His Majesty likes.

432
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,180
How are you, young lady?

433
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,340
How are you?

434
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,380
Come have a look. Which kind do you like?

435
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,300
The green one.

436
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,900
The yellow one and the red one.

437
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,180
Put the three of them in one jar.

438
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,220
Okay!

439
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,740
And that one.

440
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,660
The yellow one.

441
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,740
Okay.

442
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,620
Thanks.

443
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,140
Chacha, I'm back.

444
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,940
Your Highness, you're back.

445
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,740
Ms. Wen Tian has been waiting for you for so long.

446
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,020
Rise, please.

447
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,540
What's in your hands?

448
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,380
I found this chess playbook in the study

449
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,380
and was going to take it back and study it.

450
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,060
I met Chacha on my way

451
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,620
and she said you wanted to see me.

452
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,580
Did you have dinner?

453
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,740
Not yet.

454
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,980
Take it.

455
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,180
Have dinner with me.

456
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,780
This way.

457
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,500
To be honest,

458
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,180
I invite you here today

459
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,060
because I want to ask you to do me a favor.

460
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,700
Your Highness, just tell me.

461
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,380
Since that thing happened to Junuo,

462
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,900
Shen Ye has been staying

463
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,420
in my mansion.

464
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,620
Entrusted by someone

465
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,380
to take good care of him,

466
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,740
I've been communicating with him

467
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,860
through letters,

468
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,540
in the name of you.

469
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,860
Do you mean

470
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,940
you wrote letters to Lord Shen Ye

471
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,060
and signed yourself "Wen Tian"?

472
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,140
Yes.

473
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,420
You must know that

474
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,780
there has been bad blood between him and me.

475
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,380
I was afraid he'd be more resentful

476
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,620
if he found I wrote the letters,

477
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,700
so I did it in your name.

478
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
I see.

479
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,940
I admire you for your kindness.

480
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,180
It's just there have been so many things to deal with recently

481
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,660
that my strength doesn't equal to the will.

482
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,220
And I don't want to let down the one who entrusted me with it,

483
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,420
so I wonder

484
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,300
if you can take it over

485
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,020
and look after Shen Ye for me.

486
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,220
You did me a lot of favors.

487
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,700
Of course, I'll help you in return.

488
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,020
Can you tell me what I should say in the letters?

489
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,380
There is nothing special.

490
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,380
You just need to share with him

491
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,020
some interesting things in daily life.

492
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,740
I wrote these letters

493
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,340
to Shen Ye

494
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,780
in your name.

495
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,340
I've copied them out for you

496
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,220
lest Shen Ye finds anything wrong.

497
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,740
I have to emphasize

498
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,100
one more thing.

499
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,140
Please imitate my handwriting

500
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,740
when you write him letters

501
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
to avoid giving the game away.

502
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
Please trust me.

503
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,340
It's not hard for me.

504
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,540
I'll count on you.

505
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Your Highness,

506
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,980
why did you suddenly want to make sugar figurines?

507
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,460
I promised Xi Ze

508
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,020
to make him some other day.

509
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
I'm free today.

510
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,580
So I have made these sugar foxes.

511
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,140
You're really quick-witted and nimble-fingered.

512
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,620
I didn't know

513
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,260
you can even do that.

514
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,500
These sugar foxes are so cute.

515
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,500
Really?

516
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,300
Do you think he'd like it?

517
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,460
Trust me.

518
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,740
His Excellency likes

519
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,220
everything you make.

520
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,300
Alright.

521
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,420
Then,

522
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,540
I'll give Xi Ze ten.

523
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,740
These are for my master.

524
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,380
I'll give him five.

525
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,940
As for the rest...

526
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,540
Oh.

527
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,380
Shen Ye sent me some wine the other day.

528
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,900
It's impolite not to reciprocate.

529
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,420
I'll give him five.

530
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,940
Your Excellency, you've got a visitor.

531
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,900
Come in.

532
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,460
Your Excellency. Mr. Su.

533
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,260
What's up?

534
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,300
Her Highness Aranya

535
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,540
asked me to take this to you.

536
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,660
Mr. Su,

537
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,260
this is for you.

538
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,900
Why...

539
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,700
Why does he have ten

540
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,060
and I have only five?

541
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,340
Did you eat on the way?

542
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,580
Mr. Su, you got me wrong.

543
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,740
Her Highness told me clearly

544
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,620
His Excellency has ten

545
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,460
Mr. Su has five.

546
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,980
I am going.

547
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,740
Come on, Your Majesty.

548
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,580
Don't be so mean.

549
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,580
It's not as good as God Zhe Yan's wine,

550
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,900
but I've never

551
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,980
drunk such refreshing wine

552
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,860
since I left Qingqiu.

553
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,180
Lord Shen Ye, why are you here?

554
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,180
What wine were you drinking?

555
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,820
I've been unoccupied these days,

556
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,780
so I...

557
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,660
Your Highness.

558
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,180
Your Highness.

559
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,540
I think I lost my chess playbook

560
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,260
in your place today.

561
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,940
Wen Tian, it's a good timing.

562
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,420
Let me introduce you to him.

563
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,180
This is Lord Shen Ye.

564
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,700
Lord Shen Ye, this is Wen Tian.

565
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,420
She used to live in the Mengchun Courtyard.

566
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,700
Nice to meet you, Your Excellency.

567
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,420
The wine has strong delayed effect.

568
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,660
I feel dizzy.

569
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,380
I must go. See you.

570
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,940
Your Highness.

571
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,100
Your Highness.

572
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,380
Lord Shen Ye and Wen Tian

573
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,900
wrote a few letters to each other.

574
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,180
Ms. Wen sent him two small gifts.

575
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,020
One is a straw white-headed sparrow

576
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,260
and the other is an embroidered pendant with auspicious patterns.

577
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,820
Lord Shen Ye sent her two books in return.

578
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,140
Their relationship is moving so fast.

579
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,780
They even began to send each other tokens of affection.

580
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,860
Where are they?

581
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
I think they're playing chess by the river.

582
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Leave them alone.

583
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,460
Got it.

584
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,620
She pushed her beloved away

585
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,860
to another woman like that.

586
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,020
If she were more fearless

587
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,020
and dared to tell him her true feelings,

588
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
would they have a chance

589
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,500
to stay together?

590
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,020
I've changed my mind.

591
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,940
When the moon shines brightly in the sky

592
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,140
and the wind blows through the bamboo forest,

593
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,820
let's have a hearty drink

594
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,260
and forget all worries.

595
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,180
After today,

596
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,140
it'll be the time for us to fall out.

597
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,860
Xiangli Aranya.

598
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,740
= Xiangli Aranya =

599
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,060
You're the one who wrote those letters.

600
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,220
You lied to me and made a fool of me.

601
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,420
Do you think it's interesting?

602
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,980
You found it out so soon?

603
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,180
How did you know that?

604
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,940
Oh no. What a fool I am!

605
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,060
I could have denied it.

606
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,460
I wrote back to you

607
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,380
with sincerity.

608
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,980
Does it make you happy

609
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,460
to see me end up like this?

610
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,980
I'm sorry.

611
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,020
I didn't mean it.

612
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,660
How about having some tea?

613
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,420
Calm down. Take your time.

614
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,140
Actually, you shouldn't have thought like that.

615
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,100
How could I be happy by lying to you?

616
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,180
Fine.

617
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,620
I won't write letters again.

618
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,660
Okay?

619
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,340
What you said to me

620
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
on Lingshu Stage that day

621
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,860
was totally different from before.

622
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,780
Your response today

623
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,300
was also different.

624
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,380
I've never heard Aranya could make sugar figurines.

625
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,020
And I've never received sugar foxes.

626
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,980
What on earth is going on?

627
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,900
In this dream world,

628
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,740
nothing changed,

629
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,260
except you.

630
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,220
You've changed so much.

631
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,460
I didn't expect Shen Ye would be so angry

632
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,700
after finding out the truth.

633
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,620
It seems he's not

634
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,780
inconstant in love.

635
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,860
Something must've gone wrong.

636
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,620
I can't fall asleep anyway.

637
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,980
I'll go see what's happening in Mengchun Courtyard.

638
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,780
Why are birds twittering at night?

639
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,780
Your Majesty.

640
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,900
Xiaobai.
