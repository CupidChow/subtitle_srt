Episode 10

3
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Watch out.

4
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
General Ye.

5
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm fine.

6
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
His Majesty.

7
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,760
His Majesty.

8
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,360
Your Highness.

9
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
Your Highness.

10
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,040
You've saved me. Who are you?

11
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,840

General Ye.

34
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Your Highness.

35
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
How is your injury?

36
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
What about your eyes?

37
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm fine and my eyes aren't hurt.

38
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,360
Sit down.

39
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Your Highness, excuse me.

40
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,400
You have gone through so much

41
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,910
to protect me.

42
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,800
It's my duty to protect you, Your Highness.

43
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,760
Since I have such a loyal and brave general like you,

44
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,960
how come we can't resist foreign aggression

45
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,040
and protect our homeland?

46
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,760
General Ye,

47
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,720
please accept my bow for saving my life.

48
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,800
Please don't, Your Highness .

49
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,760
Even if I sacrificed my life for Your Highness,

50
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
Qingti would have nothing to regret for.

51
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,600
I owe you a life.

52
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
We are brothers from now on.

53
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,760
As long as I, Song Xuanren, am alive,
you, Ye Qingti, will be fine.

54
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,840
Your Highness.

55
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,920
Si Ming hasn't lied to me.

56
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,680
I didn't expect that the backfire can be so strong.

57
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm fine.

58
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,360
I will be fine with careful nursing.

59
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,560
As long as His Majesty is safe.

60
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,720
You've saved me. Who are you?

61
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Jiu.

62
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Have you found him, Qingti?

63
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
Your Highness,

64
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
each battalion has inspected its troops and reported the list.

65
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,680
But it's a pity that

66
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,560
there's no soldier named Jiu on the list of survivors.

67
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
The battle was harsh.

68
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm afraid he might be...

69
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Jiu is agile

70
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,080
with great Kung Fu.

71
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,960
He could protect himself in the battlefield.

72
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,200
Qingti,

73
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
he has saved my life.

74
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,440
You have to find him.

75
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes, Your Highness.

76
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,560
Your Highness,

77
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,800
the Crown Prince has come back in triumph,

78
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,560
and arrived at the entrance of the city gate.

79
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,120
The battle with the State of Chong'an

80
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,120
was fierce and caused many casualties.

81
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,560
How come he's still alive?

82
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,280
I heard the Crown Prince was almost killed

83
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,840
by the sword of the Great General of the State of Chong'an.

84
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,920
But it's lucky that there was a soldier
who blocked the sword for the Crown Prince,

85
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,280
which saved his life.

86
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,840
It's really lucky of him, isn't it?

87
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,440
Father,

88
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,240
I have no idea what Your Majesty convenes me for.

89
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,840
It was a great triumph.

90
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,920
Thanks, father.

91
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,880
Although our State of Chengyu has won the victory

92
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,880
in the battle between the two countries,

93
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,440
we still suffered heavy casualties.

94
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,880
This is your first battle.

95
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm so delighted

96
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,200
with your great performance.

97
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
But now

98
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,920
I'm not as healthy as I used to be.

99
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,440
There's one important thing that I have to entrust you with.

100
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,720
What's it, Father?

101
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,560
You come to the Emperor's Tomb with me tomorrow.

102
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
Yes. As you command.

103
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,320
Father.

104
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,520
Father,

105
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,200
what's wrong with you?

106
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm fine.

107
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,880
I know how I am.

108
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Let's go.

109
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,040
I'll lead you to an important place.

110
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,840
Father, isn't it Lingbi Stone,

111
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,000
the national treasure of our State of Chengyu?

112
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,280
Yeah.

113
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
It's the legendary Lingbi Stone.

114
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,160
I heard when the State of Chengyu was originally founded,

115
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,000
our deceased grandfather led the army
to resist the strong enemies in the north.

116
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,680
When deceased grandfather was driven to the last ditch,

117
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,560
Lingbi Stone fell from the sky,

118
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,080
and saved his life.

119
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
Exactly right.

120
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
That year...

121
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,000
Your Majesty,

122
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,640
enemy reinforcements are pouring in,
and the military strength is becoming extremely unequal.

123
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,840
We can barely withstand.

124
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
General Ye has already led the troop
to break out of an encirclement.

125
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,600
We have to hang in there

126
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,720
to wait for the reinforcements.

127
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,400
Transmit my order. Fight till the very end.

128
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,880
Yes.

129
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,040
The deceased Emperor was blessed by it
to triumph over enemy troops that year.

130
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
Reinforcements arrived in time,

131
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,400
which made us win the great victory.

132
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,680
Our State of Chengyu was protected

133
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,920
from being subjugated.

134
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,160
It seems that folklore is slightly exaggerated,

135
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,320
but it still reveals part of the truth.

136
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,120
When the military returned to the country,

137
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,310
the stone was regarded as a national treasure,

138
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,440
and named Lingbi Stone.

139
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,000
After that, other countries dare not invade,

140
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,520
and our country witnessed decades of peaceful time,

141
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,240
which created enough time
for our State of Chengyu to revitalize itself.

142
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,160
To prevent other countries from coveting,

143
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,830
the deceased Emperor took the advantage
of constructing the Emperor's Tomb

144
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,880
to build the underground palace,

145
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,480
and hid Lingbi Stone here.

146
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
No wonder I haven't seen it before.

147
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,760
Lingbi Stone is the national treasure

148
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,680
that is closely related to
the life-and-death of the State of Chengyu.

149
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,240
Only can the emperors of each generation

150
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,280
know where the palace is located.

151
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,880
So I bring you here today

152
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,680
to tell you the secret.

153
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,320
And I'm about to entrust you with the important task

154
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,800
of protecting Lingbi Stone.

155
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,480
Xuanren,

156
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,720
as long as Lingbi Stone is here,
the State of Chengyu will be safe.

157
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,360
So you have to protect Lingbi Stone no matter what happens.

158
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,680
Don't worry, father.

159
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,560
I'll guard Lingbi Stone with my life.

160
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,800
It seems it's destiny.

161
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,360
Everyone, see.

162
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,360
Apocalyptic visions appear in the sky.

163
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,040
Isn't there anything important about to happen?

164
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Such apocalyptic visions.

165
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,760
It seems that the soul-locking jade
must be in the State of Chengyu.

166
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,920
Lady.

167
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,520
Sir.

168
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,000
Mr. Nie.

169
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Don't get up.

170
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,760
Please have a seat.

171
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,080
Have you felt well recently?

172
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,960
Thanks to the care of Brother Mang.

173
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,200
I've felt well recently.

174
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,000
Have you ever been reminded of anything?

175
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,080
I've been inspecting all around,

176
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,120
but no clues of your falling off a cliff are found.

177
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
And your disease...

178
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,520
My disease?

179
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,840
I've felt well these days
after taking the medicine you prescribed me.

180
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,600
Is there anything wrong with my disease?

181
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,160
You fell into a flutter the other day,

182
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
so I didn't tell you all the story.

183
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,200
Except for the injury due to falling off a cliff,

184
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,880
you're poisoned with something strange.

185
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,720
I've prescribed you with some kinds of herbal medicines,

186
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,440
but they work some times while don't at others.

187
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
What a shame on me!

188
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,640
I've promised to take good care of you,

189
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
but I neither find out your background

190
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,360
nor cure your disease.

191
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,000
Why do you say that?

192
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,040
You've saved my life.

193
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm the one who should be ashamed of

194
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,880
not being able to requite what you've done for me.

195
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,800
Life or death, it's my own destiny.

196
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
You don't have to concern yourself with it too much.

197
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
About my background,

198
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,760
you don't have to make efforts to inquire.

199
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,560
It seems I'm a negligible person.

200
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,720
Lady,

201
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,040
I've prescribed something new for you

202
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,280
that may have a better effect on your symptoms.

203
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Please have a try.

204
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,320
I feel really sorry to bother you so much.

205
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,560
In fact,

206
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,600
you don't have to spend so much time

207
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,640
on someone like me.

208
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,840
Sir,

209
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
what are you doing?

210
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,800
Why are you giving me such a big salute?

211
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
You say you're a negligible person,

212
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
but from my perspective,

213
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,320
you're someone extremely important.

214
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,000
If you're willing to do me a favor,

215
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,160
I would spare no effort

216
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
to repay your kindness.

217
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,760
Please stand up.

218
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
Why are you saying so?

219
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm the one who's supposed to
spare no effort to repay your kindness.

220
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,480
What favor do you ask of me? Feel free to spill it out.

221
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,000
I want to get a treasure,

222
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,720
and I need your help.

223
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,120
What kind of treasure do you want to get?

224
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,560
It's named Lingbi Stone,

225
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,440
which is the world-renowned national treasure.

226
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,440
To tell you the truth,

227
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,120
the treasure is the love token of my late father and mother.

228
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,240
My late father passed way in his early age,

229
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
and my family was in straitened circumstances,

230
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,720
so the treasure was lost.

231
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,480
My late mother always missed the treasure when she was alive.

232
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,320
But I was an unfilial son

233
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,600
who was unable to find the treasure,

234
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,920
which made my late mother die with great regret.

235
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,520
Later, I swore

236
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,080
to do my utmost to find the treasure,

237
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,720
and put it in front of the memorial
tablets of my late father and mother.

238
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,280
Lady,

239
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,560
if you can help me,

240
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,200
I will be truly appreciated.

241
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,560
Your great filial piety is really impressive.

242
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
I should help you out.

243
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,520
But

244
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,120
I have no idea

245
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
where Lingbi Stone is.

246
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,040
Lingbi Stone is in the territory of the State of Chengyu.

247
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,760
Then...

248
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,680
then how could I help you?

249
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,960
The State of Chong'an has put an official notice that

250
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,640
whoever can find the treasure

251
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,840
will be rewarded with twenty thousand taels of gold.

252
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
The national strength of the State of Chong'an is

253
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,480
far more than that of the State of Chengyu.

254
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,240
If we are able to

255
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,520
get the help of the State of Chong'an,

256
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,200
then twice as much can be accomplished with half of our effort.

257
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,440
It seems you have well prepared.

258
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,720
If only you help me,

259
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
it would work.

260
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,000
Rest assured.

261
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,560
I'll do my utmost.

262
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,240
Ren.

263
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,240
Father.

264
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
Ren.

265
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,600
You must keep what I've told you

266
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,760
in mind all the time.

267
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,960
Rest assured, father.

268
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,680
I'll do that.

269
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,320
Ying.

270
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,760
Father.

271
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,040
Ying,

272
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,720
you're the elder brother,

273
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,560
and you have to assist the Crown Prince with all your heart.

274
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,600
You have to keep our State of Chengyu

275
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,160
safe and peaceful.

276
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,560
I'll do my best.

277
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
Ren,

278
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:42,920
I can feel free to meet your mother in the heaven.

279
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
Hurry up, imperial physician.

280
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,480
His Majesty has passed away.

281
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,120
Father.

282
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,520
Minister Li.

283
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,920
Here I am.

284
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
You'll be in charge of funeral arrangements.

285
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,320
I'll obey your instructions.

286
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,720
Entitle Song Xuanying to King Ying,

287
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,000
and reward him with the King Ying's Residence.

288
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,280
Promote Consort Xian to the Empress Dowager.

289
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Thanks for your grace, Your Majesty.

290
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,600
The deceased Emperor has passed away.

291
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm about to renovate the Emperor's Tomb.

292
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,200
First, it is to comfort the deceased Emperor in the heaven.

293
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,320
Second, it is to show the fame of the deceased Emperor.

294
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,280
From now on,

295
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Great Minister of Public Works will be responsible for
arrangements of renovating the Emperor's Tomb.

296
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll obey your instructions.

297
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,520
I've just ascended the throne,

298
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,640
so I shall follow the rules made by the deceased Emperor.

299
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,520
The deceased Emperor advocated
industry and thrift when he was alive.

300
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,600
Except the funeral arrangements,

301
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,000
all other arrangements
in the imperial palace should be simplified.

302
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
The deceased Emperor was kind and considerate towards subjects.

303
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
So I'll proclaim a general amnesty

304
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,400
to show the name of the deceased Emperor.

305
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,920
Your Majesty is brilliant.

306
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,080
Your Majesty,

307
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,040
there was one talent calling himself Mr. Nie,

308
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,080
who came to my mansion yesterday.

309
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
He said he could get Lingbi Stone.

310
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,320
For sure?

311
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm sure.

312
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,360
Come on.

313
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,840
Summon him here.

314
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,040
Call Mr. Nie to report.

315
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,360
Your Majesty, I'm Nie Chuyin.

316
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Mr. Nie,

317
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,040
have you ever seen Lingbi Stone?

318
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,000
If I say I've seen Lingbi Stone before,

319
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
no one on site will believe in me.

320
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,320
But everyone here might have known

321
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,480
well of the legendary of Lingbi Stone.

322
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,040
Mr. Nie,

323
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,080
what's your advice? Spill it all out straight.

324
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,040
We can't take Lingbi Stone by force.

325
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,440
I have come up with an idea

326
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,280
that can make us get

327
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
Lingbi Stone without the cost of a single soldier.

328
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,840
Tell me more.

329
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
Each hero has failed to resist the temptation
of beauties since ancient times.

330
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,920
Your Majesty,

331
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,080
we can propose imperial matrimony.

332
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,320
it...

333
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Imperial matrimony... Imperial matrimony... It...

334
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,240
Imperial matrimony.

335
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,720
It's a good idea.

336
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,840
But which beauty can take such a great responsibility?

337
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,560
Your Majesty,

338
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,320
I have a foster sister to show you,

339
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
and you can decide

340
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,480
whether she can take the responsibility.

341
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,600
Summon the beauty here.

342
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,640
Summon the beauty to report.

343
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:18,800
She's coming.

344
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,200
It's true.

345
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,120
She's so gorgeous!

346
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,120
What a vision she is!

347
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,800
She is really a rare beauty.

348
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,120
I, Chu Wan, is bowing to you, Your Majesty.

349
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Head up.

350
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,160
Rise quickly.

351
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
Thanks, Your Majesty.

352
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Are you willing to accomplish the imperial matrimony

353
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
for the State of Chong'an?

354
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,200
It's my great honor to share your worries, Your Majesty.

355
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
Mr. Nie,

356
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
as far as you're concerned,

357
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,520
how could we get Lingbi Stone

358
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,120
by the imperial matrimony?

359
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,560
Your Majesty,

360
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,520
if you think my foster sister can take the huge responsibility,

361
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
how come you claim her to be your foster daughter,

362
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,720
and marry her to the State of Chengyu as a princess?

363
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,680
Then it'll be easier for her to collect information

364
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,840
about the stone in the imperial palace.

365
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,600
And I'll assist her by her side.

366
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,320
What do you think, Your Majesty?

367
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,360
Guards!

368
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
Capture the man.

369
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,800
- Yes. - Yes.

370
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,000
Your Majesty,

371
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,240
what do you mean?

372
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,920
Do you think

373
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,080
presenting an unknown woman to the State of Chengyu

374
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,920
would make them willing to

375
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,560
hand over Lingbi Stone?

376
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,080
It's so ridiculous.

377
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,480
I think you look like a spy from the State of Chengyu.

378
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,360
What's your intention?

379
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,920
How come our powerful State of Chong'an
can be manipulated by you?

380
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,560
Guards!

381
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,960
Take the man

382
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
to the prison.

383
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,920
- Yes. - Yes.

384
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,760
Outstanding appearance.

385
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,560
Tender and courteous. You're really a beauty of beauties.

386
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,240
If you follow what I've asked for now,

387
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,520
what about entitling you to Imperial Lady Li tomorrow?

388
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,400
Your Majesty,

389
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,520
let me go.

390
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,480
Your Majesty, conduct yourself well.

391
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,560
Beauty.

392
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,760
Since it's what it is,

393
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
I won't care for

394
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
the backfire anymore.

395
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,480
I haven't imagined that

396
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,840
Your Majesty has such a deep love for my foster sister.

397
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,920
How could you escape from prison?

398
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,960
I've told you before, Your Majesty.

399
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,640
Listen to my advice,

400
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
or you'll be regretful.

401
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,320
What I've prepared well is

402
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,520
to assist Your Majesty and the State of Chong'an.

403
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,200
Who on earth are you?

404
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,680
The one coming to help you.

405
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,360
Your Majesty,

406
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,080
if I promise you to bring Chu Wan back to life,

407
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,000
what would you say?

408
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,880
It's impossible.

409
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,120
How could the dead be brought back to life?

410
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,800
Fine.

411
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,680
If you show me how you

412
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,920
bring Chu Wan back to life,

413
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll believe in you,

414
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
and entitle you to Imperial Tutor.

415
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
Then please give me your hand, Your Majesty.

416
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,000
It's...

417
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,560
Your Majesty,

418
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,560
I hope you could make a right decision this time.

419
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,480
If Your Majesty thinks my foster sister

420
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,840
can take the huge responsibility,

421
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,360
how come you claim her to be your foster daughter

422
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,160
and marry her to the State of Chengyu as a princess?

423
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,320
Then she can search for the stone
in the imperial palace of the State of Chengyu.

424
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,200
And I'll assist her by her side.

425
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,480
What do you think, Your Majesty?

426
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,000
Chu Wan is gorgeous,

427
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,720
tender and courteous.

428
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,640
It's rare.

429
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,560
I'll claim you as my foster daughter,

430
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,280
and entitle you to Princess.

431
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
I'll select a fortunate hour and a lucky day

432
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,480
to send you for the imperial matrimony.

433
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,400
Thanks, Your Majesty.

434
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,000
Bow to you, father.

435
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
Rise, Princess.

436
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,200
Sir, you should be rewarded for the good idea.

437
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,400
I'll entitle you to Imperial Tutor of the State of Chong'an.

438
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,200
How...

439
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,000
how could it be?

440
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Thanks, Your Majesty.

441
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,280
Why could he be entitled to Imperial Tutor?

442
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
Thanks to all the generals and soldiers
fighting so hard at the front,

443
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,320
we have triumphed over the State of Chong'an this time.

444
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
Reward all according to their contributions.

445
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,280
Undertake the funeral arrangements
for those who have fought to death.

446
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,640
Cure those who are injured.

447
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,920
After they are cured,

448
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,920
allow those who can't fight for the country anymore

449
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,600
to go back to their home and treat them well.

450
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,560
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

451
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,630
Rise.

452
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,960
Ye Qingti, listen to the imperial edict.

453
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:46,360
Ye Qingti is brave and battlewise, and loyal to the Emperor.

454
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Entitle him to Shenwu General.

455
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,800
I take the edict and thank for the grace of His Majesty.

456
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,710
Have you heard something about the soldier named Jiu?

457
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,230
I'm guilty to let Your Majesty down.

458
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,120
I haven't found his trace yet.

459
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,190
General Ye,

460
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,840
spread my instructions to all

461
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,520
that I will handsomely reward

462
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,080
whoever is able to find Jiu.

463
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,400
Yes.

464
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,680
Rise.

465
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800
Your Majesty,

467
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
the State of Chong'an has sent a letter of credence,

468
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,480
saying that they intend
to send a beauty for the imperial matrimony.

469
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,520
What do you think of that, Your Majesty?

470
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,480
The Emperor of the State of Chong'an
wants to take the advantage of

471
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,720
the imperial matrimony to make peace.

472
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,280
What do you think of that, my deputies?

473
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,480
Your Majesty,

474
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,360
the State of Chong'an always has wild ambitions,

475
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,720
and has been coveting the territory of our country for long.

476
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,720
What they're intending won't be out of goodwill,

477
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,520
which can actually hide something dangerous.

478
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Your Majesty should be wary.

479
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,520
I don't agree with you, General Ye.

480
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,000
National strength of the State of Chong'an
is originally far beyond that of ours.

481
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,440
The territory of our country tends to be invaded by them.

482
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,880
Our people are homeless and have to suffer unspeakably.

483
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,080
The State of Chong'an is making overtures to us this time,

484
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,000
which might be a good opportunity
for the two countries to make peace.

485
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
General Ye, are you only

486
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,040
caring for the achievements you can make on the battlefields

487
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
but setting aside the safety of our people, aren't you?

488
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,320
What do you mean, Your Highness?

489
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Since the State of Chong'an has
invaded our territory over and over,

490
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,880
we can clearly see their wild ambition.

491
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,200
Now they were overwhelmed and in urgent need of time to recover,

492
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
so making overtures to us this time

493
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,520
might be their expedient.

494
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,000
What they really want is to throw off our guard.

495
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,320
Your Majesty,

496
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,200
I think what General Ye has said

497
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,080
does make sense.

498
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,160
Diplomatic relations between the two countries
should value peace the most.

499
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,920
We have won the victory this time,

500
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,360
but besides the wide disparity between the two countries,

501
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,960
we have already use up what's in the National Treasury.

502
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,760
We won't be able to survive one more time.

503
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
I hope Your Majesty could consider it thoroughly.

504
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,160
Exactly.

505
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,360
If we refuse the proposal of the imperial matrimony,

506
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
the State of Chong'an might be
furious and provoke the aggression again.

507
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,760
Then there's something I want to ask General Ye.

508
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Do you want your troops to fight on an empty stomach?

509
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,040
Do you think slavishly making overtures would make

510
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,880
the State of Chong'an let off us without a price to pay?

511
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,840
Because of the wide disparity between the two countries,

512
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,880
strengthening troops is our priority.

513
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,800
Stubborn head.

514
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,320
You...

515
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,040
Stop arguing.

516
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,080
I've already made my mind.

517
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,920
I agree

518
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,000
the proposal of imperial matrimony.

519
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Your Majesty.

520
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,600
General Ye,

521
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,680
there have been disputes between the two countries for years.

522
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
Innocent lives are killed.

523
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,400
I've had it on my conscience.

524
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,800
I'll follow the deceased Emperor
to implement benevolent governance.

525
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,240
I can't see my people suffer from
the pain of being homeless and separated

526
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,080
and live in the shadow of wars,

527
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,920
which has made them in a constant state of anxiety.

528
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,240
Since the State of Chong'an intends to make peace,

529
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,040
I have no excuse to refuse the proposal.

530
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,880
As for your strategy of self-strengthening,

531
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,200
I also agree with you.

532
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,880
You'll take charge of training troops.

533
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,320
Withdraw.

534
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,880
Withdraw.

535
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,560
Take care, Your Majesty.

536
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,080
Foster brother.

537
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,120
Foster brother, what's wrong with you?

538
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,720
I'm fine.

539
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,960
I'll be fine.

540
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,400
Why are you seriously ill in a sudden?

541
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,320
Foster sister,

542
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,000
I'll introduce someone to you.

543
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,720
I'm Ling Xiang, Your Highness.

544
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,920
Forego formalities.

545
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,360
She is...

546
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,160
She is...

547
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,320
Ling Xiang,

548
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,040
introduce yourself.

549
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:00,960
Yes.

550
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,120
My family was poor in those years,

551
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,280
and my father was seriously ill,

552
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,800
but we had no money to buy medicines.

553
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
I sold myself to save my father's life.

554
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,720
And it's lucky for me to meet Mr. Nie

555
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,960
who found good doctors to cure my father

556
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
and gave his all to help me.

557
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,840
My father was eventually cured.

558
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,000
I have to requite Mr. Nie

559
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,800
for what he has done for me.

560
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,000
My foster brother is a man of filial piety and chivalry.

561
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,520
He won't set aside someone who's in trouble.

562
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,680
Searching for the treasure this time

563
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,440
is to fulfill his mother's last wish.

564
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,640
What a pity!

565
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,840
I should have accompanied you

566
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,560
to search for the treasure,

567
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,400
but I haven't expected that...

568
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,760
Foster brother.

569
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,320
My old disease would recrudesce.

570
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,000
Ling Xiang is good at powerful Kung Fu.

571
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
She can protect you on behalf of me.

572
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,200
If something happens,

573
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
you can also discuss with her.

574
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,080
Ling Xiang is willing to help you.

575
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,040
Foster sister,

576
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
I've drawn a picture of the treasure.

577
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
You have to keep it properly.

578
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,160
If something dangerous happens,

579
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,880
just burn it down.

580
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Don't worry, foster brother.

581
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,480
Foster sister,

582
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,080
the path of searching for the treasure

583
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,720
remains ambiguous.

584
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,520
What you've done for the fulfillment of my wish

585
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,120
does impress me a lot.

586
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,480
Foster brother.

587
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,520
Foster brother, sit down and have a good rest.

588
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,720
Wait for my good news.

589
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,080
I'll do my utmost.

590
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,360
It'll be dangerous

591
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,160
on the way of searching for the treasure. Be careful.

592
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,560
Foster brother,

593
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,800
I'm leaving first.

594
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,480
Your Highness.

595
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,720
Your Highness is suffering from the pain of backfire.

596
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,920
Why do you try hard to transfer the appearance of Ling Xiang

597
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,520
to what Min Su looks like?

598
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,960
It will aggravate the pain.

599
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,960
The...

600
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,920
benefit of making Ji Heng work for me

601
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,320
will overwhelm the pain of backfire.

602
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,560
Transferring her appearance to what Min Su looks like

603
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,920
can ensure that Ji Heng who knows nothing about the truth

604
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,680
follows my advice.

605
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,760
Your Highness is so wise.

606
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,600
Your Majesty,

607
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,280
I come to report the progress of finding Jiu.

608
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:44,920
How's it going?

609
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,920
I've investigated the whole battalion thoroughly,

610
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,760
and I find three soldiers named Jiu.

611
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,440
But after investigation,

612
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,680
none of them is the one who saved Your Majesty the other day.

613
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,080
Besides,

614
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,480
none of those who were dead or injured

615
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
is named Jiu.

616
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,160
He isn't the soldier in our troops, is he?

617
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,640
Is he anyone who strayed into the battlefield?

618
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,840
Shall we expand the search

619
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,000
to find him all over the country?

620
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,080
Absolutely.

621
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,680
He is the one who has saved my life.

622
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,720
I have to find him out.

623
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,240
Ask painters to draw portraits according to this one,

624
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,880
and post them all over the country.

625
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,560
Make sure to find the person.

626
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,600
Yes.
