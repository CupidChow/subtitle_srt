1
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 9

3
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,480
How is the marriage? Finally you are back.

4
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Fengjiu has bullied

5
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,000
those youths that her aunts introduced

6
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
seriously.

7
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
Her aunts were so angry that

8
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,880
they went to tell her granny Madam Fu Mi.

9
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,920
You mean Fengjiu?

10
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

11
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,520
They said she had the good look in vain

12
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,880
without becoming

13
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,480
the queen spirit to fool with the male gods,

14
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,200
but playing with spears and swords every day.

15
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,560
Caring for nothing but eating and being lazy,

16
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
her attractive appearance is totally wasted on her

17
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,520
with self-abandonment.

18
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
They were so angry

19
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,480
that they beat their breast and stamped their feet.

20
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,600
How did her granny say?

21
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
Naturally she stood by Fengjiu,

22
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
blaming her aunts

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,120
and saying that the youths that they introduced

24
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,480
were not good enough.

25
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,720
Now she is thinking of

26
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,520
finding someone for Fengjiu by herself.

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
Probably, she wants to

28
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
find someone from a family holding high
official positions for at least three generations

29
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,120
with real power and handsome look.

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,800
He can't be a warrior.

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,600
Only in this way can he match with Fengjiu.

32
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,720
And their baby fox in the future

33
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,960
can be cleverer and cuter.

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
She won't disgrace the red fox clan

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,760
and nine-tailed white fox clan.

36
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,480
Only these requirements will make
most of the youth among the gods

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,160
lose the chance.

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,920
This is just some general requirements.

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,480
As for the details,

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
she will list them after she returns

41
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,360
and ask my father to help Fengjiu choose her husband carefully.

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a pity that they don't know

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,960
Fengjiu has chosen a perfect husband.

44
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Not exactly so.

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,880
Having forgotten most of them,

46
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,120
she is now as lively as before.

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,720
If she really forgets everything,

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,200
you won't see such a scene.

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
You know how difficult it is to make the peach blossom wine.

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,080
She has learned to make it day after day without rest and sleep,

51
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,640
and made lots of wine.

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,960
She is forcing herself to stop thinking of him.

53
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
As the only grandchild in the Bai family,

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
she is loved in every possible means.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,960
Why can't she have a happy marriage?

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Jingwei, don't complain to me any more.

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Did you hear what I said?

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,080
Got it, Sister Fengjiu.

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,720
Shall we go down the mountain by foot

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,400
or magic arts?

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,760
Someone is coming.

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,040
Xie Guchou.

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,400
Why are you here?

64
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Go back first.

65
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,840
You ask me to return alone again?

66
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
I will make bean paste cakes tonight.

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,200
I can leave two for you, OK?

68
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,240
OK.

69
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,720
Goodbye, Sister Fengjiu.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,280
Leave quickly.

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
Xie Guchou, why are you here to see me?

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,400
Qingqiu has good scenery.

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's walk around.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,480
Recently, there is something

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,800
that I think you should know.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,080
How could be there

77
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,920
anything in the haven and earth

78
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,240
that can baffle you, My Lord of Nether World?

79
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,360
People in the mortal realm have natural deaths.

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,560
As for the death of spirits, it only
has something to do with three gods.

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Lord of the Southern Dipper, Lord of the Northern Dipper

82
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,680
and Lord of the Nether World.

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
The Southern Dipper is in charge of living,
the Northern Dipper is in charge of death

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,520
and the Nether World is in charge of the imprisonment
and judgment of a person after his or her death

85
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,200
as well as a Yuanqi Terrace.

86
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
Only you can trouble others.

87
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,320
How could there be anything that can trouble you?

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,520
Are you still thinking

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,480
whether to tell it to me ?

90
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I know.

91
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,480
Maybe you want to talk about the wine that I will give you.

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,560
Don't worry.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
I've promised, of course I will give you.

94
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
Moreover,

95
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,240
it's Zhe Yan's peach blossom wine.

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,080
However,

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
Zhe Yan and my uncle

98
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,240
are angry with each other these days.

99
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,080
Nobody dares to get close to them.

100
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,200
Even I

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,160
also feel awkward.

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,680
It's about Emperor Dong Hua.

103
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,240
Maybe it's unknown among the people from heaven and earth.

104
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Perhaps the Southern Dipper and the
Northern Dipper haven't perceived it, either.

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
Just because I am in charge of Yuanqi Terrace,

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,920
I just perceived it.

107
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,040
Sorting out the Yuanqi Book,

108
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,440
I found there was someone in another world

109
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
who didn't have a marriage.

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
I went to check,

111
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,240
only to find he hadn't ever appeared in the six-realm encounters.

112
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,800
You know every living thing comes to this world

113
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,000
through the Yuanqi Terrance.

114
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
In order to change the fate without my permission,

115
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,800
only the past-life magic can help make it.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,640
In this world,

117
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,400
few people have such magic arts.

118
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
Among the gods, besides me,

119
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,760
only God Yun Zhuang can make it.

120
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,080
Tai Chen Palace?

121
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,200
Could it be...

122
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,320
It was said that His Majesty

123
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,160
asked to be born in the earth

124
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
because he wanted to experience
the eight sufferings on the mortal realm.

125
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,040
It's recorded in Si Ming's Book of Fate that

126
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,640
His Majesty will be born
on the mortal realm three hundred years later.

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
During these three hundred years,

128
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
he's cultivating peacefully in Tai Chen Palace.

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,480
While cultivating,

130
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,600
it's possible that he asks God Yun Zhuang

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
to play past-life magic on his shadow to make him

132
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
appear in another world and have experiences here.

133
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,040
Is it really His Majesty?

134
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,840
Since His Majesty concealed it to all the other gods,

135
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
it's likely that it's a secret.

136
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,200
I have considered for a long time to tell you this.

137
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,680
Do you know why?

138
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
It can't be that

139
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,840
you want to have one more pot of wine.

140
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,280
Why are you still behaving so strong-willed in front of me?

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,880
Many years ago, you invited me to drink wine.

142
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,080
When you were drunk, you told me His Majesty

143
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
ever saved you from the mouth of the tiger demon.

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,680
In order to repay his kindness,

145
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
you wanted to save him in Ten-evil Lotus Land,

146
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,040
only to be saved by him again.

147
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,600
In the end, you still

148
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
owe him the gratitude.

149
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,030
Do you want to find a chance to repay him?

150
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,520
I think it's the right time now.

151
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,360
Facing His Majesty's shadow

152
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,670
is better than facing himself.

153
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm afraid it's a little awkward

154
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,920
to return to Tai Chen Palace to see him.

155
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,360
You're different from before,

156
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
saying too much today.

157
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,720
You ever told me that

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,080
sorrow

159
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,440
would fade as time went by.

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,280
It can't make sense.

161
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Why?

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,880
Hundreds of years have passed,

163
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm still as sad

164
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,560
as I was then.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,840
That's because it's not long enough.

166
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,640
Actually,

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,960
His Majesty also did many things for me,

168
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,440
such as building a hexagon pavilion for me to enjoy the cool,

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
roasting sweet potato for me,

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
cooking sweet and sour fish for me

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
as well as binding up my wounds.

172
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,880
Is his kindness to you

173
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,240
so little?

174
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
What about those bad memories?

175
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,880
As for the bad memories...

176
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,720
Once I corrected the map of Lian Song's short knife.

177
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,640
Ji Heng said she corrected it.

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,760
I was so angry that I bit her.

179
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,060
You start biting people now?

180
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,520
His Majesty scolded me

181
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,360
and drove me out of the room.

182
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,440
What happened later?

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
Later,

184
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,120
I scratched Ji Heng and hurt her.

185
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,000
His Majesty locked me up.

186
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
Feeling that I was so poor,

187
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,760
Chong Lin let me out.

188
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,200
Unexpectedly, I met Ji Heng's pet.

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
It scratched me, hurt me

190
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,960
and threw me to the pond.

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,880
It was Si Ming who saved me.

192
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,600
Later

193
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,320
His Majesty would marry Ji Heng.

194
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,600
So I left the Sky Kingdom.

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
Actually,

196
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,480
Si Ming is right.

197
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,600
He said I had a great affection for His Majesty,

198
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,160
which was as deep as the sea.

199
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,120
I don't how deep the love is.

200
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,160
Compared to him

201
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,400
who is in a high rank honorably,

202
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,200
I'd rather that he is not so kind.

203
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
Then

204
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,400
only I myself

205
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,960
can feel his kindness.

206
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,120
Only I can love him.

207
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm sure to be kind to him.

208
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,520
As for your kindness to him,

209
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,720
he didn't know it in the past

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,160
and won't know in the future.

211
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
At that time, he was indifferent to you,

212
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,760
didn't you feel sad?

213
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,080
Of course I was sad.

214
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,800
I love His Majesty,

215
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,960
so I changed myself into a pet.

216
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,000
His Majesty would certainly regard me

217
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
as a pet.

218
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
As for pets,

219
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,600
sometimes, they are favored,

220
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,880
but sometimes, they're not.

221
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,120
When he was indifferent to me,

222
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
I was very sad.

223
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
Maybe in my heart,

224
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,680
I didn't regard myself as a pet.

225
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
You have been humble enough in front of him,

226
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,440
giving up your precious fur,

227
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,480
noble identity,

228
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,200
your family and friends for him.

229
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
You have done enough

230
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,920
to repay his kindness.

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,280
I give up them

232
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,640
just for my selfish desire.

233
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,040
It's not the same with repaying his kindness.

234
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,480
You're right.

235
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,800
As for His Majesty, it's just his shadow

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,440
that comes to the mortal realm.

237
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
I think it's a good chance.

238
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,680
Since His Majesty conceals it from other gods,

239
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,640
I won't ask him

240
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,240
where he is.

241
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Why not

242
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,720
take my shadow,

243
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,880
do the same to mine as His Majesty's

244
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,520
and make me born where he is?

245
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,320
I hope my shadow

246
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
can take the place of me to repay his kindness.

247
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,400
When he is in danger, I can save him.

248
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,880
As for anything he wants,

249
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,880
I can help him to get it.

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,800
You can help him get anything he wants?

251
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
What if he can't get what he wants in the end

252
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,800
and you can't repay his kindness?

253
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,280
Didn't you say that His Majesty would

254
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,360
go to the mortal realm by himself to experience
his misfortunes three hundred years later?

255
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,560
Then I will ask Si Ming clearly

256
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,720
where His Majesty is.

257
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
I think when I see him at that time,

258
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,160
I won't be as helpless as now.

259
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,760
OK.

260
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,280
Give me half of your shadow.

261
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,920
No matter you repay his kindness or not,

262
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,680
I will inform you at that time.

263
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
You Majesty, you're awake.

264
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
I cost most of my cultivation this time.

265
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
Next time before I go to the Miaoyi Chasm,

266
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,920
I need to go to another place to recover my cultivation.

267
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
Your Majesty, you mean

268
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,040
your experience in the mortal realm
should be brought forward, right?

269
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,360
But...

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,960
Through experiencing my misfortunes,

271
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,840
I can recover my cultivation as soon as possible.

272
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,160
Since you have made up your mind,

273
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
you must be careful with everything.

274
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,120
Chief Eunuch.

275
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,440
We have something important to tell His Majesty.

276
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,120
Wait a moment. I will go to report it.

277
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,800
Hurry up. Be careful.

278
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,960
Hurry up.

279
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,880
Hot water. Hot water.

280
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
Here it is.

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

282
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,120
My sister is sure to give birth to little prince safely.

283
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,960
Put in energy.

284
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,720
Hold on.

285
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
It will come out soon.

286
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,760
Change some hot water.

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,800
Quickly. Let me change it.

288
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,440
Hot water, hot water.

289
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,320
OK.

290
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,520
Chief Eunuch.

291
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,160
With flood in the south and drought in the north,

292
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,720
serious disasters are everywhere.

293
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
The wild is full of the dead bodies of the starved.

294
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,640
Chief Eunuch. Please inform His Majesty

295
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,160
to decide on a way to relieve the people in disaster.

296
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
It's...

297
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,880
The disaster can't be delayed,

298
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
but Her Majesty is giving birth now,

299
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
please

300
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,480
hold on for a moment.

301
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,720
A baby was born.

302
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,440
Well,

303
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
it's not a good sign.

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Your Majesty.

305
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,720
Congratulations! It's a little prince.

306
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,600
Good.

307
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,720
Fantastic!

308
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

309
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,360
Bad news.

310
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,960
Bad news. Your Majesty.

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,840
Her Majesty died.

312
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,160
Your Majesty, it's flooded in the south.

313
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,000
With continuous rainstorms,

314
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,800
many rivers have overflown.

315
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,440
Common people lost their homes.

316
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Your Majesty, there is drought in the north.

317
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
Canals and ditches is dried out.
The crops nearly have no harvest.

318
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,880
Grass and trees withered and died.
The wild is full of the dead bodies of the starved.

319
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,310
There are natural and man-made disasters everywhere.

320
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,240
The situation is dangerous.

321
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,830
Your Majesty. Please...

322
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,560
Well,

323
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,070
I see.

324
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
As for the flood in the south,

325
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,240
strengthen the dike,

326
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,840
dig ditches to shunt the flood.

327
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,760
As for the drought in the north,

328
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,720
draw the water between the mountains

329
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,760
and transport people to the places which have food.

330
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,320
Open the granaries in the north and south at the same time

331
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,080
to aid the common people.

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,880
Si Kou.

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,840
Relieve the refugees and punish the roving bandits.

334
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Yes. Your Majesty.

335
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,560
Si Kong.

336
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
Reduce the tax with grain supply.

337
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,280
Yes. Your Majesty.

338
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,600
Si Ma.

339
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm here.

340
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,840
Lead the soldiers

341
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,600
to save and help the common people.

342
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Yes. Your Majesty.

343
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,040
Please perform your own functions well.

344
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,840
Anybody who is against my orders

345
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,760
should be killed.

346
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm at your command.

347
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Your Majesty.

348
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,920
Leave.

349
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,400
Yes.

350
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,920
Your Majesty.

351
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,160
Grant the child a name.

352
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
Xuerong is kind and broad-minded.

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
Just call him

354
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,880
Xuanren.

355
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,800
Xuanren.

356
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,120
Song Xuanren.

357
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,360
Lord Cheng Yu.

358
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
How are you doing these days?

359
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
I'm fine.

360
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,480
Si Ming.

361
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,680
I have a friend who has cultivated to be a fairy recently.

362
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,840
She decided to go to Qingyun Hall

363
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,000
to pay a formal visit to His Majesty on the fifth of May.

364
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,720
However, there is news from Tai Chen Palace that

365
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,120
the ceremony this year has been canceled temporarily.

366
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,640
What's wrong?

367
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,040
Well.

368
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,400
I don't know.

369
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,120
It's certain that you know it. Tell me.

370
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
I...

371
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,360
I really don't know.

372
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,040
Or I will ask Lian Song to ask you about it.

373
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,160
Don't mention it to anybody else.

374
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,120
His Majesty has gone to the mortal realm
to experience his misfortunes in advance.

375
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,080
Fengjiu.

376
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,680
Cheng Yu.

377
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,480
It's a sunny day today.

378
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,120
It's a pity that you don't go out to have a walk.

379
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,640
Come to play with me outside.

380
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I don't want to go out.

381
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,640
I want to stay here.

382
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,240
Then go to my palace

383
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,280
to drink with me.

384
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,560
I don't want to drink.

385
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
It has been over for a long time.

386
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,360
Are you still sad for him?

387
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,520
Cheng Yu.

388
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,240
Don't worry about me.

389
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm fine.

390
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,160
I don't believe it.

391
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,040
Otherwise you won't be so unhappy.

392
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,680
Maybe

393
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
it's because I haven't repaid his kindness.

394
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,920
If I make it someday,

395
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,720
then maybe I will be relieved.

396
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,560
You still want to repay his kindness?

397
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
It's not the same thing.

398
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,280
Zhe Yan also told me

399
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,080
I should earn my dignity little by little.

400
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,920
Loving His Majesty and forgetting His Majesty

401
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
are my own things.

402
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,440
His Majesty has ever saved me.

403
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,480
It's reasonable for me

404
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,280
to remember to repay his kindness all the time.

405
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,240
I got a piece of news about His Majesty.

406
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,160
Maybe it can help you.

407
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,480
What is it?

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,560
His Majesty has gone to the mortal realm
to experience his misfortunes.

409
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,840
Isn't it said that it should be three hundred years later?

410
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,360
Yeah. I didn't expect that it would be so soon.

411
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Is it reliable?

412
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,760
I heard Si Ming said it. It can't be false.

413
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,840
Then I must go to ask Si Ming.

414
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,040
Si Ming.

415
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,680
Si Ming.

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Si Ming.

417
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,400
Si Ming.

418
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,800
Your Highness.

419
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,180
= Dong Hua =

420
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,480
Si Ming.

421
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,440
Why are you here in the Sky Kingdom?

422
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,280
Si Ming.

423
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,320
I specially come to see you.

424
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,760
What's the matter?

425
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Is it true that His Majesty went to
the mortal realm to experience his misfortunes?

426
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,360
His Majesty went to experience his misfortunes?

427
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,520
I haven't heard of it.

428
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Don't conceal it from me. I have known it.

429
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,040
Who told you?

430
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,480
Si Ming, tell me

431
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,520
where His Majesty has gone.

432
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,840
Your Highness, don't ask about it.

433
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,160
Were you not seriously hurt last time?

434
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,160
Si Ming.

435
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,120
You know I didn't repay his kindness

436
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,920
last time I came to the Sky Kingdom.

437
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,680
After I returned to Qingqiu, I thought twice.

438
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
I think I should carry it through to the end.

439
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,840
So I want to take this chance

440
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,320
when His Majesty is experiencing
his misfortunes in the mortal realm

441
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
to repay his kindness.

442
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,280
Only in this way can I forget His Majesty completely.

443
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,680
I can understand your feelings.

444
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,680
But it's related to His Majesty's

445
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,440
failure or success in experiencing
his misfortunes in the mortal realm.

446
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,760
I still have some other official business to do.

447
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,640
So I can't stay with you anymore.

448
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,600
You'd better return to Qingqiu early.

449
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,280
Come here.

450
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,460
= Dong Hua =

451
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,800
Dear audience,

452
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,920
Today I will tell you

453
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,840
the story of national treasure.

454
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
It's said that when State of Chengyu was built at the beginning,

455
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,960
it was surrounded by strong neighboring states
which were like revenging tigers.

456
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,000
The former emperor always
personally led his troops to the battle

457
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,600
to resist the strong enemies.

458
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,960
Once it was invaded by the strong enemies from the north.

459
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,200
The former emperor himself
was in command to challenge the enemies.

460
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
As soon as the battle formation was deployed,

461
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,040
unexpectedly, the foxy enemies stabbed them in the back.

462
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,840
Being injured,

463
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,640
the former emperor couldn't continue commanding the troops.

464
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,800
The generals and soldiers protected
the former emperor to withdraw while fighting.

465
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,520
Eventually, they got to a valley,

466
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,600
falling into the trap of the enemies.

467
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,440
The generals and soldiers fought in the bloody battle
for three days and nights.

468
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,560
However, there were so many enemies

469
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,400
and the ring of encirclement
was narrowed smaller and smaller.

470
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,760
The whole army was going to be destroyed completely.

471
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
It was at this very moment that

472
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,280
a shinning light

473
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
appeared in the sky.

474
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,160
A huge fireball

475
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,360
fell straight into the tent
of the enemies' supreme commander.

476
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,600
The enemies were in a chaos.

477
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,040
Taking the chance, the former emperor jumped

478
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,600
and led the generals and soldiers to rush ahead

479
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,520
and beat the enemies.

480
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,920
In the place where the fireball was fallen,

481
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,040
a precious stone was found,

482
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,000
which was regarded as a national treasure,

483
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,960
named Lingbi Stone.

484
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,120
Awesome!

485
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,440
A precious stone fell from the sky.

486
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,360
It's incredible.

487
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,000
You brag!

488
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,600
How dare I brag?

489
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,720
In the place where the precious stone fell,

490
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,720
there was a big pit smashed by it.

491
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,320
It is 30 miles away
from the city frontier juncture in the north

492
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
in a valley.

493
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,840
Whether it's true or false,
go to have a look and you'll know.

494
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,800
Battlefield

495
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,720
is a place with the most grievance.

496
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
Demon Lord.

497
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,800
How is she now?

498
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,880
Princess Ji Heng has got well,

499
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,720
but she hasn't regained her memory yet.

500
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,320
Is there any progress in your inquiry these days?

501
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,360
I have found that the soul-locking jade
is in State of Chengyu.

502
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,200
Take good care of her for me.

503
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,280
Rest assured, Demon Lord.

504
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,200
This is a secret place in the three realms

505
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
with few tracks.

506
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,600
Nobody knows princess is here.

507
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,040
Ten years in the mortal realm is just in a blink of an eye.

508
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Maybe she will be put into use soon.

509
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,560
Today

510
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,840
all the princes and sons of the aristocratic
families will hunt in the same hunting ground,

511
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,280
competing your skills of riding and shooting with each other

512
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,280
to show the strength of our state,

513
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,800
thinking of danger in times of peace
with the practice of military force.

514
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,920
You can show your skills and talent as mush as possible.

515
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,120
No need to be modest to each other.

516
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,440
Anybody who has many preys can be awarded.

517
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,360
- Thank you, father. - Thank you, Your Majesty.

518
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,320
Good.

519
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,320
As for the hunting in previous years,

520
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,560
it was judged by the number of the beasts.

521
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,280
I want to play it in another way this year.

522
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,680
What's your idea, father?

523
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,200
I think

524
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,080
we can change the rules this year.

525
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,840
Victory or defeat is judged
by the number of the preys of birds

526
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
and their rarity.

527
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,600
What do you think of it?

528
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,640
- You're so wise, father. - You're so wise, Your Majesty.

529
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,320
OK. Then let's begin.

530
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,400
The time is limited to six hours.

531
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
Ready!

532
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,760
Go!

533
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,680
Your Highness,

534
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,600
are you OK?

535
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,640
I'm fine.

536
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,800
The horse can't run anymore.

537
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,280
Well,

538
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,360
the horse suddenly has a violent death.

539
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,080
It must be poisoned by someone.

540
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,680
I will go to report it to His Majesty.

541
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,360
Forget it.

542
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,680
Don't make more trouble.

543
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,080
Just say that the horse is ill.

544
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,640
Carry another horse here.

545
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,960
It's a pity.

546
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,200
Your Highness, will you blame me

547
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,560
for disturbing your skylark?

548
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,960
Brother, don't laugh at my poor shooting.

549
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
The skylark is not mine.

550
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,800
Hunting in the same hunting ground with fair competition,

551
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,880
the one who has better skills can win.

552
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,360
If you shoot it,

553
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
then it means my skill is not god enough.

554
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,920
Your Highness, you are really broad-minded.

555
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,040
Have you harvested much?

556
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
It's still empty.

557
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,760
Father did change the hunting rule this year.

558
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,560
Judging by the number of preys of birds,

559
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,480
it's more difficult than previous years.

560
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,600
No wonder you just hunted a pheasant.

561
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,800
You changed the horse on the field,

562
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,320
which will certainly affect your performance.

563
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,080
I can't blame the horse for my poor shooting skills.

564
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,040
I

565
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,200
hunted three crows, two sparrows

566
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,520
and a lark.

567
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,880
What about this?

568
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,560
I will give you one of my preys.

569
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,840
You can regard it as yours.

570
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,600
Neither of us tell it to others.

571
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,720
Father won't know it, either.

572
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,200
Thank you for your kindness, brother.

573
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,320
I don't have good shooting skills,.

574
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,600
let alone resort to trickery

575
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
to cheat father.

576
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,160
You're really ambitious!

577
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Good luck to you!

578
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,560
You'd better hurry up.

579
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
Six hours

580
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,520
will be up soon.

581
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,280
Catch it.

582
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,360
It was shot by you.

583
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,160
If you didn't shoot,

584
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
maybe it's I who am lying on the ground now.

585
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
You deserve to have the golden eagle.

586
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,080
I am Ye Qingti.

587
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,840
Thank you for saving me.

588
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,160
Ye Qingti?

589
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,240
Are you from the family of Duke Yongning?

590
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,440
My father is Duke Yongning, Ye Zhenguan.

591
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
What's your name, please?

592
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,040
Song Xuanren.

593
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,840
Crown Prince.

594
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm sorry to be impolite.

595
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,760
Forget it.

596
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,280
I've heard that you guard the frontier

597
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,360
with eminent achievements.

598
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,840
I regret not to have known you before.

599
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,440
It's my honor to hunt with you.

600
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,560
The golden eagle was hunted by you.

601
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,280
It's not mine.

602
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,840
Your Highness, you shot the pheasant first

603
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,040
and then used it to attract the golden eagle.

604
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,710
You behave carefully at each step with supreme wisdom.

605
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,760
I really appreciate you.

606
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,600
Naturally the prey belongs to you.

607
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm leaving.

608
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,360
Where is Crown Prince?

609
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,800
The Crown Prince hasn't been back yet.

610
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,080
Father,

611
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,840
I just saw His Highness.

612
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,840
Without many preys,

613
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,360
I think maybe he is still looking for preys.

614
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,360
So the time was delayed.

615
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,680
Worthless!

616
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,960
Chief Eunuch!

617
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,920
By the way,

618
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,080
have you finished counting the preys of

619
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
the princes and sons of the aristocratic families?

620
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
Your Majesty,

621
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,080
it's almost done.

622
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,800
Among all the princes,

623
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,160
the Eldest Prince hunted the most.

624
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,000
Among all the sons of the aristocratic families,

625
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,880
it's...

626
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,080
He is back.

627
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,160
His Highness is back.

628
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,120
Your Majesty, His Highness is back.

629
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm sorry I'm late. Please forgive me, father.

630
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,040
Where is your prey?

631
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,080
A golden eagle!

632
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,440
He deserves to be the Crown Prince.

633
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,720
Good.

634
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,640
Xuanren.

635
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,000
Unexpectedly, you hunted a golden eagle.

636
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
It's hard to get it.

637
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,960
As for the hunting in the paddock,

638
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,840
according to the rules,

639
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,280
with hunting a golden eagle,

640
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,200
His Highness got the first place.

641
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,640
He is awarded a ferghana horse,

642
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,200
a Mubai Sword,

643
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,120
a plain silver armor with gold wire.

644
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,800
The Eldest Prince and General Ye also performed well.

645
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,040
They are awarded a ferghana horse each.

646
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,040
As for other people, go to get your awards by yourself.

647
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,360
- Thank you, Your Majesty. - Thank you, father.

648
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,040
Your Majesty, you are not in good health.

649
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,880
It's good to return to the palace early.

650
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,960
One more thing.

651
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,920
I received a battlefield report,

652
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,280
saying the State of Chong'an

653
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,600
frequently disturbed our border recently.

654
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,720
So the first prize winner of the hunting today

655
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,960
should go on an expedition instead of me
to pacify the disturbance in the border

656
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,720
and show the national prestige of our State of Chengyu.

657
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,240
As you wish.

658
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm sure to succeed in carrying out the assignment.

659
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,800
Xuanren.

660
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,640
I appoint you as the commander in chief of the troops,

661
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,000
can you pacify the disturbance?

662
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,000
Your Majesty.

663
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,440
Although the State of Chong'an is a big state,

664
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,440
our State of Chengyu is administered
by father with kindness.

665
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Working together as a whole country

666
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,520
and protected by the Lingbi Stone,

667
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,680
it's destined

668
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,320
to beat the enemies.

669
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,840
Good. You deserve to be the Crown Prince.

670
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,200
It's my duty to share your worries and burdens.

671
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,560
Ren,

672
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,560
it's the first time for you to go an expedition.

673
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,080
I have chosen a general

674
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,040
to help you.

675
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,880
I'm wondering who you chose.

676
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,640
The son of Duke Yongning, Ye Qingti.

677
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
Pay my visit to you, Your Majesty,

678
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,720
Your Highness.

679
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,760
Forget it.

680
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,120
Xuanren, Duke Yongning

681
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,920
spread their martial arts from generation to generation.
They're brave and skillful in battle.

682
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,280
All the generations go to fight in the battlefield
and repay the country with supreme loyalty.

683
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,720
Among the younger generation,

684
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,520
Ye Qingti is the most outstanding one.

685
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,160
I have appointed him as your vice commander.

686
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,760
I'm sure to help His Highness in my full support.

687
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,440
Father, you really considered thoroughly.

688
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,760
I will lead the army to the battlefield tomorrow.

689
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,880
Good.

690
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,040
Si Ming, finally you're back.

691
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,640
Si Ming.

692
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,080
Your Highness.

693
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,720
Turn up.

694
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,600
You read His Majesty's Book of Fate secretly!

695
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,920
Only you can do such a thing.

696
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,160
How dare you not admit after doing it?

697
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,560
It's not what you always do.

698
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,000
I just come to play with you.

699
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,720
Why are you so nervous?

700
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,360
What did you see?

701
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,880
What are you saying?

702
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,960
His Majesty's Book of Fate.

703
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,400
No.

704
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,640
Tell me the truth.

705
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,520
Is it true in the Book of Fate?

706
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,080
It says the state where His Majesty
is experiencing his misfortunes

707
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,280
is having a battlement with the neighboring state.

708
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,760
It's a dangerous battle that His Majesty

709
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,040
has to go to have an expedition by himself.

710
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,840
So you plan to go to the mortal realm secretly

711
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,760
to see His Majesty.

712
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,640
You said if I went to the mortal realm,

713
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,320
it would affect His Majesty's experiencing his misfortunes.

714
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,760
So I won't go there.

715
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,360
Even if I went to the mortal realm,

716
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,400
I would just glance at him secretly.

717
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,440
Can I do that?

718
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,040
No way.

719
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,920
I just cast a glance at him.

720
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,960
I won't disturb His Majesty.

721
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,400
Can I do that?

722
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
What if His Majesty was just in danger

723
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,560
when you glanced at him secretly?

724
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Can you stand by doing nothing?

725
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,000
I...

726
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
Of course you can't.

727
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
It's certain that you will help him.

728
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,680
But Your Highness,

729
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,840
if fairies use magic arts in the mortal realm,

730
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,000
they must be backfired.

731
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,200
As for the result of the backfire,

732
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,720
you can't stand it.

733
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,600
How serious is it?

734
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,040
You will be backfired

735
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,720
by the same degree of your magic arts.

736
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,040
Not only your fairy power will be destroyed badly,

737
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
but also it may harm your immortal root.

738
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,160
It's difficult to recover.

739
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,320
So serious?

740
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,040
Your Highness, give up the idea.

741
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Since you said I couldn't go there,

742
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,520
then I won't go.

743
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,600
Don't worry.

744
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,280
Just be busy with your things. I'm leaving.

745
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,640
OK.

746
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,360
Si Ming said if I went there,

747
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,880
it would affect His Majesty's experiencing his misfortunes.

748
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,280
However, to experience his misfortunes

749
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,080
means he must be in danger.

750
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,200
Si Ming also said

751
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,360
if I used magic arts in the mortal realm,

752
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,080
I would be certainly backfired.

753
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,200
What can I do?

754
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,040
If I want to repay his kindness,

755
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,360
I can't just think of myself.

756
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,760
Anyway, I must go to have a look.
