00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 47

3
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,580
Is it delicious?

4
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,260
The sugar fox that you made tastes the best.

5
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,220
If you like it, I'll cook some more for you.

6
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,380
I also like the purple potato cakes.

7
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,140
No, I won't cook them for you.

8
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,300
Why?

9
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,940
His Excellency and Her Highness

10
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,660
are really deeply attached to each other!

11
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,460
Yeah!

12
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
They love each other so much

13
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,140
that we all admire them.

14
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,860
It's really admiring!

15
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,860
Just seeing this, they admire us.

16
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,940
Hanging out during the day

17
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,620
is not as free as that in the evening.

18
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,700
I know somewhere quiet.

19
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,140
I can take you there.

20
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,700
Where?

21
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,940
Just go with me, then you will know.

22
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
You know I'm scared of snakes the most.

23
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,980
Why do you still take me here?

24
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,740
With my company,

25
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,660
they can't hurt you!

26
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,260
You are Aranya here.

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,020
It was with their care that you grew up!

28
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,460
Since Aranya was born,

29
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,700
she had been staying there.

30
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,420
Maybe they still know you.

31
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,100
Even if they know me, I dare not go inside.

32
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,660
Why do you take me here?

33
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
Do you still remember,

34
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,540
in the Fanyin Valley,

35
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,260
it was through this Python Formation that

36
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,860
we entered the Dream of Aranya by accident?

37
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,580
I'm wondering

38
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,820
if there is something secret in the Python Formation.

39
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,460
Really?

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,380
Can we get out?

41
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,900
After all, the Python Formation was made artificially,

42
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,860
which is different from the real one.

43
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,620
After you entered the dream,

44
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,020
I heard

45
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,660
the Dream of Aranya

46
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,580
accidentally drifted to

47
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,340
the Python Formation near the Jieyou Spring.

48
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,820
According to my observation,

49
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,940
the Dream of Aranya

50
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,700
is similar to the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

51
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,700
both of which are magic wards.

52
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,380
Since you could easily

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
break the Ten-evil Lotus Land to get out,

54
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,980
it may not be difficult to get out
of the Dream of Aranya, either.

55
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,660
Right?

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,260
As for this...

57
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,740
Unless you are injured.

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,780
So

59
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,820
you had been injured before entering the dream.

60
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,500
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Tell me the truth.

62
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
I don't think

63
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,020
here you are as powerful as you are outside.

64
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,940
How did you get injured?

65
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,580
In order to enter the Dream of Aranya with you

66
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,380
without breaking it,

67
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,300
I had to discharge ninety percent of my power

68
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,140
to enter it in the flesh.

69
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,620
Discharge ninety percent of your power?

70
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,900
Then it must be...

71
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,700
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,340
you risked your life for me.

73
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,340
It's nothing.

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,020
I have gone through so many battles related to life and death.

75
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,500
Don't do such silly things any more.

76
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,460
I was not badly injured.

77
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,140
If you really don't want me to do silly things,

78
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,020
the only way is

79
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,740
to prevent yourself from silly behaviors.

80
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,780
How could you turn the topic to me again?

81
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,140
The Dream of Aranya

82
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,380
is different from the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

83
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,900
It's much bigger

84
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
and more powerful here.

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,020
I'm not sure that I can avoid hurting you

86
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,780
while using magic power to break it.

87
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,100
So

88
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,860
let's try to find out

89
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,540
something strange of the Python Formation.

90
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,660
How is it?

91
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,580
How?

92
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,620
If we want to get out of the Python Formation

93
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,740
and the Dream of Aranya,

94
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,340
we have to take the course of Aranya's life

95
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,140
to continue our way.

96
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,180
We can only do this for the time being.

97
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,140
Let's go.

98
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,020
Moye once told me that

99
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,740
he left the Fanyin Valley

100
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,940
after the event of Quanyin Beast happened.

101
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,780
Shen Ye and Aranya stayed in the mansion.

102
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,620
Although they didn't show their heart to each other,

103
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,460
they were deeply attracted to each other

104
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,740
with a sweet life.

105
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,940
Really?

106
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,700
If I have to

107
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,860
take the life course of Aranya,

108
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,900
then I have to...

109
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,340
Naturally, you can't do that.

110
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,180
Then just do as what we said before.

111
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,180
I can keep a distance with Shen Ye.

112
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,820
Moye also told me that

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,060
I didn't need to care much about the details.

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,780
When I have to make any choices for the big events,

115
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
if I do the same as Aranya did, that's OK.

116
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,580
Did Su Moye tell you

117
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,940
what the next big event was?

118
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
His Majesty's demise.

119
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,460
It seems to be a long time before that.

120
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,980
Let's go back now.

121
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Having walked for a whole day, I even have blisters on my feet.

122
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,780
Really?

123
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,140
I will give you a foot massage.

124
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,780
What's wrong?

125
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,820
It's nothing.

126
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,180
You can go back first.

127
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,260
What are you going to do?

128
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,700
Don't worry.

129
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,260
I'll be back soon.

130
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,900
Who sent the letter here?

131
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,860
It turned out that you went to take the cotton rose ointment.

132
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Was it necessary for you to behave so secretly?

133
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,660
There isn't cotton rose here.

134
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,980
So I can't make cotton rose ointment.

135
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,100
Then I just took this.

136
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,340
Are you going to

137
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,700
hide everything from me?

138
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,580
Why do you think so?

139
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,900
What about this?

140
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,180
How can you explain it?

141
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,580
It's not worth mentioning.

142
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,820
No need to let it disturb you.

143
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,980
It says in the letter that

144
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,340
this is the fifth letter.

145
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,020
No wonder that

146
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,540
I can always smell the flavor of ink.

147
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,020
You have burnt all the letters, right?

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,300
It doesn't matter.

149
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,780
I know what to do.

150
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,140
The magic instrument that you asked him to make

151
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,860
has come to the last stage.

152
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,340
As for such masterly magic instrument,

153
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,300
it is the most dangerous when it comes into being.

154
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,140
If it can't be made successfully,

155
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,340
all the efforts will be in vain.

156
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,660
There may also be backfire.

157
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,460
So you'd better go back quickly.

158
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,380
As for Shen Ye...

159
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,300
I know how to behave properly with Shen Ye.

160
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,980
I'm sure to deal with him well.

161
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,500
But I'll be out for a very long time.

162
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,580
Very long?

163
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
How long is it?

164
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,740
Several months?

165
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,820
Several years?

166
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,220
Well...

167
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,140
At least several days.

168
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,380
It's just several days.

169
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,220
You said as if you were away for a long time.

170
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Absence sharpens love.

171
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,220
Isn't it long enough?

172
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,380
How could you say that

173
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,300
you were not good at talking?

174
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,740
Your Highness.

175
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,620
Your Excellency.

176
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,420
What's wrong? Chacha.

177
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,140
Tell me!

178
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,100
Here is message from the palace that

179
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,940
His Majesty and Her Majesty haven't seen you for a long time,

180
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,220
so they asked you to go to the palace

181
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,660
to relieve their lovesickness.

182
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,740
I pay respects to father and mother!

183
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,740
Rise!

184
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,700
Thank you, father.

185
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,500
How are you doing these days?

186
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,100
Father, I'm fine.

187
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,940
I heard that Lord Xi Ze had been living
in your mansion these days.

188
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,420
How do you get on with each other?

189
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,300
We get on peacefully

190
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,140
with each other.

191
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,500
It's good.

192
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,700
Just peacefully?

193
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,740
Rumor has it that

194
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,100
Lord Xi Ze and you are closely attached to each other,

195
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,780
which is very admiring.

196
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,540
Mother,

197
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,020
I did go out with Lord Xi Ze

198
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,420
to the fair,

199
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,940
but we didn't do anything that degraded
the decency of the imperial family.

200
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,940
Never mind.

201
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,820
Xi Ze used to be cold.

202
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,860
Since he is kind to you,

203
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,260
we feel very happy for you.

204
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,380
Thank you for caring about me.

205
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,580
If you don't have anything to say, you can leave now.

206
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,420
OK.

207
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,060
By the way,

208
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,060
Shen Ye is making swords in your mansion, isn't he?

209
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,380
How is it going?

210
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,860
Though I don't know much about making swords,

211
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,740
yet I have never heard

212
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,220
he had any worries

213
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,460
or troubles.

214
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,780
So I think

215
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,180
his work goes smoothly.

216
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,980
You think it's smooth?

217
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,940
Such important weapons are being forged in your mansion.

218
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,140
Shouldn't you go to ask something about them?

219
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,660
You're right, mother.

220
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,180
I'm going back to see how it is going.

221
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,380
Well,

222
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
I can go back with her

223
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,420
to see how it is going.

224
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,220
Good.

225
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,420
As mother and daughter, you hardly have chances
to talk with each other.

226
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,700
Go ahead.

227
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,220
Then you can have a talk with your father

228
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,220
and wait for me for a while.

229
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,180
I will.

230
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,260
Mother, you know how to make swords, right?

231
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,740
No.

232
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,980
Could it be that you want to take the chance

233
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,940
to talk something with me personally?

234
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,420
Why did Xi Ze have a fancy for you suddenly?

235
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,620
Mother, you are so strange.
How could you ask me such a question?

236
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,100
Lord Xi Ze has been my husband for a long time.

237
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,780
But I heard that

238
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,620
Lord Xi Ze always lived on the Qi Nan Mountain.

239
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,620
Your marriage just existed in the name only.

240
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,300
Mother,

241
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,860
those are just rumors.

242
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,580
Lord Xi Ze and I are always attracted to each other.

243
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,940
Could it be that

244
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,460
you prefer to believe the slanders of the evil people

245
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,340
rather than believe your daughter?

246
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,180
How dare you talk to me like this?

247
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,700
Please calm your anger, mother.

248
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,900
I was just telling the truth.

249
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,380
I'm wondering why you suddenly mentioned Xi Ze.

250
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,540
Could it be that you are worried

251
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,980
after hearing we love each other?

252
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,820
Relying on Xi Ze's favor,

253
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,940
you dare to talk with me like this.

254
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,380
I dare not.

255
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,740
Aranya's mother

256
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,460
really hates her so much.

257
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,460
Mother.

258
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,020
Let me take you to the sword forging room.

259
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,420
No need. I can go there myself.

260
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,780
It's so strange today.

261
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,060
Your Majesty, it's not a long time after your last visit.

262
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,740
Aren't you afraid of His Majesty's suspicion?

263
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,500
Don't worry.

264
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,420
He allowed me to come here.

265
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,740
I don't need to worry about anything.

266
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,220
I'm not the one who is to rebel.

267
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,380
Anyhow,

268
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,860
I won't get you involved in it.

269
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,660
You are not as calm as before.

270
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,540
Today I come here

271
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,500
to ask you again.

272
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,700
If you'd like to join me,

273
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,780
tell me your opinions.

274
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,460
If not,

275
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,820
just tell me directly.

276
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Even without you,

277
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,580
I will still take actions.

278
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,740
Your Highness.

279
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,020
Your Highness.

280
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,660
What's wrong?

281
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,260
The steward said that

282
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,740
Lord Shen Ye invited you to the Mengchun Courtyard.

283
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,940
What?

284
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,700
He invited me to the Mengchun Courtyard?

285
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,700
Yes.

286
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,340
Did he tell you why?

287
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,420
I asked steward and he said he didn't know.

288
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,060
I got it.

289
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,380
I'll be there soon.

290
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,500
Do you know what that is?

291
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,220
It seems to be a magic instrument.

292
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,500
What is it used for?

293
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,940
It is the Glaze Lamp,

294
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,940
which can collect primordial spirit and memories.

295
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,860
Collect primordial spirit?

296
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,980
Inside of it

297
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,700
is Aranya's primordial spirit.

298
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,820
I made this dream

299
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,260
to bring Aranya back to life.

300
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,540
It was you

301
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
who made the Dream of Aranya!

302
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,660
Didn't you say that

303
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,220
you felt pity for Aranya?

304
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,260
I don't want to know who you are.

305
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,620
But

306
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,020
I want to tell you

307
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm not as ruthless as you said.

308
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,340
My heart is in the dream.

309
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,380
This place

310
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,420
was made to bring Aranya back to life.

311
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,180
I have been using the Glaze Lamp

312
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,820
to collect her primordial spirit,

313
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,620
hoping that

314
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,700
she could come back to me.

315
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,180
So

316
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,140
the demon is not in Aranya's heart

317
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,260
but yours.

318
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,660
Yeah.

319
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Since she died,

320
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,380
I have been in this dream

321
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,940
experiencing her life with her

322
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,900
and collecting her primordial spirit

323
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,100
the moment she died.

324
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,100
Aranya

325
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,060
will know

326
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,660
you have such deep love for her.

327
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,620
After the Earth Immortals die,

328
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,180
can they come back to life again?

329
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,420
With natural death,

330
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,820
the same as ordinary people, the Earth Immortals

331
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,900
can use Spirit-Forming Lantern or other ways

332
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,380
to come back to life again.

333
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,140
Even if the primordial spirit is vanished without trace

334
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,220
and the Spirit-Forming Lantern can do nothing,

335
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,540
as long as this dream is made,

336
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,780
everything can start from the very beginning

337
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,060
and even the dead can come back to life.

338
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,660
Moye and I missed a play.

339
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,980
I am still guilty about it.

340
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,180
Unexpectedly, you were also acting.

341
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,180
Why do you tell me now?

342
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,220
I didn't want to tell you,

343
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,260
but because of your appearance,

344
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,180
you have occupied Aranya's body,

345
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,740
everything has been different!

346
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,420
Xi Ze has changed.

347
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,860
The Stone Formation of Quanyin Beast has gone.

348
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,380
Even Qing Hua came to see me in advance.

349
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,260
Originally, in each life,

350
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,500
I can collect some part of

351
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,700
Aranya's primordial spirit.

352
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,180
Clearly I'm going to make it in this life.

353
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
But unexpectedly...

354
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,900
Beyond your expectation, maybe because of me,

355
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,740
all your efforts will be in vain.

356
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,340
I know

357
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,580
there must be someone secretly instructing you

358
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,260
to take Aranya's life course

359
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,020
to go on your performance.

360
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,380
He

361
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,900
is Su Moye, right?

362
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,620
Yeah, it's him.

363
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,980
He also wants to know what happened.

364
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,980
Why does he want to know it?

365
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,740
He is not qualified to know it.

366
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,300
Because of his appearance,

367
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,180
Aranya left me.

368
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,100
But in the last two years of Aranya's life,

369
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,820
he went to the West Sea.

370
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,940
What does he know?

371
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,700
He doesn't know Aranya's last choice.

372
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,700
If you want to get out of here,

373
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,660
you can only listen to me.

374
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,660
Because of you,

375
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,220
everything is changing.

376
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,380
Only by going back to the original course

377
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
can I finish collecting her primordial spirit.

378
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,580
You want to bring Aranya back to life.

379
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
Is it because you want to make up for your past mistakes?

380
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,780
What I have done wrong can't be changed.

381
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,660
I never wanted to cheat her.

382
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,860
Anyhow,

383
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,300
I must bring her back.

384
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,940
At that time, either she resents me

385
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,940
or regards me as a stranger,

386
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,700
I will tell her face to face that

387
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,500
there were too many misunderstandings between us

388
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,460
and we missed a lot.

389
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,980
I love her.

390
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,660
I don't want to lose her again.

391
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,260
OK.

392
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,260
I can help you.

393
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
It's not because of you

394
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
but Aranya.

395
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,020
She really had a miserable life.

396
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,340
I want her to come back to life again

397
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,020
and know that

398
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,420
someone is so deeply attached to her.

399
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,940
Who are you?

400
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,900
You wanted to kill me the moment you saw me.

401
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,100
Then don't blame me for breaking your plan.

402
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,340
Stay here.

403
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,820
What's wrong with you?

404
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,900
I've seen everything.

405
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,980
What did you see?

406
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,620
Aranya's memories.

407
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,140
Lingshu Stage.

408
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,980
Letters.

409
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,740
Quanyin Beast.

410
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,420
Both Aranya's primordial spirit and memories

411
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,740
have been in your body.

412
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,740
You're right.

413
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,860
Let me take you back.

414
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,940
Don't you always want to know what happened?

415
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,580
Go to see it yourself!

416
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,940
Most are very trivial things.

417
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,380
Too many things happened.

418
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,300
Just choose a time randomly.

419
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,940
You moved the Solanum pseudocapsicum trees
to the courtyard that day.

420
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,220
They have blossomed and born fruits by now.

421
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,740
There are also Solanum pseudocapsicum trees
in the Python Formation.

422
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,260
I used to eat such fruits when I was young.

423
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,660
It was said that there weren't such trees
in the Python Formation in the past.

424
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,260
But they rooted, sprouted

425
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
blossomed and fruited over a night.

426
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,500
Maybe the God also had compassion for me.

427
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,460
You did have true love with Aranya.

428
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,220
Aranya's love for you

429
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,060
was sincere and pure.

430
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,060
But you were

431
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,060
not that sincere to her.

432
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,180
Yeah.

433
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,620
Aranya loved me so deeply,

434
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,220
but I was too coward

435
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,780
and I didn't cherish her.

436
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,940
The period when Aranya stayed with you

437
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,220
was the happiest time in her life.

438
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,940
If everything had stopped at that moment,

439
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,940
it would be good.

440
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,380
It seemed that all the things happened later

441
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,140
made her feel sad.

442
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,980
Actually,

443
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,340
you can choose not to know her.

444
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,980
What did you see?

445
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,020
You and...

446
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,940
You and Aranya were playing chess.

447
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,860
And then?

448
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,860
Chacha came in.

449
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,780
Your Highness.

450
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,660
Your Excellency.

451
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,860
His Majesty...

452
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

453
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,460
Take it easy.

454
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Here comes the news from the palace that

455
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,940
His Majesty died of illness.

456
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,460
My father was always in good health.

457
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
How could he suddenly...

458
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:41,900
Wait for a moment.

459
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,420
Wait for me.

460
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,940
Leave the game as it is.

461
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,140
Wait for me to come back.

462
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,140
Go ahead.

463
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,380
I still remember these things.

464
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,860
What happened later?

465
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,220
Then Aranya went to the imperial palace,

466
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,780
seeing his father who was in the bed

467
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,260
without breath.

468
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,340
Although her father never liked Aranya,

469
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,620
she cried with deep sorrow.

470
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,660
I thought

471
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,820
she didn't like her father.

472
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,540
And then?

473
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,180
Aranya wanted to help Xiangli He

474
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,060
to deal with the funeral of her father.

475
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,980
But she was refused by her mother.

476
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,860
So she returned to her mansion alone.

477
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,300
Your Highness.

478
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,260
Where is Shen Ye?

479
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,260
Prince Xiangli He invited him

480
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,660
to return to the Qi Nan Palace moments ago

481
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,620
to host the funeral of His Majesty.

482
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,780
I was about to send someone to inform you of it

483
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,140
when you came back.

484
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,180
The archmage left just minutes ago.

485
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,820
I think he hasn't gone far.

486
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,820
You can leave now.

487
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,380
Yes, Your Highness.

488
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,300
It turns out that,

489
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,660
compared with me,

490
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,900
you care more about yourself.

491
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,900
You sent me this that day

492
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,620
to say goodbye to me.

493
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,060
Unexpectedly, I didn't feel it.

494
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,660
Aranya was eager to see you,

495
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,740
but you just left without a word

496
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,340
and didn't wait to see her for the last time.

497
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,820
Shen Ye.

498
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,860
What did you go for?

499
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,820
How can you be so selfish?

500
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,940
I couldn't control the situation,

501
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,140
which was beyond my expectation.

502
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,380
If it's possible,

503
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,060
could you please tell me

504
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,100
what Aranya was thinking in the end?

505
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,180
For example,

506
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,980
did she resent me?

507
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,940
No.

508
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,340
She didn't resent you.

509
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,380
She just felt a little regretful.

510
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Your farewell to her

511
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,860
was so veiled.

512
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,180
Later she was put into prison, right?

513
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,780
You, go over there.

514
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,340
Yes.

515
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:02,900
Guards.

516
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,780
Arrest Aranya!

517
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,020
Take her to the palace!

518
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,580
You...

519
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,060
What are you doing?

520
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,860
What did I commit?

521
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,860
Why do you arrest me?

522
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,620
Don't talk nonsense.

523
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,380
Take her away!

524
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:14,980
Yes.

525
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,260
Hurry up.

526
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,140
Uncle.

527
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,940
Aranya.

528
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,100
Do you confess your sin?

529
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,820
I don't know what I have committed.

530
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,700
Regicide!

531
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,780
How dare you say that you don't know your sin?

532
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,260
He who has a mind to beat his dog

533
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,340
will easily find a stick.

534
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,460
How stubborn you are!

535
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,100
If it goes on like this,

536
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,500
you're sure to be condemned to death.

537
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,420
Guards! Take Aranya away.

538
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,300
Put her into the prison to wait for punishments.

539
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,180
- Yes. - Yes.

540
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,860
Take her away!

541
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,540
This part

542
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,780
is too miserable!

543
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,220
How heartrending it is!

544
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,620
How could a mother

545
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,820
be so cruel to her biological daughter?

546
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,220
I didn't expect that

547
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,220
Qing Hua put Aranya to death behind me.

548
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,020
The biggest mistake I made in my life

549
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,140
was that I misread her.

550
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,460
Aranya did believe Qing Hua's mischief

551
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,860
and intended to die.

552
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,260
With thousands of arrows penetrating her heart,

553
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,780
living is no better than dying,

554
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,860
which is such a feeling!

555
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,340
I have told you that

556
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,860
what I did is to cheat Qing Hua.

557
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,980
No matter what you said is true or false, just put it aside.

558
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,980
Even if it's true,

559
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,180
how could Aranya know it then?

560
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,700
Aren't the incontestable evidence

561
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,980
and words more reliable?

562
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,620
I remember Moye ever told me that

563
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,180
he asked Aranya

564
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,780
if she resented you some day,

565
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,460
what the reason would be.

566
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,820
Do you know her answer?

567
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,660
Aranya said

568
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,140
it must be the reason that she got you

569
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,620
but lost you again.

570
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,580
For example, you fell in love with her

571
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,060
but gave up her later

572
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,860
and loved another person.

573
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,460
I pay my respect to Your Majesty.

574
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,660
Why are you in a panic?

575
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,780
Leave us alone.

576
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,460
Yes.

577
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,940
Sister.

578
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,620
It was reported that

579
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,900
they had made it.

580
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,460
Was it big enough?

581
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,340
I'm wondering if the night owls clan will dispatch troops.

582
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,060
Don't worry, sister.

583
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,580
The place attacked

584
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,540
happened to be under the administration
of the Eldest Prince of the night owls clan,

585
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,420
who has a hot temper

586
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,660
and is a born fighter.

587
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,900
It's unreasonable that he won't be tricked.

588
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,580
Sounds good!

589
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,740
As for me,

590
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,620
I have well-prepared

591
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,020
and am ready to dispatch troops anytime.

592
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,420
It's done!

593
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,180
The magic instrument that you want to forge

594
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,500
turns out to be a mirror.

595
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,420
This is

596
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,940
the Miaohua Mirror.

597
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
Miaohua Mirror?

598
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,260
As for the Miaohua Mirror in the Sky Kingdom,

599
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,780
I have heard of it.

600
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,740
The two...

601
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,900
It was modeled on that one.

602
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,100
But I have made some changes.

603
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,940
Although it's small,

604
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,180
as for the dead people's previous life and present life,

605
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,300
we can see all of them through this mirror.

606
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,380
You mean,

607
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,220
through this mirror,

608
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,420
we can see

609
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,500
how Aranya died.

610
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:35,780
Yeah.

611
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,260
I never knew

612
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,980
there was such a magic instrument in the world,

613
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,020
which can show the previous and present life of an immortal.

614
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,260
It's really fantastic!

615
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,860
I infer that

616
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,460
it was Shen Ye

617
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,180
who made the Dream of Aranya.

618
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,380
Shen Ye?

619
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,620
Then,

620
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,140
what did he want to do?

621
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,580
I don't know.

622
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,140
Well,

623
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,140
let's see what he did

624
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,820
and then find out the relationship

625
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,700
between Xiaobai and Aranya.

626
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,340
Then

627
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
let's start from the first time that

628
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,020
Shen Ye met Aranya.

629
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,100
I remember Aranya said

630
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,260
the first time she saw Shen Ye

631
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,820
was when she was young.

632
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,340
It was Shen Ye's birthday.

633
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,940
Are you sick?

634
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,900
There is no medicine in the Fanyin Valley

635
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,340
better than the blood of the archmage.

636
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,540
Let me save you.

637
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,900
It appeared that

638
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,380
the real first meeting

639
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,660
was much earlier than she knew.

640
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,580
Although you live in the snake nest,

641
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,220
you are not a snake.

642
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,460
You are the princess of the inseparable king bird clan.

643
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,980
So you must have a name.

644
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,420
Since your parents don't want to give you a name,

645
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,340
let me give you a name, OK?

646
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,380
Aranya.

647
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,140
This is your name.

648
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,140
If I say this word,

649
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,180
it means I am calling you. Understand?

650
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,900
Aranya.

651
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,620
Are you OK?

652
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,060
It turned out that

653
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,060
Shen Ye ever raised Aranya with his blood

654
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,740
when he was young.

655
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,940
And the words on Aranya's arm

656
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,540
were also carved by Shen Ye.

657
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,340
According to this,

658
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,580
their fate

659
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,940
was much deeper than mine

660
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,860
from the very beginning.

661
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,180
Fate

662
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,260
is always marvelous.

663
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,060
I always thought

664
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,220
it was Aranya herself

665
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,300
who desired for the fate with Shen Ye.

666
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:28,900
Clearly,

667
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,540
it's not true.

668
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,380
Shen Ye didn't seem to

669
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,500
be sincere to Aranya.

670
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,580
If not, how could he stand by and see her go die?

671
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,900
Could it be that Shen Ye changed his mind

672
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,900
after he grew up?

673
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,420
Do you want to go on watching it?

674
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,940
As for what happened later,

675
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,980
I know it generally.

676
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,100
Your Majesty.

677
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,940
Can we start watching from His Majesty's demise

678
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,460
and the time when Aranya was put into prison?

679
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,700
I want to know

680
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,540
if Shen Ye tried to save her.

681
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,260
OK.
