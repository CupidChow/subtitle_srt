00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 36

3
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,660
Aranya,

4
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,260
you've left so long.

5
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,820
I've created this dream world

6
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,060
where every tree and bush,

7
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,140
every person and animal

8
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,820
and all other trivial things

9
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,300
exist for you.

10
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,700
I missed you

11
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,220
and let you be wronged and driven to death.

12
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,100
Someone told me

13
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,220
you could start over

14
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,020
if such a dream world is created.

15
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
It can even revive you

16
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,940
by collecting your primordial spirit

17
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,140
like Spirit-Forming Lantern.

18
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,940
Over 200 years have passed.

19
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
I'm afraid

20
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,700
I'm the only one who still remembers you.

21
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,540
Do you know?

22
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,340
The two of us in the dream world

23
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,780
have met at this moment.

24
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,260
I'm going to see you,

25
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,660
Aranya.

26
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,980
Can I never

27
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,700
get out of here?

28
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,220
Now that I've lost my memories,

29
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,100
I'd better take my time.

30
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,820
What's destined

31
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,780
cannot be avoided.

32
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,500
If I'm not doomed,

33
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
I'll find the truth out sooner or later.

34
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,820
Now that I'm Aranya,

35
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,140
I'll get on with it.

36
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
Where is it?

37
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,100
There are snakes everywhere.

38
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,580
It's early in the morning.

39
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,220
Where is everyone?

40
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,900
Chacha.

41
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,380
Chacha.

42
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,580
Your Highness.

43
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,540
Your Highness, you're awake.

44
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,420
Yeah.

45
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,140
Where have you been in the early morning?

46
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,220
Your Highness, did you forget?

47
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,460
You're happiest

48
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,100
on this day of every year.

49
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,780
What's special about today?

50
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,100
Come over.

51
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,020
Put it here.

52
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,580
Open it.

53
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,420
Prince Qing, happy birthday!

54
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,020
Don't come over.

55
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,940
Stay back!

56
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,980
She gives him a kiss and a hug on this day of every year.

57
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,020
Stay back.

58
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,460
What's wrong?

59
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,420
Stay back.

60
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,260
- Hurry. - Wait for me.

61
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,100
Hurry.

62
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,700
Wait for me.

63
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,780
I want to go there too.

64
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,660
Hurry up.

65
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,140
Wait for me.

66
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,460
Where are you going?

67
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,740
Wait for me.

68
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,860
Where is Xiaobai's primordial spirit?

69
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,900
It's a dream world,

70
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,780
but it's well built.

71
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,140
It looks quite like the real world,

72
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,460
without any difference.

73
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,700
I'm afraid it'll take some time.

74
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,620
Please enjoy.

75
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,620
I'll never lie.

76
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,980
Do you know?

77
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,860
Princess Junuo

78
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,380
hurt herself the other day.

79
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,660
I think she fell off a horse.

80
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,140
- Did she? - Really?

81
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,020
Absolutely.

82
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,100
My younger sister

83
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,740
is a private servant of Princess Junuo.

84
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,860
She told me about that.

85
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,940
It's said

86
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,780
His Majesty asked Lord Xi Ze

87
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,780
to come and treat Princess Junuo.

88
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,860
I've never heard he has a younger sister.

89
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,820
Me either.

90
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,780
It's really hard to get Lord Xi Ze there.

91
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,500
Really?

92
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,260
Really.

93
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,340
Believe it or not.

94
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,860
Xi Ze?

95
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,580
By practicing Correction Magic,

96
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,300
I can change

97
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,940
the inseparable king birds' memories of Xi Ze

98
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,700
and go to look for Xiaobai like this.

99
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,300
Your Excellency.

100
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,380
What's up?

101
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,820
Their Majesties want to see you.

102
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,020
They said Princess Junuo's condition has worsened.

103
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,940
I see.

104
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,380
Okay.

105
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,900
Your Highness, you didn't call in Prince Qing.

106
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
He's so angry as to swallow three oxen.

107
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,700
He must miss you very much,

108
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,100
so I asked them to take him here.

109
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,700
Your Highness,

110
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,540
what's going on?

111
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Did I like him very much?

112
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,660
You and Prince Qing hated to part

113
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,300
with each other.

114
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,460
He left your palace the other day

115
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,420
just because he was sick.

116
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,740
Really?

117
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,700
You must be so excited

118
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,340
as to be terrified, right?

119
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,780
Chacha, come over.

120
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,100
Tell me the story about me and Qing.

121
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,660
Your Highness, is it a test for me?

122
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,700
Yeah.

123
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,700
What's the reward if I win?

124
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,700
I'll tell you after you answer my question.

125
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,460
Prince Qing is a green snake

126
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,700
saved by you when you were young.

127
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,780
You treated him like your younger brother

128
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,500
and named him Qing.

129
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,620
Everyone in the imperial palace,
from senior eunuchs that serve His Majesty

130
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,780
to common servants that do chores,

131
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,780
calls him Prince Qing to show their respect.

132
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
It's not easy to pretend to be a princess,

133
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,940
but it's terrible to be one

134
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,420
that likes snakes.

135
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,660
If I overcome my fear of snakes,

136
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,140
I'll be the genuine Princess Aranya

137
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,700
in everyone's mind.

138
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,500
Then I can catch fish and shrimps and do anything as I like.

139
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,860
But if I don't,

140
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,620
they'll find out I'm fake sooner or later,

141
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,700
and then I'll be at their mercy.

142
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,820
No way.

143
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,140
I have to find out a countermeasure.

144
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,140
Your Highness,

145
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,340
shall I have Prince Qing carried here?

146
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,260
No. Don't bother.

147
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,500
Chacha,

148
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,940
I have one more question.

149
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,980
These will be yours

150
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,660
if you answer it correctly.

151
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,780
Okay.

152
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,500
Please go ahead.

153
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,900
Who do I like the most

154
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,220
and who do I hate the most?

155
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,660
Um...

156
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,900
Don't you know that?

157
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,060
Of course I do.

158
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,500
But you're so straightforward

159
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,580
that I'm a little embarrassed.

160
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,900
There is nothing embarrassing.

161
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,500
Answer me.

162
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,180
As for who you like,

163
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,140
you're already engaged to Lord Xi Ze.

164
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,380
Unbelievable. Aranya is even married.

165
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,460
No.

166
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,220
I can try to accept a snake,

167
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,380
but what should I do with a man?

168
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,620
With all due respect,

169
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,940
I think who you hate most

170
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,900
are Princess Junuo and Princess Changdi.

171
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,980
Why do you say that?

172
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,300
Now that you asked me,

173
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,140
I'll answer you honestly.

174
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,660
The two of them are

175
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,860
your sisters,

176
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,060
but they always bully you at ordinary times.

177
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,140
Even I can't bear it.

178
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,860
They always bully me.

179
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,060
Your Highness,

180
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,580
you have a tragic life experience.

181
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,020
It's a different case for them.

182
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,900
They always ride the high horse

183
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,220
because they think they've won Their Majesties' favor.

184
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,820
You're tolerant,

185
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,300
but I feel very uncomfortable.

186
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,700
My parents have several kids.

187
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,700
Some win their favor and some don't.

188
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,100
It doesn't matter.

189
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,260
I'm used to that.

190
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,420
Your Highness,

191
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,540
I don't think it's fair to you.

192
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,420
I understand why Princess Junuo is treated differently,

193
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,980
but Princess Changdi has the same status

194
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,980
as you.

195
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,460
Why is she so arrogant and aggressive?

196
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,060
Why does she dare to bully us?

197
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,180
However,

198
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,420
seeing what happened the other day

199
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,820
when you and Junuo had a horse race,

200
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,820
we've got revenge more or less.

201
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,380
Did anything happen to Princess Junuo?

202
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,220
She fell off her horse.

203
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,620
I've heard her arm is badly injured.

204
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,460
It's a pity you didn't see that because you had left the track.

205
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,020
It was exciting.

206
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,900
Nuo,

207
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
are you feeling better?

208
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,940
No.

209
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,020
It's more painful.

210
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,700
Why hasn't Lord Xi Ze arrived?

211
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,780
Her arm is seriously injured.

212
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,380
What should we do

213
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,460
if any sequela happens to her

214
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,900
so that she can't use magic arts anymore?

215
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,780
Stop talking!

216
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,540
If you hadn't instigated Aranya

217
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,340
to have a horse race with her,

218
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,060
she couldn't have been injured.

219
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,460
I didn't expect

220
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,940
Aranya is so good at racing

221
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,620
as to make a spectacle of Nuo.

222
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,020
Enough.

223
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
Forget about it, mother.

224
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,700
It's my horse that stumbled.

225
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,180
It's not her fault.

226
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,820
Nuo,

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,420
you should know how much expectations

228
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,780
I've placed on you.

229
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,620
Don't let such a thing happen again.

230
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,860
Got it.

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,220
Your Excellency, this way please.

232
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,820
Xi Ze, you're here.

233
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,580
Junuo hasn't recovered from an arm injury

234
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,260
despite the imperial doctors' treatment.

235
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,700
I have no other choice

236
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,580
but to ask you to come here.

237
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
It's okay. Let me check first.

238
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,340
Where did she hurt?

239
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
How did it happen?

240
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,460
She fell off the horse when she had a race with Aranya.

241
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,540
Nuo did it just for fun,

242
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,220
but Aranya rode too fast.

243
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Nuo was anxious and wanted to catch up.

244
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,100
Then she ended up falling off.

245
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,060
She's seriously injured.

246
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,940
What?

247
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,980
She just fell off a horse.

248
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,420
Why is this happening?

249
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,300
It's easy to heal the wounds,

250
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,940
but she was terrified when she fell off

251
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,020
so that her mind and spirit were damaged.

252
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,100
It'll take some time to heal that.

253
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,860
What should we do?

254
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,220
I'll stay in the imperial palace in the coming days

255
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,220
to treat her carefully.

256
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,780
She'll get better

257
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,540
in half a month.

258
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,860
That'd be great!

259
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,380
Servant!

260
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,380
Prepare a nice palace

261
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,980
for Lord Xi Ze.

262
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,340
Make sure it's close to Junuo's palace.

263
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,380
Got it?

264
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Yes.

265
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,700
She's pregnant.

266
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,460
A fetus is the best home to primordial spirit.

267
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
To recuperate,

268
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,220
her primordial spirit has to go into the body of someone
with great magic arts.

269
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,980
I'll check

270
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,060
and find the truth out.

271
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,940
Hearing what Chacha said,

272
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,820
I don't think things are going quite smoothly

273
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,700
with Aranya as a princess.

274
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,460
Unfortunately,

275
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,860
I can do nothing about it.

276
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,820
Your Highness, did you want to see me?

277
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,020
I have one more question for you.

278
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,860
Your Highness,

279
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,020
you've asked me lots of questions.

280
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,540
What else do you want to know?

281
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,340
Tell me

282
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,460
which my favorite restaurant is.

283
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,860
The only one you like to go

284
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,060
is called Zuilixian Restaurant.

285
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,420
Zuilixian Restaurant.

286
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,700
That'd be great.

287
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,220
I won't have meals at home tomorrow.

288
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,180
I'll go to Zuilixian Restaurant.

289
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,100
Let me go with you.

290
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,900
Don't bother.

291
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,380
Have a good rest tomorrow.

292
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,220
I'll go there alone.

293
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,220
You can leave.

294
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,060
It seems I have to fight poison with poison.

295
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,260
Your Excellency.

296
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,700
How is Her Highness doing?

297
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,500
She just went to bed.

298
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,740
It's midnight.

299
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,500
I need to transfer energy to treat her.

300
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,180
Don't bother us.

301
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,060
Got it.

302
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,780
Xiaobai.

303
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,820
Are you there?

304
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,340
Junuo is injured.

305
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,300
Consequences may be serious

306
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,940
if I try to contact Xiaobai's primordial spirit.

307
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,540
Xiaobai,

308
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,380
I've got only 10% of my power,

309
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,180
so I can't take you out.

310
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,020
You'd better stay here for a good rest

311
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,380
now that it's a suitable place for you.

312
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,980
Give me some time

313
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,620
and I'll take you out later.

314
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,020
Your Highness,

315
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,340
this is Braised Snake you ordered.

316
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,900
That's all the snake dishes

317
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,460
served here?

318
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,460
Yeah. That's all we have.

319
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,900
Look.

320
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,820
This is Braised Snake Meat.

321
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,660
This is Quick-Fried Snake Meat.

322
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,700
This is Snake Meat with Spicy Salt.

323
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,140
Enough. Stop it.

324
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,660
I see.

325
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,380
You can leave.

326
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,940
Okay.

327
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,540
Your Highness,

328
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,860
you don't eat snake meat at ordinary times.

329
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,420
Why did you order so much today?

330
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,980
Can you eat it up?

331
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,460
I just suddenly want to try it.

332
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,140
You can leave.

333
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,420
Got it.

334
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,420
Please enjoy.

335
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:13,980
Aranya?

336
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
Sorry. I'm in a hurry.

337
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,020
Come on. What a bad luck.

338
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,300
Aranya.

339
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,660
No.

340
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,820
Why am I recognized at this place?

341
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,980
He must be one of Aranya's friends.

342
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,820
Oh no.

343
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,340
I should've come here with a maid.

344
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,460
Such being the case,

345
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,660
I have to try my luck.

346
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,780
Aranya.

347
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,140
Don't you remember me?

348
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,820
Yes, I do.

349
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,460
You're...

350
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,660
I'm Shen Ye.

351
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,020
Right. You're Shen Ye.

352
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,380
Don't you know me?

353
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,700
Um. Yes.

354
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,620
I know you.

355
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,700
I do.

356
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,820
But there is something urgent.

357
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,940
I must go.

358
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,420
What do you think?

359
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,500
Is it warm?

360
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,620
Your Highness,

361
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,460
you scared me today.

362
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,980
You left despite the heavy rain.

363
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,300
Why didn't you wait till it stopped?

364
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,220
You're drenched.

365
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,300
What if you catch a cold?

366
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,540
I met someone today.

367
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,700
It was Shen Ye, the archmage you mentioned yesterday.

368
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,740
Oh.

369
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,300
If Shen Ye asks you

370
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,180
about what I did today,

371
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,180
tell him I'd been busy.

372
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,300
It's weird.

373
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,100
Shen Ye doesn't get along with you.

374
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,580
How could he ask about you?

375
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,940
Is it because...

376
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,260
you made trouble again?

377
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,140
Not get along with me?

378
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,980
But judging from

379
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,820
the way he looked at me,

380
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,940
I don't think it's like that.

381
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,980
Do you mean

382
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,580
your relationship with him in your childhood?

383
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,300
In my childhood?

384
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,180
When you were young,

385
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,220
you went to congratulate him on his birthday

386
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,460
now that he was your cousin,

387
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,380
but he said you were dirty

388
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,340
and threw out all your gifts

389
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,300
after listening to what Princess Junuo and Princess Changdi

390
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,660
had said about you.

391
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,780
Since then you've stopped contacting him.

392
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,660
You're so generous

393
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,740
as to consider you're still friends,

394
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,140
but I don't think

395
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,180
he deserves to be your friend.

396
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,220
Is that all?

397
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,380
It's really weird.

398
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,140
It must be more than that.

399
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,060
Your Highness.

400
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,420
Did Shen Ye come here to ask about me?

401
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,380
He didn't ask me anything.

402
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,500
But I have some news

403
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,180
which will make you happy.

404
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,380
Your master is back.

405
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,540
Mr. Su is back.

406
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,060
He's waiting for you in the antechamber.

407
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,580
Your Highness.

408
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,140
Who came back? My master?

409
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,660
It's Mr. Su Moye.

410
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,980
I know

411
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,580
you'd be surprised.

412
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,860
He said he'd be back in half a year

413
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,100
when he left,

414
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:12,980
but

415
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,300
just a month has passed and he's back.

416
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,860
Does Aranya also have a master?

417
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,740
Well. Chacha.

418
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,620
His coming back is a great thing,

419
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,980
but I didn't have a good night's sleep yesterday.

420
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,060
And I have a headache because of the morning wind.

421
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,340
I'm afraid it's not the right time to see him.

422
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,020
So...

423
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,940
You should've avoided the rain yesterday.

424
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,300
I'll get a doctor here

425
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,220
to treat you.

426
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,060
Hold on.

427
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,020
Don't bother.

428
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,700
I just need a rest.

429
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,420
Ask my master to go back.

430
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,940
Tell him I'll go to visit him later.

431
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,540
But...

432
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,660
No but. Go ahead.

433
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,740
Mr. Su, please have some tea.

434
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,220
What's up?

435
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,940
Is Aranya still sleeping?

436
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,540
Yeah.

437
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,380
Did everything go on well with her

438
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,540
during the past month?

439
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,860
Nothing was wrong except that

440
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,260
Her Highness fainted after seeing Prince Qing.

441
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,220
What?

442
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,180
She fainted after seeing Prince Qing?

443
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,660
Her Highness has acted weird these days.

444
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,540
Maybe I thought too much.

445
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,820
Mr. Su,

446
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,300
you'd better go back.

447
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,540
Her Highness is feeling under the weather.

448
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,420
She said

449
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,420
she'd visit you and apologize later.

450
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,260
Mr. Su.

451
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,940
Mr. Su.

452
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,940
Mr. Su.

453
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,260
Is she feeling under the weather?

454
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,460
I haven't seen you for a month. Are you okay?

455
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,500
As my disciple,

456
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,780
wouldn't you let me sit down?

457
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,260
Master, please take a seat.

458
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Shouldn't a master

459
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,980
be as grey-haired and white-bearded

460
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,580
as the Supreme Venerable Lord in the Sky Kingdom?

461
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,420
I can't believe the young man in white

462
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,700
is Aranya's master.

463
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,060
Hi, master.

464
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,500
Have you grasped

465
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,940
what I taught you?

466
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,180
I have a bad memory recently.

467
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,740
I don't know what exactly you mean.

468
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,100
Before I left, I asked you to learn to

469
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,580
dance with Qing.

470
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,660
Dance with Qing?

471
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,220
Where is he?

472
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,340
He's sleeping.

473
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,780
He's also greedy for sleep.

474
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,140
Does he want me to get him a cup of tea?

475
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,860
I wonder

476
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,780
how Aranya gets along with him.

477
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,900
I should've asked about it.

478
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,940
Master, have some tea please.

479
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,260
It sucks.

480
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,860
Does the tea taste bad?

481
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,140
I'll get it changed.

482
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,060
Chacha.

483
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,940
Don't bother.

484
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,540
Let's drink this today.

485
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,900
Have a taste.

486
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,940
Is it good?

487
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,140
Is it familiar?

488
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,500
Yeah.

489
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,700
It's like I've drunk it before.

490
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,620
That's right.

491
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,460
As expected, it's you.

492
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,820
I hope you're well,

493
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,940
Princess Fengjiu.

494
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,380
What did you call me?

495
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,220
Am I not Aranya?

496
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,980
Of course you're not.

497
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,340
The two of you look alike,

498
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,180
but you're completely different.

499
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,500
Who am I?

500
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,780
Fengjiu.

501
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,220
Bai Fengjiu, Princess of Qingqiu.

502
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,580
Let's go.

503
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,980
I'll take you out for a walk.

504
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,940
Do you mean

505
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,100
here is a ward called Dream of Aranya

506
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,060
and it's made of her dream?

507
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,300
Yes.

508
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,260
It's not the real world.

509
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,140
You fell into this world
from the Python Formation in Fanyin Valley.

510
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
You didn't come back after a long time had passed.

511
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,820
You were surrounded by four boa constrictors.

512
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,980
Prince Lian Song thought

513
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,500
Empress of Snakes could drive those boa constrictors away,

514
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,380
so he asked me to save you.

515
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,900
Empress of Snakes?

516
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,460
Right. It's my mother.

517
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,420
Who is Lian Song?

518
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,540
It seems your amnesia is serious.

519
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,060
Second Prince of West Sea, you are here.

520
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,100
Why did you want to see me?

521
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,220
Just now,

522
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,140
Emperor Dong Hua of Tai Chen Palace

523
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,900
and Bai Fengjiu, Princess of Qingqiu,

524
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,620
entered Dream of Aranya in the Python Formation.

525
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,380
They entered Dream of Aranya?

526
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,860
Exactly.

527
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
I remember you lived in Fanyin Valley for years.

528
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,740
You must be familiar with the dream world.

529
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,980
And your mother is Empress of Snakes.

530
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,740
I hope you can enter the dream world

531
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,540
and take them out.

532
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,180
Okay.

533
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,340
Now that we're friends,

534
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,180
I'll take Emperor Dong Hua

535
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,700
and Princess Fengjiu back.

536
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,980
Dong Hua will protect Fengjiu,

537
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,420
but unexpected changes may happen anytime

538
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,100
now that they're in Dream of Aranya.

539
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,380
Once you get there,

540
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,980
the first thing is to find them.

541
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,100
Trust me.

542
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,460
I know what to do.

543
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,500
I didn't expect that

544
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,020
you became Aranya

545
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,140
and even can't remember who Lian Song is.

546
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,660
The dream world is dangerous,

547
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,220
but you took risks to come here for me.

548
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,980
Thank you very much.

549
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,660
But

550
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,620
are you really Aranya's master?

551
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,740
You know I'm someone else at the first sight of me

552
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,540
while nobody else did.

553
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,260
It's true that she's my disciple.

554
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,900
When she was 25,

555
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,420
I took her out of a snake pit

556
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,940
and brought her up.

557
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,100
She's not my descendant,

558
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,940
but I treat her like my own flesh and blood.

559
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,180
I had something to deal with in West Sea,

560
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,260
so I left the valley for two years.

561
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
When I came back here again,

562
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,580
that lively girl had gone,

563
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,540
only leaving

564
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,860
a tomb covered with grass.

565
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,620
But the inseparable king birds stated categorically

566
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,100
she committed suicide.

567
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,380
Committed suicide?

568
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,900
Is she dead?

569
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,540
Yeah.

570
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,980
But I don't buy their story.

571
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,660
Over the past 200 years,

572
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,180
I've been investigating the cause of her death.

573
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,420
But they hid the truth well.

574
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,900
So when

575
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,740
Lian Song asked me to save you

576
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,580
after you fell into Dream of Aranya,

577
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,420
of course I'd come in and have a look

578
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,060
now that it's about Aranya.

579
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,740
Besides,

580
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,540
I also need your help.

581
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,940
You're the only one here who knows about my true identity.

582
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,020
Just let me know if I can be of any help.

583
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,500
The dream world

584
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,380
is created by someone

585
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,860
based on the world where Aranya lived.

586
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,300
Everyone and everything
that existed in Fanyin Valley at that time

587
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,060
can be found here in the dream world.

588
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,540
Anyone of Fanyin Valley

589
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,420
will take the place of the one created correspondingly

590
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,020
if they fall into Dream of Aranya.

591
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,620
For example. When I came here,

592
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,820
Aranya's master,

593
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,300
that is,

594
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,020
the "me" created correspondingly in the dream world,

595
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,780
disappeared at once.

596
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,980
Do you mean

597
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,500
I came into Aranya's body

598
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,020
because Aranya is me

599
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,340
and I am Aranya?

600
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,620
It's a little weird as for your case.

601
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,260
I guess the creator of the dream world

602
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,340
made some small mistakes

603
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,900
because of lack of skills.

604
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,500
Anyone who falls into Dream of Aranya

605
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,180
can't remember what people in their own world look like.

606
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,220
When I just came in,

607
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,260
I already had a vague impression of your appearance.

608
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,300
I think that's a small accident.

609
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,820
Maybe you becoming Aranya

610
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,580
is another accident.

611
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Actually,

612
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,300
nothing but a tomb has left about Aranya.

613
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,380
For the mortal inseparable king birds,

614
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,900
they don't exist anymore if they die.

615
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,820
Anyone in Dream of Aranya

616
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,660
could be replaced

617
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,220
by the corresponding one from Fanyin Valley,

618
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,820
except Aranya.

619
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,340
I have my head in the clouds.

620
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,580
I didn't quite get it.

621
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,700
Forget about it.

622
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,740
Just tell me

623
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,100
what I can do to help you.

624
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,060
After that,

625
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,460
let's figure out a way to leave here.

626
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,260
At the very beginning, the dream world

627
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,140
might be exactly the same as the Fanyin Valley back then,

628
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,740
but as time goes on,

629
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,060
it has nothing to do with the valley anymore.

630
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,900
I guess someone created it

631
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,260
just to change the tragedy that happened to Aranya

632
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,820
so that her life could have a happy ending.

633
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,300
But Aranya is dead.

634
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,780
A happy ending here won't make a difference.

635
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,020
The creator is just deceiving himself and others.

636
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,660
Well.

637
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,820
Now that you're in the body of Aranya,

638
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,780
I hope that you can follow

639
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,780
the choices and decisions Aranya made

640
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,500
so that everything in those years could reappear

641
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
till her death.

642
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,140
Maybe it's the only way you could get out of here

643
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,340
and go back to Qingqiu.

644
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,500
That's also what I need your help with.

645
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,940
I want to know the truth behind Aranya's death.

646
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,260
Isn't there another way to do that?

647
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,060
I'm afraid not.

648
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,140
But I've heard

649
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,660
Aranya was innocent and elegant.

650
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,580
She was otherworldly

651
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,140
and she liked snakes.

652
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,940
How could I be convincing?

653
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,420
These are some letters Aranya wrote to others

654
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,980
when she was alive.

655
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,980
Study them carefully.

656
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,500
As for Prince Qing,

657
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,260
you have to figure out a way yourself.

658
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,660
It's really complicated.

659
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,900
I didn't expect anyone to save me,

660
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,860
but Emperor Dong Hua took risks

661
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,100
to save me.

662
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,540
I have no idea about that either.

663
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,020
All I know about Dong Hua

664
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,380
came from Lian Song.

665
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,820
I don't know what happened between the two of you,

666
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,060
so I can't give you any advice.

667
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,220
It's a little weird.

668
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,620
You two fell into the dream world at the same time.

669
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,100
You should've been at the same place.

670
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,340
Your Excellency.

671
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,860
Take the pills to Princess Junuo

672
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,180
and ask her to have a rest-cure.

673
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,220
Got it.

674
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,380
Xiaobai,

675
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,780
I'll know if you're in Junuo's body

676
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,620
when she's fully recovered.

677
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,540
Quick.

678
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,460
Put it here. Right.

679
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,780
Your Highness.

680
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,700
Your Highness.

681
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,780
Your Highness, do you have a headache again?

682
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,380
No.

683
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,820
I feel much better these days.

684
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,180
Your Highness,

685
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
please say something to Prince Qing.

686
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,620
You were under the weather the other day.

687
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,820
Without seeing you,

688
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,780
Prince Qing has been dispirited for several days.

689
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,220
Really?

690
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,180
Qing...

691
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,900
Qing, be a good boy.

692
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,660
You didn't see me just for a few days.

693
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,020
You don't need to miss me so much.

694
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,140
Your Highness.

695
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,180
Your Highness.

696
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,500
Your Highness.

697
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,500
It scared the hell out of me!

698
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,540
I'm scared to death.

699
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,180
Your Highness, you're awake.

700
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,020
The imperial doctor checked

701
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,540
and said it's nothing serious.

702
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,700
You're just frightened.

703
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,860
But Your Highness,

704
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,500
how could you be frightened

705
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,940
by Prince Qing?

706
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,100
You were very close to each other.

707
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,500
How close?

708
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,820
Prince Qing used to

709
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,340
eat and sleep with you.

710
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,060
You've ignored him for several days.

711
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,860
I really don't have the heart to see him suffer.

712
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,300
Qing is troublesome.

713
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,860
I have no other choice

714
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,540
but to get used to him for the time being.

715
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,780
Um.

716
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,500
Chacha, don't think too much.

717
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,020
I'll be nice to Qing.

718
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,260
That'd be great.

719
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,740
Oh.

720
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,660
What? What's up?

721
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,980
This is a list sent by His Majesty.

722
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,060
It's the list of followers

723
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,620
who'll go to Her Majesty's birthday banquet.

724
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,380
Please have a look.

725
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,380
Followers? What are they going to do?

726
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,340
I've heard that a new cruise is made

727
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
for Her Majesty

728
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,380
and we'll go to Guan Chen Palace in the south

729
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,300
to view camellias.

730
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,940
Shen Ye. Xi Ze. Junuo.

731
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,940
Changdi. Aranya.

732
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,740
I'm also on the list!

733
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,100
You must be kidding.

734
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,460
As the Second Princess,

735
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,980
of course you're on the list.

736
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,180
That'd be great.

737
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,580
Now that we're going to the south,

738
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,260
Qing couldn't board the ship

739
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,180
now that he's such a large snake.

740
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,740
He couldn't have a chance to bother me then.

741
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,900
Oh. Your Highness,

742
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,460
Lord Xi Ze is also on the list.

743
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,260
The two of you should meet each other.

744
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,700
You're husband and wife, anyway.
