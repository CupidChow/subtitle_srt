00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 23

3
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,740
I know you didn't mean what you said.

4
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,940
It's not easy for you to get it over

5
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,620
within such a short time.

6
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,660
That's not true.

7
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,460
I was just thinking about something,

8
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,780
and I didn't see you come in.

9
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,500
Don't deny it.

10
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,100
You've lost a lot of weight since I saw you a few days ago.

11
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,420
Cheng Yu.

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,980
Do you know what Romance-Forgetting Water tastes like?

13
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,180
Come on, Fengjiu.

14
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,420
You can't follow in your aunt's step.

15
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,660
You can't compare us.

16
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,780
Aunt and His Highness Crown Prince...

17
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,180
His Highness has always cared about aunt.

18
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,980
But His Majesty...

19
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,620
He doesn't even know who I am.

20
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,700
Stop talking about him. Let's go.

21
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,820
To where?

22
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,940
Don't stay in the mansion all the time.

23
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,420
I'll show you a good stuff.

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,660
What is it?

25
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,540
Something more tasteful than Romance-Forgetting Water.

26
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,460
Good tea.

27
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,940
This is a new tea I brought back from Mount Qinyao.

28
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,980
God Zhe Yan is such a great predictor.

29
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,020
I just got back from Qingqiu today.

30
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,260
And you knew it right away.

31
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,500
I came here to discuss something

32
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,420
with you.

33
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm all ears.

34
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,140
I have a good friend

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,220
who likes Fengjiu a lot.

36
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,180
He asked me to propose a marriage for him.

37
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,700
I know you treat her well.

38
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,020
I'm wondering...

39
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,940
Your good friend is

40
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,300
Immortal Lord Cang Yi from Mount Zhiyue?

41
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,340
Exactly.

42
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,860
He came across Fengjiu

43
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,780
and fell in love with her at first sight.

44
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,580
So he particularly asked me to be a matchmaker.

45
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,420
I thought he would make a worthy suitor

46
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,060
for Xiaojiu.

47
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,780
So I came here to tell you about it.

48
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,020
But...

49
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,540
I'm not sure if Xiaojiu will like him.

50
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,780
Immortal Lord Cang Yi doesn't come from the gods.

51
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,860
But he manages to keep the mortal realm

52
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,340
thriving with his own power.

53
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,380
Definitely one of the best among junior immortals.

54
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,220
I noticed him earlier.

55
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,020
He and Xiaojiu are well suited.

56
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,260
Li,

57
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,820
what are you doing here?

58
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,940
So the marriage...

59
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,980
I will ask Xiaojiu

60
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,700
about it first.

61
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,300
After all, it depends on her.

62
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,300
Of course.

63
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,020
As the officiator of the marriage,

64
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,460
I even brought the marriage contract.

65
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,620
As long as Fengjiu agrees to it,

66
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,300
we'll get the marriage settled right away.

67
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,420
I know you hate to see her leave.

68
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,660
But she is going to marry someone eventually.

69
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,940
I'm waiting for the wedding feast.

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,540
Silly girl,

71
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,580
you still can't get over him.

72
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,220
I can get over him here.

73
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,580
But not here.

74
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,380
I descended to the mortal realm to help him

75
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,940
experience romance misfortune for paying back the favor.

76
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,820
I made him fall in love with me,

77
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,140
and love me deep into his bones.

78
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,580
And then I ignored him

79
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,700
and hurt him deep into his bones,

80
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,620
so he could end the romance misfortune

81
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,260
thoroughly.

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,860
Now he's back to the Sky Kingdom,

83
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,420
and everything goes smoothly as he wished

84
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,500
with no obstacles.

85
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,740
You'd think I helped him with

86
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,180
his romance misfortune,

87
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,220
paid the favor

88
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,900
and I've fulfilled my wish.

89
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,940
But no one know that I'd wanted to be nice to him

90
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,860
rather than just pay the favor.

91
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,580
I like him so much.

92
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,940
But I had no choice but to hurt him.

93
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
I broke his heart.

94
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,340
But my heart hurt even worse.

95
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,020
Your Majesty, are you feeling okay?

96
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,220
Yeah, I'm fine.

97
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,220
Flowers bloom and fade all the time.

98
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,660
People meet and get together by fate.

99
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,620
Your Majesty,

100
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,500
Si Ming has finished your book of merits

101
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,980
in mortal realm.

102
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,860
Do you want to take a look at it?

103
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,900
No.

104
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,140
Tell me.

105
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,020
How could I get over His Majesty?

106
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,500
The best way is

107
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,420
to find someone

108
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,460
who loves you and cares for you.

109
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,740
Someone who answers to

110
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,620
whatever you say.

111
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,620
Someone who cares about

112
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,380
all your emotions.

113
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,260
With someone being so good to you,

114
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,460
over time,

115
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,900
you will forget about

116
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,500
His Majesty who didn't treat you well.

117
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,900
Right.

118
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,260
You're right.

119
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,100
Okay.

120
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Drink this

121
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,740
and get over His Majesty for good.

122
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,100
Don't get stuck in this over and over again.

123
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,660
I'm a woman from Qingqiu. I need to be decisive.

124
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,660
You are wearing the bracelet

125
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,460
Ye Qingti gave you every day.

126
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,220
How do you feel about him exactly?

127
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,620
If I hadn't gone down to the mortal realm,

128
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,980
and changed the misfortune,

129
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,180
he wouldn't have died.

130
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
I owe him my life.

131
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,140
I will find a way to save his life.

132
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,660
Who's eavesdropping on us?

133
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,540
Don't, don't.

134
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,860
It's me, Lian Song.

135
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,260
It's you.

136
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,580
Cheng Yu,

137
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,740
do what you have to do.

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,460
I'm heading back to Qingqiu.

139
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,340
Bye.

140
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,300
Is it a bad time to come?

141
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,180
What are you doing here?

142
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,820
The short knife is finally finished.

143
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,660
I came here to give it to you.

144
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,260
I should have presented it to you earlier.

145
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,900
But you borrowed my design drawing.

146
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,220
So it took some more time.

147
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,660
It's good that you take it out

148
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,740
when no one else is around.

149
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,940
Or

150
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,820
others may get upset.

151
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,900
It's my present for you.

152
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
It has nothing to do with others.

153
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I'm not in the mood for jokes today.

154
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,380
You can go find others.

155
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,180
Cheng Yu. You...

156
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,620
Cheng Yu.

157
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,260
What do you mean others?

158
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,460
You are confusing me.

159
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,060
Where do I find others?

160
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,180
You promised to go on a date with me last time.

161
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
But you haven't finished it yet.

162
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,700
You ran off in the middle of it.

163
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,900
This time, you have to...

164
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
What exactly do you want?

165
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,820
I want you to promise me

166
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,220
to help me with the ceremony.

167
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,140
You...

168
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
I've got too much work to deal with.

169
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,460
Just help me check the list of people

170
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,140
attending the Mile-fleurs Ceremony, will you?

171
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,220
Why should I?

172
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,260
You promised to go on a date with me last time.

173
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
But you ran off in the middle of it.

174
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,060
If you don't want to help me with the checking,

175
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,100
you can finish the date with me.

176
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm an easygoing person. I can...

177
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,140
If I help you this time,

178
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,540
it'll clean the slate, right?

179
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,100
Of course.

180
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,140
Okay, I'll do it now.

181
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,860
I will get this goddamn deal over!

182
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,460
Cheng Yu, no rush.

183
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
I'm not used to that. Cheng Yu.

184
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,460
It hurts!

185
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,260
Cheng Yu, you...

186
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,380
Wait for me.

187
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,500
These pictures in my head are so unfamiliar.

188
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,780
Are they what I went through in the mortal realm?

189
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,660
Why do I have memories of them?

190
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,740
Who is the woman

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,940
in my dream?

192
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,820
I thought we were going to Yuan Ji Palace.

193
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
Why are we here?

194
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,460
Who said the checking has to be done

195
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
in the room?

196
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,580
You were confined to the room due to your friend.

197
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,860
Why don't you come out and enjoy the flowers with me,

198
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,500
check the list with me

199
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,140
and get your mind out of things with me?

200
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,980
Get my mind out of things?

201
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,900
Okay.

202
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,140
Let me show you

203
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,220
how I get my mind out of things.

204
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,820
I didn't know you

205
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,580
like the short knife so much.

206
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,340
You can't wait to

207
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,540
try the short knife out,

208
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,220
and see if it's handy.

209
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,060
Rascal!

210
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
Your Majesty, pardon me for

211
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,820
disturbing you.

212
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,180
Take it.

213
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

214
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,980
His Majesty has become quite reserved

215
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,900
since he came back from the mortal realm.

216
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,900
Do you think he came across something bad?

217
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,180
You!

218
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,780
He came across something bad?

219
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,260
He's the one who put whoever came across him

220
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,740
through bad things.

221
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,900
He's the last one to come across bad things.

222
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,780
He... he's the worst thing himself.

223
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,300
Get up.

224
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,420
If you are hurt,

225
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,500
I don't need to check the list.

226
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,860
That's not gonna happen.

227
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,460
I've worked so hard to get a yes from you.

228
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,180
Cheng Yu, it's hurting me.

229
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,900
Wait for me.

230
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,940
Sister Fengjiu,

231
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,700
why are you drinking so much liquor?

232
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,820
Don't go in.

233
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,340
Why?

234
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,100
Uncle wants to see you.

235
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:57,980
My father?

236
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,820
Yes.

237
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,420
And he wants you...

238
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,020
Father.

239
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,780
Father.

240
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,300
I miss you so much.

241
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,100
She's very sad.

242
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,500
Look at you.

243
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,820
You are going to be the female monarch of Qingqiu.

244
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,660
Don't act so childish.

245
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,220
Come with me.

246
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,940
Father.

247
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm sorry to get you mad again.

248
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,340
Before I went traveling,

249
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,300
I told you that

250
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,540
you are the natural successor of the female monarch of Qingqiu.

251
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,980
You can't do whatever you want like you did before.

252
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,820
Do you remember

253
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,540
how you promised me?

254
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,300
And what have you done during my travel?

255
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,540
You descended to the mortal realm in secret

256
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,380
and even mourned for a mortal.

257
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,940
How absurd!

258
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,260
Raise your head and look me in the eye!

259
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
You are the future female monarch of Qingqiu.

260
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,780
You were born to be different than others.

261
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,780
Others can do whatever they want.

262
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,940
But you can't.

263
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,060
After a few more years,

264
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,620
you will take the place as the female monarch of Qingqiu.

265
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,420
If you keep behaving like this,

266
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,540
how are you going to shoulder

267
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,780
the responsibility as the female monarch of Qingqiu?

268
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,180
Father.

269
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,060
I'm sorry that I upset you again.

270
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,140
I was so silly.

271
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,820
I shouldn't have gone to the mortal realm.

272
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,340
I shouldn't have...

273
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,060
I'll let it go this time.

274
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,660
But this is a little lesson for you.

275
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,860
Don't make the same mistake ever again.

276
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,100
Got it.

277
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,180
From tomorrow,

278
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,060
you have to spend more time

279
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,860
on study,

280
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,340
making up for those lessons that you've missed.

281
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,380
Okay, father.

282
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,860
Keep in mind

283
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,660
what I said.

284
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,740
Are you clear?

285
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,460
Yes.

286
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,620
And one more thing.

287
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,940
God Zhe Yan came here today to propose a marriage

288
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,820
for Immortal Lord Cang Yi from Mount Zhiyue.

289
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
He even brought the marriage contract.

290
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,820
What's your idea about this marriage?

291
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,580
Tell me.

292
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,820
How could I get over His Majesty?

293
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,260
The best way is

294
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,300
to find someone

295
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,380
who loves you and cares for you.

296
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
Someone who answers to

297
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,060
whatever you say.

298
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,780
Someone who cares about

299
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,740
all your emotions.

300
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,700
With someone being so good to you,

301
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,460
over time,

302
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
you will forget about

303
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,940
His Majesty who didn't treat you well.

304
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,100
I'll ask you again when you are sober.

305
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,020
I agree.

306
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,420
I will marry him.

307
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,100
You have to think it through.

308
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,660
Marriage is a big thing.

309
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,580
It's no joke.

310
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,500
Immortal Lord Cang Yi.

311
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,460
I don't know him.

312
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,220
Great! Great!

313
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,980
Right in time.

314
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,420
You have to think it through.

315
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
It's time for me to find my fate.

316
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,940
To love someone and forget someone else.

317
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,620
I want nothing.

318
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:03,860
Father,

319
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,860
you can look forward to my wedding now.

320
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,780
Go.

321
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,180
Yes.

322
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,460
Don't keep Lord Cheng Yu waiting.

323
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,340
I am so gracious with my work.

324
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,100
Lord Cheng Yu will definitely be impressed.

325
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:38,820
Chong Lin.

326
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,100
Third Prince.

327
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,380
His Majesty has come back.

328
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,380
But why are you looking so unhappy?

329
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,940
After His Majesty got back,

330
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,300
he seems worried.

331
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,300
And he wanted to check the book of merits of the mortal realm.

332
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,180
I wonder if there's anything wrong.

333
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,380
He didn't say.

334
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,100
So I dared not to ask.

335
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,020
Okay.

336
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,220
You can go and ask Si Ming to come now.

337
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:07,980
Yes.

338
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,100
Did you get the tea

339
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,900
from Immortal Lord Xi Hai?

340
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,900
It's said that the tea buds once in 3000 years.

341
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,460
How rare!

342
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,220
You finally got Lord Cheng Yu to

343
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,260
help you with the busy work.

344
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,260
Why do you have time to come here studying tea?

345
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,580
Although Cheng Yu matters to me,

346
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,780
you also

347
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,780
matters to me greatly.

348
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,060
It's not like you

349
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,100
to have such a solemn expression.

350
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,900
If my memory serves me right,

351
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,580
last time I saw this expression is hundreds of years ago

352
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,140
when Lord Cheng Yu left the mortal realm and went up the heaven.

353
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,180
If I didn't know you so well,

354
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,580
I would have thought that you are being jealous.

355
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,820
You put a lot of thought

356
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,140
to trick her into checking the list.

357
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,660
But now you are here at my place.

358
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,060
If I didn't know you so well,

359
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,860
I would have thought that something happens to you.

360
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,460
Your Majesty.

361
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,660
Third Prince.

362
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,100
You can have Chong Lin deliver it to me.

363
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,060
Why bother yourself?

364
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,500
You didn't want to read

365
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,420
the book of merits in mortal realm before.

366
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,180
But you changed your mind all of a sudden.

367
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,540
I'm afraid that there's something wrong.

368
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,300
So I came here myself.

369
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
If there's anything that Your Majesty have doubt on,

370
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,620
I can explain to you.

371
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,500
Put it there.

372
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,900
If there's nothing I can help with,

373
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,820
please excuse me,

374
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,220
Your Majesty.

375
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,820
Looks like I'm not overly concerned.

376
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,900
When I first heard that you wanted to know about

377
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,300
your misfortune in mortal realm, I was worried.

378
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,900
Strange as things are,there must be something wrong.

379
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
I've got more curious

380
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,460
after seeing it today.

381
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,820
What are you curious about?

382
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,820
The first curiosity is with Si Ming,

383
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,740
who's so careful.

384
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,180
But given his character,

385
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,780
it sort of makes sense.

386
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,700
But the second curiosity.

387
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,860
Only you can tell me about it.

388
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,980
Why would Emperor Dong Hua, who's always been indifferent,

389
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,380
suddenly become interested in

390
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,020
his misfortune in the mortal realm?

391
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,260
If you feel like something isn't right,

392
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,180
you can ask me.

393
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,900
Perhaps I can give some advice.

394
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,820
Anything wrong?

395
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,180
Do you mind

396
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,940
if I take a look at it?

397
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,580
You were the emperor of State of Chengyu in the mortal realm.

398
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,220
A woman named Zhou Mengxi saved you in the war.

399
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,660
You fell in love with Zhou Mengxi.

400
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,980
But she died of illness very soon.

401
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,660
And not long after that, you died of grief.

402
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,380
It turns out that you were such a romantic in the mortal realm.

403
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,020
Anything wrong?

404
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,020
Why is it wrong?

405
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,540
There's nothing wrong.

406
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,820
I just feel like it doesn't match

407
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,380
my memory.

408
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,620
What memory do you have?

409
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,300
The experience in the mortal realm is like a dream.

410
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,380
You are not a man with obsession.

411
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,100
If it's nothing serious,

412
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,260
just let it go.

413
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,500
Don't hold on to it.

414
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,540
Well, then,

415
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,060
your feelings for Cheng Yu. You should let it go, too.

416
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,500
Lovesickness is also a form of happiness.

417
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,380
You don't understand.

418
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,580
Oh, I've got something to deal with.

419
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,740
I have to go now.

420
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,260
You're finally back.

421
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,660
You left all the work to me,

422
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,700
and got away yourself.

423
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,260
I thought you had left.

424
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,780
Am I an irresponsible person?

425
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,580
Of course not.

426
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,580
I'm not like you.

427
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,420
Cheng Yu.

428
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,260
I have something important

429
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,740
that I want you to answer me seriously.

430
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,220
Can you...

431
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,940
The person that you are trying to protect.

432
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,700
Your friend.

433
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,420
I don't want to know how she's involved in

434
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,620
His Majesty's misfortune.

435
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,300
But the safety of His Majesty

436
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,700
matters to the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

437
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,060
which involves a lot of things.

438
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,140
Things that you even can't imagine.

439
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,460
It's okay that you don't want others to know about it.

440
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,260
But you have to make sure that

441
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,060
what you have done

442
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,420
won't put His Majesty in danger.

443
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,300
We have no intention to hurt

444
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,740
His Majesty at all.

445
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,060
The thing is...

446
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
we can't tell anyone about it.

447
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,500
There's a reason for it.

448
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,740
She didn't do it on purpose.

449
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,260
Don't worry.

450
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
It won't happen again.

451
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,460
She...

452
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,940
dares not try again.

453
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,020
Cheng Yu.

454
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,140
Does it mean I've done you a favor again?

455
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,820
Do you owe me once again?

456
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,820
How stupid I am to believe

457
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,620
you could talk seriously!

458
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,380
I almost got tricked again.

459
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,620
I'll take that as a yes.

460
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,140
I'll be an idiot if I answer it.

461
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,500
I'd better get the list checking done

462
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,460
and clean the slate

463
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,260
thoroughly.

464
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,460
No.

465
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,500
You have to answer it first. You can't just...

466
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,340
I have nothing to say.

467
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,940
I...

468
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,820
Damn.

469
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,740
I just wanted to make fun and

470
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,620
change the serious atmosphere.

471
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,580
Now I'm screwed.

472
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,300
Do you believe that I didn't mean that at all?

473
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,980
You know the answer already.

474
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,980
Lord.

475
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,740
Let's talk it through.

476
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,300
A gentleman uses his tongue but not his fists.

477
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,300
I'll let my fists talk to you.

478
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,700
Is that okay?

479
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,540
Don't hit me.

480
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,300
Stop there.

481
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,060
Don't hit me.

482
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,460
Li,

483
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,780
you can't play with your mother's phoenix crown.

484
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,180
Sister Fengjiu, it's yours.

485
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,940
What?

486
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,620
You promised uncle a few days ago

487
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,860
to marry Immortal Lord Cang Yi,

488
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,380
and signed the marriage contract.

489
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,260
So Immortal Lord Cang Yi
had the betrothal gifts delivered the next day.

490
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,220
What?

491
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,180
God Zhe Yan came here today to propose a marriage

492
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,100
for Immortal Lord Cang Yi from Mount Zhiyue.

493
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,820
He even brought the marriage contract.

494
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,620
I agree.

495
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,900
I will marry him.

496
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,420
No.

497
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,420
No.

498
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,500
Sister Fengjiu, where are you going?

499
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,940
I'll go ask about it.

500
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,380
Father.

501
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,300
The marriage that I agreed when I was drunk a few days ago.

502
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,620
Please cancel it for me.

503
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,780
You have made the promise yourself.

504
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,100
As the future female monarch of Qingqiu,

505
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,900
how could you go back on your words?

506
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,100
Father,

507
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,060
I don't want to get married yet.

508
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,140
I want to spend more time with you.

509
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,820
If you don't want to get married,

510
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,580
you shouldn't have fingerprinted that day.

511
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,180
I was drunk and dizzy then.

512
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,220
That doesn't count.

513
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:53,980
It's too late.

514
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,620
I have replied to God Zhe Yan.

515
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,260
The engagement is settled, and the wedding date will be set.

516
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,580
You can start preparing for it now.

517
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,700
Father,

518
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,380
are you going to risk my happiness?

519
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,700
Xiaojiu.

520
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,980
You've made the choice.

521
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Before doing it,

522
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,500
you should have thought it through,

523
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,540
instead of being impulsive.

524
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,820
Now you've made the decision,

525
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,540
you should not regret it.

526
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,540
You have to be responsible for yourself.

527
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,300
I can't help you

528
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,340
this time.

529
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,780
That's bad.

530
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,580
Sister Fengjiu,

531
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,460
where are you going?

532
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,020
I have to leave here.

533
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,940
Sister Fengjiu, are you going to run away from wedding?

534
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,660
Your mother said it.

535
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Run if you can't beat the enemy.

536
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,140
I have to break off the marriage.

537
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,620
The best way is to flee.

538
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,460
Sister Fengjiu, why don't you ask my mother

539
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,140
to speak for you?

540
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,700
Your mother is getting married soon.

541
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,420
How can I bother her at this time?

542
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,900
Who else can speak for you then?

543
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,580
Since you mention it,

544
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,980
I think of someone.

545
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,500
So

546
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,220
you are planning on escaping?

547
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,540
Yeah.

548
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,820
It's all your fault, uncle.

549
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,860
My fault?

550
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,060
When God Zhe Yan proposed the marriage

551
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,980
for Immortal Lord Cang Yi,

552
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,260
why didn't you stop him?

553
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,180
So you have to be on my side

554
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,500
no matter what happens now.

555
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,220
But it's you who nodded the marriage.

556
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,620
On what ground should I help you?

557
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,140
You know I drank a little then.

558
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,380
But uncle.

559
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,180
You have to persuade my father to cancel the marriage,

560
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,860
so that I don't have to run away.

561
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,380
But it seems like father is determined

562
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,660
to marry me off.

563
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,740
You

564
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,260
are such a pain in the ass.

565
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,860
God,

566
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,860
Immortal Lord Cang Yi from Mount Zhiyue sent a letter.

567
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,580
You can go out now.

568
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,500
Yes.

569
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,180
Brother.

570
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,580
What does the letter say?

571
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,340
Did Immortal Lord Cang Yi change his mind?

572
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,620
The mortal realm is in turmoil.

573
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,660
Immortal Lord Cang Yi has gone down to deal with troubles.

574
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,780
He can't escort the bride on the wedding day.

575
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,740
Brother,

576
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,580
Immortal Lord Cang Yi

577
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
can't even escort the bride back on the wedding day.

578
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,660
I'm afraid he doesn't really like Fengjiu.

579
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,260
I think

580
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,460
we should cancel the marriage.

581
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,940
On Qianqian's wedding day,

582
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,900
Prince Ye Hua can't escort her either.

583
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,020
Does it mean their wedding

584
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,340
has to be canceled?

585
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,660
Brother escorting the bride has been a tradition in the gods.

586
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,420
But they don't have such a tradition in Mount Zhiyue.

587
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,540
Besides, Xiaojiu is unwilling to

588
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,060
marry Immortal Lord Cang Yi.

589
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,100
Why do you have to force her into it?

590
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,220
I know.

591
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,460
You've doted on Xiaojiu.

592
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,020
But it is different this time.

593
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,060
Xiaojiu agreed the marriage,

594
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,060
and signed the marriage contract herself.

595
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,860
How can she break off the engagement now?

596
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
A dishonest man

597
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,860
can't survive in this world.

598
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,620
How would people in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions

599
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,620
view us?

600
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,900
Brother.

601
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:47,860
That's enough.

602
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,260
Say no more.

603
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,100
The marriage will not be canceled.

604
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,860
Xiaojiu

605
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,380
should learn to grow up.

606
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,100
Do you know who is Immortal Lord Cang Yi?

607
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,220
He is one of the best among junior immortals

608
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,860
after chaotic era.

609
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,180
And he is the best

610
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,540
of the best.

611
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,980
Such a man sees in Xiaojiu.

612
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,020
And he's not roundabout at all.

613
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,820
Instead he asked God Zhe Yan to be his matchmaker very openly.

614
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,980
The great achievements he's accomplished

615
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,020
in thriving the mortal realm for tens of thousands of years

616
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,940
and his forthrightness toward the marriage

617
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,580
really deserve to be respected.

618
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,940
But as a princess,

619
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,620
Xiaojiu

620
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,580
came back from the mortal realm

621
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,980
and even mourned for a mortal.

622
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,740
She just made a fool of herself.

623
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,900
She acted so recklessly before

624
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,980
and now she wants to break off the marriage.

625
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,660
If I let her do that,

626
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
She will definitely cause great troubles in the future.

627
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,540
Since Xiaojiu was appointed
to succeed the monarch of East Desert,

628
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,980
she has never done anything correct.

629
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,740
The most important thing for me now

630
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,460
is to find her an excellent husband

631
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,700
to help her reinforce the throne.

632
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,540
Immortal Lord Cang Yi

633
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,220
will be a perfect choice.

634
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,220
He's such a good person.

635
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,180
We can't afford to insult him.

636
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,020
Don't you speak for Xiaojiu anymore.

637
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,500
If you want to do something for her own good,

638
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,860
you should persuade her into marrying.

639
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:27,780
Brother.

640
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
I know this man has so many merits.

641
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,620
But does it matter more than her happiness?

642
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,900
It's her happiness we're talking about.

643
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,580
Is marrying a suitable man more important

644
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,380
than being happy?

645
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,660
Fourth brother.

646
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,700
You've been an immortal for quite a long time.

647
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,420
Do you actually think everything
will go the way we want as immortals?

648
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,940
We couldn't ask for more

649
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,380
if things don't go the wrong way.

650
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,500
Immortal Lord Cang Yi

651
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,140
will be a saving grace for Xiaojiu

652
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
in becoming a qualified Princess of Qingqiu.

653
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,580
She can't go wrong any more.

654
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,500
There's no other way.

655
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,580
Looks like I have no choice but to run.

656
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,020
Sister Fengjiu,

657
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,820
but you can't just hide yourself

658
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,460
until the wedding day.

659
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,940
Maybe we can find another way.

660
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,700
There's no other way out.

661
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,460
Unless Immortal Lord Cang Yi doesn't marry you,

662
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,340
there doesn't seem to be a better way.

663
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,420
Right.

664
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,260
I should have thought of it sooner.

665
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,100
Sister Fengjiu, where are you going?

666
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,900
Li, take it.

667
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,860
You go back

668
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,460
and tell my father that I'll go meet Cang Yi.

669
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,540
I can work it out myself.

670
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,740
Uncle, uncle.

671
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,940
Uncle, uncle.

672
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,540
Something's up.

673
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,420
Li.

674
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,700
Slow down.

675
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,620
A real man has to keep

676
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,420
calm in face of changes.

677
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,340
But...

678
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,420
Sit down.

679
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,140
Catch your breath first.

680
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
You catch your breath now?

681
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,260
Okay, go ahead.

682
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,140
Sister Fengjiu wanted me to

683
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,740
tell you that she would answer to what she did.

684
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,500
She would take care of the engagement on her own.

685
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,540
And you don't have to worry about it.

686
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,780
It's good that she comes around.

687
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,420
Where is she now?

688
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,180
Sister Fengjiu went to Mount Zhiyue alone

689
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,580
to break if off with Immortal Lord Cang Yi.

690
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,740
What?

691
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:49,860
She...

692
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,380
Uncle.

693
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,900
A real man has to keep calm in face of changes.

694
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,060
Catch your breath.

695
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,060
Immortal Lord Cang Yi.

696
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,220
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu. I came here to see you.

697
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,500
I'm about to go to the mortal realm to deal with troubles.

698
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,820
I didn't expect to see you

699
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,100
before I leave.

700
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,220
We really are destined, aren't we?

701
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,100
Immortal Lord Cang Yi.

702
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,820
There's a misunderstanding.

703
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,500
Misunderstanding?

704
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,500
How come?

705
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,740
I didn't have chance to

706
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,260
show my feelings for you before.

707
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
But since I saw you saving a young boy

708
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
in the temple fair,

709
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,500
I have fallen in love with you.

710
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,580
I can swear to god that

711
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,220
my feelings for you

712
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,540
have been real.

713
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,140
I want to get married with you

714
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,260
and spend the rest of my life with you.

715
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,860
Immortal Lord Cang Yi,

716
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,100
I don't want to marry you at all.

717
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,460
I'm sorry that I signed the marriage contract

718
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,260
when I was drunk.

719
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,860
We should cancel it.

720
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:08,980
Why?

721
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,780
I'm aware that

722
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,620
you don't know me yet.

723
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,660
But that's not a problem.

724
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,020
If we are together all the time,

725
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,660
you will fall in love with me.

726
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,380
I heard from God Zhe Yan that

727
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,060
you are still young and fond of play.

728
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,180
So I found some novelties for you

729
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,780
in mountains of Immortals in the mortal realm.

730
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,300
You can take them now if you like them.

731
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,540
I will treat you better in the future.

732
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,420
I know how you feel for me.

733
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,420
I really appreciate it.

734
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,140
But I have promised to mourn for someone.

735
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,420
I can't get married during the period of time.

736
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,300
I've heard about things

737
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,460
between you and the mortal.

738
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,300
A mortal can't dominate

739
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,740
his death.

740
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,220
I don't really care about it.

741
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,340
But I'm indebted to him.

742
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,660
So I've kept my promise to mourn for him.

743
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,620
I'm willing to mourn for him with you

744
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,340
and pay back the favor together with you.

745
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,860
Immortal Lord Cang Yi,

746
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,380
I will ask you one last time.

747
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,060
Are you going to cancel the marriage or not?

748
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,140
No.

749
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,420
Fine.

750
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,340
Then I'll deal with it our way in Qingqiu.

751
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,740
I am the Princess of Qingqiu.

752
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,140
So my husband has to be better than me in every aspect.

753
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,500
Let's have a fight.

754
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,540
If you win,

755
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,900
I will say yes to the marriage.

756
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,940
But if you lose,

757
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
the marriage has to be canceled.

758
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,980
You must be joking.

759
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,500
I've always respected female immortals.

760
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,220
I will never fight with a female immortal.

761
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,740
Since you don't want

762
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,900
to fight with me,

763
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,820
I'll take it as your acquiescence

764
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,660
of canceling the marriage.

765
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,300
Thank you so much.

766
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,740
Wait.

767
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,980
My feelings for you are real.

768
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,260
Since you want to test me,

769
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,660
I will accept the challenge.

770
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,140
Be careful.

771
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,780
Are you okay?

772
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,980
There's no clear winner yet.

773
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,700
Let's go on.

774
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,780
Stop.
