Eternal Love of Dream

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 42

3
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,900
How come I'm lying in it?

4
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,860
Is it the real me?

5
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,900
Your Majesty?

6
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,820
Your Majesty.

7
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,940
Xiaobai,

8
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,700
you're back.

9
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,620
It's great.

10
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,860
Be careful, Your Majesty.

11
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,100
Hide yourself.

12
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,980
What's on earth going on here?

13
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,020
Is that banshee

14
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,180
the one who fought with His Majesty

15
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,860
in the Fanyin Valley earlier?

16
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,700
Your Majesty.

17
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,060
Your Majesty.

18
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,860
It's fine, Nuo.

19
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,380
Everything's fine.

20
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,860
Shen Ye has finally saved you.

21
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,540
Mother, did you go beg him to save me?

22
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,940
Your father once saved him when he was alive,

23
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,740
which can be regarded as a great favor for him and his mother.

24
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,100
That he saved your life this time

25
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,060
can be counted as a reward from him.

26
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,940
But I feel sorry to

27
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,180
get Shen Ye involved.

28
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,020
I know what you're thinking.

29
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,900
You always have a thing for Shen Ye,

30
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,820
and there's an engagement between you.

31
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,540
But

32
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,460
his feeling for you is always ambiguous.

33
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,740
You made the mistake,

34
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,380
since you weren't willing to accept the way he treated you.

35
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,700
You made the mistake in a moment of weakness.

36
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,620
If there should be someone to take the responsibility,

37
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,380
Shen Ye should take it.

38
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,700
I'm not a filial daughter.

39
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,900
I let you down, mother.

40
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,980
Don't worry, Nuo.

41
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,700
Xiangli Que has promised me

42
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,900
that you can live in the imperial palace for more days.

43
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,740
Feel free to live here

44
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,060
and nurse your health.

45
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,100
Later,

46
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,060
I'll make good preparations

47
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,700
for your leaving in person.

48
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,300
Remember,

49
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,500
I will choose the proper timing

50
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,860
to make you return to the imperial palace.

51
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,620
What a strong smell of blood!

52
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,660
Your Majesty.

53
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,540
Your Majesty.

54
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,900
Your Majesty.

55
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,300
Xiaobai,

56
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
you finally wake up.

57
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,340
Your Majesty,

58
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:40,980

Let me lean against you for a while.

You... You can't just lean against me.

77
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,180
You have to lie down

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,220

But I didn't ask you to push me to the stone.

83
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,980
I didn't feel the pain when I pushed you, so I did it.

84

Don't make me talk to you.

85
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,380
I can feel the pain when I talk to you.

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,820
Do you think you can subdue me

115
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,620
the same as you did in the Fanyin Valley that year?

116
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,620
Only a shape can hurt you.

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,020

118
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,540
Wait and see.

119
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,900
You don't feel the pain anymore?

120
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,460
Can you talk to me for a while?

121
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,500
Of course.

122
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,660
I'm afraid I can only shout

123
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,860
due to the distance between us.

124
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,260
Why do you come here, Your Majesty?

125
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,300
Because you're here.

126
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,780
I come here for you.

127
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,740
For me?

128
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,220
Why do you come to me

129
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,540
rather than staying with your Ji Heng?

130
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,860
My Ji Heng?

131
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,380
Why do you think so?

132
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,740
Because I have remembered everything.

133
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
I've remembered

134
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,780
how hard

135
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,900
I tried to find pimpon fruit earlier.

136
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,060
You gave it to her

137
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,100
as soon as she asked.

138
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,460
If you hadn't fallen for Ji Heng and wanted to flatter her,

139
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,700
why would you have given it to her so easily?

140
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,220
I'm sorry for the pimpon fruit thing.

141
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,540
I didn't intend to give it to you at the first place.

142
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,220
Ji Heng came to me later,

143
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,100
and she said pimpon fruit could detoxify her Qiushui Cold Toxin.

144
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,620
The fruit was useless to me,

145
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,220
so I gave it to her without a hitch.

146
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,540
So it means

147
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,780
that Ji Heng got pimpon fruit

148
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,860
wasn't well planned by you at the first place.

149
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,500
It's because you never intended to give me,

150
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,980
and you gave it to her without a hitch.

151
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,340
Why didn't you want to give it to me?

152
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,020
Because

153
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
I thought you would make a cake

154
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,300
with pimpon fruit for Yan Chiwu.

155
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,660
I was jealous of him.

156
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,780
You were jealous?

157
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,380
That you were jealous of Yan wasn't because of Ji Heng?

158
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,540
Xiaobai,

159
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,820
why do you always mention those who don't matter?

160
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,220
Are you still mad at me?

161
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,980
What can I do

162
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,140
to make you believe that I like you, Xiaobai?

163
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,420
What do you want me to do?

164
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,860
Will giving my heart to you work?

165
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,540
If I hadn't liked you,

166
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,980
why should I have stepped into the Dream of Aranya?

167
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,660
Your Majesty.

168
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,020
I've already known

169
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,740
what you've done for me, Xiaobai.

170
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
You're bleeding again.

171
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,140
It doesn't matter.

172
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
When the banshee attacked you,

173
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,780
why didn't you dodge?

174
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,340
And you made yourself hurt.

175
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
What are you saying?

176
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,660
I can't hear you.

177
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,180
You can hear me clearly.

178
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,580
Are you sure

179
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,740
that you want to ask me these

180
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,380
instead of others?

181
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,460
You could have used your magic arts.

182
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,900
Why not use them?

183
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,980
Maybe

184
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,220
I want to show off my superb kung fu.

185
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,220
Xiaobai,

186
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,060
that you don't talk to me

187
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,940
is because I didn't kiss you well just now,

188
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,420
or I didn't flatter you?

189
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,340
Please excuse me.

190
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,580
I don't have much experience in this aspect,

191
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,140
and I'll learn from you in the future.

192
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,660
Learn from me?

193
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,900
You're as bold as brass.

194
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,140
I think you're supposed to prefer
some pure and naive immortal nymph.

195
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
It all depends.

196
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,340
It all depends?

197
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,020
It depends on you, Xiaobai.

198
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,460
You don't intend to respond me, do you?

199
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,100
Respond you?

200
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,780
Who knows you're telling the truth or just kidding me this time?

201
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,940
There's

202
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,540
something that I can almost recall,

203
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,580
but I don't seem to recall it clearly.

204
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,500
There may be something wrong.

205
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,620
Your Majesty,

206
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,300
do you really come here for me?

207
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,500
I'm used to being alone.

208
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,460
But if you cheat on me over and over,

209
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,740
even I won't be able to stand it.

210
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,060
Xiaobai,

211
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,540
there's too much misunderstanding between us.

212
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,020
Dream of Aranya is bizarre and motley.

213
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,980
And your primordial spirit just came back to your own body.

214
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,860
Your primordial spirit wasn't peaceful,

215
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,620
and now there's other spiritual one mixed in,

216
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,060
which will lead to more odds.

217
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,780
We shouldn't talk here for too long.

218
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,740
When we leave the Dream of Aranya,

219
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,460
I'll tell you the truth to clear up
all the misunderstandings on your mind.

220
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,460
Xiaobai,

221
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,660
you have no idea why you're here.

222
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,420
It's because you were hurt heavily.

223
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,180
I nursed your health with my blood for a long time.

224
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,300
To make you recover soon,

225
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,260
I led you to the Dream of Aranya for recuperation.

226
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,780
I didn't lie to you.

227
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,260
I came here for you.

228
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,220
In the Dream of Aranya, I'm Xi Ze,

229
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
and you're Aranya.

230
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,980
We're supposed to be a couple.

231
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,460
I'll definitely protect you.

232
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,060
When everything comes to an end,

233
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,780
I'll tell you the truth in person.

234
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,580
You're Xi Ze,

235
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,300
and we are married.

236
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,660
You took me to see Yueling flowers,

237
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,620
and sang a song for me.

238
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,220
I remembered. I remembered it all.

239
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,340
Then sing one more for me.

240
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,020
Why should I?

241
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,900
I feel too painful to fall asleep.

242
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,940
If such a brave person says it hurts,

243
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,220
he must be badly hurt.

244
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,660
Come here.

245
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,980
Sing it.

246
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,780
Yueling flowers, the snow in the sky.

247
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,740
They start to wither when they just bloom.

248
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,780
Once exuberant, once withered.

249
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,580
Once exuberant, once withered.

250
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,620
They wither when the moon comes out.

251
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,420
They bloom when the moon disappears.

252
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Yueling flowers don't know

253
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,300
they never meet the moon.

254
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,780
They bloom in an instant.

255
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,260
They wither in an instant.

256
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,020
The instants witness their blooming and withering.

257
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,220
They wither when the moon comes out.

258
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,220
They bloom when the moon disappears.

259
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,060
Xiaobai,

260
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,780
I won't hurt your feelings anymore.

261
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,860
You still remember what I said that night.

262
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,540
More than what you said that night.

263
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,580
I also heard a song when I was a child,

264
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,020
which was different from what you sang.

265
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,380
Let me sing it for you.

266
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,660
You can also sing?

267
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,500
When a full moon night comes,

268
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,340
Moonlight shines on the mountain.

269
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,300
Down the mountain stands a short fence.

270
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,300
A girl sows a pile of green beans.

271
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,340
Green vines twine the fence.

272
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,380
On the green vines bloom green flowers.

273
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,540
Pick a green flower to make the nectar.

274
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,020
Pick a green flower to make sweets.

275
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,500
I also heard the song,

276
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,180
but the last lyric

277
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,260
should be "pick a green flower as a dowry."

278
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,420
On the green vines bloom green flowers.

279
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,220
Pick a green flower as a dowry.

280
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,020
The lyric should be like this,

281
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,620
but you change the last one.

282
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,380
You like to have sweets?

283
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
Your Majesty,

284
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,300
if you like to have sweets,

285
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,220
don't be too embarrassed to acknowledge it.

286
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,420
There's nothing embarrassing

287
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,980
that a man likes to have sweets.

288
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,220
If I had sweets,

289
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,100
I should like them.

290
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,900
I've never seen my parents,

291
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,940
and I haven't had sweets since I was a child.

292
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,340
When I see someone having sweets,

293
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,820
I may feel envious.

294
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,740
Will you make sweets for me?

295
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,740
I'll make sweets for you.

296
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,020
I'm an expert at making sweets.

297
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
When we come out,

298
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,980
I'll take you home.

299
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,220
I didn't feel homesick,

300
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,700
since I forgot everything.

301
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,620
But now I've been

302
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
in the Dream of Aranya for a while.

303
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,060
It has been long since I left Qingqiu.

304
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,500
I feel homesick.

305
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,900
Then we'll go back to Qingqiu first after we leave here.

306
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,180
Well,

307
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,540
Moye said

308
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,820
if I want to leave the Dream of Aranya,

309
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,900
I should go through Aranya's life

310
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,540
as same as she did.

311
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,340
It's fine that you do what he said.

312
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,740
I'll take care of the rest.

313
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,860
I know you prefer a quiet place,

314
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,660
so I especially arrange the secluded Mengchun Courtyard for you.

315
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,620
If you're not satisfied,

316
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,100
there are other courtyards that can be arranged in the mansion.

317
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,780
If you need anything,

318
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,020
just instruct me.

319
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,260
Hard to divert myself from troubles.

320
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,460
Why so urgent?

321
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,260
Life has diversity.

322
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,060
Fate is sealed.

323
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,580
Worry and horror

324
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,140
will always come to an end.

325
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,260
Her Highness usually likes to practice calligraphy.

326
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,220
She always writes some inscriptions.

327
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,500
It's the one Her Highness wrote in person.

328
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,980
I know.

329
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,020
I can recognize her handwriting.

330
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,380
Let's go.

331
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,420
Yes, Your Excellency.

332
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,100
It's been two hundred years.

333
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,620
We finally reach the last step

334
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,620
after countless repetitions.

335
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,820
Xiaobai looks almost the same as Aranya.

336
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,460
Now Xiaobai's primordial spirit
comes to her own body spontaneously,

337
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,540
which is really uncanny.

338
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,420
Aranya's body is still in the Water Moon Pond.

339
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,180
Xiaobai's primordial spirit comes to her own body

340
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,940
while Aranya's body disappears.

341
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Does it mean Xiaobai replace Aranya?

342
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,260
Aranya was born hundreds of years ago,

343
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,020
when Xiaobai should be cultivated in Qingqiu.

344
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,780
The only time that she was away from Qingqiu for a long time

345
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,820
was when she went to the mortal realm
to experience misfortune for me.

346
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,900
It means

347
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,900
when Aranya was born,

348
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,060
it's impossible for Xiaobai to be in the Fanyin Valley.

349
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,380
But there must be some connections between them.

350
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,220
If I have Miaohua Mirror

351
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,020
to help discover the past and present life of Aranya,

352
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,940
I'll figure out everything.

353
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,660
You wake up?

354
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,020
Get up, if you wake up.

355
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,060
I didn't seem to have a good sleep last night.

356
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,420
How come I feel sore all over my body?

357
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,620
Are you sure that the one who didn't have a good sleep

358
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,580
is you instead of me?

359
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,140
I have to go back to the Qi Nan Palace.

360
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,780
You have a good rest here.

361
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,420
You can go to the Qi Nan Palace, if you need me.

362
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,340
You have to be Aranya here

363
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,180
while I have to be Lord Xi Ze.

364
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,100
To avoid troubles,

365
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,580
I've wiped off the phoenix feather flower on your forehead,

366
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,300
and cast the Correction Magic on everyone here.

367
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,500
They will confirmedly believe

368
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,100
that you're Aranya.

369
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,300
Xiaobai,

370
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,940
there won't be any danger for you.

371
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,700
Well,

372
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,220
you exactly remind me.

373
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Shall I make a cut

374
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,100
on my hand?

375
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,780
Otherwise they may not regard me as Aranya.

376
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,940
Aren't you afraid of pain?

377
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,460
Forget it. I'm afraid of pain. Let's not do it.

378
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,420
I'm done.

379
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100
You got smarter.

380
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,140
Is it like the paw you bandaged

381
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,220
for the little fox in the Ten-evil Lotus Land?

382
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,140
At that time, you were so stupid

383
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,420
to get your hand hurt

384
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,980
by the fireball you spat out yourself.

385
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,380
I was not stupid. I didn't act like that normally.

386
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,900
I will only be away for a few days.

387
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,100
You go back first.

388
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,060
You should take good care of your wound.

389
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,860
Behave yourself.

390
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,300
Your Highness, you wake up.

391
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,340
Do you feel well?

392
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,980
Do you feel uncomfortable?

393
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,860
Does your wound hurt?

394
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,180
Chacha,

395
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,820
you've asked so many questions,

396
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,220
which one shall I answer first?

397
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,820
Yesterday Mr. Su said you were badly hurt and fainted away.

398
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,900
I didn't know what was going on

399
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,540
after Lord Xi Ze took you away.

400
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,340
I was so worried about you.

401
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,100
See,

402
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,740
I'm fine.

403
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,780
But why is your hand bandaged like this, Your Highness?

404
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,020
It may be painful for a while.

405
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,300
It's just a small wound. It doesn't matter.

406
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,860
It'll be fine in a few days.

407
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,740
Well, Your Highness,

408
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,740
His Excellency Shen Ye moved to the mansion yesterday.

409
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,140
The elder steward has arranged him in the Mengchun Courtyard.

410
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,500
Is he satisfied?

411
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,780
I heard from the elder steward that

412
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,580
His Excellency Shen Ye seemed to know well

413
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,540
of the environment in the mansion after he came here.

414
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,860
He even didn't need the elder steward to lead the way for him.

415
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,300
But I remember

416
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,980
His Excellency Shen Ye has never been to our mansion.

417
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,260
Is it true?

418
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,700
He's a guest anyway.

419
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,340
You take good care of him.

420
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,460
Yes, Your Highness.

421
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,180
Send him

422
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,580
whatever he wants.

423
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,340
What a good day today!

424
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:56,980
Chacha,

425
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,580
brew a pot of good tea and send it to the courtyard.

426
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,260
Yes. I'm on my way.

427
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,860
There're so many troubles in the Dream of Aranya,

428
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,140
but His Majesty and I

429
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,340
can live a peaceful life happily for a while

430
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,380
in the name of

431
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,860
Aranya and Lord Xi Ze's conjugal relation,

432
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,700
which can be counted as a hard-won blessing.

433
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,660
Your Highness,

434
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,540
how is

435
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,740
your wound?

436
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,940
Moye,

437
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,700
do you still think you didn't cheat me?

438
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,540
See.

439
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,580
I am almost killed

440
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,300
by that white-fronted tiger.

441
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,380
I'll definitely report to uncle

442
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,420
about everything you've done to me when I leave here.

443
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,220
I didn't expect that sacrificing your blood to the sword

444
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,340
would make you hurt so heavily.

445
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,860
Your Highness, I'm so sorry.

446
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,500
I'm kidding.

447
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm lucky to have His Majesty by my side.

448
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,620
He has healed me in time.

449
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,140
I'm almost healed now.

450
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,700
You get your memory back?

451
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,020
That I am badly hurt this time
can be regarded as a blessing in disguise.

452
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,820
Not only I get my memory back,

453
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,660
but my primordial spirit also comes back to my body.

454
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,820
What?

455
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,580
This...

456
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,700
this is your own body?

457
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,620
Exactly.

458
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,900
Now

459
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,740
I'm the original Bai Fengjiu of Qingqiu.

460
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,460
Aranya and you resemble each other too much.

461
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,380
I can see no difference.

462
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,660
Come here.

463
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,620
Let me tell you the difference.

464
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:39,940
See.

465
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,260
There's no cut on your hand.

466
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,500
Now do you believe me?

467
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,460
Well,

468
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,380
then

469
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,300
where did you go yesterday?

470
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,420
I didn't see you go back to Aranya's mansion,

471
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,900
and I worried so much about your wound.

472
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,140
I even went to the Qi Nan Palace,

473
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,660
but I didn't find you there.

474
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,540
It's a long story.

475
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,260
When I woke up yesterday,

476
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,980
I found myself lying at the side of Water Moon Pond.

477
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,700
There's a freezing coffin right at the side of the pond.

478
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,260
My original body was preserved in the freezing coffin.

479
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,180
Once I touched my original body,

480
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,860
my primordial spirit returned

481
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,620
to my own body.

482
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,860
And I got my memory back at the same time.

483
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,060
What about Aranya's body?

484
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,060
That's the strangest part

485
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,540
that Aranya's body disappeared.

486
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,220
Disappeared?

487
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
How could it happen?

488
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,740
I don't know.

489
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,780
Well,

490
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,860
Moye,

491
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,860
you have asked me

492
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,900
to invite Lord Shen Ye to the mansion, haven't you?

493
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,540
Now he is in the mansion.

494
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,260
What shall we do next?

495
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,820
Aranya's body disappeared.

496
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,340
How could it happen?

497
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,580
Moye.

498
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,740
Moye.

499
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,580
What's wrong with you?

500
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,740
Well,

501
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,820
when Shen Ye lived in the mansion that year,

502
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,780
he never stepped out of the side chamber

503
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,580
because of his bad mood.

504
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,380
Aranya wrote to him from time to time

505
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,940
and talked with him,

506
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,660
when she noticed it.

507
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,100
Now I have to ask you

508
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,660
to write some letters to Shen Ye

509
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,900
in Aranya's handwriting.

510
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,340
Are these letters the ones you showed me,

511
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
when I just arrived here?

512
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,380
Not exactly.

513
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,140
Those letters are ones she wrote to me sometimes.

514
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,340
These are ones she especially wrote to Shen Ye.

515
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,260
But my handwriting isn't that good.

516
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,980
If compared with Aranya's,

517
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,500
mine will be far worse than Aranya's.

518
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,540
You'll have to give me more time to practice my handwriting.

519
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,100
Forget it. Forget it.

520
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,260
You take good care of yourself first.

521
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,420
I'll deal with the letter thing.

522
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,860
Your Highness,

523
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,300
do you think

524
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,020
the Dream of Aranya is too bizarre?

525
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,020
I'm even too bewitched to

526
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,980
distinguish whether my feelings at the moment

527
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,940
belong to me in the dream world

528
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,860
or the original me in the real world,

529
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,300
when I stay here for long.

530
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,060
Your Highness, there's an ambiguous connection

531
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,500
between Aranya and you.

532
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm afraid what's happening now is tricky.

533
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,180
You'd better be careful.

534
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:47,860
Moye,

535
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,540
your feeling bewitched may be

536
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,860
because the dream world

537
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,540
is essentially a part of your life.

538
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,980
It's sure that an insider will feel more bewitched.

539
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,180
You look romantic and unruly,

540
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,420
but deep in your heart,

541
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,980
you always care for Aranya.

542
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,460
Perhaps you feel like this

543
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,940
because of the devil inside.

544
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
I don't feel the same as you,

545
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,940
since this is not my life.

546
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,180
All that I care about is His Majesty.

547
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,540
As long as His Majesty is here,

548
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,460
I'll have nothing to worry about.

549
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,220
I'm bewitched.

550
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,460
Thank you for enlightening me, Your Highness.

551
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,540
Not at all. Not at all.

552
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,500
Moye, let's hasten

553
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,300
to go through the whole life of Aranya.

554
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,140
You can get the answer you want

555
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,020
while we can go back

556
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,660
to our real world.

557
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,740
As long as the Miaohua Mirror is made,

558
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,180
I'll get to know the connection between Xiaobai and Aranya.

559
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,180
With you,

560
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,900
I can start to run the furnace and make the mirror.
