1
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 4

3
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Nie Chuyin.

4
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
Nie Chuyin,

5
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
You'll have to come up with an idea for me.

6
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Badger.

7
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
Badger.

8
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,880
Is...

9
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,800
this for me?

10
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Have you been searching for
it for hundreds of years, haven't you?

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,680
If you help me out this time,

12
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
I'll give it to you.

13
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,080
What's it?

14
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
I want to make the poker face fight with me.

15
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,560
The poker face?

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Emperor Dong Hua?

17
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,800
Yes.

18
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,240
It seems

19
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,040
your fight with him has already ended.

20
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
It's my negligence.

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,080
What I mean is to fight with him fair and square.

22
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
I won't play the dirty tricks he does.

23
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,200
It's not like my style.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
I really do have an idea.

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,160
Rumor has it that

26
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,920
there is a soul-locking jade belonging to Emperor Dong Hua

27
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,160
that blocks evil monsters on earth.

28
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,520
How does it relate to the fight between me and him?

29
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,840
I mean, the soul-locking jade,

30
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,360
if it's lost,

31
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
what's he gonna do?

32
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,120
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,000
Miaoyi Chasm?

34
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
I'll go check on it. You stay here.

35
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,080
Don't spread it.

36
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,160
Yes.

37
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
What's wrong with His Majesty?

38
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,360
It's so strange.

39
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,120
It is.

40
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,480
Your Majesty.

41
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,320
Your Majesty.

42
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,400
Haven't you been in just now?

43
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It's... It's...

44
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,360
Poker Face,

45
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,600
I do know

46
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
you will chase after me for the meaningless thing.

47
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,120
Now you do have to have a fight with me, don't you?

48
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,240
I really can't figure out

49
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
why Xu Yang wants to betroth Ji Heng to you.

50
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
In terms of appearance,I won't be overwhelmed by you.

51
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
Except that I'm not as aged as you,

52
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,880
how am I any worse than you?

53
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,880
If the soul-locking jade can be brought back safely,

54
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,320
I might regard it as the price

55
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,080
you pay the Tai Chen Palace.

56
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,640
What do you

57
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
mean the price?

58
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
If there's something wrong,

59
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,040
you,

60
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,320
and your entire clan would die with you.

61
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
Emperor Dong Hua,

62
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
who becomes a Buddha or a demon
depending on a blinding flash,

63
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
dies for the killing.

64
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,080
You can act as well as Miao Luo, can't you?

65
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,440
Yu Ru,

66
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,480
go ask about where my foster brother is.

67
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,760
Your Highness.

69
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,030
Why are you standing still?

70
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Even though my foster brother has promised you
to stay in the Imperial Kitchen,

71
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
don't you think you have nothing else to do?

72
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
What's happening over there?

73
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,480
Does it have anything to do with His Majesty?

74
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,920
Who do you think you are?

75
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,160
How dare you show your consideration for my foster brother?

76
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,160
What kind of flower is the hairpin made from?

77
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,600
I haven't seen it in the Sky Kingdom.

78
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,200
It's the sky of Qingqiu

79
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,760
as well as the stars of Qingqiu.

80
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,760
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

81
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,160
who can tell how many years it has been through?

82
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Sister Zhi He.

83
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,640
Cheng Yu.

84
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,040
Lord Cheng Yu, why are you here

85
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,880
without advance notice?

86
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,640
Excuse me for not welcoming you outside.

87
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,960
What mistake has the fairy maid made

88
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,880
to irritate you so much?

89
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,120
Even in the Sky Kingdom,

90
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,920
hurting a fairy maid on purpose matters much,

91
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,280
not to mention in the Tai Chen Palace.

92
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,440
Zhi He,

93
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,400
you'll have to think twice.

94
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,680
Even though you don't care for anything else,

95
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
you'll have to take the fame of His Majesty into account.

96
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,920
Do you intend to make up more gossip

97
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,520
to the rumor of His Majesty's taste for the killing

98
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
to amuse people?

99
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It's just a misunderstanding.

100
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,200
A rumor doesn't make sense.

101
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,200
Lord, for the sake of His Majesty,

102
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
please make rumors end with the wise.

103
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,040
Since it's a misunderstanding,

104
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,560
please look before you leap later, Zhi He.

105
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
You're right, Lord.

106
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,280
I have something else to deal with.

107
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Excuse me for leaving first.

108
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,720
Lord Cheng Yu,

109
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
I, I just saw...

110
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,360
I heard

111
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,160
Demon Lord Yan Chiwu stole
the soul-locking jade of His Majesty.

112
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,320
His Majesty and Yan Chiwu

113
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,920
is fighting on the Mount Fuyu.

114
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,280
His Majesty is having a fight?

115
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,240
Then how could it happen that

116
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
his follower, I am not on site?

117
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,600
You, little fox.

118
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
It's he who always beats the other down
when he is having the fight with someone else.

119
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,560
Is it worth you coming all the way there?

120
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
As long as it has something to do with His Majesty,

121
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,680
I will have to go no matter what it takes.

122
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
You little fox.

123
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,320
Your Highness.

124
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Si Ming.

125
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,160
Where are you going in such a hurry?

126
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
His Majesty is having a fight with someone.

127
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
I'll go help him.

128
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,440
Do you know where the Mount Fuyu is?

129
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,400
Well,

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
where's the Mount Fuyu?

131
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,880
I can lend you my fast-running felt

132
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,600
that can both lead the way and carry things.

133
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640
It can help you find His Majesty.

134
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
Your Highness, you have to remember

135
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,360
you should keep yourself safe

136
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,280
before worrying about His Majesty's safety.

137
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,720
Otherwise I might break my promise

138
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,960
to the elders in Qingqiu.

139
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
I get it, Si Ming.

140
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't worry.

141
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
I'll bring His Majesty back safely.

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,600
Fine.

143
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,480
I guess you won't even able to

144
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,440
touch His Majesty when you get there.

145
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
What you can do is merely clear the battlefield.

146
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,600
What on earth is it?

147
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Poker Face,

148
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,400
since you have hidden yourself,

149
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
I can't do anything to you,

150
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,840
but your engagement with Ji Heng doesn't count.

151
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
If you don't promise,

152
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
you should appear and fight with me
for another three hundred rounds.

153
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
What the hell is it?

154
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640
Nie Chuyin, if you don't make a clear explanation to me,

155
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,240
don't expect to live until tomorrow.

156
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,320
Are you the one who comes to help?

157
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Are you an immortal

158
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,920
who's on the side of Dong Hua?

159
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Then I'll tell you that

160
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,160
Dong Hua is locked by Yan Chiwu in the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

161
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
Your cultivation is not strong enough

162
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,280
to save him.

163
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
Let's make a deal.

164
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,160
If you lend your fur to me for amusement for three years,

165
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,720
I'll give you half of my cultivation.

166
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,760
Then you can step in and save Dong Hua.

167
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
What do you think?

168
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,560
Give me half of your cultivation?

169
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,760
Is there such a virtuous man on earth?

170
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,160
Wait a second.

171
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,280
Why is there only one tail of mine left?

172
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
Opps!

173
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,640
How could I miss such important information?

174
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,400
Forget it! Forget it! Forget it!

175
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,040
I'll only look less beautiful

176
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,960
without my fur,

177
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,560
and I can't transfer either,

178
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,400
which is less important than saving His Majesty.

179
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,280
I haven't imagined that the magic power of
the Demon Lord is so strong.

180
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,600
I've no idea whether His Majesty has seen my

181
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
splendid magic.

182
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,160
Nie Chuyin makes me here

183
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,320
stop Demon Lord Yan from hurting His Majesty,

184
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,200
but where are they?

185
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,080
Meng Hao.

186
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,080
Your Majesty.

187
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,040
Why are you here?

188
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,480
I heard Yan Chiwu intended to hurt Your Majesty,

189
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,320
so I come here exclusively.

190
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,520
I haven't expected to fall in the Land.

191
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,800
Here is the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

192
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,520
which is transferred from the soul-locking jade.

193
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,920
You shouldn't have come here.

194
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,560
What's happening originates from me,

195
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,160
and it's me who put Your Majesty in danger.

196
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,120
It's not your fault.

197
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,040
I happen to take the opportunity to remove the evils in the Land.

198
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,480
How come there's a little fox here?

199
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,560
How could it fall into the Ten-evil Lotus Land?

200
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,680
Its paw is hurt.

201
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,680
Your Majesty,

202
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,760
are you OK?

203
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Are you going to be faint with hunger?

204
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,760
What about grabbing a bite

205
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,720
of my paw first?

206
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,120
See, I've roasted it

207
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,680
that is scorched outside but tender inside.

208
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
I don't know how it tastes.

209
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,880
I guess it must be delicious.

210
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,360
I mean,

211
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,080
shall we add some salt first?

212
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,200
You wake up?

213
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,560
Your Majesty.

214
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,760
Are you really Your Majesty?

215
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,080
Am I dreaming?

216
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

217
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,400
Allow me.

218
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

219
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,800
I do see you.

220
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,600
Have you seen me

221
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,840
save you with splendid magic just now?

222
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,240
It's really you, Your Majesty.

223
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,640
I'm not dreaming.

224
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,840
Your Majesty is binding up my wound.

225
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,080
What a blissful moment!

226
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
Your Majesty,

227
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
I once saw you glaze

228
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,720
the wine set out and away in the courtyard.

229
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,240
You were indifferent and solemn like now.

230
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,480
You look great.

231
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,280
Your Majesty,

232
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,880
how could, could it walk

233
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,680
since you bandaged it like this?

234
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,280
Try to spit a fireball.

235
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,400
Bandage harder,

236
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,120
or it will be easily fired to ashes.

237
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,800
As far as I'm concerned,

238
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
the little fox was forced to

239
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
join the battle.

240
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,880
It can't be willing to spit fireballs

241
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,480
to fire itself in normal times.

242
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,280
Your Majesty, you worry too much.

243
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,240
See,

244
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
how smart it is!

245
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,720
It won't be stupid to such an extent.

246
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,200
It's hard to say.

247
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,600
His Majesty used to be fond of the smart.

248
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,640
The rides he used before were all smart
and the successor was even better than the predecessor.

249
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,760
What should I do?

250
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,960
It seems I do have to spit a fireball

251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,080
that won't do any harm to myself,

252
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,400
which may be able to eliminate his misunderstanding of me.

253
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
How stupid you are!

254
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,600
I don't want to face the brutal truth.

255
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
How stupid I am!

256
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,480
How come I lose the trace of Jiu,

257
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,280
who is such a living creature?

258
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,400
We have searched everywhere,

259
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,040
but there's no trace of her.

260
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,040
Has she sneaked out?

261
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,200
Keeping searching.

262
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,120
Every single corner should be thoroughly searched.

263
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,280
Yes.

264
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,760
Your Highness,

265
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
isn't it good that Jiu has disappeared herself

266
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,560
to stop being an eyesore in the Tai Chen Palace?

267
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,600
Ridiculous!

268
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,040
It's I who will decide whether she stays or leaves.

269
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,320
If a fairy maid in the Tai Chen Palace

270
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,080
can decide whether she stays or leaves on her own,

271
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,720
what kind of the system here will be?

272
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Your Highness, Immortal Official Chong Lin is coming.

273
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Let him in.

274
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,200
Yes.

275
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,120
What's happening outside?

276
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,600
Those immortal officials
who are supposed to look after the soul-locking jade

277
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,880
are discussing about how to confess themselves to His Majesty.

278
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,360
It won't be hard for His Majesty to

279
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
take back the soul-locking jade, will it?

280
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,920
Your Highness, there's something you don't know.

281
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,120
If those evil monsters blocked by the soul-locking jade

282
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,440
are released incautiously,

283
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
there will be a catastrophe.

284
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,200
What kind of catastrophe?

285
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,760
Once the evil monsters blocked by the soul-locking jade

286
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,400
scatter to Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

287
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,760
which might have impact on the Miaoyi Chasm

288
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
where Miao Luo was sealed.

289
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,560
It won't matter that His Majesty

290
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,920
eats nothing for even half or a year.

291
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,600
But I have just been through a harsh battle,

292
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,800
and there's been nothing in my stomach for one day.

293
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,640
My chest is coming closer to my back.

294
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,640
I'm so hungry.

295
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,000
Ji Heng is going outside
to find something to eat exclusively for me.

296
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,040
How kind she is!

297
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,560
Little fox,

298
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
there're only sweet potatoes can be eaten here in the Land.

299
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,040
Otherwise,

300
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
you can spit a fireball

301
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,160
to roast a sweet potato for yourself, can't you?

302
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,680
It's so astute of the demon

303
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,200
to take away my fur

304
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,160
which is the one of a nine-tailed fox.

305
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,640
And he left me

306
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,520
with the ordinary fox fur.

307
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,560
Not to mention the magic power he gave me,

308
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
which couldn't last a half day long.

309
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Now I won't be able to transfer. Without magic power,

310
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,360
I can't even talk.

311
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,000
It's truly impossible for me

312
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,920
to protect His Majesty.

313
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,080
Little fox,

314
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,480
what I cultivate is the water magic,

315
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
and I can't magic the fire for you

316
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,080
to roast the sweet potato.

317
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,400
Could

318
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,240
you put up with having it raw?

319
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm a picky-eater,

320
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
and I don't want to eat a raw sweet potato.

321
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
It's been the best meal of sweet potatoes

322
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,920
that I've eaten since almost the last thirty thousand years.

323
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I must head off a danger,

324
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,320
If I have you by my side.

325
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,000
Are you cold?

326
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,560
It's better to be a fox.

327
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,760
What a shame!

328
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,200
It seems that the trick I used to my mother

329
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,720
when I wasn't weaned

330
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,600
still works on His Majesty.

331
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,760
If His Majesty doesn't bring me back to Heaven

332
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,840
when we leave here,

333
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,800
then we'll have to say farewell.

334
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,320
It's not until I have my fur back

335
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
that I can return to the Tai Chen Palace,

336
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,800
by His Majesty's side,

337
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,880
which will be three years later.

338
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,840
Once I heard that

339
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,440
His Majesty would always hold his breath
for a while when he has a break.

340
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,080
I haven't imagined

341
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,400
that I can take such a big advantage today.

342
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,000
Is it that God is blessing me

343
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,920
or he saw me make such great effort sincerely?

344
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,280
Thank God

345
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,600
for blessing me.

346
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,200
I like it.

347
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,160
The lips of His Majesty look so gorgeous,

348
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,080
the color of them is light

349
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,280
and they might be cold.

350
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,480
How do they taste when I kiss him.

351
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,760
It's my first kiss.

352
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:08,960
What?

353
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,200
Yan Chiwu went to pick a fight with Emperor Dong Hua?

354
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,040
Yes.

355
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,120
How mischievous he is!

356
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
If Yan Chiwu ruins the marriage

357
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,080
between the gods and the demons,

358
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,440
I won't let him go that easily.

359
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,360
Your Highness, there's one more thing.

360
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:24,880
Spill it.

361
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,120
Princess Ji Heng has already known the story,

362
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,520
and she goes to mediate on her own.

363
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,640
On her own?

364
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,440
Yes.

365
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,160
Where is Min Su?

366
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,080
He hasn't followed the princess.

367
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,720
It's Min Su's fault to make the princess at risk.

368
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,840
Then teach him a lesson.

369
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Please show the instructions, Your Highness.

370
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,360
There are so many fierce beasts in the Baishui Mountain.

371
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,800
If Min Su, as the personal bodyguard of the princess,

372
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
isn't able to handle these beasts,

373
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
how come he is qualified
for the personal bodyguard of the princess?

374
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,040
Then send him to the Baishui Mountain to ponder upon his faults.

375
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:10,880
Yes.

376
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,560
What are you going to do?

377
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,320
We're ordered to capture Min Su.

378
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,920
The princess would punish me,

379
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,440
if I make some mistakes.

380
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
How come you do this to me?

381
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,400
Here is the token.

382
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,400
Min Su, it's the order of the Demon Lord

383
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,280
to take you to the Baishui Mountain
to ponder upon your faults right now.

384
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,720
Take him away.

385
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,560
Move.

386
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,360
Hurry up.

387
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:55,960
Move.

388
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,360
I've never stepped out of the palace since I was a child.

389
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,600
It's your luck to have the opportunity

390
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,280
to experience yourself in the Baishui Mountain.

391
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,670
And the princess

392
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,280
will have her own path to go.

393
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,190
You won't come back

394
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
until she gets married.

395
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,320
What's up?

396
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,230
Your Majesty,

397
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,920
come to check on it.

398
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,190
There's something wrong with the fox.

399
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,600
What's wrong?

400
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,040
Is it hurt by

401
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,960
the foul atmosphere in the Lotus Land,

402
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,680
or by the wound she had days ago?

403
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,280
Are there some symptoms of wicked energy into the body?

404
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,280
None.

405
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,280
It's pregnant.

406
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,520
Haven't the clan leader of Spiritual Fox told you the story?

407
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,160
Your clan is always strictly disciplined.

408
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,760
The reason why you're not allowed
to be hooked on human beings casually is

409
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,360
that you'll be prone to pregnancy,

410
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,280
once you have a casual fling with someone.

411
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,800
How...

412
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,840
come I haven't heard

413
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
about what you're saying?

414
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,640
Do you belong to the Spiritual Fox Clan?

415
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,360
No, I don't.

416
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
If you don't belong to the clan,

417
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,160
it's certain that they won't tell you the truth.

418
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,840
And you won't be able to know it.

419
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,600
Since I'm not one of them either,

420
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,760
how come I inherit their features

421
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,360
just because I have their fur on me?

422
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,840
Oh my God,

423
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,040
you have expressed too much preference for me.

424
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,720
Although I want to make some progress

425
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,000
on the relationship with His Majesty,

426
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,160
it's too fast.

427
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,040
And

428
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,040
since it's my own baby,

429
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,000
I should give birth to the baby, shouldn't I?

430
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,160
But how...

431
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,120
how on earth can I give birth to the baby?

432
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,320
I've heard that

433
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,040
there're some instructions
that should be observed when nourishing a fetus.

434
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,160
Who should I consult about this kind of advice?

435
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Follow me.

436
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
His Majesty is about to recover

437
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
to his prime.

438
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,480
We are about to get out soon.

439
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,040
So soon?

440
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,400
What should I do then?

441
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,400
Will His Majesty treat me

442
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,000
as an unknown fox?

443
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
His Majesty always prefers a quiet environment.

444
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,400
He won't be willing to take me back to
the Tai Chen Palace when we get out of the Land.

445
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,480
Besides,

446
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,680
Ji Heng likes me so much,

447
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,920
what if he would send me to Ji Heng?

448
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,320
Your Majesty,

449
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,720
Yan Chiwu is born mischievous.

450
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
He didn't intend to make the mistake.

451
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,600
I hope Your Majesty could forgive him.

452
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
He stole the soul-locking jade

453
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,800
and opened the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

454
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,080
which put you in danger.

455
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,560
It's lucky that things don't go wrong.

456
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,400
Otherwise,

457
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,880
I must take a share of the blame.

458
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,960
Your merits have offset your demerits
since you have the heart of repentance.

459
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,680
Thanks, Your Majesty.

460
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,040
Your Majesty, I have one thing to ask you for.

461
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,200
Spill it.

462
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,880
I'm fond of the little fox so much.

463
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,040
As far as I'm concerned,

464
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,200
there are so many strict rules in the Sky Kingdom.

465
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,680
It won't get used to the life there,

466
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
if it goes to the Sky Kingdom.

467
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,520
What about allowing me

468
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,320
to take it to the place of the demons.

469
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,000
Please don't, Your Majesty.

470
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,560
It will get used to it.

471
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,600
It's just an unmatured fox,

472
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,840
what else does it know?

473
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
It won't be able to get used to

474
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,920
the heavily foul atmosphere of the demons.

475
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,880
Your Majesty, you get me wrong.

476
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,000
Our nine-tailed fox clan always shows

477
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,760
the appearance of a human,

478
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,280
so when we transfer to the appearance of a fox,

479
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,840
we might be a little heavy-headed sometimes.

480
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
But I'm mature,

481
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
and I've already been thirty thousand years old.

482
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,440
Your Majesty,

483
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,800
you're the prestigious god

484
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,120
in Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

485
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,320
It'll be so narrow-minded of you to strive for

486
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,520
a little fox with me, won't it?

487
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,080
How come you allow me to raise it for one month?

488
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,240
Half a month?

489
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,120
Ten days?

490
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Won't ten days be OK?

491
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,360
Won't ten days be OK?

492
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,800
When I got out,

493
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,160
I was merely a fairy maid in the Tai Chen Palace.

494
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,720
And when I come back,

495
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,560
I've already been a little fox lying in the arms of His Majesty.

496
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,080
It's so blissful of me!

497
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,680
Your Majesty,

498
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,000
there you are.

499
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,240
The soul-locking jade...

500
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,920
Broken.

501
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,520
These evil monsters?

502
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,720
Your Majesty, officials who are supposed
to look after the soul-locking jade

503
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,120
are kneeling outside the Tai Chen Palace,

504
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,360
waiting for Your Majesty to punish them for getting the jade lost.

505
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,120
Let them go back to ponder upon their faults.

506
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,800
Chong Lin,

507
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,920
you're the most careful person in the whole Tai Chen Palace.

508
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,640
I have to go out for a while.

509
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,840
Take care of the little fox for the time being.

510
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,880
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

511
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,760
I'll take good care of it.

512
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,880
Fondling my head

513
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,800
means he thinks I'm cute.

514
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,840
The little fox is lively.

515
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Do take care of it and don't let it run wild

516
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,640
to aggravate the wound on its paw.

517
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,560
Yes.

518
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,600
What l like to do most is make one cry.

519
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,520
How come you cry louder?

520
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,840
Do exactly as Chong Lin instructs.

521
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,920
I'll get you back from him

522
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,000
as soon as I finish my business.

523
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,280
Your Highness is coming back.

524
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,360
You must have been through a lot this time.

525
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,960
It's more scared than hurt.

526
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,120
Luckily, it doesn't turn into a catastrophe.

527
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
If it were because of me that the fight
between the two clans was triggered,

528
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,080
it would be my biggest sin.

529
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,280
Well,

530
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,480
where's Min Su?

531
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,680
What's up? Say something.

532
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,720
Your Highness,

533
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,160
right before you came back,

534
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,680
the Demon Lord had sent someone to capture Guard Min.

535
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,720
What are you talking about?

536
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,040
Why?

537
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,400
When I arrived here,

538
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,320
Guard Min had already been taken away.

539
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,040
Where had he been taken?

540
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,640
Baishui Mountain.

541
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,000
Baishui Mountain.

542
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,240
Let's go.

543
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,160
Pray for yourself.
