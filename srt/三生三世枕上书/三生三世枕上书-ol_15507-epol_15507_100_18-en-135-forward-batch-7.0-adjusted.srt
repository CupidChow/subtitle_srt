00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 18

3
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,520
Your Majesty.

4
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
What's going on?

5
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,480
Your Majesty, something bad happened.

6
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Imperial Concubine Wan...

7
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
What happened to her?

8
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,080
She vanished!

9
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,960
What?

10
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
So her whereabouts

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,640
is unknown.

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
She literally vanished

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
in front of us.

14
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,000
I swear I'm telling the truth.

15
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,040
Enough. You good-for-nothing!

16
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,400
Go out now.

17
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,760
Yes.

18
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,880
Your Highness,

19
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
people in the palace have known about it.

20
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
But it hasn't been spread.

21
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,360
Keep at it. Send more men.

22
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,640
Yes.

23
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,960
How could something so weird happen?

24
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,160
No traces of kidnapping

25
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
or fighting?

26
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,320
No, Your Highness.

27
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Absolutely no.

28
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,480
How is that possible?

29
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,440
Madam Jiu,

30
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
only you can talk His Majesty through now.

31
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,360
Or His Majesty will have

32
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
all the imperial bodyguards in prison suffer.

33
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,120
And even General Ye will be implicated.

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
Ji Heng can't use magic arts.

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,600
But someone might rescue her with magic arts.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Even my concubines can come and go

37
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,720
as they like.

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,240
Does it mean Empress Dowager

39
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,200
may also vanish someday?

40
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
This is how you protect me?

41
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,280
This is how you protect the whole palace?

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,760
Your Majesty, Madam Jiu is here to see you.

43
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,830
Send her in.

44
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,720
Yes.

45
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,920
Summon Madam Jiu.

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,480
What's the matter?

47
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,520
Your Majesty,

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
do you remember what the imperial physician said?

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
The imperial physician?

50
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,440
Leave us.

51
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,640
Yes.

52
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,760
Your Majesty, don't you think

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
what the imperial physician said is suspicious?

54
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
The pulse beats arrhythmically.

55
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
It's beating sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly,

56
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,920
which is very unstable.

57
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,600
And there's a sign of heavy intoxication.

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,440
But Imperial Concubine Wan
showed no symptoms of intoxication at all.

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,240
In that way, she's not poisoned.

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,560
At first, I felt so strange

61
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,360
when the imperial physician was diagnosing.

62
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,920
Perhaps Imperial Concubine Wan is not a mortal.

63
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
What?

64
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,800
Imperial Concubine Wan.

65
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
Maybe she really isn't a mortal.

66
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,720
Maybe she had her reasons

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,800
coming here.

68
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Now it's all over.

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,520
So she should probably leave.

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,800
If she's not a mortal,

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
why did she come to the palace?

72
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,200
For you, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,120
For me?

74
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,920
Then why did she disappear

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,560
when you refuse to see her?

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,640
Is it for me or for Lingbi Stone?

77
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,040
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,680
I think

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,920
Imperial Concubine Wan holds feelings for you.

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
That's enough, Xiaojiu.

81
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
I know what you've been trying to get to.

82
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
You want me to forgive

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,520
the imperial bodyguards for their dereliction of duty.

84
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
Your Majesty, what I want

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
is making you to truly let it go.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,320
Fine, I will listen to you.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
No matter what she was here for,

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,680
it's all over.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,760
She's gone,

90
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,960
and I'm fine.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,240
Lingbi Stone is in one piece as well.

92
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,080
Don't mention about

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,960
Imperial Concubine Wan anymore.

94
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,780
Yes.

95
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
Where am I?

96
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
You're awake.

97
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
Great. Great.

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,280
I made porridge for you.

99
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Have some before it gets cold.

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,040
Come and have some.

101
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,960
Sir, thank you for saving my life.

102
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,600
Sir, may I know your name?

103
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Nice try.

104
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,880
You learn how to play act in the mortal realm.

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,480
Fine, then I'll go along with you.

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm Yan Chiwu,

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,640
Green Demon Lord.

108
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Now eat the porridge.

109
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,760
You mentioned mortal realm?

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Oh, sir,

111
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,160
can you tell me

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,640
what

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
this place is?

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
This is Qingxuan Hall of the demons.

115
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,320
I invited you here before. You don't remember it?

116
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,120
Qingxuan Hall?

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,800
The... the demons?

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
Don't you remember who I am?

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,360
Look carefully.

120
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,760
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,920
So...

122
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
do you remember who you are?

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm Chu Wan.

124
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,560
No,

125
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,560
you are the Princess Ji Heng of the demons.

126
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,560
You even forget this?

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,280
Ji Heng.

128
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,400
You don't remember anything?

129
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,400
Ji... Ji Heng.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,280
Do you know me?

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,550
More than that!

132
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,440
We are close to each other.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,150
Do you remember something else?

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,080
Like...

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
Danling Palace.

136
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,670
Xu Yang.

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,960
Ice.

138
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,840
Dong Hua.

139
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
I... I...

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,040
I...

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,120
I don't recall anything.

142
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,520
Nie Chuyin! You are a bastard!

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
I will skin him!

144
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,560
Nie Chuyin!

145
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
Are you talking about

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Mr. Nie?

147
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
I think you got it wrong.

148
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,800
He is the man who saved my life.

149
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
Nonsense!

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,680
He's the one who made you to lose your memory.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
What?

152
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,520
He must have been using you,

153
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,000
so he sealed your memory.

154
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
He used to be a fraud.

155
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,440
He's so good at it.

156
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,680
Sir, you must get it wrong.

157
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
I remember I fell

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
from somewhere high

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,240
and nearly died.

160
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,000
And it was then that Mr. Nie came out and helped me.

161
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,080
You mean...

162
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,960
you lost your memory

163
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,800
because of falling from a cliff?

164
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,240
Falling from a cliff?

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
I looked for you everywhere.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Then Xu Yang told me you fell from a cliff.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,240
You said you fell from somewhere high.

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,120
That makes sense.

169
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,680
Who's Xu Yang?

170
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,040
Sir,

171
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,680
why were you looking for me everywhere?

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
Xu Yang is your brother.

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
I...

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,120
I'm your good friend,

175
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
and I cared about you.

176
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
That's why I looked for you everywhere.

177
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,880
Then...

178
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,040
how did you find me?

179
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,880
I went to the cliff, but I didn't find you there.

180
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,480
So I enlarged the search range.

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,520
I almost looked every place of the demons

182
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
and finally found a lead on you

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,920
from Nie Chuyin.

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,440
Then I knew that you went to the mortal realm.

185
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
So I immediately went to
the mortal realm to feel your breath.

186
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,360
But the minute I found you

187
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
you were almost killed in prison.

188
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
Then...

189
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,600
it's hard to explain.

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay, here's how it goes.

191
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,120
Come.

192
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
You take a good rest in my place.

193
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,400
I'll try some magic arts

194
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,760
and see if I can bring your memory back.

195
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,760
Eat it before it gets cold.

196
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,360
Thank you, sir.

197
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,160
It's getting cold.

198
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,160
Your Highness, you should stop drinking.
It's time for bed.

199
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,080
What time is it?

200
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
9 p.m. to 11 p.m.

201
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,520
It's still early.

202
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
You should stop, Your Highness.

203
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,680
Since you came to the palace,

204
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,760
you've grown to love drinking
liquor and enjoying the moon.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,960
You've had too much.

206
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
What if

207
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,640
your health is harmed?

208
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,160
Don't worry.

209
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm a good drinker.

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,560
It's time for reunion

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
when the moon is full.

212
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,600
But I've been here for so long.

213
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,160
When do I get to reunite with my old friends?

214
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
Your Highness.

215
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,840
You've had too much.

216
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,640
You begin to talk like a book.

217
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Where is the cloak from?

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,440
It's His Majesty's reward for you.

219
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Again?

220
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,240
Yes.

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,360
You found out secret of Imperial Concubine Wan,

222
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,920
which is a great job.

223
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,800
His Majesty rewarded about five times in total.

224
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I think,

225
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,720
His Majesty is really attentive with you.

226
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Buy why don't you...

227
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Stop.

228
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,000
Mind your words.

229
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,160
Is Xiaojiu being sentimental under the moon?

230
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
Your Majesty.

231
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,680
What's wrong?

232
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

233
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,320
You are drinking again.

234
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Just a little bit.

235
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
The cloak is nice.

236
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,680
You look so different with it.

237
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,320
It's just...

238
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,880
What?

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,760
An accessory is lacked to match it.

240
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,720
Your Majesty.

241
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,640
This is Gilded Nine Phoenixes Hairpin

242
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,680
I had craftsman make for you in particular.

243
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,840
Do you like it?

244
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,040
Have a look.

245
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,760
This is too,

246
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,200
too expensive for me.

247
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,920
I can't take it.

248
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,920
The cloak and the hairpin are great match.

249
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
Listen to me.

250
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,840
You can take it.

251
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,720
Thanks.

252
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Don't follow us.

253
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
No,

254
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,720
what is His Majesty doing?

255
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,240
Were you missing someone

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
when I just walked in?

257
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,360
I've been wondering

258
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,360
who had been

259
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,400
in your mind?

260
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
No matter who had been in your mind,

261
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,600
you are not allowed to have

262
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
anyone in your mind now, except me.

263
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,320
Can I

264
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,760
stay for tonight?

265
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,960
Xiao...

266
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Xiaojiu.

267
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,960
Are you coming or not?

268
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,840
Do you want to stay here tonight?

269
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,920
Go back to Muning Hall.

270
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,840
Yes.

271
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,760
Oh no.

272
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,320
Did I and His Majesty...

273
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,680
Muyun.

274
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,800
Muyun.

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,600
Your Highness.

276
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,080
You are finally awake.

277
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,840
It's 9 a.m. to 11 a.m now.

278
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,960
Muyun, tell me.

279
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Did His Majesty stay here last night?

280
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Come on, Your Highness.

281
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,360
I really don't understand you.

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,200
His Majesty rewarded you
so many good stuffs last night.

283
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,640
And finally he decided to stay.

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,760
But in the end...

285
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,320
In the end?

286
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,240
He got out very soon.

287
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,560
Instead,

288
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,320
you drank a lot and just went straight to bed.

289
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,080
I fell asleep?

290
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,600
Really?

291
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,080
Yes.

292
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,240
His Majesty looked so angry

293
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,120
when he got out last night.

294
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,960
It was me who waited upon you
while you're sleeping.

295
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Thank God.

296
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,040
Nothing has happened.

297
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,840
God is helping me.

298
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,200
Your Highness.

299
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,440
Why are you...

300
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,160
Why are you so happy about it?

301
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,120
Don't you know

302
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
how His Majesty feels for you?

303
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,360
Your Majesty.

304
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,320
Of course I know

305
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,520
how much you like me.

306
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,400
But you will never know my feelings for you

307
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,640
for your whole life.

308
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,280
Don't put it on.

309
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
I think it's better this way.

310
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,480
Your Highness, you seldom dress up.

311
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,320
His Majesty was nice

312
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
to send you the phoenix hairpin.

313
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,240
You are Madam Jiu now.

314
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,000
You should look differently.

315
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
Your Highness, look.

316
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
The phoenix hairpin really goes with your beauty.

317
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,840
It reminds me of a poem.

318
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680
You can recite poems?

319
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,080
Your smile looks so beautiful,

320
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,000
Your eyes look so cheerful.

321
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,800
I think the poem just portrays you, Your Highness.

322
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,600
You just say those nice words

323
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,920
to please me.

324
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,000
Empress Dowager is here.

325
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,280
Your Majesty, Madam Jiu is here.

326
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,360
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

327
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,880
Raise your head.

328
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,160
The phoenix hairpin is so delicate.

329
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Rise.

330
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

331
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Madam Jiu.

332
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,240
It took me too long

333
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,480
to come visit you.

334
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,160
I should have come earlier.

335
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,600
I was being naughty

336
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,040
and didn't show enough courtesy.

337
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
It was my bad not visiting you, Your Majesty.

338
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,480
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

339
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,400
You seem smart.

340
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,160
I was wondering where you're from.

341
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,760
I was born in an ordinary family in

342
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
a border town

343
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,000
of Chengyu.

344
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,920
An ordinary family?

345
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
Where are your parents?

346
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,680
They went traveling around the world.

347
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,640
I don't know any more about it.

348
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,520
Really?

349
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,080
How strange!

350
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,880
So you mean

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,760
you don't even have your old family?

352
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
No wonder

353
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,240
your behaviors and manners look so different

354
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
from other concubines in the palace.

355
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,880
You win favor with your humble background,

356
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,400
which makes other concubines envy you.

357
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,200
Madam Jiu.

358
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,480
You are not a vulgar girl

359
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,200
from a small village anymore.

360
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
You are the concubine of State of Chengyu.

361
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,200
You should be more gentle, modest and courteous.

362
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
And be more diligent and harmonious.

363
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Don't try any underhanded tricks

364
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,720
to win emperor's favor.

365
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
Do you understand?

366
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,400
Yes, I do.

367
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,760
That's good then.

368
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,760
So long, Your Majesty.

369
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,440
Who's there?

370
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,120
How dare you break into Prince Ying's Mansion!

371
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Who are you?

372
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,800
Take it easy, Prince Ying.

373
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,080
You can take your time and drink the tea first.

374
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Don't worry, Prince Ying.

375
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
People from State of Chong'an

376
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,680
don't do poisoning

377
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,600
in tea and cakes.

378
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,520
What exactly do you want from me?

379
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm here to help Prince Ying.

380
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,160
Prince Ying.

381
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
I know everything you did.

382
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,120
It's impossible.

383
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,600
How do you know?

384
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
I'll kill you.

385
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,080
Prince Ying.

386
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,400
Do you forget what happened

387
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,480
when you tried

388
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,720
to kill Chu Wan?

389
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
Prince Ying, don't get panic.

390
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm the Imperial Tutor of State of Chong'an.

391
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,240
I know everything you've been doing

392
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,720
is for the throne of State of Chengyu.

393
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,280
You want to take the throne.

394
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,520
If I tell you that I can help you with that,

395
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,160
would you like to cooperate with me?

396
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,200
You want to cooperate with me?

397
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,280
Yes.

398
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,000
With the power of State of Chong'an,

399
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,000
it's not a difficult thing

400
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,360
to help you

401
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
take back the throne.

402
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,320
You can be so kind-hearted?

403
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,480
Of course,

404
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,360
I need you to do

405
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,160
something for us.

406
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,480
What is it?

407
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,800
It's just a way too easy thing for you,

408
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,560
Prince Ying.

409
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
As long as you give me Lingbi Stone,

410
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,320
all our future cooperation

411
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
is negotiable.

412
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
You want Lingbi Stone?

413
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,680
Why?

414
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,640
That's not your concern, Prince Ying.

415
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,240
Lingbi Stone is the treasure of my country.

416
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,280
Only the emperor can get access to it.

417
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,400
Prince Ying.

418
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,640
You are the second most powerful man in the nation.

419
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,440
I don't believe that

420
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,680
you know nothing of Lingbi Stone.

421
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
Unless I come to power,

422
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,480
I will have no way of knowing it

423
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
for my whole life.

424
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,200
Okay.

425
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,960
Then I can tell you.

426
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,920
Lingbi Stone is in the Emperor's Tomb.

427
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,680
Prince Ying.

428
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
Now you have to think it through.

429
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,440
The stone matters more

430
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,160
or your secret matters more?

431
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,600
There's a map of the Emperor's Tomb.

432
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,920
There is?

433
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,280
It's in Song Xuanren's study.

434
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,840
I have no access to it.

435
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,640
Prince Ying.

436
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,760
You are his brother.

437
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,880
It's not difficult for you

438
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,720
to go into his study.

439
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,280
I can try my luck, though.

440
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,680
Good.

441
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,000
I believe nothing is impossible

442
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,040
as long as you are cooperating fully.

443
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,680
I guess I'll wait and see.

444
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,240
I said I can try. I can't guarantee anything.

445
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,960
But when it's done,

446
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,360
I hope you don't bother me anymore.

447
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,040
By the way, Prince Ying.

448
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
This thing

449
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,600
stays between us.

450
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,640
If anyone else knows about it,

451
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
you know what consequences there will be.

452
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,280
Qingti.

453
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,600
You suggested to add
reinforcements in the Emperor's Tomb,

454
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,520
and change the way of guarding.

455
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,200
I think the suggestions are very good.

456
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,160
You're allowed to do them.

457
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,080
Yes.

458
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,120
The smell...

459
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
Your wound?

460
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I happened to get

461
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
an effective ointment for curing scars.

462
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
This is cotton rose ointment

463
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,640
I specially made for you, Your Majesty.

464
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,160
It's so nice of you.

465
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,840
I'm really happy.

466
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,640
Let my apply it for you, Your Majesty.

467
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,560
I saw you were being melancholy in the Heaven.

468
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Do you get into any troubles?

469
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,120
I don't want to carry on anymore.

470
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,800
It's too hard.

471
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,640
I told you not to come.

472
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,160
You didn't believe me.
Instead, you insisted.

473
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,880
Now you've experienced
all the hardships in the mortal realm.

474
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
It sucks, right?

475
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,000
Now I understand the lovey-dovey

476
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,680
in the books.

477
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,000
Sorrow and bitterness are what hidden behind.

478
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,200
Your Highness, you are getting in deeper and deeper.

479
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,800
It's better sooner than later with the pain.

480
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,520
You are too kind to Song Xuanren.

481
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,640
If you don't hurt him soon,

482
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
when will His Majesty

483
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
finish his love misfortune?

484
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,240
But it's killing me

485
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
to see him experience love in vain.

486
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,960
Only after he goes through love misfortune,

487
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,000
can you be freed.

488
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
The extraordinary place you were talking about is here?

489
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,120
Yes.

490
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,480
It's so beautiful.

491
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,840
I thought the scenery on earth was just so so.

492
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,960
But the beautiful scenery I'm looking at right now

493
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,960
is nothing less than that in Sky Kingdom.

494
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,840
I used to come here

495
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,000
when I was upset.

496
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Looking at the setting sun,

497
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,920
feeling the breeze,

498
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,320
and you feel like

499
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,320
all the things that have
been upsetting you are gone.

500
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,440
How did you find

501
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,320
such an extraordinary place?

502
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,440
Once I went for a war with my father.

503
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,240
But I got blamed by my father

504
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,160
for being too aggressive in the war.

505
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,400
I was young back then.

506
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,200
And I rode my horse here.

507
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
At that time,

508
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,280
I wanted to be alone,

509
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,680
just like how you're feeling now.

510
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,280
Qingti, the scar on your face is fading away.

511
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,360
Thank you for giving me cotton rose ointment.

512
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,960
You're welcome.

513
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,920
Xiaojiu.

514
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Is he not being nice to you?

515
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,120
He's very nice to me.

516
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,360
Maybe I just don't belong to

517
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
that palace.

518
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,600
What's wrong?

519
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,000
What are you hiding?

520
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,120
Nothing.

521
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,920
Just a little something

522
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,440
I wanted to give you.

523
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,880
But I haven't got the chance.

524
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,760
You can't take back what you sent out.

525
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,000
It's beautiful.

526
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,480
Really?

527
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,560
I thought you got tired of the delicate articles in the palace,

528
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,920
and don't fancy something like it.

529
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,520
No, it's not true.

530
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,230
Does it look nice?

531
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,920
You like it?

532
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm glad you like it.

533
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,630
Xiaojiu.

534
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,960
Come find me anytime

535
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
if you don't want to be

536
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,280
in the palace anymore.

537
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
The sun is setting.

538
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,080
I guess it will turn cold

539
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,640
in the evening here.

540
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,960
You want to go back?

541
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,960
No.

542
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I want to stay here looking at the stars.

543
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,280
In the palace,

544
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,160
you can see just a few of them.

545
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,120
Can I stay here and look at the sky

546
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,000
some more?

547
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Sure.

548
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
Your Majesty, time to sleep.

549
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,680
I'll go to Yue Hua Palace tonight.

550
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,840
Yes.

551
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,520
Arrange carriage to Yue Hua Palace.

552
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,720
Your Highness is finally back.

553
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,160
Your Majesty!

554
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,680
Are you mimes?

555
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,840
His Majesty is asking you a question!

556
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,760
Where is Madam Jiu?

557
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,000
Chief Eunuch,

558
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,520
I met Madam Jiu and greeted her

559
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,840
when she went out this morning.

560
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,280
Did she say anything?

561
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,240
Madam Jiu said

562
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,440
she wanted to go out of palace
for some peace and quiet.

563
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,560
She said...

564
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,840
She said she was meeting someone,

565
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,240
whose name was Ye...

566
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,840
Okay, I'll see myself off from here.

567
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm worried to let you go back alone.

568
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,840
And it is my responsibility to

569
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,360
keep you safe.

570
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,400
I'm really grateful for you today.

571
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,240
This is the happiest day
I've ever had since I came to the palace.

572
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,400
And thank you for your present.

573
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,720
Xiaojiu.

574
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,760
Keep in mind what I said.

575
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,040
Come find me

576
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,000
if you ever feel unhappy.

577
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Your Majesty.

578
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,480
You're back.

579
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,640
Where have you been?

580
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,640
I felt cooped up in the palace.

581
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,280
So I went out for some fun.

582
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,560
By yourself?

583
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,040
Yes, by myself.

584
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,880
How could you be out there so late by yourself?

585
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,960
There's story-telling in a tavern.

586
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,600
I guess I must have been fascinated by it,

587
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,160
and forgot about time.
That's why I came back late.

588
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,560
What's the story

589
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,840
that made you so fascinated?

590
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,800
It was a love story about an emperor and a beauty.

591
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,880
An emperor and a beauty?

592
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,360
Yes.

593
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,320
I got so fascinated that I...

594
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,160
And you bought a bracelet.

595
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,880
I saw it in a store and thought it was beautiful,

596
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,040
so I bought it.

597
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
I thought you didn't fancy

598
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,600
these vulgar jewels.

599
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,760
Now I get it.

600
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,840
You just don't like what I sent you.

601
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,440
Your Majesty.

602
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,080
Never mind.

603
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,240
Take some rest.

604
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,080
I should head back.
