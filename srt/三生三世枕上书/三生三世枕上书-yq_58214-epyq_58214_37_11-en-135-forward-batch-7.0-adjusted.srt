00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 11

3
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,540
Your Highness.

4
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Why are you here?

5
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,380
Your Highness,

6
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,980
did you go to the mortal realm for His Majesty?

7
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,860
No.

8
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,900
Really?

9
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,820
I just went there to get some scripts.

10
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,260
Then why do you look pale?

11
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,740
Maybe it's because

12
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,780
I've been studying too hard these days.

13
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,660
Actually, I've been engrossed in swordsmanship lately.

14
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Perhaps I've practiced too much.

15
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,780
How about letting me

16
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,500
check your pulse?

17
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,540
Obviously, these symptoms showed up

18
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,340
after your magic arts backfired on you in the mortal realm.

19
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,420
Won't you tell me the truth?

20
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,340
I... I did go to see His Majesty.

21
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,380
His Majesty hasn't recovered.

22
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,700
If you bother him,

23
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
he wouldn't regain his strength,

24
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,780
which, in turn,

25
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,820
makes him unable to suppress Miaoyi Chasm.

26
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,540
By then,

27
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,540
Miao Luo will break the seal.

28
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,780
Then the universe

29
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,020
will undergo great calamity.

30
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,820
Do you know all that?

31
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,380
How could it be like this?

32
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,140
I've heard he's gone to experience
his misfortunes in the mortal realm

33
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,700
to better understand the "seven suffering" in Buddhist texts.

34
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,940
Why did you say he's there to regain his strength?

35
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,260
Every action His Majesty makes

36
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,500
is vital to the universe.

37
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,380
How can we...

38
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,540
How can we let others know

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,100
His Majesty is badly injured?

40
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,220
Your Highness, you're muddle-headed.

41
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,100
But I didn't bother him.

42
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,580
I even saved him

43
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,420
when he was in danger.

44
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,580
Your saving him

45
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,340
actually bothered him.

46
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,140
Why?

47
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,580
His Majesty was supposed to

48
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,100
go through three major setbacks in the mortal realm.

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,300
I won't give you too many details.

50
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,300
Let me just tell you something about his relationships.

51
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,300
According to Book of Fate,

52
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,420
His Majesty should've been badly wounded in that battle.

53
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,580
Then he should be saved by a maid called Zhou Mengxi

54
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,100
before getting better.

55
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,140
That's why His Majesty falls in love with her.

56
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,140
Zhou Mengxi

57
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,580
is the one His Majesty is destined to love.

58
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,740
Now that you saved His Majesty,

59
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,820
he was not injured at all,

60
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,220
so he couldn't meet Zhou Mengxi.

61
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,780
Then how could he fall in love with her?

62
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,820
So...

63
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,820
What to do now?

64
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,380
Is there anything I can do to make up for it?

65
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,700
To make up for it,

66
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,940
you have to let His Majesty meet Zhou Mengxi soon.

67
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,220
As the saying goes, whoever started the trouble should end it.

68
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,700
Your Highness,

69
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,900
now that you stopped them meeting each other,

70
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,180
you'll have to help them encounter.

71
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,260
Then His Majesty can continue experiencing his misfortune.

72
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:31,980
Okay.

73
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,700
I'll go to the mortal realm

74
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,260
and find Zhou Mengxi.

75
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:35,860
Wait.

76
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,620
Let me repeat it.

77
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,140
Your magic arts will backfire on you

78
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,820
if you use them in the mortal realm.

79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,140
You may be seriously injured and even die.

80
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,300
You've known what it's like.

81
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,420
Remember.

82
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,580
No matter how awful the situation is,

83
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,620
don't use magic arts.

84
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,900
Got it.

85
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,460
I used some magic arts

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,420
and then almost failed to come back.

87
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,980
I won't use them again.

88
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Hope to see you again.

89
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,100
Okay.

90
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,780
Hope to see you again.

91
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,220
Okay.

92
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,940
Take care.

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,820
Sir, this way please.

94
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,260
Okay.

95
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,940
Those cosmetics in the mortal realm

96
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,580
can cover my birthmark on the forehead easily.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,300
I wouldn't have bothered Zhe Yan if I had known that.

98
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,180
This way, please.

99
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,220
A table by the window.

100
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,780
What would you like to have, sir?

101
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,940
Just recommend two dishes to me.

102
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,300
Okay. Just a minute.

103
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,140
Si Ming said Zhou Mengxi stays in the imperial palace
of the State of Chengyu.

104
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,060
So, the first thing is

105
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,020
to find a way to enter the imperial palace

106
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,260
before I can get more information.

107
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,780
But how can I get there?

108
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,580
Okay, sir.

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,780
Here are your dishes.

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,140
Here you are.

111
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,100
Okay. This is the liquor you want.

112
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,500
It's awful.

113
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Si Ming did me a favor

114
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,020
when I wanted to be a maid in Tai Chen Palace.

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,300
Nobody could help me in the mortal realm.

116
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,660
That beauty has arrived!

117
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,980
That beauty has arrived!

118
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,660
Waiter,

119
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,260
what's going on?

120
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,500
Sir, there is something you don't know.

121
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
The princess of the State of Chong'an has arrived.

122
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Everyone wants to have a look at her.

123
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,980
I wonder what His Majesty's woman looks like

124
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,700
when he's in the mortal realm.

125
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,180
I'll go have a look.

126
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,220
Look. That's General Ye.

127
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,900
He's hot!

128
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,380
- He's handsome. - A fine-looking man.

129
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,540
He's the general

130
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,540
who fought with His Majesty side by side that day.

131
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,780
If I get to know him,

132
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,340
I can ask him to help me

133
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,060
enter the imperial palace.

134
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,980
Beautiful.

135
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,100
Your Highness,

136
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,340
so many people are here for you.

137
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,700
I don't think they've seen anyone

138
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,500
as gorgeous as you.

139
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220
A grander ceremony must be awaiting us

140
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,060
after we enter the imperial palace.

141
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,060
The more attention we draw,

142
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,340
the more inconvenient it'll be for us to take actions.

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,820
Mr. Nie asked us to be cautious

144
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,740
when we stay in the imperial palace.

145
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Got it.

146
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,780
General Ye.

147
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,820
Your Highness. General Ye.

148
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,300
General Ye.

149
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,180
Protect Her Highness!

150
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,740
Got it!

151
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,540
Ling Xiang,

152
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,340
don't worry.

153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,660
General Ye is brave and battlewise. It'll be fine.

154
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,700
General Ye, watch out!

155
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,060
Watch your back!

156
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,300
Your Highness, be careful.

157
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,740
Your Highness, let's try to get out of here.

158
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,580
Ling Xiang,

159
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,020
if we lose patience because of something trivial like this,

160
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,060
how could we get the treasure?

161
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,180
Don't let them know you can do Kung Fu unless it's necessary,

162
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,460
or they'll be suspicious of us.

163
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,300
Your Highness, you're right.

164
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,260
Please forgive me.

165
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,420
Who sent you here?

166
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,380
Pull back!

167
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,660
Chase them!

168
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,220
Got it.

169
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
Take these bodies back

170
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,140
to find out their identities.

171
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,020
And catch those suspicious people around for interrogation.

172
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,140
Got it.

173
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,500
Your Highness, sorry for letting you be scared.

174
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,380
I should've done better.

175
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,500
Please forgive me.

176
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Your Highness, are you injured?

177
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,780
General Ye,

178
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,180
Her Highness is not injured.

179
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,180
General Ye, you did a good job.

180
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,380
You didn't do anything wrong.

181
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,980
Have those assassins been caught?

182
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,460
I've sent guys to chase those who ran away.

183
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,500
Those we caught have died of poison.

184
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,900
It's safe now.

185
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,980
Please don't worry.

186
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,340
General Ye, you deserve the reputation you enjoy.

187
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm flattered.

188
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,820
To prevent such a thing happening again,

189
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,700
I'll escort you to the imperial palace now.

190
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,660
Just do as you say.

191
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,500
Go!

192
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,780
I'm not an assassin.

193
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,380
General Ye knows me.

194
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:12,940
- Cut the crap. - Go!

195
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,100
We'll find out the truth after interrogation.

196
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,820
Go!

197
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,420
Let go of him.

198
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,700
Who allowed you to tie him up?

199
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,060
You can leave.

200
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,380
Got it.

201
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,460
I ordered them to take back suspicious people.

203
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,660
Unexpectedly, they tied you up.

204
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,980
I thought

205
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,020
you'd return my kindness

206
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,980
with ingratitude.

207
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,300
Xiaojiu,

208
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,540
you saved His Majesty

209
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,900
over and over again.

210
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,300
I couldn't be rude to you

211
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,940
no matter how unwise I am.

212
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,940
How did you know my name?

213
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,180
Where did you get it?

214
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,340
Since you saved His Majesty that day on the battlefield,

215
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
he's been trying to find you.

216
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,340
He had portraits of you painted and posted across the country.

217
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,740
Don't you know that?

218
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,060
Why were you disguised as a solider?

219
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,860
Why did you come here in the capital?

220
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,380
I...

221
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,620
Forget about it.

222
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,260
I'll take you to the imperial palace now.

223
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,060
You can tell His Majesty directly.

224
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,660
Let's go.

225
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,100
Ye Qingti's subordinates

226
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,380
are tougher than common soldiers.

227
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,420
And he himself is bold and powerful.

228
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,540
But don't worry.

229
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,100
All of them killed themselves after being caught,

230
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,460
leaving no clues at all.

231
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:39,980
Good.

232
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,900
Each of you will be rewarded.

233
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,180
Your Highness,

234
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,580
now that I didn't fulfill the task,

235
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,020
I don't dare to accept any reward.

236
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,420
This failure

237
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,860
is not your fault.

238
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,940
You'll be rewarded as usual.

239
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,580
Give them liquor.

240
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,020
Come on.

241
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,140
For bros who lost their lives!

242
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,140
For bros who lost their lives!

243
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,500
Ye Qingti,

244
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,740
you're lucky this time,

245
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,300
but I won't leave it at that.

246
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,340
After a title is conferred on the princess of Chong'an,

247
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
I'll report to His Majesty.

248
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Then you'll be summoned.

249
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,100
I see.

250
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,060
Your Highness, here we are.

251
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,420
Please follow me.

252
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,820
It's a pity that I didn't see her face.

253
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,540
I'm going to see His Majesty soon.

254
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,180
He's just a mortal.

255
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,060
Why am I still so nervous?

256
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,540
Bai Fengjiu,

257
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,860
you're really hopeless.

258
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,900
Your Majesty,

259
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,820
Princess Chu Wan of Chong'an arrives.

260
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,860
Let her in.

261
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,860
Let Princess Chu Wan of Chong'an come in!

262
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,060
Here she comes.

263
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,460
Gorgeous!

264
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,700
She proves herself to be the No.1 beauty in Chong'an.

265
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,980
She deserves her reputation.

266
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,260
Exactly.

267
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,460
Let me show my respect to you, Your Majesty.

268
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,780
Rise.

269
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,420
Chu Wan, are you injured?

270
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,660
Thank you for your care.

271
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,500
It's all good with me.

272
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm unharmed.

273
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,420
You must've been scared

274
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,860
now that an assassination happened once you came into town.

275
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,340
I'll find the truth out

276
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,340
and give you an explanation.

277
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

278
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,860
I really appreciate it.

279
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,100
The two states of Chengyu
and Chong'an had many complaints against each other

280
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,260
and had been at war for years,

281
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,140
resulting in numerous casualties.

282
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,820
It's a good thing

283
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,340
that we make peace

284
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,260
with each other

285
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,740
and turn hostility to friendship.

286
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,340
Chu Wan, you impressed me

287
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,820
with your praiseworthy courage.

288
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,180
The benefits people received from you are beyond measure.

289
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,660
I'm flattered.

290
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,500
It's a great honor

291
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,020
to do my bit for the sake of the two states.

292
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,300
Great.

293
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,580
You're sensible

294
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,100
and reasonable.

295
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,740
It's a blessing for people of the two states to have you.

296
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,060
Now that your name is Chu Wan,

297
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,140
Imperial Concubine Wan will be conferred on you.

298
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,700
You'll live in Wan Yun Palace.

299
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

300
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,500
Rewards will be sent to your palace later.

301
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,900
After having a long journey

302
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,620
and being scared,

303
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
you'd better go back and have a good rest.

304
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

305
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,420
I'm taking my leave.

306
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,660
Your Majesty,

307
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,820
there is something I need to report to you.

308
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,860
Go ahead.

309
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,100
When the assassination happened,

310
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,100
a young man came to my help and saved me.

311
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,620
I found that

312
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,340
he's the one you've been looking for.

313
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,820
Do you mean Xiaojiu?

314
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,540
Where is he?

315
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,780
He's waiting outside the hall.

316
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,620
Let him in!

317
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,580
Let Xiaojiu come in.

318
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,780
Let Xiaojiu come in.

319
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,140
Ji Heng?

320
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,420
Why does she look the same as Ji Heng?

321
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
Hasn't Ji Heng disappeared?

322
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,660
Is it possible

323
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,940
she also comes to the mortal realm?

324
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Or is she here to help His Majesty go through his misfortunes?

325
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,460
Let Xiaojiu come in.

326
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,020
Let Xiaojiu come in.

327
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,900
Xiaojiu.

328
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,460
Xiaojiu.

329
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,700
Xiaojiu.

330
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,060
Kowtow to His Majesty.

331
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,700
Let me show my respect, Your Majesty.

332
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,660
Rise.

333
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,060
Thank you.

334
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,740
I've tried numerous ways in vain to find you.

335
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Are you really called Xiaojiu?

336
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,660
Yes.

337
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,700
What's your surname?

338
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,580
Bai.

339
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,620
It means "white".

340
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,820
Where are you from?

341
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,620
Why were you disguised as a solider that day?

342
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,140
I live in the mountains at the border.

343
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,580
I happened to pass the battlefield that day

344
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,500
and see you get into trouble.

345
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,700
In a moment of desperation,

346
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,220
I got dressed in a soldier's clothes.

347
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,900
Later, I got injured,

348
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,140
so I went back to heal my wounds.

349
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,980
Qingti told me

350
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,380
it's you that saved his life

351
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,900
and protected the princess of Chong'an

352
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,180
when the assassination happened.

353
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,100
You prevented a crisis between the two states.

354
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,220
And you saved my life last time.

355
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,620
So...

356
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
What do you want as rewards?

357
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,980
I don't need any rewards.

358
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,300
No matter it's about saving you or General Ye,

359
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,860
it's what I should do

360
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
as a citizen of Chengyu.

361
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,460
You don't need any rewards?

362
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:09,980
Unbelievable.

363
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,300
Really.

364
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,860
But I'm not stingy.

365
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,060
I have to do something for you in return.

366
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,460
You can choose a high position, gold and jewelry,

367
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,540
big houses or beautiful women.

368
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,780
You can have all those things

369
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,540
as long as you tell me.

370
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,260
Think over about it.

371
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,380
In this case, I have a request.

372
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,180
Go ahead.

373
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,500
Can I stay here in the imperial palace?

374
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,580
Stay here?

375
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,220
Yes.

376
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,380
I seldom saw my parents.

377
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,660
At the first meeting, I felt like...

378
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,820
...you're my old friend.

379
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,540
I didn't have a chance to talk to you that day,

380
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,220
but I've never forgotten you

381
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,540
since then.

382
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,180
So, I want to always stay

383
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,580
by your side as a guard

384
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,220
to protect you.

385
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,900
Such a reward...

386
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,620
...is nothing compared with what you have done.

387
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,820
But now that you want to do that,

388
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,700
I'll let you stay.

389
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,420
You can have other rewards later.

390
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,780
Thank you.

391
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,780
Your Highness.

392
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,500
Go ahead.

393
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,220
What on earth did those assassins come for?

394
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,380
What do you think?

395
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,540
Obviously, they were there for you.

396
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,420
Is it possible some people in Chong'an
are opposed to the intermarriage?

397
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,500
So they sent guys to assassinate you.

398
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,020
If I'm killed in Chengyu,

399
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,460
Chong'an would say it's Chengyu's fault

400
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,220
and they may go to war again.

401
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,340
How will those guys benefit from that?

402
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,980
It makes sense.

403
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,020
Is it possible some officials of Chong'an

404
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,220
are jealous of Mr. Nie

405
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,860
now that he has won over the emperor's trust?

406
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,540
So, they decided to kill you.

407
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,660
It's possible.

408
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,860
I'll send a message to Mr. Nie

409
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,900
and ask him to be more careful.

410
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,420
Your Highness,

411
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,460
what shall we do next?

412
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,820
Well,

413
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,900
you just get well along with

414
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,860
Chief Imperial Bodyguard and maids here.

415
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,060
Try to ask about the topography.

416
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,700
Draw a map

417
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,940
of how to get to the throne room

418
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,340
from Wan Yun Palace.

419
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,620
I'll get these things done.

420
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,340
Have you got any clues about the assassins?

421
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,420
Those who were caught killed themselves on the spot.

422
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,500
We can't tell their backgrounds from their bodies.

423
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
As for their weapons,

424
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,860
both materials and styles are common,

425
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,180
so the origin is still unknown.

426
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,140
Keep investigating the issue.

427
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,540
Let me know

428
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,460
as long as you have further information.

429
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,300
Got it.

430
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,060
No matter who's the one behind the scenes,

431
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,500
there will be more assassinations

432
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,300
now that they failed this time.

433
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,660
From now on,

434
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,660
you'll serve as Director of the Imperial Guards

435
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,100
and be responsible for the safety of the imperial palace,

436
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,260
especially Wan Yun Palace.

437
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,300
Your subject obeys.

438
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,300
Now that Xiaojiu wants to be a guard,

439
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,340
help him with relevant procedures.

440
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,740
You can trust me.

441
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,340
I'll get it arranged.

442
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,580
The door is open.

443
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,740
Come in, General Ye.

444
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,580
His Majesty specially assigned a side palace to you.

445
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,100
It has never happened to any guard before.

446
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,340
Are you happy?

447
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,220
Yes.

448
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,300
It's not only a comfortable place

449
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,460
but also close to His Majesty's palace.

450
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,420
Oh.

451
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,180
His Majesty asked me to promote you,

452
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,460
so I planned to let you be a team leader.

453
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,740
What do you think?

454
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,860
What should I do as a team leader?

455
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,780
Will I have much free time?

456
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,460
Yes.

457
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,860
If there is nothing special,

458
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,380
you just need to go on patrol several times every day.

459
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,460
That'd be great.

460
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,660
Alright.

461
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,380
I'm done with official business.

462
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,780
Now I want to express my personal gratitude.

463
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,620
General Ye, don't be so polite.

464
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,100
It's nothing precious.

465
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,780
Just a pot of alcohol that has been stored for 60 years.

466
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,300
I know it's out of the ordinary by just smelling.

467
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,260
In the Eight Deserts...

468
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,660
I may never have a chance to drink such alcohol again.

469
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,660
This is for your saving my life.

470
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,940
Come on. Cheers.

471
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,220
Cheers.

472
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,180
Pure and sweet, with an aftertaste that lingers.

473
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,500
It's good!

474
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,380
Xiaojiu, you can tell good from bad.

475
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,460
To be honest,

476
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,500
besides martial arts and military tactics,

477
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,820
my only hobby is alcohol.

478
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,100
It turns out we're kindred spirits.

479
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,620
I wish I could know you earlier.

480
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,940
I like martial arts too.

481
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,700
Really?

482
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,580
We can compare notes if there is any chance.

483
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,060
Cheers.

484
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,380
General Ye,

485
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,860
the scar on your face doesn't make you ugly,

486
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,260
but have you thought about having it removed?

487
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,300
His Majesty has asked imperial physicians about it.

488
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
There isn't much they can do.

489
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,340
I happen to know a secret prescription,

490
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,980
but I'm not sure

491
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,060
if the medicine is available or not.

492
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,500
It doesn't matter.

493
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm a man.

494
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,780
A scar is no big deal.

495
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,180
Cheers.

496
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,620
Ling Xiang,

497
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,980
let's find out the topography

498
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,140
of the imperial palace

499
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,020
and draw a complete map soon.

500
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,420
Then we'll investigate

501
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
and check one by one

502
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,980
to know the whereabouts of Lingbi Stone.

503
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,780
Got it, Your Highness.

504
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,580
Remember.

505
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,500
Avoid becoming the center of attention.

506
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,940
I see.

507
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,940
It's been great to chat with you

508
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,260
while drinking.

509
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,540
Xiaojiu,

510
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,660
how about being my sworn brother?

511
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,420
General Ye,

512
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,940
you're a general.

513
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
As a common guard, I don't deserve to be your brother.

514
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,460
You must be drunk.

515
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,300
I'm quite sober.

516
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,300
I just think we have good chemistry.

517
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,540
Well. It's not been long since we got to know each other,

518
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,020
so it may be a little rude to say that.

519
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,260
Let's talk about it later.

520
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,660
But

521
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,580
I'm serious about asking you to be my sworn brother.

522
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,500
Yeah. I see.

523
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,380
Cheers, General Ye.

524
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:31,820
Cheers.

525
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,780
General Ye.

526
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,940
I have a question for you.

527
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,020
Just go ahead.

528
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,380
I wonder if there is a maid

529
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,620
or an imperial concubine

530
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,860
called Zhou Mengxi here.

531
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,820
Zhou Mengxi?

532
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,740
I've never heard of this name.

533
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,020
What is she to you?

534
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,500
She's one of my distant relatives.

535
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,220
I've never heard of her

536
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,620
since she entered the imperial palace years ago.

537
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,060
As Director of the Imperial Guards,

538
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,700
I have the right to

539
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,700
check the muster roll of all maids.

540
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,380
I'll help you look for her.

541
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,180
Let me drink a toast to you.

542
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:09,660
Cheers.

543
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,580
General Ye, I'll count on you.

544
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,380
Your Majesty,

545
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,700
are you going to Wan Yun Palace tonight?

546
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,700
Chu Wan...

547
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,980
She just arrived here

548
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,940
and was frightened on her way.

549
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,260
I'll go there a few days later.

550
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,460
Go to her palace tomorrow

551
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,660
and tell her that I've been tied up
with official business lately.

552
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,260
Ask her to relax and have a good rest.

553
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,060
Got it.

554
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,820
How is it going with Xiaojiu?

555
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,020
Your Majesty, don't worry.

556
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,060
General Ye has got everything set.

557
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,420
Xiaojiu stays in a side palace.

558
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,420
It's very close to Muning Hall where you live.

559
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,300
Really?

560
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,380
Good.

561
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,020
I want to go out for a walk

562
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,020
and relax.

563
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,620
Let's go to his place.

564
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,700
What's going on? I'm having a terrible headache.

565
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,580
The alcohol has strong delayed effect.

566
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,420
It's really been stored for 60 years.

567
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,700
Your Majesty,

568
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,420
you've been in a good mood

569
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,860
since you found Xiaojiu.

570
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,860
Really?

571
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,620
Is it so obvious?

572
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,380
You've been in a good mood since you found Xiaojiu.

573
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,140
And you married the princess of Chong'an.

574
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,820
I think

575
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,260
little princes will be born

576
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,060
in the imperial palace soon.

577
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,860
I hope I can live longer

578
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,420
to take care of your kids.

579
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,300
At holidays and festivals,

580
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,540
I'll visit your parents' tombs

581
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,980
and tell them

582
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,900
about their grandchildren.

583
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,460
Then you have to live 100 years.

584
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,940
His Majesty fell into the lake!

585
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,540
Save His Majesty!

586
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,380
Save His Majesty!

587
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,140
Save His Majesty!

588
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,300
Your Majesty!

589
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,540
Guards!

590
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,340
Go have a look.

591
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:34,940
Yeah.

592
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,420
Hurry.

593
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,740
General Ye!

594
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,580
What's up?

595
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,260
His Majesty fell into the lake by accident
in the imperial garden.

596
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:42,780
What?

597
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,540
It's said someone bumped into him.

598
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,460
We're searching for suspects.

599
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,620
Your Majesty, be careful.

600
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,180
Your Majesty.

601
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,820
Hurry up.

602
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,300
Your Majesty.

603
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
There is still a girl inside.

604
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,540
Anyone who saves her

605
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,460
will be heavily rewarded.

606
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,180
- Got it. - Quick.

607
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,220
Hurry.

608
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,420
Your Majesty,

609
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,140
let's wait in the pavilion.

610
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,900
I often went swimming in Rebirth Sea of Qingqiu.

611
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,820
How could I be trapped in such a small pond?

612
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,260
I'll go back and have a bath.

613
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,540
Send more guys into the lake.

614
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,580
She's not here.

615
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,580
How is it going?

616
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,300
General Ye.

617
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,180
Nobody has been found in the lake.

618
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,140
General Ye,

619
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,260
His Majesty ordered us

620
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,700
to look for a girl in the lake.

621
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,420
How on earth did His Majesty fall into the lake?

622
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,820
That girl bumped into His Majesty,

623
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,340
but we've found no trace of her.

624
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,620
A girl?

625
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,980
Comb the area.

626
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,100
Don't disturb the imperial harem.

627
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,500
Send someone to check where the maids went tonight

628
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,180
and if anyone suspicious showed up.

629
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,300
Got it.

630
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,100
Let's go.

631
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,780
Your Majesty.

632
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,060
I can't believe

633
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,020
there is such a beautiful girl in the world.

634
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,580
Your Majesty,

635
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,260
you haven't seen your concubines for a long time.

636
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,500
Did you mistake a maid for her?

637
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,420
No.

638
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,500
No.

639
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,140
I don't think so.

640
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,700
Your Majesty,

641
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,180
you must be tired.

642
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,380
How about

643
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,620
going to Imperial Concubine Wan's palace

644
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,500
so that she can serve you?

645
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,580
I'm eager to drink some ginger tea

646
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,580
instead of sleeping with my concubine.

647
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,780
Did you find her?

648
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,340
Your Majesty,

649
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,260
they'll report to you

650
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,780
as soon as they find her.

651
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,340
You'd better take care.

652
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,740
I see.

653
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,860
I'll go on reading the memorials.

654
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,820
Just let me know if there is any news.

655
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,540
I've asked people of all palaces

656
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,300
if anyone suspicious showed up last night,

657
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,820
but we've found no clue.

658
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,660
Captain Bai wants to see you.

659
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,540
Let him in.

660
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,700
Your Majesty, you summoned me?

661
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,500
Xiaojiu,

662
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,140
from today on,

663
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,060
you report to Qingti.

664
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,620
You're here at the right time, Xiaojiu.

665
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,180
His Majesty just assigned a tough task to us.

666
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,140
A tough task?

667
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,100
No matter how hard it is,

668
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,460
I'll try my best.

669
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,780
We have to find a suspicious girl for His Majesty.

670
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,100
Mind your language.

671
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,940
Qingti.

672
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,260
Qingti, you're way too conservative.

673
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,780
It's a fairy.

674
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,620
I fell in love with her at first sight.

675
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,620
I can't drive her out of my mind.

676
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,780
His Majesty fell in love with a girl in the mortal realm.

677
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,180
Has Zhou Mengxi showed up?

678
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,380
She's the one that made His Majesty fall into the lake.

679
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
Fall into the lake?

680
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,300
She has occupied all my mind.

681
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,580
From today on,

682
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,380
it's your task

683
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,620
to find that fairy for me.

684
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,140
Got it.

685
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,780
Got it, Your Majesty.

686
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,900
His Majesty is always cautious.

687
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,220
How could he be captivated by a suspicious girl?

688
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,060
Exactly.

689
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Such things happened one after another.

690
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,540
Xiaojiu,

691
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,900
it's just been a few days since we knew each other.

692
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
I didn't expect you also care about

693
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,940
His Majesty so much.

694
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,100
You're also wondering

695
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,780
where we should start

696
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,500
to find this unidentified person, right?

697
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,300
Yeah.

698
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,540
She was too careless.

699
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,900
I mean...

700
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,900
Now that she acted secretively at night,

701
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,740
she couldn't be a good person.

702
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,540
General Ye,

703
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,260
we can't let His Majesty find her.

704
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,580
I agree with you.

705
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,820
You'll be an excellent guard.

706
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,460
I just said what came to my mind.

707
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,620
Oh.

708
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,020
Can you take me with you

709
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,180
if you want to look for that girl?

710
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,060
I want to take the opportunity to look for Zhou Mengxi.

711
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,140
It's a piece of cake.

712
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,140
Just follow me.

713
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,900
You saved my life.

714
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,220
His Majesty asked you to be my subordinate

715
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,820
just because he wants me to take care of you.

716
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,260
However, before that,

717
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,660
as a team leader,

718
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,620
you have to see our bros.

719
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,540
Okay.

720
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,300
In my opinion, that girl must be one of the enemy's spies.

721
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:23,980
A maid.

722
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,940
She must be a maid.

723
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,140
Here comes General.

724
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
- General. - General.

725
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,300
Why are you messing about

726
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,780
instead of working hard?

727
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,340
General,

728
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,380
we're betting on the identity of the girl

729
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,420
who fell into the lake last night.

730
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:37,900
Right.

731
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,780
How dare you?

732
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,020
How can you gossip

733
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,420
about His Majesty's issue?

734
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,220
General,

735
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,980
we're just worried about His Majesty.

736
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,100
Exactly.

737
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,820
What's your conclusion?

738
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,780
Half of us think she's one of the enemy's spies.

739
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,020
The other half

740
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,060
believes she's an ambitious maid.

741
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,020
Enough.

742
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,180
Time to stop. Brace yourself up.

743
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,580
He is the one

744
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,780
who saved His Majesty on the battlefield,

745
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,500
Bai Xiaojiu.

746
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,500
He also saved my life.

747
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,140
His Majesty asked him to work for me

748
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,460
as a team leader.

749
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,660
Come on.

750
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,100
Come meet him.

751
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,700
Um...

752
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
Can he do that?

753
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,300
He looks weak. Exactly.

754
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,300
General,

755
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,900
he just joined us.

756
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,780
Can he show us what he can do

757
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,820
so that we assign suitable tasks to him?

758
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,500
I'm just afraid His Majesty would blame us

759
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,900
if he's injured.

760
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,620
Right?

761
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,340
Yeah.

762
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,780
That's right.

763
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,820
Alright. How do you want to compete?

764
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,340
Unexpectedly, he's amazing.

765
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:52,820
Yeah.

766
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,860
Good match.

767
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:47,780
Awesome.

768
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,580
I didn't expect to see that.

769
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,340
You Imperial Guards are capable.

770
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,820
We're inferior to you,

771
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,980
but we're influential to some extent

772
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,460
now that we can go around in the imperial palace.

773
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,980
If we can be of any help,

774
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,900
just come to us.

775
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,260
That's right.

776
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,380
Feel free to come to us.

777
00:40:59,500 --> 00:40:59,980
Exactly.

778
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,540
We'll try our best to help you.

779
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,620
There he is.

780
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,020
General.

781
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,540
General.

782
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,260
General.

783
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,180
Where have you been?

784
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,300
We didn't see you.

785
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,980
All of you are fooling around.

786
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,260
Get prepared

787
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,900
and go to work.

788
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,420
Got it.

789
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,460
Xiaojiu,

790
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,420
follow me.

791
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:18,820
He's a skillful archer.

792
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,420
Yeah.

793
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,540
He's capable.

794
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,940
Just call me Qingti in the future.

795
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,420
If you're so polite,

796
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,260
I'll have to call you my life saver.

797
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,500
Okay.

798
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,900
Xiaojiu,

799
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,660
I checked about Zhou Mengxi

800
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,620
while I checked about that unidentified girl.

801
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,660
But looking through the muster roll of maids
in the past five years,

802
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,180
I didn't find her name.

803
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,940
Not in the past five years?

804
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,620
When on earth did she enter the imperial palace?

805
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,140
Do you have any other clue?

806
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,700
I looked for her for someone else,

807
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,140
so I don't know many details about her.

808
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,900
Then it's like searching for a needle in a haystack.

809
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,860
It'll be time-consuming.

810
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,100
How about this?

811
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,780
Please take me

812
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,020
whenever you need to go out.

813
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,780
I'll look for her as long as I work here.

814
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,380
I shouldn't have acted on impulse today.

815
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,580
I should've gone with you.

816
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,580
It's nothing.

817
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,460
From today on,

818
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,860
they are also your bros.

819
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,460
We have to be of one heart and one mind

820
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,300
to go through thick and thin in the future.

821
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,340
We have to join hands to protect His Majesty.

822
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,020
Got it, General Ye.
