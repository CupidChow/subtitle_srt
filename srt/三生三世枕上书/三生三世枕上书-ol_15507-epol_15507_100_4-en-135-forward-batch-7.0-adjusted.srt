1
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 4

3
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,480
Nie Chuyin.

4
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Nie Chuyin,

5
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,840
You'll have to come up with an idea for me.

6
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,480
Badger.

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Badger.

8
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
Is...

9
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,800
this for me?

10
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Have you been searching for
it for hundreds of years, haven't you?

11
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,680
If you help me out this time,

12
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
I'll give it to you.

13
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,080
What's it?

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,840
I want to make the poker face fight with me.

15
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,560
The poker face?

16
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Emperor Dong Hua?

17
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,800
Yes.

18
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,240
It seems

19
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,040
your fight with him has already ended.

20
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,880
It's my negligence.

21
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,080
What I mean is to fight with him fair and square.

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
I won't play the dirty tricks he does.

23
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,200
It's not like my style.

24
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
I really do have an idea.

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,160
Rumor has it that

26
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,920
there is a soul-locking jade belonging to Emperor Dong Hua

27
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,160
that blocks evil monsters on earth.

28
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,520
How does it relate to the fight between me and him?

29
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
I mean, the soul-locking jade,

30
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
if it's lost,

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
what's he gonna do?

32
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,120
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Miaoyi Chasm?

34
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,720
I'll go check on it. You stay here.

35
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,080
Don't spread it.

36
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,160
Yes.

37
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,360
What's wrong with His Majesty?

38
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,360
It's so strange.

39
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,120
It is.

40
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Your Majesty.

41
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,320
Your Majesty.

42
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,400
Haven't you been in just now?

43
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
It's... It's...

44
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,360
Poker Face,

45
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
I do know

46
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
you will chase after me for the meaningless thing.

47
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Now you do have to have a fight with me, don't you?

48
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
I really can't figure out

49
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,120
why Xu Yang wants to betroth Ji Heng to you.

50
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,560
In terms of appearance,I won't be overwhelmed by you.

51
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,160
Except that I'm not as aged as you,

52
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,880
how am I any worse than you?

53
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,880
If the soul-locking jade can be brought back safely,

54
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,320
I might regard it as the price

55
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,080
you pay the Tai Chen Palace.

56
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,640
What do you

57
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
mean the price?

58
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
If there's something wrong,

59
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,040
you,

60
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,320
and your entire clan would die with you.

61
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
Emperor Dong Hua,

62
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,280
who becomes a Buddha or a demon
depending on a blinding flash,

63
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
dies for the killing.

64
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,080
You can act as well as Miao Luo, can't you?

65
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Yu Ru,

66
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,480
go ask about where my foster brother is.

67
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,760
Your Highness.

69
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,030
Why are you standing still?

70
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Even though my foster brother has promised you
to stay in the Imperial Kitchen,

71
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
don't you think you have nothing else to do?

72
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,800
What's happening over there?

73
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,480
Does it have anything to do with His Majesty?

74
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,920
Who do you think you are?

75
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,160
How dare you show your consideration for my foster brother?

76
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,160
What kind of flower is the hairpin made from?

77
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,600
I haven't seen it in the Sky Kingdom.

78
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,200
It's the sky of Qingqiu

79
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,760
as well as the stars of Qingqiu.

80
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,760
When a nightingale strays into the Milky Way,

81
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,160
who can tell how many years it has been through?

82
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
Sister Zhi He.

83
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,640
Cheng Yu.

84
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,040
Lord Cheng Yu, why are you here

85
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,880
without advance notice?

86
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,640
Excuse me for not welcoming you outside.

87
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,960
What mistake has the fairy maid made

88
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,880
to irritate you so much?

89
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,120
Even in the Sky Kingdom,

90
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
hurting a fairy maid on purpose matters much,

91
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,280
not to mention in the Tai Chen Palace.

92
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,440
Zhi He,

93
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,400
you'll have to think twice.

94
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,680
Even though you don't care for anything else,

95
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
you'll have to take the fame of His Majesty into account.

96
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,920
Do you intend to make up more gossip

97
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,520
to the rumor of His Majesty's taste for the killing

98
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
to amuse people?

99
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
It's just a misunderstanding.

100
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
A rumor doesn't make sense.

101
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,200
Lord, for the sake of His Majesty,

102
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,440
please make rumors end with the wise.

103
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,040
Since it's a misunderstanding,

104
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,560
please look before you leap later, Zhi He.

105
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
You're right, Lord.

106
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,280
I have something else to deal with.

107
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,640
Excuse me for leaving first.

108
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,720
Lord Cheng Yu,

109
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,160
I, I just saw...

110
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,360
I heard

111
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,160
Demon Lord Yan Chiwu stole
the soul-locking jade of His Majesty.

112
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
His Majesty and Yan Chiwu

113
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,920
is fighting on the Mount Fuyu.

114
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,280
His Majesty is having a fight?

115
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,240
Then how could it happen that

116
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,600
his follower, I am not on site?

117
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,600
You, little fox.

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,440
It's he who always beats the other down
when he is having the fight with someone else.

119
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,560
Is it worth you coming all the way there?

120
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,760
As long as it has something to do with His Majesty,

121
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,680
I will have to go no matter what it takes.

122
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,640
You little fox.

123
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,320
Your Highness.

124
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,200
Si Ming.

125
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
Where are you going in such a hurry?

126
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,680
His Majesty is having a fight with someone.

127
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
I'll go help him.

128
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,440
Do you know where the Mount Fuyu is?

129
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,400
Well,

130
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,720
where's the Mount Fuyu?

131
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,880
I can lend you my fast-running felt

132
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,600
that can both lead the way and carry things.

133
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,640
It can help you find His Majesty.

134
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,680
Your Highness, you have to remember

135
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
you should keep yourself safe

136
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
before worrying about His Majesty's safety.

137
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
Otherwise I might break my promise

138
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,960
to the elders in Qingqiu.

139
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,120
I get it, Si Ming.

140
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't worry.

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,880
I'll bring His Majesty back safely.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Fine.

143
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,480
I guess you won't even able to

144
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
touch His Majesty when you get there.

145
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,960
What you can do is merely clear the battlefield.

146
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,600
What on earth is it?

147
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
Poker Face,

148
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,400
since you have hidden yourself,

149
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,920
I can't do anything to you,

150
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,840
but your engagement with Ji Heng doesn't count.

151
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,840
If you don't promise,

152
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,240
you should appear and fight with me
for another three hundred rounds.

153
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,480
What the hell is it?

154
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,640
Nie Chuyin, if you don't make a clear explanation to me,

155
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
don't expect to live until tomorrow.

156
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,320
Are you the one who comes to help?

157
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Are you an immortal

158
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,920
who's on the side of Dong Hua?

159
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Then I'll tell you that

160
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,160
Dong Hua is locked by Yan Chiwu in the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

161
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
Your cultivation is not strong enough

162
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,280
to save him.

163
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,520
Let's make a deal.

164
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,160
If you lend your fur to me for amusement for three years,

165
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,720
I'll give you half of my cultivation.

166
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
Then you can step in and save Dong Hua.

167
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,400
What do you think?

168
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,560
Give me half of your cultivation?

169
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,760
Is there such a virtuous man on earth?

170
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,160
Wait a second.

171
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,280
Why is there only one tail of mine left?

172
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,040
Opps!

173
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,640
How could I miss such important information?

174
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,400
Forget it! Forget it! Forget it!

175
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,040
I'll only look less beautiful

176
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,960
without my fur,

177
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,560
and I can't transfer either,

178
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,400
which is less important than saving His Majesty.

179
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,280
I haven't imagined that the magic power of
the Demon Lord is so strong.

180
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,600
I've no idea whether His Majesty has seen my

181
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
splendid magic.

182
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,160
Nie Chuyin makes me here

183
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,320
stop Demon Lord Yan from hurting His Majesty,

184
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,200
but where are they?

185
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,080
Meng Hao.

186
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
Your Majesty.

187
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
Why are you here?

188
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,480
I heard Yan Chiwu intended to hurt Your Majesty,

189
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,320
so I come here exclusively.

190
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,520
I haven't expected to fall in the Land.

191
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,800
Here is the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

192
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,520
which is transferred from the soul-locking jade.

193
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
You shouldn't have come here.

194
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,560
What's happening originates from me,

195
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,160
and it's me who put Your Majesty in danger.

196
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,120
It's not your fault.

197
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,040
I happen to take the opportunity to remove the evils in the Land.

198
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,480
How come there's a little fox here?

199
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,560
How could it fall into the Ten-evil Lotus Land?

200
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,680
Its paw is hurt.

201
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,680
Your Majesty,

202
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,760
are you OK?

203
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you going to be faint with hunger?

204
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,760
What about grabbing a bite

205
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,720
of my paw first?

206
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,120
See, I've roasted it

207
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
that is scorched outside but tender inside.

208
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,680
I don't know how it tastes.

209
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,880
I guess it must be delicious.

210
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,360
I mean,

211
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,080
shall we add some salt first?

212
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
You wake up?

213
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,560
Your Majesty.

214
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
Are you really Your Majesty?

215
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
Am I dreaming?

216
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

217
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,400
Allow me.

218
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

219
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,800
I do see you.

220
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,600
Have you seen me

221
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
save you with splendid magic just now?

222
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,240
It's really you, Your Majesty.

223
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,640
I'm not dreaming.

224
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,840
Your Majesty is binding up my wound.

225
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,080
What a blissful moment!

226
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,280
Your Majesty,

227
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,960
I once saw you glaze

228
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,720
the wine set out and away in the courtyard.

229
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,240
You were indifferent and solemn like now.

230
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,480
You look great.

231
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,280
Your Majesty,

232
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,880
how could, could it walk

233
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,680
since you bandaged it like this?

234
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,280
Try to spit a fireball.

235
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,400
Bandage harder,

236
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,120
or it will be easily fired to ashes.

237
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,800
As far as I'm concerned,

238
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,760
the little fox was forced to

239
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,280
join the battle.

240
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,880
It can't be willing to spit fireballs

241
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,480
to fire itself in normal times.

242
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Your Majesty, you worry too much.

243
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,240
See,

244
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
how smart it is!

245
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
It won't be stupid to such an extent.

246
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
It's hard to say.

247
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,600
His Majesty used to be fond of the smart.

248
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,640
The rides he used before were all smart
and the successor was even better than the predecessor.

249
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,760
What should I do?

250
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,960
It seems I do have to spit a fireball

251
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,080
that won't do any harm to myself,

252
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,400
which may be able to eliminate his misunderstanding of me.

253
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,520
How stupid you are!

254
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,600
I don't want to face the brutal truth.

255
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,120
How stupid I am!

256
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,480
How come I lose the trace of Jiu,

257
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
who is such a living creature?

258
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,400
We have searched everywhere,

259
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,040
but there's no trace of her.

260
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,040
Has she sneaked out?

261
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Keeping searching.

262
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,120
Every single corner should be thoroughly searched.

263
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,280
Yes.

264
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,760
Your Highness,

265
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
isn't it good that Jiu has disappeared herself

266
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,560
to stop being an eyesore in the Tai Chen Palace?

267
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,600
Ridiculous!

268
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,040
It's I who will decide whether she stays or leaves.

269
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,320
If a fairy maid in the Tai Chen Palace

270
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
can decide whether she stays or leaves on her own,

271
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
what kind of the system here will be?

272
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,760
Your Highness, Immortal Official Chong Lin is coming.

273
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,200
Let him in.

274
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,200
Yes.

275
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,120
What's happening outside?

276
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,600
Those immortal officials
who are supposed to look after the soul-locking jade

277
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,880
are discussing about how to confess themselves to His Majesty.

278
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
It won't be hard for His Majesty to

279
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
take back the soul-locking jade, will it?

280
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Your Highness, there's something you don't know.

281
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,120
If those evil monsters blocked by the soul-locking jade

282
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
are released incautiously,

283
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,840
there will be a catastrophe.

284
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,200
What kind of catastrophe?

285
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,760
Once the evil monsters blocked by the soul-locking jade

286
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
scatter to Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

287
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,760
which might have impact on the Miaoyi Chasm

288
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
where Miao Luo was sealed.

289
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,560
It won't matter that His Majesty

290
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,920
eats nothing for even half or a year.

291
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,600
But I have just been through a harsh battle,

292
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
and there's been nothing in my stomach for one day.

293
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,640
My chest is coming closer to my back.

294
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm so hungry.

295
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,000
Ji Heng is going outside
to find something to eat exclusively for me.

296
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,040
How kind she is!

297
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,560
Little fox,

298
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,080
there're only sweet potatoes can be eaten here in the Land.

299
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,040
Otherwise,

300
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,160
you can spit a fireball

301
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,160
to roast a sweet potato for yourself, can't you?

302
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,680
It's so astute of the demon

303
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
to take away my fur

304
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,160
which is the one of a nine-tailed fox.

305
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,640
And he left me

306
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,520
with the ordinary fox fur.

307
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,560
Not to mention the magic power he gave me,

308
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,360
which couldn't last a half day long.

309
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,840
Now I won't be able to transfer. Without magic power,

310
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
I can't even talk.

311
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,000
It's truly impossible for me

312
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,920
to protect His Majesty.

313
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,080
Little fox,

314
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,480
what I cultivate is the water magic,

315
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,960
and I can't magic the fire for you

316
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,080
to roast the sweet potato.

317
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,400
Could

318
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,240
you put up with having it raw?

319
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,480
I'm a picky-eater,

320
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,720
and I don't want to eat a raw sweet potato.

321
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,400
It's been the best meal of sweet potatoes

322
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,920
that I've eaten since almost the last thirty thousand years.

323
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
I must head off a danger,

324
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,320
If I have you by my side.

325
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,000
Are you cold?

326
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,560
It's better to be a fox.

327
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,760
What a shame!

328
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,200
It seems that the trick I used to my mother

329
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,720
when I wasn't weaned

330
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,600
still works on His Majesty.

331
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,760
If His Majesty doesn't bring me back to Heaven

332
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,840
when we leave here,

333
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,800
then we'll have to say farewell.

334
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
It's not until I have my fur back

335
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,680
that I can return to the Tai Chen Palace,

336
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
by His Majesty's side,

337
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,880
which will be three years later.

338
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,840
Once I heard that

339
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,440
His Majesty would always hold his breath
for a while when he has a break.

340
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
I haven't imagined

341
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,400
that I can take such a big advantage today.

342
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,000
Is it that God is blessing me

343
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,920
or he saw me make such great effort sincerely?

344
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,280
Thank God

345
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,600
for blessing me.

346
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,200
I like it.

347
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,160
The lips of His Majesty look so gorgeous,

348
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
the color of them is light

349
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,280
and they might be cold.

350
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,480
How do they taste when I kiss him.

351
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,760
It's my first kiss.

352
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,960
What?

353
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,200
Yan Chiwu went to pick a fight with Emperor Dong Hua?

354
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,040
Yes.

355
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,120
How mischievous he is!

356
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,240
If Yan Chiwu ruins the marriage

357
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,080
between the gods and the demons,

358
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,440
I won't let him go that easily.

359
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
Your Highness, there's one more thing.

360
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:31,880
Spill it.

361
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Princess Ji Heng has already known the story,

362
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,520
and she goes to mediate on her own.

363
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,640
On her own?

364
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,440
Yes.

365
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,160
Where is Min Su?

366
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,080
He hasn't followed the princess.

367
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,720
It's Min Su's fault to make the princess at risk.

368
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,840
Then teach him a lesson.

369
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Please show the instructions, Your Highness.

370
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,360
There are so many fierce beasts in the Baishui Mountain.

371
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,800
If Min Su, as the personal bodyguard of the princess,

372
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
isn't able to handle these beasts,

373
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
how come he is qualified
for the personal bodyguard of the princess?

374
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,040
Then send him to the Baishui Mountain to ponder upon his faults.

375
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:17,880
Yes.

376
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,560
What are you going to do?

377
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,320
We're ordered to capture Min Su.

378
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,920
The princess would punish me,

379
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
if I make some mistakes.

380
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
How come you do this to me?

381
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,400
Here is the token.

382
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,400
Min Su, it's the order of the Demon Lord

383
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,280
to take you to the Baishui Mountain
to ponder upon your faults right now.

384
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,720
Take him away.

385
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,560
Move.

386
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,360
Hurry up.

387
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:02,960
Move.

388
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,360
I've never stepped out of the palace since I was a child.

389
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,600
It's your luck to have the opportunity

390
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,280
to experience yourself in the Baishui Mountain.

391
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,670
And the princess

392
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,280
will have her own path to go.

393
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,190
You won't come back

394
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,960
until she gets married.

395
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,320
What's up?

396
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,230
Your Majesty,

397
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,920
come to check on it.

398
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,190
There's something wrong with the fox.

399
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,600
What's wrong?

400
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,040
Is it hurt by

401
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,960
the foul atmosphere in the Lotus Land,

402
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,680
or by the wound she had days ago?

403
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,280
Are there some symptoms of wicked energy into the body?

404
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,280
None.

405
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
It's pregnant.

406
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,520
Haven't the clan leader of Spiritual Fox told you the story?

407
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,160
Your clan is always strictly disciplined.

408
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,760
The reason why you're not allowed
to be hooked on human beings casually is

409
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,360
that you'll be prone to pregnancy,

410
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,280
once you have a casual fling with someone.

411
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,800
How...

412
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
come I haven't heard

413
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,520
about what you're saying?

414
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,640
Do you belong to the Spiritual Fox Clan?

415
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,360
No, I don't.

416
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
If you don't belong to the clan,

417
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,160
it's certain that they won't tell you the truth.

418
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
And you won't be able to know it.

419
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,600
Since I'm not one of them either,

420
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,760
how come I inherit their features

421
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,360
just because I have their fur on me?

422
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh my God,

423
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,040
you have expressed too much preference for me.

424
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,720
Although I want to make some progress

425
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,000
on the relationship with His Majesty,

426
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,160
it's too fast.

427
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,040
And

428
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,040
since it's my own baby,

429
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
I should give birth to the baby, shouldn't I?

430
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,160
But how...

431
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,120
how on earth can I give birth to the baby?

432
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,320
I've heard that

433
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,040
there're some instructions
that should be observed when nourishing a fetus.

434
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,160
Who should I consult about this kind of advice?

435
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Follow me.

436
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,560
His Majesty is about to recover

437
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,800
to his prime.

438
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
We are about to get out soon.

439
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
So soon?

440
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,400
What should I do then?

441
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,400
Will His Majesty treat me

442
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,000
as an unknown fox?

443
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
His Majesty always prefers a quiet environment.

444
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,400
He won't be willing to take me back to
the Tai Chen Palace when we get out of the Land.

445
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,480
Besides,

446
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,680
Ji Heng likes me so much,

447
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,920
what if he would send me to Ji Heng?

448
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,320
Your Majesty,

449
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,720
Yan Chiwu is born mischievous.

450
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
He didn't intend to make the mistake.

451
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,600
I hope Your Majesty could forgive him.

452
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,960
He stole the soul-locking jade

453
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,800
and opened the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

454
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,080
which put you in danger.

455
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,560
It's lucky that things don't go wrong.

456
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,400
Otherwise,

457
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
I must take a share of the blame.

458
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,960
Your merits have offset your demerits
since you have the heart of repentance.

459
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,680
Thanks, Your Majesty.

460
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,040
Your Majesty, I have one thing to ask you for.

461
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,200
Spill it.

462
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm fond of the little fox so much.

463
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,040
As far as I'm concerned,

464
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,200
there are so many strict rules in the Sky Kingdom.

465
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,680
It won't get used to the life there,

466
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,200
if it goes to the Sky Kingdom.

467
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
What about allowing me

468
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,320
to take it to the place of the demons.

469
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,000
Please don't, Your Majesty.

470
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,560
It will get used to it.

471
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,600
It's just an unmatured fox,

472
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,840
what else does it know?

473
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
It won't be able to get used to

474
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,920
the heavily foul atmosphere of the demons.

475
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,880
Your Majesty, you get me wrong.

476
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,000
Our nine-tailed fox clan always shows

477
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,760
the appearance of a human,

478
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,280
so when we transfer to the appearance of a fox,

479
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,840
we might be a little heavy-headed sometimes.

480
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,160
But I'm mature,

481
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,920
and I've already been thirty thousand years old.

482
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,440
Your Majesty,

483
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
you're the prestigious god

484
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,120
in Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

485
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,320
It'll be so narrow-minded of you to strive for

486
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,520
a little fox with me, won't it?

487
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,080
How come you allow me to raise it for one month?

488
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,240
Half a month?

489
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,120
Ten days?

490
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Won't ten days be OK?

491
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,360
Won't ten days be OK?

492
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,800
When I got out,

493
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
I was merely a fairy maid in the Tai Chen Palace.

494
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,720
And when I come back,

495
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,560
I've already been a little fox lying in the arms of His Majesty.

496
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,080
It's so blissful of me!

497
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,680
Your Majesty,

498
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,000
there you are.

499
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,240
The soul-locking jade...

500
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,920
Broken.

501
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,520
These evil monsters?

502
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,720
Your Majesty, officials who are supposed
to look after the soul-locking jade

503
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,120
are kneeling outside the Tai Chen Palace,

504
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,360
waiting for Your Majesty to punish them for getting the jade lost.

505
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,120
Let them go back to ponder upon their faults.

506
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,800
Chong Lin,

507
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,920
you're the most careful person in the whole Tai Chen Palace.

508
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,640
I have to go out for a while.

509
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,840
Take care of the little fox for the time being.

510
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,880
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

511
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,760
I'll take good care of it.

512
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,880
Fondling my head

513
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,800
means he thinks I'm cute.

514
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,840
The little fox is lively.

515
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Do take care of it and don't let it run wild

516
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
to aggravate the wound on its paw.

517
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,560
Yes.

518
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,600
What l like to do most is make one cry.

519
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,520
How come you cry louder?

520
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,840
Do exactly as Chong Lin instructs.

521
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,920
I'll get you back from him

522
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,000
as soon as I finish my business.

523
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,280
Your Highness is coming back.

524
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,360
You must have been through a lot this time.

525
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,960
It's more scared than hurt.

526
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,120
Luckily, it doesn't turn into a catastrophe.

527
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
If it were because of me that the fight
between the two clans was triggered,

528
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,080
it would be my biggest sin.

529
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,280
Well,

530
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,480
where's Min Su?

531
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,680
What's up? Say something.

532
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:30,720
Your Highness,

533
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,160
right before you came back,

534
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,680
the Demon Lord had sent someone to capture Guard Min.

535
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,720
What are you talking about?

536
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,040
Why?

537
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,400
When I arrived here,

538
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,320
Guard Min had already been taken away.

539
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,040
Where had he been taken?

540
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,640
Baishui Mountain.

541
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,000
Baishui Mountain.

542
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,240
Let's go.

543
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,160
Pray for yourself.
