00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 50

3
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,900
You're awake?

4
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,780
Who are you?

5
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,300
You don't remember me?

6
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,660
Do you know who you are?

7
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,140
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

8
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,220
So,

9
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,300
you just forget about me.

10
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,780
Take a good look at me. Who am I?

11
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,460
Are you a little fox from Qingqiu?

12
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,260
Are you my classmate?

13
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,420
Or,

14
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,980
did you have a blind date with me?

15
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,220
It seems that

16
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,660
you've really lost your memories.

17
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,580
What a pity!

18
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,740
For what?

19
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,460
I originally planned to go to Qingqiu

20
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,940
with you to meet your family

21
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,420
and discuss how to hold our delayed wedding banquet

22
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,380
to make you my Empress.

23
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,340
Now that you've lost your memories,

24
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,340
it has to be postponed indefinitely.

25
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,500
What?

26
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,980
What?

27
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,180
Will you marry me?

28
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,900
I didn't expect that

29
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,980
you had forgotten it all.

30
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:37,980
Wait!

31
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,340
Where are you going?

32
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,660
I'm going to find Lian Song

33
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,740
and ask him to send you back to Qingqiu.

34
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,500
Then, won't you marry me?

35
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,380
Now that you don't remember me,

36
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,460
I have to let it go.

37
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,700
Actually...

38
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,140
Actually, I kind of recall something.

39
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,860
In the Dream of Aranya,

40
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,540
we were a couple, right?

41
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,780
I was Aranya, and you were Xi Ze.

42
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,140
What happened in the Dream of Aranya doesn't count.

43
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,020
Since you can't remember me,

44
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,060
don't force yourself.

45
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,620
I kind of recall it.

46
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,340
What do you recall?

47
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,300
You seem to be Emperor Dong Hua.

48
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,220
Seem?

49
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,620
You are Emperor Dong Hua!

50
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,620
I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

51
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,740
I'm your girl, Xiaobai.

52
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,740
Ouch!

53
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,700
I dare not trick you next time.

54
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,180
Next time?

55
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,700
No. Never.

56
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,700
What you just said,

57
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,980
does it still count?

58
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,580
What did I say?

59
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,180
You said you would marry me.

60
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,220
Take a bath in hot spring first to recover from fatigue.

61
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,780
We're leaving the valley.

62
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,460
I'll have Chong Lin get everything ready.

63
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,580
After we get out,

64
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,900
I'll marry you.

65
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,580
OK.

66
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Aren't you coming?

67
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,540
We haven't got married yet.

68
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,500
I didn't mean that.

69
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,580
The royal family of the inseparable king birds

70
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,180
and the royal family of the night owls

71
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,460
would like to guard the valley.

72
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,660
Your Majesty, please approve.

73
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,020
Do you know

74
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,060
what will happen to you

75
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,780
if the Miaoyi Chasm is broken?

76
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,340
Your Majesty,

77
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,220
having sealed Miao Luo for tens of thousands of years,

78
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,100
the Miaoyi Chasm has been filled with her dark energy.

79
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,140
If Miao Luo breaks out of the seal this time,

80
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,820
the entire Fanyin Valley

81
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,100
will be filled with dark energy.

82
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,340
By then, all the living things
will surely be plunged into an abyss of misery.

83
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,460
Wherever the dark energy reaches,

84
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,020
it will become barren

85
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,500
and lifeless.

86
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,940
Are you all clear?

87
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,980
Your Majesty, please approve.

88
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,940
We're willing to perish with the Fanyin Valley.

89
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,580
Your Majesty,

90
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,540
though we're not so competent as gods from the Sky Kingdom,

91
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
we're honored as royals by our clans

92
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,420
and have enjoyed high positions and great wealth.

93
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,540
If we don't stay now, we'll be too ashamed

94
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,420
to see our people in future.

95
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,220
Exactly!

96
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,500
Though the gods from the Sky Kingdom have great magic power,

97
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,980
their magic power will be removed after entering the valley.

98
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,220
Also, the magic tricks they learned
are not as pure as those learned in the valley.

99
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,340
In the Fanyin Valley,

100
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,860
it's nice to have some help.

101
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,660
I've arranged for the clansmen

102
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,340
to evacuate from the valley.

103
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,620
The gods from the Sky Kingdom are also ready for assistance.

104
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,940
We're willing to guard the valley.

105
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,580
Your Majesty, please approve!

106
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,380
Your Majesty, please approve!

107
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,980
Then please join me

108
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,020
in guarding the Miaoyi Chasm.

109
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
Thank you, Your Majesty!

110
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,620
This is the Lianxin Mirror
specifically used for purifying the dark energy.

111
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,500
It can help you confine Miao Luo.

112
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
Thank you, Your Majesty!

113
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,860
Elder brother!

114
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,860
Jielu,

115
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,460
why are you here?

116
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,260
Why do you all stay

117
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,860
but me?

118
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,700
I also want to stay and guard the valley with you.

119
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,140
I'm also a royal.

120
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,540
You're still a kid!

121
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,420
I go to school with you now.

122
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,500
You can all stay.

123
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,820
Why can't I?

124
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,740
Jielu,

125
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,420
if we all stay here,

126
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,300
who can our people rely on?

127
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,460
For this trip to the Sky Kingdom,

128
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,100
they need someone to make decisions

129
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,100
and lead them.

130
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,860
Do you want our people to seek living

131
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,380
in the Sky Kingdom on their own?

132
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,420
Can you leave instead?

133
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,540
Elder brother,

134
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,780
you're the future king of the inseparable king birds.

135
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,820
You should take our people to the Sky Kingdom,
and I'll stay here instead.

136
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Silly girl,

137
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,140
you're the only daughter of uncle and aunt.

138
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,700
I promised them

139
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
to take good care of you

140
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,380
and keep you safe and sound.

141
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,300
Then,

142
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,900
you'll all be back, right?

143
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,340
Well,

144
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,660
we're preparing for the worst.

145
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,300
But with His Majesty on our side,

146
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,260
we won't end up like that.

147
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,980
But I can't!

148
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,260
Elder brother,

149
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,220
I can't do it on my own!

150
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,500
You like Her Highness Fengjiu so much.

151
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,460
Are you willing to never see her again?

152
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,460
I have no one to care about outside the valley.

153
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,500
I grew up here as a child.

154
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,060
Just let me stay.

155
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,780
I...

156
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,740
I do like Her Highness Fengjiu.

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,820
I'll miss her in my heart.

158
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,340
But I'm also the prince of the inseparable king birds.

159
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,340
It's my inescapable duty to guard the valley.

160
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,860
I won't leave,

161
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,340
and I can't leave.

162
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,780
Jielu,

163
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,820
we decided together that

164
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,060
you should leave with our people.

165
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,660
Mother,

166
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,860
uncle, aunt,

167
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,940
and me.

168
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,380
Why?

169
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,420
Jielu,

170
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,620
though you've never experienced the outside world,

171
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,820
you've always been our hope.

172
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,100
If one day,

173
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,660
we are really at the critical juncture of life and death,

174
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,500
as long as we know

175
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,260
we've still got you to lead our people,

176
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,540
we can feel relieved

177
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,020
and spare no efforts in dealing with the situation.

178
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,500
Elder brother!

179
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,460
Mother asked me to send you a message.

180
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,740
Let the tragedy of the Fanyin Valley

181
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,060
stay in the Fanyin Valley.

182
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,900
She said you would understand it.

183
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,100
But why do you have to stay?

184
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,420
You haven't fulfilled your wish yet!

185
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,660
Mother is old.

186
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,540
They need me.

187
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,140
Moreover,

188
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,500
Jielu,

189
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,780
do you really have no one to care about?

190
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,100
Who are you thinking of right now?

191
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,900
Elder brother,

192
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,540
you're making fun of me.

193
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,180
I still expect you to grow up and get married.

194
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,700
Don't panic.

195
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,780
It's just a temporary separation.

196
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,420
Then

197
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,620
you must all be safe and sound!

198
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,140
I will guard this place well

199
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,340
and wait for you to return.

200
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,660
Magnificent and unhurried,

201
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,500
yet filled with deep emotions.

202
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,420
Terrific!

203
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,220
I was playing randomly.

204
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,340
Sorry for my poor skills.

205
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,540
You helped Xiaobai and me

206
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,020
out of righteousness this time.

207
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,900
I haven't thanked you yet.

208
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,580
I'm so flattered.

209
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,220
Your Majesty, it's the honor of a lifetime

210
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,540
to be able to serve you.

211
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,380
Also, you know that

212
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,140
I have my selfish motive.

213
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,060
That's hardly a selfish motive.

214
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,620
You just want to know the truth.

215
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,740
Right.

216
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,300
For all these years,

217
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,460
I just couldn't get over Aranya's death.

218
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,740
After entering the dream world this time,

219
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,100
I finally

220
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,820
have taken a load off my mind.

221
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,180
Such a result

222
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,060
may not be the one you wanted.

223
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,260
To me,

224
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,100
I certainly don't want to see that

225
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,220
Aranya was deeply in love with Shen Ye.

226
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,700
Nor do I want to believe that
Shen Ye was also deeply in love with Aranya.

227
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,860
But after brooding it over here for days,

228
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
I've gradually realized that

229
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,860
such a result,

230
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,980
the truth,

231
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,660
was actually better than I speculated.

232
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,660
I feel relieved for Aranya.

233
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,940
She didn't love

234
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,100
the wrong guy after all.

235
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,980
It's rare to think like that.

236
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,180
Something strange has happened inside the valley.

237
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,740
His Highness Lian Song didn't tell me the details,

238
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,700
but I can guess a thing or two.

239
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,100
Your Majesty,

240
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,140
anything you ask,

241
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,460
the people of West Sea will surely help you.

242
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,260
It's too early to ask for help.

243
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I know how to deal with it.

244
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,740
Jiuge,

245
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,740
this is a letter from Yan to you.

246
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,860
Yan?

247
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,540
When did he become so genteel?

248
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,460
See you.

249
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,580
Xiaojiu, I'm so glad that you're back!

250
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,180
Can you drink wine or eat meat now?

251
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,460
If you can,

252
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,580
meet us in private in the Zuilixian Restaurant right away.

253
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,980
Meng wants to give you a farewell dinner in private.

254
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,220
Since you fell into the Dream of Aranya,

255
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,340
the inseparable king birds

256
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,420
have known that we lied about who we were.

257
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,780
But due to the ice face and Lian Song,

258
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,220
they dared not inquire about our true identities.

259
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,100
Meng asked me in private several times.

260
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,060
Given that he's a friend,

261
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,300
I told him who I was honestly.

262
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,940
Though I said nothing about your identity,

263
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,580
he mistakenly thought that you were also a demon.

264
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,140
Yan was quite smart this time.

265
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,140
He actually remembered to hide my identity.

266
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,940
Actually,

267
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,820
whom Meng loves is the legendary Fengjiu.

268
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
It's not you.

269
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,820
We're friends.

270
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,980
Even if he knows who you are,

271
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,780
he stands no chance against the ice face.

272
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,220
Whether to keep hiding your identity

273
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,980
or to tell him who you are,

274
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,340
it's up to you.

275
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,220
It seems that back with four seasons,

276
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,260
the Fanyin Valley is picturesque.

277
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,260
It's really a reclusive land of peace and happiness.

278
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,620
The Fanyin Valley was originally built outside the mortal realm.

279
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,700
Back then, I chose this place

280
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,900
to suppress the Miaoyi Chasm

281
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,580
and neutralize the dark energy in the world.

282
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,940
It costs more than half of your cultivation

283
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,700
to suppress the Miaoyi Chasm once.

284
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,180
To completely purify it,

285
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,740
I'm afraid you'll have to use all of your cultivation

286
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,780
and end up falling into a deep slumber
for tens of thousands of years.

287
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,100
Moreover, Miao Luo also needs to be handled.

288
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,100
Now we can only stabilize the Miaoyi Chasm

289
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,420
to confine Miao Luo.

290
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,620
After figuring out the way
to get rid of Miao Luo once and for all,

291
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,420
we can make further plans.

292
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,740
Though you're the most powerful
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

293
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,340
there're still several powerful gods

294
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,340
in the Sky Kingdom.

295
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,140
You shouldn't be the only one to carry the burden.

296
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,380
Moreover, now that heaven and earth have settled

297
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,060
and the conflicts within the demons

298
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,620
have been eased due to the whole thing concerning Miao Luo,

299
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,540
you should go back to rest and recuperate in Tai Chen Palace.

300
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,860
A wedding will be held in Tai Chen Palace.

301
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,660
You're going to have an Empress?

302
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,900
I promised to marry her after getting out of the valley.

303
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,060
You're actually the last to taste love,

304
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,940
but you're going to get married before me.

305
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,620
Well,

306
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,780
now that your marriage is settled,

307
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,340
you can set your mind at rest.

308
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,540
Well,

309
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,340
as to the pimpon fruit you gave me,

310
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,980
I've given it to Lord Xie.

311
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,580
Feel relieved.

312
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,500
Yan,

313
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,020
why did you waste magic power

314
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,060
to come to the Fanyin Valley?

315
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,820
I thought you wouldn't come back after leaving in a hurry.

316
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,140
I'm here to pick up Ji Heng.

317
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,260
The musician.

318
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,820
Right,

319
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,940
you've liked her all the time.

320
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,220
His Majesty really loves Xiaojiu?

321
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,980
Dignified and majestic as His Majesty is,

322
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,100
he actually ordered to hide the truth

323
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,340
from her for her sake.

324
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,900
Unbelievable!

325
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,620
He's just too naïve!

326
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,140
You can both be with your lovers.

327
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,620
Lucky you!

328
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,420
I wonder whether I can see Her Highness Fengjiu again

329
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,340
the rest of my life.

330
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,540
Her Highness Fengjiu doesn't even know I like her.

331
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,140
Meng,

332
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,540
in your mind,

333
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,580
what is Fengjiu like?

334
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,140
A first-class noble lady as she is,

335
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
she must be pure and kind.

336
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,140
She likes animals

337
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,580
and never touches mundane things such as wine and meat.

338
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,220
Moreover...

339
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,620
Who is he talking about?

340
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,580
So strange!

341
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,300
Another dancing girl?

342
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,420
I think...

343
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,020
He's talking about Her Highness Fengjiu
from Qingqiu in his imagination.

344
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,780
...she likes animals and insects.

345
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,380
She won't even

346
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,460
kill a fly.

347
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,580
Meng,

348
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,220
has it ever occurred to you that

349
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,780
if Fengjiu is not the person you've imagined her to be,

350
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,660
will you still like her?

351
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,340
What do you mean?

352
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,700
If Fengjiu is the same as her,

353
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,620
will you still like her?

354
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,060
How is that possible?

355
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,060
If Her Highness Fengjiu is the same as her,

356
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,060
I might as well knock into a piece of bean curd and kill myself.

357
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,620
I am Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

358
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,980
I gave you the Ever-victorious General as a gift.

359
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,740
I also gave you the colored glaze jar.

360
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,060
When I saved you,

361
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,940
I didn't tell you who I was.

362
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,980
And I've kept it from you for so long.

363
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,700
Meng, I'm really sorry.

364
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,260
You're really Her Highness Fengjiu?

365
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,500
Yes, I am.

366
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,380
Her Highness Fengjiu who doesn't touch wine or meat

367
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,300
and who loves insects and animals?

368
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,540
Meng,

369
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,620
you might have misunderstood me.

370
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,620
Actually,

371
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,140
I...

372
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,460
What did you just drink?

373
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,540
Wine.

374
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,500
What did you eat?

375
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,700
Rabbit meat.

376
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,580
What's nailed on that bamboo chopstick?

377
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,980
A fly.

378
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:33,820
Meng!

379
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,500
Meng!

380
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,340
Meng!

381
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,860
Second Prince!

382
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,860
Second Prince!

383
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,340
What's wrong with him?

384
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,140
Well,

385
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
the dream he's had for several decades was just shattered.

386
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,420
He passed out because he couldn't bear it.

387
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,900
Second Prince!

388
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,060
Women!

389
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,220
I'll never believe women!

390
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,340
The woman I worship the most turns out to be no difference.

391
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,780
Which woman can I count on around the world?

392
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,140
What happened to him?

393
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,260
Given the way he behaves,

394
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,100
will he do anything silly?

395
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,740
I didn't expect to drive him mad.

396
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,060
Shall I follow him?

397
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,860
What if he takes it too hard?

398
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,180
Just leave him alone.

399
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,900
If you comfort him,

400
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,260
I'm afraid he won't just have a broken heart.

401
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,500
It's good for him to cry.

402
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,460
He might come round after crying.

403
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,420
In my opinion,

404
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
you shouldn't follow him.

405
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,580
For his safety,

406
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
we'd better go and check him out.

407
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,860
When did they become so close?

408
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Only they think the meat here is delicious.

409
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,780
It's tasteless actually.

410
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,860
I'll cook something delicious for you when we're back.

411
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,140
OK.

412
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,020
Actually, the refreshing soup is my signature dish.

413
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,940
When we're back in Tai Chen Palace,

414
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,300
I'll make it for you to build up your health.

415
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,580
Good.

416
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,380
We're about to leave here.

417
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,780
I actually feel a bit sad.

418
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,140
Before we go,

419
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
I'll take you somewhere else.

420
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,660
I didn't expect that you gods

421
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,940
would care about people living under the Sky Kingdom.

422
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,620
Xiangli Meng is affectionate and loyal to friends.

423
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,860
You've tricked him for so long.

424
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,060
He waited outside the Dream of Aranya on his own,

425
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,620
ready to sacrifice his life

426
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,460
to save His Majesty and Fengjiu at any time.

427
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,060
Nor did he blame you for not telling him you're a demon,

428
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,340
and he still remains to be your friend.

429
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,780
Xiaojiu is to blame for breaking his heart.

430
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,460
Meng

431
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,180
is pure and honest.

432
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,740
I'm afraid he may seem fine,

433
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,220
but he would actually hide somewhere to cry secretly.

434
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,300
Meng!

435
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,780
Silly you. Are you too sad?

436
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,740
There's sand

437
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,260
in my eyes.

438
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,900
I fell accidentally.

439
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,100
Are you really sad?

440
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,220
Do you really like Xiaojiu?

441
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,940
She takes you as a sincere friend.

442
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,140
Her friendship for you is real.

443
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,300
But the woman you love

444
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,500
is a completely different person imagined by you

445
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,460
who meets all your requirements,

446
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,700
but that woman is not her.

447
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,180
Exactly.

448
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,620
After all these troublesome matters are handled,

449
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,940
I'll take you outside the valley

450
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,820
to have a good trip around the Four Seas and Eight Deserts

451
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,340
and the mortal realm.

452
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,700
Then you can find a real girl to love.

453
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,300
OK?

454
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,220
Actually, I'm not sad.

455
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,140
I just...

456
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,660
I just feel embarrassed

457
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,460
after calming down.

458
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,860
Embarrassed?

459
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,740
You mean you passed out after she told you the truth?

460
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,020
I was always wondering

461
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,780
if I met Her Highness Fengjiu,

462
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,660
what I should tell her first,

463
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,740
and how I should express my love to her.

464
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,140
I was so embarrassed just now.

465
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,780
A long-time friend suddenly became

466
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,820
the woman I loved for so long.

467
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,060
Also, I told her

468
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,900
I loved her many times shamelessly,

469
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,660
but I couldn't even recognize her.

470
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,020
How embarrassed I was!

471
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,300
I even made you worry.

472
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,700
I'm so sorry.

473
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,780
Then just tell her you love her.

474
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,660
Since you feel regretful in your heart,

475
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,340
you should let her know how much you love her.

476
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,220
Whom she loves is her own business,

477
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,500
but no one in the entire world

478
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,380
can stop you from loving her.

479
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,540
But

480
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,620
she and His Majesty love each other.

481
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,100
Why should I bring contempt upon myself

482
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,740
and add trouble to her.

483
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,220
She and the ice face love each other. That's their own business.

484
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,300
What does it have to do with you?

485
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,860
Cheng Yu calls me shameless all the time.

486
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,300
I should ask her over to see

487
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,860
there's actually someone

488
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,980
more shameless than I am.

489
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,220
Don't interrupt!

490
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,300
Meng,

491
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,580
you're smarter than I am.

492
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,660
You should consider it yourself.

493
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,420
Who sets the rule that in the world,

494
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,780
only mutual love is allowed to exist

495
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,180
while unrequited love is inferior to that?

496
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,780
If you love someone who can't love you back,

497
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
isn't it also love?

498
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,860
You love her openly and sincerely.

499
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
You never force her to respond to your love.

500
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,460
If you want to let her know you love her, just go and tell her.

501
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,260
If you don't, just keep it in your heart the rest of your life.

502
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,780
Anyway, I'm your friend.

503
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,180
Whatever you want to do,

504
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,700
as long as Xiaojiu won't get hurt,

505
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,740
I will always support you.

506
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Does it make any sense?

507
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,180
I...

508
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,820
I want to express my love to Her Highness Fengjiu.

509
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,220
I haven't told Her Highness Fengjiu

510
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,700
I love her in the right way.

511
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,340
Then just go.

512
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,020
Let her know how much you love her.

513
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,140
I support you.

514
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,540
After you tell her, if you need,

515
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,540
I can drink with you.

516
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,940
Let's get drunk!

517
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,540
I'll go with you.

518
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,100
They're over there.

519
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,100
We can only accompany you here.

520
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,420
The rest is up to you.

521
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,100
Yan! Your Highness!

522
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,700
Thank you!

523
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,580
Every time I look at Meng,

524
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,180
I find myself extremely vicious and wicked.

525
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,580
Indeed you are.

526
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,220
But compared to him, we both are.

527
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,860
Where are you taking me?

528
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,820
Your Highness Fengjiu!

529
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,500
Your Highness!

530
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,900
Your Majesty, I want to

531
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,540
talk with Her Highness Fengjiu in private.

532
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,220
Fine.

533
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,260
Your Highness,

534
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,500
I was so rude just now because I was drunk.

535
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,300
Please forgive me.

536
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,780
Meng,

537
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,420
in my heart, you've always been a good friend.

538
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,340
Though I didn't tell you the truth,

539
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,140
you don't have to be so polite.

540
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,380
So are we still good friends?

541
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,340
Of course!

542
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,180
Jiuge is a good friend to you,

543
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,740
and you're also a good friend to Jiuge.

544
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,940
In future, just treat me

545
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,580
as Jiuge.

546
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,580
Because that's the real me.

547
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,740
Actually, I'm very happy that

548
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,620
I can...

549
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,780
I can

550
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,260
let the woman I love know that

551
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,620
I love her.

552
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,140
Your Highness,

553
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,100
I've got

554
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,140
no regrets.

555
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,940
How come you've got no regrets?

556
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,780
Only when the woman you love loves you back

557
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
can you say that you've got no regrets.

558
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,620
In the future, you're bound to meet someone

559
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,660
who truly loves you.

560
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,340
By then, you must spare no efforts.

561
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,860
Just learn from Yan

562
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,820
and make her love you

563
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,780
as deeply as you love her.

564
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,500
Do you understand?

565
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,300
Yes!

566
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,780
Shall we leave and give them some space?

567
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,540
It's an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for fun.

568
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,860
Someone is actually trying to win over Emperor Dong Hua's woman.

569
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,460
How I wish I could watch closer!

570
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,580
Why should I leave?

571
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,700
I knew it! No one from the Sky Kingdom is good.

572
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
You should leave actually.

573
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,780
By watching them,

574
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,540
I can step in if anything unpleasant happens.

575
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,380
Why do you look at me like that?

576
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,860
You just want to watch the drama, right?

577
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,620
You're too straight-forward.

578
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,100
I guessed right, didn't I? Asshole from the Sky Kingdom.

579
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,100
The one you called asshole

580
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,500
actually taught you how to play the game of go

581
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,500
and how to win Princess Ji Heng's heart.

582
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,620
Is this how you treat your master?

583
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,820
What master?

584
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,260
I hate playing the game of go the most.

585
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,500
You're burning the bridge after crossing the river, right?

586
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,140
I...

587
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,020
So fast?

588
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,420
Have you told her?

589
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,220
Yes.

590
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,540
What did Xiaojiu say?

591
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,820
She said we were still good friends,

592
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,820
and she asked me to learn more from you.

593
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,740
Learn from

594
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,900
me?

595
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,180
Learn from your shamelessness for sure!

596
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,140
She also said that

597
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,740
next time I loved someone,

598
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,220
I should make her love me

599
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,260
as deeply as I love her.

600
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,580
Then you should live up to her blessing.

601
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,100
Actually, I knew it from the start.

602
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,140
When I first met Her Highness Fengjiu,

603
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,380
I knew she would never love me.

604
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,700
She was so gorgeous,

605
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,700
special, charming,

606
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,900
and distinguished.

607
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,140
I knew it all.

608
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,220
Even if I were not from the Fanyin Valley,

609
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,340
even if I were from the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

610
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,100
I would still be the most unimpressive one

611
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,900
among tens of thousands of people

612
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,580
pursuing Her Highness Fengjiu.

613
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,860
You both said that

614
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,460
the woman I loved was an imaginary figure,

615
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,820
not the real Fengjiu,

616
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,980
but Yan,

617
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,020
do you know?

618
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,420
I always wanted to leave the Fanyin Valley

619
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,980
not because I felt lonely in the Fanyin Valley

620
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,700
for it was winter all the year round,

621
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,340
but that

622
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,980
I met Her Highness Fengjiu.

623
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,780
I wanted to see her again.

624
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,220
Even if we couldn't talk,

625
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
it's fine.

626
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,180
I started longing for the outside world

627
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,540
after meeting Her Highness Fengjiu.

628
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,620
To get closer to her,

629
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,500
I collected all the information about her,

630
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,540
even the fake one.

631
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,900
As long as the information was about her,

632
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,620
I just couldn't let it go.

633
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,940
I knew the unrequited love wouldn't work,

634
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,780
but I just couldn't give up.

635
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,580
It's not because

636
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm silly,

637
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,540
but that

638
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,700
she's Her Highness Fengjiu.

639
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,420
I had never felt the warmth of spring, summer and autumn,

640
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,260
but Her Highness Fengjiu

641
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,740
made me feel warm

642
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,460
and made me realize the way to get warm.

643
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,300
I'm really happy

644
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,660
to know you

645
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,980
and become good friends with you.

646
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,220
I can talk to you freely and frankly,

647
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,100
but when I saw Her Highness Fengjiu,

648
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,740
I was speechless.

649
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,820
I could only wish her the very best.

650
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,900
Don't turn around.

651
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,740
Don't turn around.

652
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,020
You're sure to meet someone

653
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
who matches you

654
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,980
and loves you deeply.

655
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,500
Now she's found her happiness.

656
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,740
Stop looking at her.

657
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,500
Just walk straight ahead.

658
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,260
Right!

659
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't turn around.

660
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,380
The road is ahead of you.

661
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Just go your way.

662
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,820
What's this?

663
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,140
I've sealed the primordial spirits of Shen Ye and Aranya

664
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,620
into this tree.

665
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,380
As shadows,

666
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,020
they still have primordial spirits?

667
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:07,940
Right.

668
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,660
They should have vanished into the universe

669
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,060
after they died,

670
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,980
but if everything in the world is inferred with common sense,

671
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,740
then many feelings will be wasted.

672
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,220
Now that I've sealed them here,

673
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,380
it's up to the will of Heaven

674
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,820
whether their fates can change millions of years later.

675
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,740
Though they're shadows of us,

676
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,820
their feelings for each other are deep and sincere.

677
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,780
Your Majesty, by choosing such a good place

678
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,700
to settle them down,

679
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,020
you've sort of made up for their regrets when they were alive.

680
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,500
We should go back now.

681
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,580
Why are you smiling?

682
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,660
I suddenly remembered that

683
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,020
when I worked as a fairy maid in Tai Chen Palace,

684
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,580
you never paid attention to me.

685
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Now you've actually asked me to go back with you.

686
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,900
It feels like a dream.

687
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,740
I didn't know it was you.

688
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,060
What if you had known?

689
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,580
If I had known,

690
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,460
we wouldn't have wasted so much time.

691
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,660
Ignorant youngsters,

692
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,780
you actually want to confine me?

693
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,340
Lianxin Mirror?

694
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,820
It's actually the Lianxin Mirror
which can purify the dark energy!

695
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,860
Dong Hua,

696
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,380
you really gave me no chance.

697
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,140
You forced me!

698
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,740
Nie Chuyin,

699
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,180
come to me now!

700
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,620
Your Majesty,

701
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,100
Xu Yang has set the ward with his life.

702
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,260
To enter the Forbidden Land

703
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
and take out the blood tear now,

704
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,500
Xu Yang must die.

705
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,740
But with my current power,

706
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,820
I can't kill Xu Yang and others all at once.

707
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,540
Try everything.

708
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,860
Kill him!

709
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,300
Yes!

710
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,100
Dong Hua has sealed part of my power.

711
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,580
If I want to break out of the ward,

712
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,980
I have to obtain the last blood tear.

713
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,180
Take it to me

714
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,820
as soon as possible.

715
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:55,900
Yes!

716
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,860
What're you doing?

717
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,780
Demon Lord Xu Yang,

718
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,540
I just saw you reinforcing the ward.

719
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,940
I was intended to help you.

720
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,700
Is there anything wrong with the ward?

721
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,220
I feel that something is wrong,

722
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,380
but I can't figure out why.

723
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,180
Let me help you reinforce the ward.

724
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,780
I'll help you, too.

725
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,420
Demon Lord Nie,

726
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,340
please tell the other demon lords that

727
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,540
the ward needs to be reinforced.

728
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,660
Make sure that they come with you.

729
00:39:59,540 --> 00:39:59,980
OK.

730
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,380
Xie Guchou,

731
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,220
haven't you made a body for him

732
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,700
with the pimpon fruit,

733
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,420
why isn't he awake?

734
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,380
I just finished the body three days ago.

735
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,780
Moreover, buried under the imperial palace back then,
he had no bones left

736
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,540
but a tiny bit of primordial spirit sealed in the Nether World.

737
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,020
Unfortunately, after sleeping for a hundred years,

738
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,420
his primordial spirit has fallen into quietus.

739
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,820
If we resurrect him hurriedly,

740
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,060
I'm afraid the dark energy
inside his primordial spirit won't be removed.

741
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,740
So what?

742
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
Even if he's awake,

743
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,340
he'll be muddleheaded

744
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,340
and intellectually reduced to an infant.

745
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,980
What can we do

746
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,540
to make him stay clear and bright?

747
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,660
I do have a way,

748
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,260
but...

749
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,420
Please tell me.

750
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,460
If an immortal

751
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,420
is willing to give him half of his or her cultivation,

752
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,700
maybe he can remain clear and bright when he's resurrected.

753
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,860
Just take my cultivation.

754
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
Don't you want to think it over?

755
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,260
Qingti sacrificed his life to save me.

756
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,300
I just need to give him some cultivation.

757
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,060
No need to think about that.

758
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,020
One more thing.

759
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,460
According to the rules of the Immortal Record Book,

760
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,260
Ye Qingti has become an immortal by a rare chance,

761
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,740
so the person who bestowed him with an immortal body
should go to the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool

762
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,100
to help him wash away his mortal dust

763
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,740
for him to become a real immortal.

764
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,740
OK.

765
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,700
When he wants to start his cultivation,

766
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,940
I'll help him.

767
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,060
Take it easy.

768
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,860
The immortal body was just formed.

769
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,940
Haste does not bring success.

770
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
When the immortal body can take it,

771
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,740
I'll inform you for sure.

772
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,500
OK.
