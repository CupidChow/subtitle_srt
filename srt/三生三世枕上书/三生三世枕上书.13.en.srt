00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 13

3
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,540
Qingti,

4
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,140
I'll give you the task of forging the short knife.

5
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,500
Your Majesty, rest assured.

6
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,660
I've called together the best blacksmiths in our state.

7
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,540
I won't fail Xiaojiu for sure.

8
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,700
After knowing Xiaojiu,

9
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,060
I've been much happier.

10
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,020
Really?

11
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,580
Your Majesty!

12
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,540
Slow down.

13
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,780
- Your Majesty! - What's the hurry?

14
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,740
Captain Bai just sent word that

15
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,820
he has found the woman who had fallen into water.

16
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,420
What?!

17
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,500
If His Majesty fails to go through his misfortunes,

18
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,300
his cultivation won't come back.

19
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,220
When the Demon King breaks the seal,

20
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,820
Eight Deserts and Six Directions

21
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,580
will suffer from a huge misfortune.

22
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,020
The consequences will be terrible.

He's not His Majesty,

nor his rebirth.

27
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,740
He is just Song Xuanren.

And you are still Bai Fengjiu.

29
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,100
This is your fate.

Your Majesty,

45
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,340
to walk around conveniently,

46
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,180
I usually dress as a man.

47
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,500
That day on the Hall,

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,660
everyone was there.

49
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,580
I really couldn't reveal my identity,

50
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,300
so I let them mistake me as a man.

51
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,820
Your Majesty, please forgive me for deceiving you.

52
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,500
Rise.

53
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,180
Then why do you confess today?

54
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,860
I may not find out your identity.

55
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,820
Your Majesty, I don't want you to set foot
in the Cold Palace ever again.

56
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,460
It's a place of loneliness for hundreds of years,

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,820
so hopeless and so cold.

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,140
It doesn't suit you.

59
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,580
You're so considerate.

60
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,460
I ask for nothing.

61
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,340
I only want to stay by your side forever.

62
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,340
The ornament on your forehead

63
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,380
looks like an unfolded phoenix feather.

64
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,540
The ornament on my forehead

65
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,780
is a birthmark I've had since I was born.

66
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,740
Its color is too bright,

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,580
so I use cosmetics to cover it

68
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,660
for fear that it might cause trouble when I'm out alone.

69
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,460
Good!

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,540
Well done!

71
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,140
Such a beauty

72
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,780
should not be seen by strangers easily.

73
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,460
Eunuch!

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,340
Bai Xiaojiu

75
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,860
is bright and cheerful in disposition
and righteous and honest in virtue.

76
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,340
I hereby bestow the title of Imperial Lady upon her

77
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,940
and allow her to live in Yue Hua Palace.

78
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,380
Is it too fast?

79
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,300
How can this be fast?

80
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,660
You don't like it?

81
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,260
I do.

82
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,740
Thank you, Your Majesty!

83
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,620
I'm glad you do.

84
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,420
Your Majesty,

85
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,180
traditionally, to bestow titles upon consorts,

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,660
we have to check family background first.

87
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,860
I'm afraid it's not appropriate

88
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,260
to bestow the title in such a hurry.

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,100
Having saved me twice,

90
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,220
Xiaojiu has rendered great services.

91
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,260
I don't even know what I should grant her.

92
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,780
The title of Imperial Lady

93
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,380
is not enough.

94
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,540
Well...

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,380
Your Majesty, congratulations.

96
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,620
Your Highness, congratulations.

97
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,180
Your Highness, are you OK?

98
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,020
Si Ming,

99
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,660
I won't act capriciously anymore.

100
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,020
When Emperor Dong Hua wakes up

101
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,500
after passing the love test,

102
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
he won't remember anything.

103
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,900
I remember.

104
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,980
Aren't those memories

105
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,500
in Tai Chen Palace not deep enough?

106
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,740
Si Ming,

107
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,460
I won't face the test

108
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,420
with my own obsession any more.

109
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,100
This time, I'm here to complete the love test

110
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,340
on behalf of Zhou Mengxi.

111
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,060
Also, I won't mess with
Emperor Dong Hua's love test anymore.

112
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,740
You'll suffer from backfire.

113
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,620
The longer you stay in the mortal realm,

114
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,620
the harder it will be to heal your wounds.

115
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,980
Do remember,

116
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,940
don't go through extreme emotions

117
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,780
or get too involved in love.

118
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,860
I'll make it quick.

119
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,460
Mother,

120
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,860
good day!

121
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,140
Ren'er, you're here.

122
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,780
Take a seat.

123
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,940
Ren'er,

124
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,460
I heard you've had a new Imperial Lady Jiu.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,700
I'm about to tell you.

126
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,340
She saved my life before.

127
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,460
To thank her for saving you,

128
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,700
you only need to grant her an official position

129
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,380
or reward her with properties.

130
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,300
I'm afraid it's inappropriate to take her
into the imperial harem.

131
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,060
Mother,

132
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,220
it's not likely for her to harbor evil intents towards me.

133
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,500
Otherwise, she wouldn't have saved me back then.

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,660
I just think...

135
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,180
Mother,

136
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
with her by my side,

137
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,820
I feel so happy.

138
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,300
I want to keep her in the imperial palace.

139
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,500
Well,

140
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,700
you are exactly the same as your father.

141
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,340
I said so

142
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,340
for your safety

143
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,820
and the general picture of the State of Chengyu.

144
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,700
If you really want to keep her,

145
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,700
you must observe her for some time

146
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,820
before making the decision.

147
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,380
The title conferring ceremony should be postponed.

148
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,900
Mother, thank you for your approval.

149
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,660
Your Highness!

150
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,460
Your Highness,

151
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,180
among these maids, do you find anyone pleasing?

152
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,340
What's your name?

153
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,460
I'm Muyun.

154
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,180
I'll take her.

155
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:54,940
Yes.

156
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,940
Your Highness,

157
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,260
do you like quilt of this color?

158
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,100
It's good.

159
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,420
Muyun,

160
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,500
the butterfly mark behind your neck

161
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,020
is quite special.

162
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,500
It's a birthmark.

163
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,820
I've had it since I was born.

164
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,820
Strange to say,

165
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,980
every time I wake up after having a dream,

166
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,500
the birthmark feels warm.

167
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,500
Dream?

168
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,500
What dream?

169
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,540
Since childhood,

170
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,620
I've been having the same dream.

171
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,220
In my dream, I'm a butterfly

172
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,100
being punished by my master after doing something wrong.

173
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,540
A woman saves me.

174
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,300
But in my dream,

175
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,700
I can't see her face

176
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,340
no matter how hard I try.

177
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,940
Is Muyun

178
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,620
that Mufeng Butterfly expelled
from heaven to the mortal realm?

179
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,300
We've never met before,

180
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,580
but fate brings us together.

181
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,380
Take this hairpin as my gift for you.

182
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,460
Your Highness,

183
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,140
I haven't rendered any meritorious service yet.

184
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,540
I don't deserve such a precious gift.

185
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
It's for you. Just take it.

186
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,500
Yes.

187
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,540
Your Highness, you're so good to me.

188
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,620
Fetch me a tub of water.

189
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,260
After a day's busy schedule,

190
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,260
I feel uncomfortable all over.

191
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,540
Your Highness, do you want to have dinner before bathing?

192
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,500
No need.

193
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,060
I've just had some snacks.

194
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I can eat later.

195
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,340
Right.

196
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,780
His Majesty is sure to come tonight.

197
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,180
You should have dinner together.

198
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,940
I'm careless.

199
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,340
Your Highness,

200
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,380
I'll go and fetch water for you.

201
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,140
Your Majesty,

202
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,620
are you painting the scene when you met Her Highness Jiu?

203
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,180
I dared not put brush to paper

204
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,500
as if there were layers of fog in front of my eyes.

205
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,780
Now that I've seen Xiaojiu in person,

206
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,540
I suddenly remember clearly.

207
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,460
Your Majesty, tonight...

208
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,620
I'll go to Yue Hua Palace.

209
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,860
Frame it

210
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,660
after the ink is dried,

211
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,380
and keep it in Muning Hall.

212
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,500
Yes.

213
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,420
Fate is so mysterious.

214
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,460
It brings Mufeng Butterfly to me,

215
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,740
but it keeps Emperor Dong Hua from me.

216
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,820
Fengjiu! Fengjiu!

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,060
Don't get confused! Don't waiver!

218
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,980
His Majesty is not Emperor Dong Hua!

219
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,260
Just focus on completing the love test,

220
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,460
and get everything back on track as soon as possible!

221
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,820
Don't think too much!

222
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,140
His Majesty is here!

223
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,140
Your Majesty!

224
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,660
Rise.

225
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,180
Where's Imperial Lady Jiu?

226
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,260
Your Majesty, Her Highness is bathing.

227
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,940
Then I'll wait for her here.

228
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,860
Is she used to living here?

229
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,620
Is she short of anything?

230
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,460
Your Majesty,

231
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,380
Her Highness just moved in today.

232
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,460
I'm too impatient.

233
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,820
Too impatient.

234
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,260
Keep an eye on Yue Hua Palace for me.

235
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,700
If they're short of anything,

236
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,260
just take it directly from Muning Hall.

237
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,780
No need to bother others.

238
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,260
Your Majesty!

239
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,220
Rise!

240
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,260
Leave us alone.

241
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,420
Go! Go! Go!

242
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:41,940
Come here.

243
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,820
You're my Imperial Lady.

244
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,660
We are husband and wife in common people's eyes.

245
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,220
No need to be nervous.

246
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,500
Husband and wife?

247
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,300
It's the first time for me to be someone's wife.

248
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,740
I'm just not used to that.

249
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,140
Mother agreed to keep you in the imperial palace,

250
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,940
but she insisted on postponing
the title conferring ceremony.

251
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,140
Sorry to keep you waiting

252
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,900
all these days.

253
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,220
Filial piety is the most important of all virtues.

254
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,660
Your Majesty, you should certainly

255
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,900
follow Her Majesty's words.

256
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,180
Moreover,

257
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,660
I don't care about status.

258
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
But I do.

259
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,180
I want to bring all your families into the capital,

260
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,060
so as to remove my mother's doubts.

261
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,420
In this way, you can get the title as soon as possible.

262
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,580
What do you think?

263
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,300
Do I have to tell him that my parents
have passed away and I'm all alone?

264
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,300
It doesn't go with my character,

265
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,060
and it is hard to act.

266
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,860
What if I give myself away?

267
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,340
I used to live in the wild,

268
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
and I'm not a registered citizen.

269
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,740
Also, my parents have been traveling around the world.

270
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,900
It's hard to find them in such a short time.

271
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,500
Well,

272
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,980
it's pretty tricky.

273
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,340
But I still want to send people to your home

274
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,500
in case your parents might return home
after finishing their trips.

275
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,460
Your Majesty, thank you for your kindness.

276
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,260
It's just our house is located in a desolated place

277
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
which is hard to find.

278
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,020
Let me draw a map to our house first

279
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,020
and present to you later.

280
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,580
That's terrific!

281
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,260
Xiaojiu,

282
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,860
the more I look at you, the better you look.

283
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,380
Everybody says Imperial Concubine Wan
is a matchless beauty.

284
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,140
But I think, you're more beautiful

285
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,820
than she is.

286
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Your Majesty, I'm so flattered.

287
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm not that beautiful.

288
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,180
Yes, you are.

289
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm not a lecher,

290
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,340
but I fell in love with you

291
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,420
right after I saw you in the water.

292
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,540
I've never

293
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,500
experienced that before.

294
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,500
He's speaking sugared words with Emperor Dong Hua's face.

295
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,060
Who can resist that?

296
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,780
What are you doing?

297
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,500
Your Majesty, you're not a lecher,

298
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,300
but I can't resist a beauty like you.

299
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,300
Please don't look at me this way.

300
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,740
You!

301
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,580
You're the first one

302
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,980
who has ever called me a beauty.

303
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,740
What's wrong?

304
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,540
I must have caught a cold.

305
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm afraid I might infect Your Majesty.

306
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,180
I'll send for the imperial physician
to write you a prescription.

307
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,980
That's not necessary.

308
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,620
I'm just coughing.

309
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,220
I'll be fine after resting for one or two days.

310
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,580
Then you should rest well.

311
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,820
You haven't got your title yet.
It's improper for me to stay here for long.

312
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,940
I'll visit you some other day.

313
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,740
Have a rest.

314
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,300
No need to see me out.

315
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,260
Your Majesty, see you!

316
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,900
Your Majesty,

317
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,220
Wan Yun Palace is not far ahead.

318
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,140
Would you like to see Her Highness Wan?

319
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,660
No need.

320
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,260
Just take good care of

321
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,740
Imperial Concubine Wan in terms of food and clothing.

322
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,740
Go back to Muning Hall.

324
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,860
= Yue Hua Palace =

325
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,180
Your Highness,

326
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,700
I heard that His Majesty has
just appointed an Imperial Lady Jiu.

327
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
There's no official title conferring ceremony yet

328
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,060
because the Empress Dowager held it off.

329
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,700
His Majesty didn't visit you last night, but he...

330
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,940
You've got nothing useful last night,

331
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
but these useless information.

332
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,140
There are so many beauties in the imperial harem.

333
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,820
Whoever His Majesty loves has nothing to do with us.

334
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,860
Let's focus on our business.

335
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,340
Your Highness, so this is what you've been talking about?

336
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,140
If others know about it,

337
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
they will surely laugh at you.

338
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,340
But I just love to eat it.

339
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,420
It smells good!

340
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,860
Very good!

341
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,860
Your Majesty!

342
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,260
I've smelt the fragrance for some time.

343
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,300
I came from a rural place,

344
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,540
so I love to eat coarse food grain.

345
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,900
Your Majesty, I'm sorry for being foolish.

346
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,540
Why is that foolish?

347
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,260
I wonder whether I'm lucky enough

348
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,900
to taste the sweet potato roasted by Xiaojiu in person.

349
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,660
Your Majesty, you also like to eat the roasted sweet potato?

350
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,660
Of course!

351
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,380
Sure!

352
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,780
Delicious!

353
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,700
As long as you like it.

354
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,900
Fragrant, sweet and soft, it's terrific!

355
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,340
Come here.

356
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:33,820
Take a seat.

357
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,580
All the women in my imperial harem

358
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,180
love to eat delicacies of every kind.

359
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,660
Leave us.

360
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,020
You're the first one

361
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,060
who loves to eat the roasted sweet potato.

362
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,260
I once ate a roasted sweet potato

363
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,740
someone specially made for me.

364
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,380
Since then, I've loved the flavor.

365
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,060
That's the most delicious sweet potato

366
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,340
I've ever had in my life.

367
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,380
Really?

368
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,580
He's really something.

369
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,180
He made you think about him all the time

370
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,300
simply by roasting sweet potatoes.

371
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,500
In fact, memories in our mind can be deceptive.

372
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,340
After a long time,

373
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
even if I rack my brains,

374
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,500
I can only find a few

375
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,100
shared memories with him.

376
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,820
To me, I treasure

377
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,780
those memories so much

378
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,300
that I've even formed ideas that I shouldn't have,

379
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,420
which turn into obsession.

380
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,460
However,

381
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
things will be different if I can

382
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
relive those good memories by eating.

383
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Such a feeling

384
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,340
will become an instinct.

385
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,020
Just like tasting mom's cooking

386
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,740
for the first time in early childhood,

387
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,980
I still find it familiar after recalling it many years later.

388
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,460
Just like the sweet potato he roasted for me,

389
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,300
however chaotic and disturbing the world is,

390
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,100
as long as I think of that flavor,

391
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,060
I feel relieved and happy.

392
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,540
I do want to meet him.

393
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,740
You can't.

394
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,820
He's so far away.

395
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,740
Yet he's so close.

396
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,060
Your Majesty, it's you, but you just don't remember.

397
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Recently, rumor is spreading in the imperial palace that

398
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,940
the Imperial Lady Jiu just appointed by His Majesty

399
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,420
can draw weapon sketch.

400
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,540
Really?

401
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Indeed!

402
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,060
Look, these are the weapon books

403
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,300
His Majesty ordered me to send to Imperial Lady Jiu

404
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,500
in Yue Hua Palace.

405
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,260
Coming from the countryside,

406
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,860
she must have learned some skills

407
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,500
to tempt His Majesty.

408
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
Not only is she of low birth,

409
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
but rumor has it that to seduce His Majesty,

410
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,740
she even get herself wet
and bump into His Majesty on purpose.

411
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

412
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,380
Xiaojiu is adept with both the pen and the sword.

413
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,500
She stepped forward bravely
and saved His Majesty many times.

414
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,460
Righteous as she is,

415
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,780
even men can't match her.

416
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
You're also women.

417
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,260
How can you defame her like that?

418
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,500
General Ye, please forgive us!

419
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,700
General Ye, please forgive us!

420
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,460
Fine. Fine.

421
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,020
This is inappropriate in the imperial palace.

422
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,420
Leave now!

423
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,300
Yes!

424
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,100
We don't know anything about Xiaojiu,

425
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,500
and we can't find any clue.

426
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,940
If we let her stay by His Majesty's side...

427
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,340
She saved not only His Majesty

428
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,380
but me.

429
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,740
If you suspect her,

430
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,780
you'd better serve someone else.

431
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,540
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,620
Address her by "Your Highness" in future.

433
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,060
Let's go! Keep patrolling!

434
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:12,860
Yes.

435
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,740
Your Highness,

436
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,700
I've searched Lingxiao Pavilion

437
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,660
at the northwest corner of the imperial palace.

438
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,260
Lingbi Stone can't be kept there.

439
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
Is that the last place?

440
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,020
Yes.

441
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,500
We've almost searched everywhere in the imperial palace,

442
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,180
but we didn't find Lingbi Stone.

443
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,420
In that case,

444
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,500
the only place we haven't searched

445
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,660
is His Majesty's chamber, Muning Hall.

446
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,780
But to get into His Majesty's chamber,

447
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,140
I'm afraid we can only count on you.

448
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,100
Your Highness,

449
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,420
we've come to the State of Chengyu for quite some time,

450
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,100
but His Majesty has never come to Wan Yun Palace.

451
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,300
While that Imperial Lady Jiu is deeply favored by His Majesty.

452
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Last time in the study,

453
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,300
Imperial Lady Jiu meddled in again.

454
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,180
She specially brought the
weapon sketch to impress His Majesty.

455
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,580
Your Highness,

456
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,780
you'd better take the initiative than sit still and do nothing.

457
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,660
Enough.

458
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,180
I know what I should do.

459
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,940
We've been making progress. No need to worry.

460
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,300
I feel dizzy these days.

461
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,140
Taking time out of my busy schedule for some fresh air today

462
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,340
and seeing the sun shining brightly,

463
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,620
I feel so happy.

464
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,740
Indeed!

465
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,180
Your Highness, you're lively and cheerful.

466
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,980
Spending too much time indoors can make you sick.

467
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,580
Isn't that Imperial Lady Jiu?

468
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,340
Sisters!

469
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,780
Imperial Lady Jiu, you're so beautiful.

470
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,780
No wonder His Majesty favors you alone.

471
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,380
Sister, I'm so flattered.

472
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,900
His Majesty is here!

473
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,100
Your Majesty!

474
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,140
Rise.

475
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

476
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,580
Today we're here to appreciate flowers,
and there's no outsider here.

477
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,900
No need to feel restrained.

478
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,460
Why is Imperial Concubine Wan not here?

479
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,740
Your Majesty,

480
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,620
after receiving the dragon fruit

481
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,700
granted by you this morning,

482
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,140
Her Highness Wan suddenly turned so homesick

483
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,180
that she felt depressed and uncomfortable.

484
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,420
For fear that she might ruin your mood,

485
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,980
Her Highness Wan wouldn't come,

486
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,180
so she especially sent me to report to Your Majesty.

487
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,500
Since Imperial Concubine Wan entered the imperial palace,

488
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,220
I've never visited her in Wan Yun Palace.

489
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,900
Does she mistakenly think I ignored her on purpose,

490
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,900
so as to become depressed and sad?

491
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,500
In that case, Your Majesty,

492
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,580
why not visit her in Wan Yun Palace?

493
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,780
Imperial Concubine Wan has come a long way
from the State of Chong'an to marry in Cheng Yu.

494
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,060
Now that she's sick,

495
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,860
she really needs company.

496
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,100
Well then,

497
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,300
I'll go to Wan Yun Palace first.

498
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,860
Chief Eunuch!

499
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,980
Go to Wan Yun Palace.

500
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,820
Your Highness, are you OK?

501
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,860
I don't know why. I suddenly feel dizzy.

502
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Maybe I'm just tired.

503
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,420
I don't have a mood swing.

504
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,940
Why do I suddenly feel so terrible?

505
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,380
Does the backfire turn worse?

506
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,220
Let's go back.

507
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,900
I'll take you back to our palace right away.

508
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,420
Your Highness,

509
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,940
the medicine is OK. Do you want to take it now?

510
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,260
Just leave it there.

511
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,540
I'll drink it after it cools.

512
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,260
His Majesty is here!

513
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
Your Majesty, I didn't know you would come.

514
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,220
Please forgive me for not welcoming you.

515
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,340
Rise.

516
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,540
Chief Eunuch said you're homesick,

517
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,060
so I come to see you.

518
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,060
Your Majesty, thank you for your care.

519
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,660
I'm fine.

520
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,100
Good.

521
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,780
The medicine...

522
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,260
Imperial Concubine Wan, are you sick?

523
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,580
No.

524
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,420
I'm in poor health since childhood.

525
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,340
It's just medicine to keep me fit.

526
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,900
OK.

527
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,460
What's this?

528
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,180
Did you carve it?

529
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Your Majesty,

530
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,740
it's the memorial tablet.

531
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,340
The memorial tablet?

532
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,180
Yes.

533
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,540
In my hometown, we have the tradition of

534
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,340
making memorial tablets for the deceased.

535
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,060
On the one hand, it's for praying that our late families

536
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,660
can rest in peace in heaven.

537
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,860
On the other hand,

538
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,460
it's for commemorating the deceased.

539
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,780
I made this memorial tablet

540
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,540
to commemorate my mother.

541
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,420
Your mother has passed away?

542
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:38,940
Yes.

543
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,420
She passed away

544
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,780
shortly after I was born.

545
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm unable to take care of her even for one day.

546
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,020
In half a month, it'll be my mother's deathday,

547
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,140
so I made this memorial tablet

548
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,620
to commemorate her.

549
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,420
I can understand how you feel.

550
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,820
Just like you,

551
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,140
I lost my mother

552
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,340
right after I was born.

553
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,180
Your Majesty, I'm sorry for

554
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,100
reminding you of your pain.

555
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,700
Rise.

556
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,300
Don't be too sad

557
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,020
to impair your health.

558
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,420
In this case,

559
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,980
your birthday is around the corner.

560
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,580
My birthday is half a month away.

561
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,020
Though I lost my mother when little,

562
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,140
my father loves me dearly.

563
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,140
He celebrated my birthday with me every year.

564
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,980
I'll celebrate your birthday

565
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,620
with you this year.

566
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,340
I've still got important things to attend to.

567
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,940
Have a good rest.

568
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,180
Your Majesty, see you.

569
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,900
Your Highness, congratulations!

570
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,020
Thanks to you,

571
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,620
I got the information of the late empress.

572
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,580
Well,

573
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,500
I haven't paid respects to Empress Dowager Xian today.

574
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,300
Go with me now.

575
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,540
Yes.

576
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,020
Imperial Lady Wan!

577
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,460
Your Highness!

578
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,540
Your Highness,

579
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
are you also here to pay respects to Her Majesty Xian?

580
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,580
I'm also here for you.

581
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,140
Your Highness, please be self-possessed.

582
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,260
I am the Imperial Concubine of His Majesty.

583
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,180
I shouldn't get in touch with princes or ministers.

584
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,500
See you.

585
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,820
We've been making progress.

586
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,340
No need to worry.

587
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,900
Your Highness,

588
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,900
I just sent a letter to my families afar

589
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,660
because I missed them so much.

590
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,700
Even if you tell His Majesty,

591
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,500
I'll explain the same way.

592
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,860
A secret letter sent by a flying pigeon,

593
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,980
His Majesty probably won't believe

594
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,380
it's a simple letter home.

595
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,180
Neither of us is dumb.

596
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,100
No need to hide it.

597
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,180
Your Highness,

598
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,300
what do you want?

599
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,860
I knew that

600
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
imperial matrimony

601
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,540
wouldn't be a good thing.

602
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,540
Why on earth do you come to the State of Chengyu?

603
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,180
Your Highness,

604
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,060
you've been keeping close watch on

605
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,780
everything happened in the imperial harem.

606
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,340
I wonder why you monitor

607
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,860
the imperial harem.

608
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,060
I am the prince of the State of Chengyu.

609
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,300
I have the right to look into anything

610
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,060
that concerns state security.

611
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,300
Your Highness,

612
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,020
if you think you can declare me guilty

613
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,620
simply with one letter,

614
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,660
feel free to tell His Majesty.

615
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,860
Please go ahead.

616
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,460
Imperial Lady Wan, if you don't want to admit,

617
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,980
I won't press you for an answer.

618
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,980
But you'd better not be self-righteous

619
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
or act rashly.

620
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,940
Otherwise,

621
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,580
I won't spare you easily.

622
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,540
Your Highness,

623
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,500
are you letting me off?

624
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,580
As long as you don't act on your own to cause trouble,

625
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,380
I'd like to be your friend.

626
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
Imperial Lady Wan, you're new here.

627
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,380
In the imperial palace,

628
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,380
it's better to have a friend

629
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,020
than an enemy, right?

630
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,460
Your Highness,

631
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,820
what on earth does Prince Ying mean?

632
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,540
With sinister motives,

633
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,980
he's not the good type.

634
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,380
I can't figure out what he's up to for now.

635
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,660
However, we should be

636
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,980
more careful and cautious in the imperial palace in the future.

637
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,820
Your Highness,

638
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,140
His Majesty just noticed you.

639
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,740
You should seize the chance

640
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
to approach His Majesty and look for Lingbi Stone.

641
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
I said no hurry.

642
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,620
We should wait for the right moment.

643
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
I'm afraid Mr. Nie

644
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,460
can hardly wait.

645
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,500
Accomplished as you are in martial arts,

646
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,500
why not search Muning Hall on your own.

647
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,500
I certainly won't stop you.

648
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,260
Your Highness, pardon me for crossing the line.

649
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,860
I'll do whatever you ask me.

650
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,180
None of you

651
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,980
can forge this weapon?

652
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,540
Your Excellency,

653
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,140
the sketch design is so ingenious.

654
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,540
I've never seen anything like this before.

655
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,860
We really can't forge it with the current tools.

656
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,100
You are old blacksmiths I invited over

657
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,140
from all around the State of Chengyu.

658
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,660
All of you are skilled,

659
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,540
representing the highest level of our state.

660
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,580
If you can't forge it,

661
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,580
I'm afraid no one in the entire state can.

662
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,180
Well...

663
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,620
Well...

664
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,140
Lose no time.

665
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,060
Make sure to figure out

666
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,420
the forging method within the shortest time.

667
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,940
Yes.

668
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,700
His Majesty is here!

669
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,780
I pay respects to Your Majesty!

670
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,100
Imperial Concubine Wan, do you feel better today?

671
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,500
Your Majesty, thank you for caring.

672
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,660
I'm much better.

673
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,620
Your Majesty,

674
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,180
would you like to join me for a meal?

675
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,660
OK.

676
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,300
These dishes are specialties of Chong'an.

677
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,460
Exactly.

678
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,300
This one is called Peacock Tail,

679
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,740
which implies being splendid, auspicious, rich and honored.

680
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,820
May our two states enjoy
lasting prosperity and peace together!

681
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,580
Good!

682
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:56,940
Well said!

683
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,380
Your Majesty,

684
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,260
this is the chestnut begonia porridge,

685
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,340
which is a specialty of Chong'an.

686
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,900
Your Majesty, you worry a lot

687
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,260
when handling state affairs.

688
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,500
This is an herbal cuisine for strengthening your body
and nourishing your vitality.

689
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,900
I hope that after taking it, Your Majesty
can calm your mind and reach inner peace.

690
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,380
You're so considerate.

691
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,740
Seldom coming to Wan Yun Palace,

692
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,100
I neglected you.

693
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,980
Your Highness, don't say that.

694
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,500
Though I came a long way to marry in Chengyu,

695
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,740
I've made many friends in the imperial palace,

696
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,380
especially Jiu.

697
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,740
We felt like old friends at first meeting.

698
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,940
If I want to divert myself from boredom,

699
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
I can talk with Jiu.

700
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,220
Good.

701
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,060
Is that your Qin?

702
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,100
I didn't know you're a master of music.

703
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm not a master.

704
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,420
When I'm not occupied,

705
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,620
I just play it to kill the time.

706
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,660
Your Majesty, if you feel like listening to some music,

707
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,500
I can play it to add to the fun.

708
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:51,900
OK.

709
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,140
Her Highness Jiu suddenly passed out.

710
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,660
Your Majesty,

711
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,260
word came from Yue Hua Palace that

712
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,940
Her Highness Jiu suddenly passed out.

713
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,300
Hurry up!

714
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,500
Let's go to Yue Hua Palace.

715
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,580
Let me go with you.

716
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,740
Imperial physician,

717
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,340
what's wrong with Her Highness?

718
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,460
As to Her Highness Jiu's disease...

719
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,740
His Majesty is here!

720
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,900
What's wrong with Imperial Lady Jiu?

721
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,500
Why did she suddenly pass out?

722
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:35,940
Your Majesty,

723
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,860
Her Highness Jiu's pulse condition is smooth,
and her main and collateral channels are unobstructed.

724
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,340
Forgive me for being incompetent.

725
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,940
I can't find the cause of her disease.

726
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:44,860
Just leave.

727
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,060
Yes.

728
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,460
Xiaojiu.

729
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,940
Xiaojiu.

730
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,420
Emperor.

731
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,020
What?

732
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,060
Your Majesty.

733
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,140
Your Majesty,

734
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,700
please forgive me for my slip of tongue.

735
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,740
As long as you're awake.

736
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,980
As long as you're awake.

737
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,060
What happened to me?

738
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,500
You passed out suddenly.

739
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,740
Do you feel uncomfortable?

740
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,060
Then it must be the fact that you're new here

741
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,900
and you're not used to living in the imperial palace.

742
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,260
Staying inside the imperial palace all day long

743
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,460
has impaired your health.

744
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,260
Rest well these days.

745
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,300
In a few days,

746
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,340
I'll take you to the hunting ground to relieve boredom, OK?

747
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,260
What did you just call me?

748
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,780
Emperor?

749
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,540
It is said that eyes don't lie.

750
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Look at his eyes.

751
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,860
Has he really fallen in love with me?

752
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,540
Bai Fengjiu! Bai Fengjiu!

753
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,540
Keep fantasizing like this,

754
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,460
you'll disrupt Emperor Dong Hua's love test again. What to do then?

755
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,380
It's a task! It's not real!

756
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,740
It's for Emperor Dong Hua! It's not real!

757
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,660
Do you feel uncomfortable?

758
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,700
Then you should lie down and rest.

759
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,900
I won't leave.

760
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,220
I'll keep you company.
