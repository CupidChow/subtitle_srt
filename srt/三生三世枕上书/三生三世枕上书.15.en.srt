Eternal Love of Dream

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 15

3
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,100
Your Majesty, we have reached the Yue Hua Palace.

4
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,100
Will you go inside, Your Majesty?

5
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,420
= Yue Hua Palace =

6
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,580
Unconsciously,

7
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,740
we are here.

8
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,820
It used to be a busy and cheering place,

9
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,460
but now

10
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,620
it's cold and cheerless.

11
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,380
I won't go inside.

12
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,980
Have a walk with me.

13
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,500
Yes.

14
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,660
Mother,

15
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,140
I have been married to His Majesty of the State of Chengyu.

16
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,660
His Majesty was depressed recently.

17
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,260
I hope your spirit

18
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,220
can bless His Majesty everything going well.

19
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,100
Imperial Concubine Wan.

20
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,220
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

21
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,420
Rise.

22
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

23
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
It's so late. Who are you worshiping?

24
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,540
I...

25
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,660
It's your mother's memorial day.

26
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,860
Please forgive me.

27
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,020
I didn't want to violate the rules of the palace purposely,

28
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,980
having a worship in the palace without permission.

29
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,580
Today is my mother's memorial day.

30
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Missing my mother so much,

31
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,460
I came here to worship her under
the cover of night when few people went here.

32
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,260
Please punish me.

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,740
It doesn't matter.

34
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,180
It's human nature to worship deceased family members.

35
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,020
You showed filial piety to your mother.

36
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,980
How could I punish you?

37
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

38
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,500
It's your birthday today, right?

39
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,540
I promised to celebrate your birthday with you.

40
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,980
But because of the business in the palace,

41
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,300
I forgot it.

42
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,220
It's not important to celebrate my birthday.

43
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,740
Recently, you're worrying about Sister Jiu's case,

44
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,820
finding no way out.

45
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,660
I feel regretful that

46
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,340
I can't share your worry.

47
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,900
Worshiping your mother here,

48
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,020
why do you take a Qin along with you?

49
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,340
Your Majesty.

50
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,820
When I was young, my father told me that

51
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,060
my mother liked to listen to the music of my hometown.

52
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,980
Therefore, each time I worship my mother,

53
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,940
I will take the Qin

54
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,540
and play for her.

55
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,220
Since it is so,

56
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
play a tune for your mother.

57
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,380
I also want to hear it.

58
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,620
Thank you for helping me, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,140
Is the melody from the palace?

60
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,620
Your Highness, do you know

61
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,700
what His Majesty is doing now?

62
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,420
Your Majesty,

63
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
this is the second time that you have locked me up.

64
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,020
Will the ending be the same as the last time?

65
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,580
Your Highness,

66
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,940
His Majesty must be busy with

67
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,340
our case.

68
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,060
He will prove us innocent soon.

69
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,020
Right?

70
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,980
If I was killed this time,

71
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,820
would His Majesty

72
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,420
go through his romance misfortune?

73
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,540
How is everything going, Qingti?

74
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,380
Your Majesty.

75
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,500
Having investigated related people,

76
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,740
I haven't had a clue yet.

77
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,340
With seven days' limitation, the deadline is near.

78
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,300
But you said you hadn't found a clue yet.

79
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,300
General Ye,

80
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,620
how did you investigate the case?

81
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
Although there is no direct evidence

82
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,500
to prove Her Highness Jiu's innocence,

83
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,900
I think

84
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,540
Her Highness must be guiltless.

85
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,300
Why?

86
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,940
If she intended to plot to assassinate,

87
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
she would have acted before Double Seventh Festival

88
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,820
to put Your Majesty to death.

89
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,580
Why did she delay it?

90
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,060
Moreover,

91
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,220
she ever saved Your Majesty

92
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,460
and me in the battlefield.

93
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,660
She has no motive to kill me.

94
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,940
I know it.

95
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,900
Being naive, kind and straightforward,

96
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,900
Her Highness Jiu is not shrew and deep.

97
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Your Majesty, please have an upright judgement.

98
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,780
All the evidences are not good for Xiaojiu.

99
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,460
How can I protect her?

100
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,540
It's possible that the person
who poisoned would destroy the evidence.

101
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,580
Even though there isn't evidence,

102
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,220
Her Highness Jiu is still innocent.

103
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,260
Your Majesty,

104
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
she is your concubine.

105
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,940
If you don't protect her,

106
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,300
then...

107
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,460
I know she is innocent from the beginning.

108
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,100
Qingti.

109
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm the emperor,

110
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,580
not a common person.

111
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,980
This is the palace,

112
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,700
not a citizen's home.

113
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,060
Trust can't save her life.

114
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,340
Your Majesty.

115
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,220
What I need is the evidence that can prove her innocence

116
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,460
to get rid of the bad thoughts of those who have bad intentions,

117
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,980
not your nonsense.

118
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,100
I know.

119
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm sure to try my best to find out the evidence to

120
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,500
prove Her Highness Jiu's innocence before the deadline.

121
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,140
General Ye.

122
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,180
Tell me

123
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,020
how to make sorrowless cake in detail.

124
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,020
You still don't believe me, right?

125
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,300
No.

126
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,580
I have interrogated those involved,

127
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,220
only to find that they don't have the chance to poison.

128
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,220
In the whole palace, only you can make sorrowless cake.

129
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,700
If I can't find strong evidences,

130
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,900
it's hard for me to exonerate you.

131
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,420
What are the ingredients?

132
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,140
Tell me.

133
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,820
Then I can ask the imperial physician to verify them.

134
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,900
But both you and His Majesty

135
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,140
have ever eaten the sorrowless cake that I made.

136
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,860
If I want to murder you,

137
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,420
then....

138
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,980
Xiaojiu.

139
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,060
The deadline is near.

140
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,820
You're in the situation of life and death now.

141
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
If you don't clarify everything,

142
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,980
I can't save you even though I want.

143
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,940
Sorrowless flower.

144
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,220
What's it?

145
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,500
I've never heard of it.

146
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,300
It's a kind of flower from my hometown.

147
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,900
OK.

148
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,700
Where is your hometown?

149
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,500
I...

150
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,780
You still want to hide something?

151
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,460
Since we knew each other,

152
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,820
you have hidden your family background.

153
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,620
Could it be that you are an escaped prisoner?

154
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,100
No, I'm not.

155
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,380
Since you're not an escaped prisoner,

156
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,460
why can't you tell me your family background?

157
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,460
Why did you come to the palace?

158
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,460
You always ask me to look for Zhou Mengxi,

159
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,580
but you even don't know

160
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,420
what she is.

161
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,940
It's hard to avoid being suspected.

162
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,180
If you can't make it clear,

163
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,860
I can't help to exonerate you.

164
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,860
You can leave, General Ye.

165
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,260
You...

166
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,540
If you can't believe me,

167
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,580
I have no ways to help you.

168
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,220
Guards.

169
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,300
Take her back.

170
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,060
Yes.

171
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,820
Your Majesty.

172
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,660
I didn't do you a favor

173
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,260
but added some trouble.

174
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,060
Muyun,

175
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,300
I

176
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,660
didn't tell my background to General Ye.

177
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,500
Will you blame me?

178
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,300
No.

179
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,180
These days,

180
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,900
I have been staying with you,

181
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,540
knowing what kind of person you are, Your Highness.

182
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,740
Your Highness, you must have your own reason
so that you are reluctant to tell him.

183
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,700
Thank you for understanding me.

184
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,380
However,

185
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,620
the deadline is near.

186
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,260
If General Ye still can't find anything,

187
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,620
we...

188
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,820
If he can't find anything,

189
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,100
I'm sure to save you.

190
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,100
I won't let you die here wrongly.

191
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,660
Your Highness.

192
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,340
You've been in the prison.

193
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,180
What's your solution?

194
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm sure to save you.

195
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,620
Don't you believe me?

196
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,780
I believe.

197
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,260
I believe you forever.

198
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,900
Take it easy. Mufeng Butterfly.

199
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,620
I got you into trouble last time.

200
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,300
Even though I suffered the backfire this time,

201
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,660
I won't let you die because of me again.

202
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,300
Demon Lord.

203
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,140
It says in the letter that Chu Wan is winning

204
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,700
the trust of His Majesty of State of Chengyu.

205
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,780
It appears that we will know
the whereabouts of Lingbi Stone soon.

206
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,300
Soon?

207
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,580
It means we still don't know the whereabouts.

208
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,100
Since Princess Ji Heng is wise,

209
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,420
I'm sure that she can find some clues,

210
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,060
hoping you can focus on recovering your body.

211
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,540
It's better for us to wait for more days.

212
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,060
There must be good news at that time.

213
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,140
Your Majesty,

214
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,140
Imperial Concubine Wan is here.

215
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,340
Let her in.

216
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:42,980
Yes.

217
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,500
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

218
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,980
It's so late.

219
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,220
Why do you come here?

220
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,940
Hearing that you don't have a good appetite these days,

221
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,780
I specially made the Osmanthus Jiuniang,

222
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,300
hoping you can taste it.

223
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,420
You specially come to send me this?

224
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,020
No.

225
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,940
Recently, I've learned some refreshing skills

226
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,140
from the servants in the palace.

227
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,900
Your Majesty, you are busy with
memorials to the throne these days.

228
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,860
If you don't mind,

229
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
I'd like to show my skills

230
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
to relax your body.

231
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,140
Since you are so considerate,

232
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
how can I refuse your kindness?

233
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,340
Xiaojiu.

234
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,020
Your Majesty.

235
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,260
Xiaojiu.

236
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,980
Imperial Concubine Wan.

237
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,620
Why are you here?

238
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,580
Your Majesty.

239
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,380
You had a dream?

240
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,260
How can I fall asleep?

241
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,420
Maybe it's because I put wine in the Osmanthus porridge

242
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,220
that I made,

243
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,300
and you are tired from reading memorials to the throne,

244
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,780
you fell asleep unconsciously.

245
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,140
Your Majesty,

246
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,060
you're busy with work.

247
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,780
It's not convenient for me to be here disturbing you.

248
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,140
OK.

249
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,820
Guards.

250
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,620
Here.

251
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,060
Send Imperial Concubine Wan back to her palace.

252
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,060
Yes.

253
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,660
Your Highness, please.

254
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
I'm leaving.

255
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,860
Yang Shun.

256
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,620
Your Majesty.

257
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
Go out with me.

258
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,300
Yes.

259
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,500
Your Highness.

260
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,620
So you mean

261
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,860
Lingbi Stone is not in His Majesty's resting place.

262
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,540
Your Majesty.

263
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,580
Your Majesty.

264
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,580
No.

265
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,100
No. Xiaojiu.

266
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,260
I have searched over the whole palace.

267
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,420
Could it be somewhere that I missed?

268
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,220
Your Highness.

269
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,500
Ling Xiang.

270
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,180
In my view,

271
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,900
the palace is so big.

272
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,900
It's possible that

273
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,500
we didn't search every place carefully.

274
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,060
From tomorrow,

275
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,140
you search everywhere again

276
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,220
in case there's somewhere we missed.

277
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,660
I know.

278
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
You suffered, Xiaojiu.

279
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,860
Your Majesty.

280
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,300
Is it true that I'm going to be executed,

281
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,140
so you come to see me the last time?

282
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,020
I'm here to take you away.

283
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,580
Take me away?

284
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,180
Won't the Empress Dowager investigate it anymore?

285
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,540
As long as you can tell me everything,

286
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,660
I'm sure you are safe in front of the Empress Dowager.

287
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,780
You don't believe me?

288
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,460
Of course I believe you.

289
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,700
But if you don't say anything,

290
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,420
how can I save you?

291
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,660
What should I say?

292
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,060
Just tell

293
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,420
where the sorrowless flower comes from

294
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,700
and where you are from.

295
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,020
I can't say that.

296
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,540
You can't tell?

297
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm saving you.

298
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,740
But I can't say that.

299
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
Why?

300
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,620
No reason.

301
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,020
It's not time to get angry now.

302
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,620
If you are angry with me

303
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,780
because I put you into prison,

304
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,540
after you get out of here,

305
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,140
I'm at your disposal.

306
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,020
But you must tell me now.

307
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,580
Your Majesty.

308
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,940
Do you really love me?

309
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,100
Do you love me sincerely?

310
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,900
Or do you just think I'm fresh and interesting?

311
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
I can't sleep all night because of you.

312
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,060
Even the state affairs have been delayed.

313
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,980
Do you still suspect me?

314
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,300
If you love me sincerely

315
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,220
and I die wrongly this time,

316
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,700
when everything is clear later,

317
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,100
you must feel deep pain because of losing your beloved forever.

318
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,100
In this way can you go through your romance misfortune

319
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,500
smoothly?

320
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,020
I dare not.

321
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,780
I have my reasons.

322
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,460
So I can't tell you.

323
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,700
Your Majesty, are you willing to believe me?

324
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,420
You...

325
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,060
Why?

326
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,580
In the palace,

327
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,180
even my favor

328
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
can't compete against the law.

329
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,300
Could it be that you really have another purpose?

330
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,460
Xiaojiu.

331
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,060
Talk with me.

332
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,300
Xiaojiu, raise your head and look at me.

333
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,940
Why did you come to the palace?

334
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,180
Why did you come to the palace?

335
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,860
What you said

336
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,580
are all false to me, right?

337
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,340
How can I tell you that

338
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm here in the mortal realm to help
you go through your romance misfortune?

339
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,020
How can I tell you

340
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,220
I'm the Princess of Qingqiu.

341
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,940
Everything I do is to repay your kindness.

342
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,860
So that's what it is.

343
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,460
What you did...

344
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,980
I see.

345
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,100
Eventually God will

346
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,500
take back the wrong fate.

347
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,260
You said Fengjiu would be executed.

348
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:21,900
What's wrong?

349
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,140
Don't worry, Lord.

350
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,380
Her Highness went to the mortal realm to have some experiences.

351
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,260
It's different from His Majesty who went to
the mortal realm as a common person.

352
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,300
Even though in the mortal realm,
Her Highness is still an immortal.

353
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,700
She can use magic arts to protect herself.

354
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,820
Won't she be backfired?

355
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,940
Why are you still peaceful?

356
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,980
Peaceful?

357
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,820
Don't worry.

358
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,980
Her Highness has a life full of lucky escapes.

359
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,500
She has solutions to go through the misfortune.

360
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:46,980
OK.

361
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,540
Since you don't save her, I will save her.

362
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,380
Lord.

363
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,580
Wait me to finish my words.

364
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,740
Zhou Mengxi has been dead.

365
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,580
At present, Her Highness is the
romance misfortune that His Majesty would go through.

366
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,980
What?

367
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,860
All the changes in the mortal realm

368
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,420
were caused because Her Highness went there privately.

369
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,380
She disturbed the fortunes in the mortal realm

370
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,660
as well as the fates among people.

371
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,620
So the misfortune came into being.

372
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,540
Neither you nor I can offer help.

373
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,300
Otherwise,

374
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,900
the situation in the mortal realm

375
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,740
will be worse and worse.

376
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,660
Then how can it end?

377
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,540
How unlucky she is!

378
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,180
If she becomes the romance misfortune

379
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,250
and we can't be involved,

380
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,620
how can we help her?

381
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,020
Right.

382
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,740
She is suffering in the prison.

383
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,740
Can I just stand by without doing anything?

384
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,260
Her Highness went to the mortal realm this time.

385
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,580
There exists a fixed fate.

386
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Maybe she has her own fate.

387
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,670
Moreover,

388
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,140
before the end of the romance misfortune,

389
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,300
there must be some hints in my Book of Fate.

390
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,180
Naturally I will give her a helping hand at that time.

391
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,260
It's not the right time now.

392
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,460
The lotus in the lotus pond came into being by human heart.

393
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,780
I'm afraid in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions

394
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,460
you can't find more beautiful lotus.

395
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,980
I'm wondering if you like them?

396
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,300
Very beautiful.

397
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,260
Having agreed to appreciate the lotus here,

398
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,100
why do you have a worried face?

399
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,100
It doesn't count this time.

400
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,080
The more you get, the more you want.

401
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,380
Do all the men behave like this,

402
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,580
just thinking of yourselves?

403
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,820
Why do you think so?

404
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,540
It's about Emperor Dong Hua.

405
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,980
He just went to the mortal realm to experience his misfortune.

406
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,420
Why did he bother...

407
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,900
Forget it. You won't understand.

408
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,100
You always say that I don't understand.

409
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,900
How do you know that I can't understand?

410
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,180
What about telling me in detail?

411
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,420
I don't know how to say it

412
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,020
and where to begin.

413
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,820
All the women are the same.

414
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,740
His Majesty is in the Sky Kingdom.

415
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,500
He doesn't know everything.

416
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,460
Now he is in the mortal realm,

417
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,220
so it's certain that he lost his memory.

418
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,580
All...

419
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,620
All the women?

420
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,580
Birds of a feather.

421
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,940
Why do you leave so suddenly?

422
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,660
Xiaojiu.

423
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,820
General Ye.

424
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,860
Are you here to see me off?

425
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,460
Are you so easy to give up?

426
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,020
What can I do if I don't give up?

427
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,860
His Majesty has given me up.

428
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,500
His Majesty gives you up.

429
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,500
Then you will give up yourself, right?

430
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,580
Since you give up so easily,

431
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,850
is there any difference between you

432
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,700
and the weak girls in the world?

433
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,940
What do you want me to do?

434
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,140
I've been locked in the prison.

435
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,220
If you don't want to tell your background.

436
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,590
Then think of the situation that day

437
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,340
in detail

438
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,820
to say if there's something you didn't notice.

439
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,860
This is the only way to save you

440
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,500
and them now.

441
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,900
Your Highness.

442
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,860
Time isn't up.

443
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,380
As long as there is chance,

444
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,220
don't give up.

445
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,100
I asked Muyun to send the sorrowless cake that I made

446
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,020
to the Imperial Kitchen,

447
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,580
as for the rest things, I didn't take in charge.

448
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,980
Later,

449
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,700
as for the sorrowless cake in the banquet,

450
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,140
just from the surface,

451
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,060
do you think if there were some signs that it was changed?

452
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,300
One tray of sorrowless cake is ready.

453
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,140
Muyun.

454
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,740
I'll put them in the plate for you
before you serve them to the Imperial Kitchen.

455
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,900
The people from the Imperial Kitchen
will spread these for them tomorrow.

456
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,980
Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,900
They were changed.

458
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,300
What?

459
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,300
The sorrowless cake that I gave Muyun

460
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,780
were put in a five-petal plate.

461
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,820
But the plate in the palace was changed.

462
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,900
Could it be someone...

463
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,700
How can't I expect that?

464
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,460
I haven't finished my words.

465
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:18,980
General.

466
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,260
You have checked the sorrowless cake, haven't you?

467
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,940
Indeed there exists Lophophora williamsii poison.

468
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,180
Where is the porcelain where the sorrowless cake were put?

469
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,660
It has been lost.

470
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,180
Your Majesty.

471
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,710
It's cold.

472
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,020
Take care of your health.

473
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,580
Do you think what I did

474
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,220
is right?

475
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,540
Your Majesty,

476
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,140
in my heart,

477
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,500
I also feel pity for Sister Jiu.

478
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,740
But we need an explanation

479
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,100
to Empress Dowager,

480
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,820
dukes, ministers

481
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,620
and the Chief Eunuch who died wrongly.

482
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,980
More importantly,

483
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,900
it's to those who have bad intentions.

484
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,980
Grind the ink for me.

485
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:02,740
Yes.

486
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,740
Your Majesty.

487
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,060
I'm curious about one thing.

488
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,740
I want to turn to you.

489
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,660
Say it.

490
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,900
When I was in state of Chong'an,

491
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,460
I heard that there was a national treasure in State of Chengyu,

492
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
called

493
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,180
Lingbi Stone.

494
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,820
It's said that State of Chengyu was built

495
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,820
because of the protection and blessing of this precious stone.

496
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,380
I'm wondering if there is any difference

497
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,580
between this stone and the other stones.

498
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,260
If I'm lucky enough,

499
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,220
I want to have a look.

500
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,140
Since it's a legend,

501
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,900
it's exaggerated unavoidably.

502
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,340
No need to take it seriously.

503
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,740
Now that you love jewelry,

504
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,820
I will order the craftsman to make one for you.

505
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,900
Your Majesty.

506
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,460
I'm happy to be spoiled by you.

507
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,620
= Chengming Hall =

508
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,420
Rise.

509
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,500
General Ye.

510
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,100
Time is up.

511
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,620
As for the case of sorrowless cake,

512
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,580
I'm wondering if there is any progress.

513
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,820
I just want to report it to you.

514
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,140
Your Majesty.

515
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,780
After seven-days investigations and finding evidences,

516
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,980
I have made some progress.

517
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,500
Please send an imperial edict,

518
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,780
permitting me to take some human testimony
and physical evidences to the palace

519
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,060
to show you

520
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,580
how to disclose the truth of the poison case.

521
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,100
Disclose it as quickly as possible.

522
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,220
Come in.

523
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,700
Look.

524
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,980
He is pulling a dog.

525
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,940
Hmm.

526
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,660
How abrupt!

527
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,060
Everybody,

528
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,500
the sorrowless cake is not poisonous.

529
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,220
I'd like to try them.

530
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,260
General Ye, don't eat it.

531
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,260
General Ye.

532
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,020
Your Majesty.

533
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,340
Everybody.

534
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,580
I'd like to risk my life to show you
the sorrowless cake is nontoxic.

535
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,540
If I'm unlucky to die by eating it,

536
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,060
that's because I didn't handle the case well and I deserve it.

537
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,860
I'd like to apologize for my offense with death.

538
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,620
He really ate it.

539
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,500
He isn't afraid.

540
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,460
Is he OK?

541
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,100
He really ate it.

542
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,820
How brave he is!

543
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,300
Maybe you're wondering

544
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,260
why I'm OK after eating it.

545
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,220
But the Chief Eunuch just had a bite

546
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,420
and died because of poison.

547
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,340
Now I will show you again.

548
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,300
Watch carefully.

549
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,020
What are the differences between the two cakes?

550
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,460
Well.

551
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,660
How could it be this?

552
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,260
Yeah.

553
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,460
It's toxic.

554
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,580
Why is it so?

555
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,740
What's the matter?

556
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,700
It's the same cake.

557
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,100
Why am I fine after eating it

558
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,220
while the dog died after eating it?

559
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,780
Of course,

560
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,060
I didn't take antidote in advance.

561
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,660
Could it be that

562
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,180
it's not poisonous on the surface of the sorrowless cake?

563
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,380
The part

564
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,020
close to the vessel is poisonous.

565
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,580
The upper part is safe.

566
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,980
So the real murderer

567
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,420
is not Her Highness Jiu, the maker of the sorrowless cake,

568
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,780
but the servant who secretly changed the plate.

569
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,220
General Ye.

570
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,500
Do you have conclusive evidence?

571
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,580
The vessel that the sorrowless cake was put

572
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,540
was broken by the Chief Eunuch.

573
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,580
Then you don't have evidence.

574
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,380
It's just your guess.

575
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,580
No.

576
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,540
I have the evidence.

577
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,300
This fragment was found

578
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,860
under the potting of the banquet that day.

579
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,740
Search it.

580
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:57,740
Yes.

581
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,540
General.

582
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,380
The crumbles left on the fragment

583
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,340
is the same with those

584
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,060
scraped from the sorrowless cake.

585
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,420
There is Lophophora williamsii poison in it.

586
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,140
I can confirm that

587
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,140
the poisoner is the person who changed the vessel,

588
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,660
not Her Highness Jiu.

589
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,340
Then who is

590
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,580
the poisoner on earth?

591
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,140
Guards.

592
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,580
Take the maid, Sang here.

593
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,060
I have queried all Imperial Cooks.

594
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,140
They said they were in the Imperial Kitchen checking

595
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,940
the cakes and food sent from different palaces.

596
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,980
Different palaces use

597
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,180
different vessels.

598
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,580
For example, the Wan Yun Palace used a celadon saucer,

599
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,780
while Yue Hua Palace used a white porcelain five-petal plate.

600
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,900
Her Highness Jiu

601
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,580
presented the cake in a white porcelain five-petal plate.

602
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,860
All the Imperial Cooks can prove it.

603
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,700
Why was the vessel containing the sorrowless cake

604
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,540
changed into a white porcelain round plate at last?

605
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:01,780
I...

606
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,260
Your Majesty.

607
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,180
I don't know anything.

608
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,220
She changed it.

609
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,180
All the people's words

610
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,300
can evidence for themselves.

611
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,900
Only this maid, Sang firmly claimed that

612
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,300
it was the vessel from Yue Hua Palace.

613
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,980
But she didn't know what the vessel in Yue Hua Palace

614
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,860
looked like.

615
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
The maid didn't tell the truth.

616
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,020
It's hard to evidence with those of the Imperial Cooks.

617
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,260
With my interrogation, she confessed that

618
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,540
she was the prisoner.

619
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,100
Why did you poison me?

620
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,900
Because you are not qualified

621
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,820
to be the emperor of state of Chengyu.

622
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,140
How bold you are!

623
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,940
How dare you be so rude to His Majesty?

624
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,340
His Majesty?

625
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,050
You are just a fatuous person

626
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,540
hankering after beautiful women.

627
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,740
You are not qualified to be the emperor of state of Chengyu.

628
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,140
She is killed?

629
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,300
It was so dangerous just now.

630
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,100
Your Majesty, you're frightened.

631
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
The real murderer has been executed.

632
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,460
Take it easy. Your Majesty.

633
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,300
She deserved to be killed.

634
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,940
I'm here to take you home.

635
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,980
Your Majesty.

636
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,740
What happened? Do you believe me?

637
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,620
Qingti has investigated that

638
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,220
the prisoner was someone else.

639
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,460
You were wronged.

640
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,860
Sorry to hurt you.

641
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,180
You'd like to believe me?

642
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,900
I misunderstood you,

643
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,380
saying some harsh words.

644
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,500
I

645
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,260
am sorry for you.

646
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
You'd like to believe me?

647
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,180
Will you forgive me?

648
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,740
I have never blamed you.

649
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,500
Never.

650
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:29,900
Your Majesty.

651
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,580
I miss you so much.

652
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,940
It's time to screen

653
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,820
the maids and eunuchs in the palace.

654
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,340
Yes.

655
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,500
Sorry to frighten you.

656
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,460
Xiaojiu, owing you much,

657
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,420
I plan to confer the title of Madam Jiu on you.

658
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,500
Madam?

659
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,900
I will confer you the title of Madam Jiu,

660
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,900
granting you to live in Xi Ning Palace.

661
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,620
Your Majesty, is it too hasty for you to make this decision?

662
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,700
I want to do something for you.

663
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,780
Don't refuse me.

664
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,340
Thank you for your favor and kindness.

665
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,340
I have a request.

666
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,380
Say it.

667
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,500
Can I keep living in Yue Hua Palace

668
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,980
instead of going to Xi Ning Palace?

669
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Yue Hua Palace also has complete furnishings,

670
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,100
but it's a little small.

671
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,780
According to your present status,

672
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,500
you should live in a bigger palace.

673
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,580
Each time I change my living place,

674
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,540
naturally I can't sleep well at night.

675
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,020
It's not easy for me to be used to living in Yue Hua Palace.

676
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,340
I don't want to move to Xi Ning Palace.

677
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,500
OK.

678
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,780
As you like,

679
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,580
you can still live in Yue Hua Palace.

680
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Thank you. Your Majesty.

681
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,860
As for the awards matching your status of Madam,

682
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,220
I will order the servants to prepare

683
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,100
and send them to Yue Hua Palace as soon as possible.

684
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,140
No need.

685
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,100
I always don't like these things.

686
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,220
Just keep them simple.

687
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,340
You shouldn't been treated shabbily.

688
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,300
You are the Madam now,

689
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,780
but your parents can't share the good life with you.

690
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,220
It's not perfect.

691
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,380
What about my telling all the people in the state

692
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,100
to look for your parents?

693
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,460
Thank you for your favor. Your Majesty.

694
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,020
Maybe my parents are

695
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,620
travelling in another state now.

696
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,940
It's not an effective way.

697
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,740
Besides, you drag people to look for my parents so abruptly.

698
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,820
I don't want Your Majesty and me to bear the criticism.

699
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,220
OK.

700
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,060
Just put it aside.

701
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,980
I'm so greedy that I didn't solve it properly.

702
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,980
If things continue this way,

703
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,060
how can I make His Majesty safe?

704
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,900
It's better for me to make a decision early.

705
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,060
Your Majesty.

706
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,640
As for the awards, I have prepared them well.

707
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,500
Please have a look.

708
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,340
OK.

709
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:12,980
By the way,

710
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,860
send the nerve soothing incense that I concocted for Madam Jiu

711
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,020
and the gilding censer decorated with a wandering dragon

712
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,020
to her as well.

713
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,780
Yes.

714
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,500
Your Majesty,

715
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,860
you are really sincere to Madam Jiu.

716
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,750
It's good for you to know it.
