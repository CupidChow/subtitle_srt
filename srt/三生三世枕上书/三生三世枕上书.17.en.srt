00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 17

3
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,720
Your Majesty, you're so wise and intelligent

4
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
as to design such complicated

5
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,680
and magnificent mechanisms.

6
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,400
It's a pity

7
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,160
that the pivotal part hasn't been completed.

8
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
I was almost going to give up.

9
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,440
Luckily, I met you.

10
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,080
As for the talent of making mechanisms,

11
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,240
you're better than me

12
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,720
now that you designed a perfect short knife.

13
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm flattered.

14
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
Actually, the short knife was not

15
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,760
designed by me.

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
I've used others' experience for reference.

17
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,720
But it's a different case for you.

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
You designed all the mechanisms

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
on your own.

20
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,400
You're right.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
I love studying such stuff since my childhood.

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,800
But

23
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,600
as a prince,

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,760
shouldn't you have focused
on ways of running a country?

25
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,040
Why do you like studying mechanisms?

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,320
My father had little time to
stay with me when I was young,

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,040
so I had lots of spare time

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
to study different things,

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,280
such as Qin-playing,

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,800
tea-drinking

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
and these mechanisms.

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,040
But you were the Crown Prince, right?

33
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,800
Why did your father spend little time with you?

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
Sorry. I shouldn't have asked about it.

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,320
Please forgive me.

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm willing to tell you about that.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
My mother passed away

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
when I was born.

39
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
My father rarely came to see me.

40
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,320
I thought it was because he was tied up with official business,

41
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,520
but later I found

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,800
it was not true.

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,680
He must've missed my mother too much.

44
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,440
He didn't want to see me

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,480
because he tried to avoid thinking of my mother again.

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,600
I see.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Born in the royal family,

48
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,840
you also had a tough childhood.

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,040
It must've been difficult for him.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,600
I really want to give him a hug.

51
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Actually,

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,280
I hated my father when I was young.

53
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,560
But lately,

54
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,440
I began to understand him a little.

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,800
Why?

56
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
Before I met you,

57
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,240
I didn't quite understand
my father's love for my mother.

58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
How could one have so deep love

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
for another?

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,160
After meeting you,

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,960
I finally understood.

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,920
Your Highness, His Majesty isn't in the palace again.

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600
He must've gone out for fun

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,000
with Madam Jiu.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,880
It's weird.

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,520
His Majesty is not playful by nature.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
He couldn't go out every two or three days

68
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,880
no matter how he loves Madam Jiu.

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,960
Sounds reasonable.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,760
Is it possible...

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
His Majesty really stays with Madam Jiu.

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,560
His Majesty is heartless to you.

73
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
He said he'd come to see you last time,

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
but he didn't show up at all.

75
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go.

76
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Your Highness, what are you drawing?

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600
Mechanisms.

78
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
His Majesty often took me to the Emperor's Tomb

79
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
and asked me to help him design mechanisms.

80
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
So you can spend a lot of time

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
with each other, right?

82
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,360
Of course.

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,440
Cheng Yu told you something

84
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,960
about helping the Emperor experience his misfortunes.

85
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,920
Does it work?

86
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Don't mention it.

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
I tried teasing him

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
when we enjoyed the full moon last time.

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
Guess what?

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
I almost failed to hold my own ground.

91
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,200
Luckily, a bright idea occurred suddenly.

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,400
I made him drunk.

93
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,200
How could I believe Cheng Yu can give some good advice?

94
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
Do you know?

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,120
It was so hard for me to resist him

96
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,720
every time he looked at me affectionately,

97
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
saying sweet words

98
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,200
and making sweet moves.

99
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,280
Every time he did that,

100
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,360
I was annoyed and confused.

101
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,520
I looked forward to it but I was also afraid.

102
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Every day, I was in dire suffering.

103
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
It's really difficult for you, Your Highness.

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,720
But in this way,

105
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,600
His Majesty has gone through most of his misfortune of love.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,360
What do you mean?

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,960
You have to let His Majesty feel deep pain.

108
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Now he's completely into you.

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,560
You just need to do one thing:

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,880
to use his love and break his heart.

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
Let him see you

112
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
be close to another man

113
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,680
so that he hates you.

114
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,520
Then he'll finish experiencing his misfortune of love.

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
He's not the one who's experiencing the misfortune.

116
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
I am.

117
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
You can say that.

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
But there is nothing we can do about it, Your Highness.

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,880
You should make your mind.

120
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,080
Don't forget

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
His Majesty couldn't regain his strength

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,440
if he fails to experience his misfortune.

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Then the vast universe

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,960
will undergo a greater calamity.

125
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Do you have any good idea?

126
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Prepare some jewelry

127
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
and go to Yue Hua Palace with me.

128
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,980
Yue Hua Palace?

129
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,840
I'll go to see Madam Jiu in the name of returning favor

130
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,480
and see if I can get some information

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,760
from her.

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
Madam Jiu is lively by nature,

133
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
but she's not stupid.

134
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,880
I don't think she'd tell us anything useful.

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,920
That's why I got this.

136
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
What's special about the perfume satchel?

137
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
This perfume satchel

138
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,240
is a precious thing Mr. Nie gave to me.

139
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,800
It smells like sweet-scented Osmanthus,

140
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
but something with a special fragrance is included.

141
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
As long as Madam Jiu accepts it

142
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,280
and puts it in her palace for a few hours,

143
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,360
the smell will be part of her.

144
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Then we can track her by following the smell.

145
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
Unbelievable.

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Mr. Nie is amazing.

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
I'd been staying in my palace to regain my health,

148
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
so I didn't visit you.

149
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm ashamed to say that

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
it's the first time I came here

151
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,240
since you became a madam.

152
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,600
I should've visited you earlier.

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,080
Don't say that.

154
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
What matters most is to regain health.

155
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,440
Are you feeling better?

156
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,920
Thank you.

157
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
It's all healed up.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,960
During the period when I was sick,

159
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
I ignored a lot of things

160
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,680
that happened in the imperial palace.

161
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm wondering what you've been busy with.

162
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
Something really happened here,

163
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,920
but there is nothing important.

164
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Admiring the beauty of flowers, going for a walk

165
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
and keeping His Majesty in company. That's all I do.

166
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
With your company beside His Majesty,

167
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
I'm much relieved.

168
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,920
You're lively by nature.

169
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,800
His Majesty will laugh more when he's with you.

170
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,960
Oh.

171
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,120
Have you gone hunting with His Majesty lately?

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,840
His Majesty is busy with public affairs and hasn't gone out.

173
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,920
Really?

174
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,920
You can put it forward.

175
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,200
It'll do good to His Majesty's health.

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,920
Thank you for your advice.

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,400
Your palace

178
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,480
looks unadorned.

179
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,760
Look.

180
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,640
You don't wear much jewelry.

181
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,680
As a girl,

182
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,200
you should focus more on your appearance.

183
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
Sounds reasonable.

184
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
I'm just used to that.

185
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,120
I seldom wear jewelry at ordinary times.

186
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
I know what you're like.

187
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,120
But you're a madam.

188
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,400
It's a different case nowadays.

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
I've taken

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,440
some gifts to you although they're not precious.

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
I hope you'll like them.

192
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,600
Ling Xiang.

193
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,920
You're too modest.

194
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
You said they were not precious,

195
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,560
but I think they are very valuable.

196
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,080
What I did doesn't deserve this.

197
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
I can't accept it.

198
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,480
I see.

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
His Majesty has given you lots of good stuff,

200
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,880
so you look down upon it,

201
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,120
but it's a gift for you as my good wishes.

202
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,120
Besides,

203
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,640
when I was ill,

204
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
you went to see me

205
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,240
and had lots of tonics sent to me.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,120
I have to return your kindness.

207
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Please don't say that.

208
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,600
Okay. I won't make things difficult for you.

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,840
But there are two things

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
I've taken here from the State of Chong'an.

211
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,040
Xiaojiu, look.

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,840
This is a green jade necklace.

213
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,280
And this.

214
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
It's a perfume satchel that
can keep mosquitoes at bay.

215
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Sister, you have to take these two things.

216
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,800
If you don't,

217
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,080
it'll really make me humiliated.

218
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
Thank you.

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,600
I'll take them.

220
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,920
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

221
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,560
A flood happened in the south.

222
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,080
It's very serious.

223
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll have to

224
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,520
discuss countermeasures with ministers later.

225
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm afraid I won't be available in the coming days,

226
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,880
so I'll leave the Emperor's Tomb thing to you.

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
I'll try my best to share your worries

228
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,560
and complete the mechanisms as soon as possible.

229
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
Qingti is there.

230
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,640
You'll be safe.

231
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,800
Got it.

232
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,280
Your Majesty, don't get yourself too tired.

233
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,880
Take good care of yourself.

234
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,480
Don't worry.

235
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to the Emperor's Tomb now.

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,280
Go ahead.

237
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,720
Your Highness.

238
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,200
There are no outsiders here.

239
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Just call me Xiaojiu.

240
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,200
It really panics me.

241
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,520
How dare I do that?

242
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
Why not?

243
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,920
We even drank together.

244
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,360
And we called each other bros.

245
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Why can't you do that now?

246
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,040
I was stupid and ignorant

247
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,600
so that I acted wildly at that time.

248
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,360
Now as a madam,

249
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,560
you're much superior to me.

250
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,280
I have to think about our status.

251
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,440
Superior? Status?

252
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,160
I never care about that.

253
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,120
Besides,

254
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,200
as a general,

255
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,840
you're also a real man who's brave and battlewise.

256
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
Why do you rigidly adhere to

257
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
such old rules about status and rank?

258
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
When I was just a team leader,

259
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
you never put on airs as if I was inferior to you.

260
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,680
Why do you care about it now?

261
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,680
Are you looking down upon me?

262
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm going in.

263
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
It turns out it's here.

264
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800
Your Highness! What's up?

265
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,520
Your Highness!

266
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,320
Are you injured?

267
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,280
No.

268
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,600
Let's get out of here first.

269
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,350
Drink some alcohol to get over the shock.

270
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,480
You even have alcohol with you
when you're on duty here.

271
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,160
This is my only hobby.

272
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,720
Thank you for saving me.

273
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,310
Don't say that.

274
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,440
You also saved my life.

275
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,040
Besides, it's my duty

276
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
to keep you safe.

277
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,560
If anything happens to you,

278
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,560
I couldn't afford to take
the responsibility even if I die.

279
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,440
It's not that serious.

280
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,040
The underground palace is full of traps. It's dangerous.

281
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
You shouldn't had come here alone.

282
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm here to set up mechanisms.

283
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,360
It happened because of my carelessness.

284
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't know what has happened

285
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
to the entrance of the mausoleum.

286
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,960
I'll figure it out later.

287
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,840
You can't go on taking the risk

288
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,240
and checking the mechanisms in the secret tunnels.

289
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't worry.

290
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,520
If I'm careful enough,

291
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
those things couldn't hurt me.

292
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,640
Come on. Cheers.

293
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,440
Your Highness,

294
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
how can I...

295
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,840
I've told you numerous times.

296
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,880
Don't call me "Your Highness" when nobody else is here.

297
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,280
Don't think yourself inferior to me.

298
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,840
But I...

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,120
Alright. Stop.

300
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Do you want to drink or not?

301
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,760
I...

302
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
That's better.

303
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,160
I hope to drink with you as before.

304
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,120
At that time, I didn't know...

305
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,520
...you're a girl.

306
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,520
Obviously,

307
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
you have little experience with girls.

308
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
Why don't you get married?

309
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,720
I was born in a family with roots in the military.

310
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
Most of men died fighting on the battlefield,

311
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,320
leaving their wives widowed.

312
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,320
Those of equal status

313
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,920
wouldn't marry their daughters into our family.

314
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Why do they have to be of equal social rank?

315
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
I don't think a couple has to be well-matched
in social and economic status.

316
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,480
There is no big difference

317
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,760
between officials and ordinary people.

318
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,520
I'm sure some of them would be happy

319
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,480
to marry Duke Yongning.

320
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,880
It makes sense.

321
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640
I don't care much about

322
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,080
a girl's family background.

323
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,960
It's just I was garrisoned at the border

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,040
and I have to be responsible
for the safety of the imperial palace,

325
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,760
so I've never thought about getting married.

326
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,720
Besides,

327
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
I've never fallen in love with anyone.

328
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,360
I can see that

329
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,480
you'll be loyal

330
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
and passionate

331
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,320
once you're into someone.

332
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,360
You'll do anything for her.

333
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,920
Maybe.

334
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,800
No. That's for sure.

335
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,280
As for this aspect, we're the same kind of person.

336
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,360
Really?

337
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,560
Are you willing to do anything for a man

338
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
once you fall in love with him?

339
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,520
Thank you.

340
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,960
Luckily, those arrows are not poisoned.

341
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Be more careful next time.

342
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,480
I didn't think too much.

343
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,240
I just wanted to find out more information.

344
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,320
There is an underground palace
in the Emperor's Tomb.

345
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
Mechanisms are set up in the secret tunnels.

346
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,400
Obviously, it's unusual.

347
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,600
Do you mean...

348
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,200
In my opinion,

349
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,640
Lingbi Stone is most likely to be hidden there.

350
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Lingbi Stone?

351
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
I fell in love with a man

352
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,520
and did a lot of stupid things for him.

353
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,520
Even if he never responded

354
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,920
and I got heartbroken

355
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,760
after being hurt over and over again,

356
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I've never regretted.

357
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,800
I don't know all of this

358
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,400
Perhaps I'm just that kind of person.

359
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,080
I can't believe there is even a man who'd let you get hurt.

360
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
He must be very stupid.

361
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,600
Now that you said

362
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,840
you loved him,

363
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,120
why do you treat His Majesty...

364
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,160
Um.

365
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,320
I...

366
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Don't say anything.

367
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,200
I see.

368
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,400
It's offensive for me to ask you about that.

369
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,320
Come on.

370
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,440
Drink.

371
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,800
Forget about what I said after you drink it.

372
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Xiaojiu,

373
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,440
it's me that took you to the imperial palace.

374
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,200
If you're not happy,

375
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,560
I'll help you.

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
Will you do anything for me?

377
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,680
Put it there.

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Handle with care.

379
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,720
Put it here.

380
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Put this one here too.

381
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,360
Put it in order.

382
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,120
Wan, your timing is not good.

383
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,600
It's a mess in my palace.

384
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Please don't laugh at me.

385
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,720
Xiaojiu, what are you doing?

386
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,760
Are you moving to another palace?

387
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
A flood happened in the south.

388
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,800
His Majesty is burning with anxiety.

389
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,440
I want to do something to share his worries,

390
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,320
so I asked them

391
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,000
to collect everything that's valuable.

392
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,240
You really care about the common people

393
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,600
and His Majesty.

394
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,680
I'm so muddle-headed

395
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,480
as not to think of that.

396
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,800
Ling Xiang,

397
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,400
Xiaojiu has set a good example.

398
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,560
Let's do as she did when we go back.

399
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,280
Got it.

400
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,120
Wan, it's a mess here.

401
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Let's go to the inner room.

402
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,360
Are you here

403
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,680
to discuss something with me?

404
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,000
There is nothing special.

405
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
I just want to chat with you.

406
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,320
His Majesty has been tied up with official business,

407
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,960
utterly exhausted from overwork.

408
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't think it's good to go to him at this time,

409
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,960
so I'm here to see you.

410
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,840
I've heard over 30 prefectures

411
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,400
and over ten counties have been affected by flood.

412
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,040
The situation is serious.

413
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm really worried about it.

414
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,080
You used to live among the people,

415
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
so you know well about their hardships.

416
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,080
Oh.

417
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,600
I've heard the State of Chengyu

418
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,280
has a national treasure.

419
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,120
I think it's called...

420
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Lingbi Stone.

421
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,320
It's said it can resist the enemy

422
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,560
and exorcise evil spirits.

423
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,840
It can also make country to run well.

424
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,400
Have you heard of that?

425
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,560
Of course I have,

426
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,160
but I don't know it's so magical.

427
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,480
I must've been wrongly informed.

428
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,920
The farther away it is,

429
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,500
the more greatly the rumor will be exaggerated.

430
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,160
But,

431
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
it's definitely true that Lingbi Stone is a gift from the Heaven.

432
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,680
Xiaojiu,

433
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,480
I think it'll be helpful for people in flooded areas

434
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
if His Majesty holds a sacrificial ceremony

435
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,200
with Lingbi Stone.

436
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,720
Really?

437
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,200
What...

438
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,280
What to do?

439
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
Wan, just sit here and wait.

440
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,240
I'll go and see what has happened.

441
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,800
Okay.

442
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,160
Xiaojiu, what's up?

443
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
Nothing special.

444
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,720
A maid broke a vase.

445
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
Before I said anything,

446
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,960
she started to cry.

447
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,320
Then I had to comfort her.

448
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,080
As your servant,

449
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,800
she should've been more careful.

450
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,400
She must've become as careless as me

451
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,000
after staying with me for a long time.

452
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,720
You're really kind-hearted.

453
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,480
But you should be stricter sometimes.

454
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,680
I'll ask you for advice

455
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,240
some other day.

456
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,520
You can come to me anytime.

457
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
I've stayed here for some time.

458
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,480
I'd better leave you be.

459
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
Okay. Let me see you out.

460
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,080
Ling Xiang,

461
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,640
you did a good job about the vase.

462
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,080
I just did as you said.

463
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,320
You asked me to make some noise

464
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
to divert Madam Jiu's attention.

465
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,400
I happened to see a maid

466
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
hold several vases in her arms.

467
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
On a sudden inspiration,

468
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,920
I flipped the walnut in my hand secretly

469
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,560
which, as expected, made a vase broken.

470
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,640
Good.

471
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,160
You took out the drawing of Lingbi Stone

472
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,840
made by Mr. Nie as soon as you came back.

473
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,040
Did you find any important clue?

474
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,880
When Madam Jiu went out

475
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,400
after hearing the noise,

476
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,360
I found an abandoned spitball on the floor.

477
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,320
It's a drawing of Lingbi Stone on the paper.

478
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,480
Great.

479
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,480
It means Madam Jiu has seen Lingbi Stone.

480
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
There is no doubt.

481
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,240
We may reasonably conclude

482
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,280
it's hidden in the underground palace.

483
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,880
Exactly.

484
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,920
I'll go find it out tonight.

485
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,760
Tonight?

486
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,480
I think it's too hasty.

487
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,880
We should tell Mr. Nie

488
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,280
about it first

489
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,480
and wait for his instructions.

490
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,440
Your Highness,

491
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
His Majesty and Madam Jiu are setting up mechanisms.

492
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,480
It's the perfect timing to take actions.

493
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,840
They'd finish doing that

494
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
when we get a reply from Mr. Nie.

495
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,160
Then it'll be extremely hard

496
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
for us to enter the Emperor's Tomb.

497
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,960
But...

498
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,080
Your Highness, this matter shouldn't be delayed.

499
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,280
Don't let such an opportunity slip.

500
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,840
We can't hesitate anymore.

501
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,720
Ling Xiang,

502
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,280
if you have to go there tonight,

503
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,120
be careful and cautious.

504
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
You don't need to succeed this time,

505
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,640
but make sure you don't alert them.

506
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,880
Got it.

507
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
You get up early and go to bed late. You must be tired.

508
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm fine.

509
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
The masses become destitute and homeless.

510
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,160
They really suffer a lot.

511
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,440
But

512
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,240
Your Majesty, in the long run,

513
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,880
you have to take care of yourself.

514
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,200
Luckily, the trouble has blown over.

515
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,480
It really took me a lot of time and energy.

516
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
How is it going with the Emperor's Tomb?

517
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,480
Her Highness Jiu worked overnight

518
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,200
and it's almost been finished.

519
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,680
Tell His Majesty I want to see him.

520
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,280
Got it.

521
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,080
After commenting on these memorials,

522
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,480
I'll go to see her.

523
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,560
Your Majesty, Her Highness Jiu wants to see you.

524
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,160
Let her in.

525
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,200
Summon Madam Jiu.

526
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,960
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

527
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,320
It's rare

528
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,320
that you came to me.

529
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,000
I have something to report to you.

530
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,000
It's just

531
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,560
you've been busy with the flooding issue,

532
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,080
so I didn't dare to bother you the other day.

533
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,000
I pay respects to Your Highness Jiu.

534
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,800
It's a good thing that General Ye is also here.

535
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm finished reporting. Your subordinate takes his leave.

536
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,600
Okay.

537
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,280
Hold on.

538
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,080
General Ye can be of help if he stays.

539
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,040
His Majesty arrives!

540
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,520
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

541
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,400
You're still awake.

542
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,160
Yeah.

543
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,600
You look shocked

544
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
to see me.

545
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
No. It's a pleasant surprise.

546
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,440
Let's go in.

547
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,280
Your Majesty,

548
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
I've always prepared

549
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,000
the tea you like in my palace.

550
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,320
You're considerate.

551
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,160
Xiaojiu mentioned it several times.

552
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,160
She asked me to come and see you,

553
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,200
but pitifully, I was too busy.

554
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,440
Nowadays, the flooding issue has come to an end.

555
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,200
I've finally got time to come here.

556
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,920
It's just a slight illness.

557
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,160
National affairs are more important.

558
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,080
Congratulations on removing the flooding risk.

559
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,640
How are you feeling?

560
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,840
I'm fully recovered.

561
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
I went to see Xiaojiu twice,

562
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,520
but I didn't dare to bother you.

563
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,120
Oh.

564
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,040
I had my palace cleaned up

565
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,120
and collected some clothes.

566
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,560
I've sent them to the National Treasury

567
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,040
to do my bit for people in stricken areas.

568
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,600
Good.

569
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,120
You're kind-hearted and merciful.

570
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,240
Imperial Concubine Wan, you're sensible.

571
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
She really cares about the masses.

572
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,760
She once asked me to suggest

573
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,360
you hold a sacrificial ceremony with Lingbi Stone

574
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,080
to control floods.

575
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,400
Really?

576
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,720
It's just an immature suggestion.

577
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,760
Please don't laugh at me.

578
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,520
How did you know

579
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,960
Lingbi Stone can be used for a sacrificial ceremony?

580
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,600
It's just a wild guess.

581
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,360
I've heard Lingbi Stone is a gift from the Heaven.

582
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,400
I know little about it,

583
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,400
so I'm a little curious.

584
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
That'd be great

585
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,160
if it's true.

586
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,560
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

587
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,080
I don't understand.

588
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,960
Oh.

589
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,360
Where is your personal maid?

590
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,840
She always followed you.

591
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,560
Where is she?

592
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,680
Do you mean Ling Xiang?

593
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,880
I asked her to go out and get some clothes,

594
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,480
but I don't know why she hasn't been back.

595
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,960
I'm also worried.

596
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,600
I was waiting for her in the backyard.

597
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,600
You don't know where she has been?

598
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,560
I don't.

599
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,600
Your Majesty,

600
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,480
did anything happen to Ling Xiang?

601
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,480
How could I know if you don't know about that?

602
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,710
Imperial Concubine Wan,

603
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,600
I haven't heard you play the Qin for long.

604
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,280
Play a tune for me.

605
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,080
Got it.

606
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,320
You just played half of it. Why did you stop?

607
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,840
You came here

608
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,920
not to listen to a tune

609
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,920
but to ask me some questions, right?

610
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,080
I prefer a tune

611
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
to your lies.

612
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,880
It's not easy

613
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,040
to tell truth from lies.

614
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,440
There is no need to do that.

615
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,960
I just focus on facts.

616
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,800
I caught Ling Xiang in the act in the Emperor's Tomb.

617
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,320
Do you still want to make excuses?

618
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,720
I wanted to have a look at Lingbi Stone

619
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,640
out of curiosity.

620
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
I deserve to die ten thousand deaths,

621
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,560
but Her Highness knew nothing about it.

622
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,160
I don't want to hear what you say!

623
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,040
I want to hear Imperial Concubine Wan's explanation.

624
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,440
You've had a conclusion.

625
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,240
What do you want me to say?

626
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,640
Did you also think

627
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,240
Madam Jiu was telling lies

628
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,280
when she couldn't prove her innocence?

629
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,000
I've caught her.

630
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,840
How dare you compare yourself to her?

631
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,720
Your Majesty,

632
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,880
it doesn't matter.

633
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Let me say to her.

634
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,640
This perfume satchel is a gift from you.

635
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,280
There is something you don't know.

636
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,920
I'm very sensitive to smells.

637
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
As long as you sent it to me,

638
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,960
I found there is another kind of fragrance

639
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,280
besides the smell of sweet-scented Osmanthus

640
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
on the surface.

641
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,560
It's a faint smell,

642
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
but it'll linger on for a long time

643
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,280
as long as it's attached to the body.

644
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,280
I didn't think too much at that time.

645
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,200
But after that,

646
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,000
this arrow was shot from the mechanisms,

647
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,520
which were triggered by someone.

648
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,040
I had thought something went
wrong with the mechanisms,

649
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,400
but then I found a blood stain

650
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,360
on the arrow.

651
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,280
It's at that time that I knew

652
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,640
someone tried to break in.

653
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,320
I didn't know who it was,

654
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,480
so I didn't tell anyone about it.

655
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,600
But I guessed the whole story
when you came to see me

656
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,920
and mentioned Lingbi Stone that day.

657
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,080
Speaking of the spitball,

658
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,600
you're smart.

659
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,880
After looking at it, you put it back

660
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,360
instead of taking it away.

661
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,120
But you may not know

662
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,160
everyone balls paper up in a different way.

663
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,120
Later, I observed it carefully

664
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,800
and finally realized what's going on.

665
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,960
Thinking of Lingbi Stone,

666
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
the spitball,

667
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,920
the arrow

668
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,320
and the perfume satchel,

669
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,880
I understand everything.

670
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,800
You and Ling Xiang are the ones

671
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,520
who tried in every way to steal Lingbi Stone.

672
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,160
Your Highness Jiu, you're thoughtful

673
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
and full of resources.

674
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
I have no regrets

675
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,880
about being defeated by you.

676
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,480
But

677
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,360
I'm the only one

678
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,440
that tried to steal Lingbi Stone.

679
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm also the one who told Her Highness
to send you the perfume satchel.

680
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,240
Her Highness knew nothing about it.

681
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,640
It's all my fault.

682
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,920
I'll kill myself to atone for my crime.

683
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,200
Ling Xiang!

684
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,800
Ling Xiang.

685
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,120
Ling Xiang.

686
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,120
Ling Xiang took all the blame

687
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,880
and killed herself. She's a loyal maid.

688
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,880
But it's such a serious matter.

689
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,120
How could she take all the blame?

690
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,760
If you tell me the truth,

691
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll spare your life

692
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,600
for old times' sake.

693
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,840
For old times' sake?

694
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,280
You haven't come here until tonight

695
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,000
just because you have no feelings for me.

696
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,600
Your Majesty,

697
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,840
you've never been in love with me, right?

698
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,320
You're still impenitent.

699
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,280
Put her into prison.

700
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,520
Got it.

701
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,600
What? Imperial Concubine Wan was imprisoned?

702
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,200
She and her maid

703
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,400
were caught by His Majesty and Ye Qingti

704
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,000
when they tried to steal Lingbi Stone.

705
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,520
Has she been executed?

706
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,120
She's just been imprisoned.

707
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,760
Keep a close eye on it.

708
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,080
Kill her to prevent divulgence of our secrets

709
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,080
once you have a chance.

710
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,240
Got it.

711
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,600
Are you here to laugh at me?

712
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,120
Sorry

713
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,600
for letting you down.

714
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,720
I'm here just to talk to you.

715
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,160
You're a winner

716
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,600
and I'm a loser.

717
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,120
I have nothing to talk to you.

718
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,520
There is no winner or loser.

719
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,400
Both of us

720
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,480
are just fooled by fate.

721
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,640
You've won the favor of His Majesty.

722
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,120
You're blessed.

723
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Ji Heng,

724
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,840
have you really forgotten everything?

725
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,680
Ji Heng?

726
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,600
Ji Heng,

727
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,640
you've lost your memories, right?

728
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,240
Even Ling Xiang has no idea about that.

729
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,560
How did you know?

730
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,520
Who on earth are you?

731
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,560
Have you seen

732
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,680
the me in the past?

733
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,360
Why did you want to steal Lingbi Stone?

734
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,360
It's my savior's wish.

735
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,880
Of course I'd try my best to fulfill it.

736
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,200
It turns out you also did that
to pay a debt of gratitude.

737
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,920
Who is your savior?

738
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,000
If you don't tell me,

739
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,480
how could I get you out of trouble?

740
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,560
Why do you want to help me?

741
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,760
As you said,

742
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,640
you didn't know the me in the past.

743
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,400
We know each other.

744
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,440
Besides, to pay a debt of gratitude,

745
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,480
I also did something that I didn't mean to do.

746
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,120
If you tell us the one behind all this,

747
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,760
His Majesty will let you go.

748
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:07,920
Madam Jiu,

749
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,920
don't waste your time.

750
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,440
I'll never

751
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,680
betray my savior.

752
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,800
Ji Heng.

753
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,120
I know it's hard to convince you within a short time,

754
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,760
but you have to understand

755
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,120
it doesn't matter

756
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,840
if you've lost your memories or not.

757
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,840
You always belong to yourself.

758
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,400
Don't be used by others.
