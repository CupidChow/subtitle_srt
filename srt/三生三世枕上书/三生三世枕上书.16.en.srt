1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 16

3
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Hurry up.

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,880
Hurry up.

5
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Hurry up.

6
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,280
Are you fond of what I've awarded you?

7
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,400
Your Majesty.

8
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,280
It seems

9
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,560
you aren't fond of them.

10
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,440
Thanks for your preference, Your Majesty.

11
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,920
But I'm used to the simplicity of country life,

12
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,040
so I don't like these from the bottom of my heart.

13
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,960
I know it.

14
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,280
You're not the same as ordinary women.

15
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,840
But you've been entitled to Madam now,

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,800
and your spending on food and clothing has sharply increased.

17
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,920
You used to live in poverty.

18
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Simplicity doesn't mean poverty.

19
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
And what you've awarded me

20
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,920
has gone far beyond what a Madam should have, hasn't it?

21
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,160
I want to show you how much I care for you.

22
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,400
You can regard them as the compensation for you being wronged.

23
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,160
If Your Majesty does treat me with your heart,

24
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,720
please withdraw all these rewards.

25
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Are you still mad at me?

26
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,840
I dare not.

27
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm really wronged,

28
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
but Your Majesty has

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,800
cleared the name for me,

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,680
and even entitled me to Madam.

31
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,840
How come I'm still mad at Your Majesty?

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,000
The why do you always feel down

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,280
and avoid me?

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm used to the unfettered life,

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,760
and I haven't adapted to the life of being a Madam.

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,320
It's because of the way I'm made

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,880
that I can't change the lifestyle

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
for a while.

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,080
So I'm asking a favor of Your Majesty

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,000
to withdraw all these rewards.

41
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,800
If I keep all these rewards in the Yue Hua Palace

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,240
I'll feel more uncomfortable.

43
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,480
Then you're not mad at me anymore?

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm not mad at Your Majesty.

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,880
What do you want?

46
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Holding your hand...

47
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,840
What's the second part?

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,800
I remember Aunt feels happy every time

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
when Uncle says these words to her.

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,360
Holding your hand...

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,640
And living a happy life with you till our hairs turn gray.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
As you wish.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,640
Withdraw all of them.

54
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,520
Yes.

55
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
Quick. Quick. Quick. Withdraw all.

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
Keep the censer.

57
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Move.

58
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,360
Hurry up.

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,920
Your Majesty.

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
I made the incense in person,

61
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,200
and I also selected the censer for you.

62
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,120
Do you like it?

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
Your Majesty made it in person?

64
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
I like it.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,720
This kind of reward is enough for me.

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,640
I'll protect you from now on.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,440
And I won't force you to do anything.

68
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,800
That Madam Jiu insisted on withdrawing all the rewards

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
once made His Majesty furious,

70
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,040
but in the end,

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
His Majesty still did what Madam Jiu wished.

72
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,000
It shows although Madam Jiu is raised in a humble home,

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,160
she is one of broad outlook.

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,880
She is either the kindest,

75
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,200
or the evilest.

76
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,680
You're right, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,840
I don't mean that I don't believe in Ren'er,

78
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,800
but once a man

79
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
falls in love with a woman,

80
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
he will always miss something important.

81
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
You're a bystander.

82
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,360
As far as you're concerned, which kind does Madam Jiu belong to?

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,240
Please forgive me for saying it out straight.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
Madam Jiu

85
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,680
is simple and innocent, which doesn't like pretending.

86
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
And...

87
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,840
Spill it out.

88
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll forgive you.

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,960
The great affection that His Majesty has for Madam Jiu

90
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,200
won't be less than

91
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
that Madam Jiu has for His Majesty.

92
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,320
If a woman

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,560
truly falls in love with a man,

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
she'll shun no difficulties and dangers,

95
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,560
and won't hesitate to sacrifice herself if needed.

96
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,960
As our servants can see,

97
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,560
what's happening can prove the saying...

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,800
Only envy of an affectionate couple but not being an immortal.

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,240
You're wise, You Majesty.

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
In those days, the late Empress Dowager

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,680
also scolded the sister and the late Emperor the same as I did.

102
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,040
I've never felt I'm getting old before.

103
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,960
I haven't expected

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,760
I've already followed what the late Empress Dowager did,

105
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
even though I'm not as aged as the late Empress Dowager.

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,200
Your Majesty worries about His Majesty

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,360
out of motherliness.

108
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,040
Now that you're saying so,

109
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm more relieved.

110
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,520
You go back first.

111
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
But remember,

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,920
always keep an eye on what's happening.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,120
If something goes wrong, report to me as soon as possible.

114
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

115
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,880
I, Ye Qingti, am bowing to Your Highness Jiu.

116
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,280
General, can we have a talk privately?

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,920
Keep going on patrol. I'll come later.

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,880
Yes.

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
I have something to tell you, Your Highness.

120
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,760
I have one thing to return to Your Highness.

121
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,320
Qingti,

122
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,720
thanks for what you've done to people

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,360
in our Yue Hua Palace.

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,760
I have nothing else to requite you

125
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
but these boxes of flower-made ointment.

126
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,960
Thanks, Your Highness.

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,880
You have to use it on time.

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
If it's not enough,

129
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,440
you can come to me.

130
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Please show me that you look in good health.

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,040
Yes.

132
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,520
Your Highness,

133
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,320
is the reason why you ask me to inquire
the patrol schedule of General Ye

134
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
to wait here

135
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,960
and send the flower-made ointment to General Ye?

136
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,960
Of course.

137
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,240
General Ye has saved our lives.

138
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,480
We have to requite him.

139
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Rest assured.

140
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
The three boxes of flower-made ointment

141
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
were sent in the name of Yue Hua Palace.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
His kindness to you can also be repaid.

143
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,800
Your Highness is so considerate.

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm worrying for...

145
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,080
For what?

146
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Forget it.

147
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Your Highness is frank. You might tease me.

148
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Spill it out or not?

149
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,840
I'll keep it. I'll keep it.

150
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
Your Highness,

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
I...

152
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm going to make preparation for your shower.

153
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Say it.

154
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,720
Your Highness, I'll keep it.

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,320
Say it.

156
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,080
I don't. I don't. Say it.

157
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,640
Muyun.

158
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,560
Your Majesty, where are we going?

159
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I'll take you to an important place

160
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,480
outside the Imperial Palace.

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,560
Where is it?

162
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,400
You'll know when we get there.

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:08,920
But...

164
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,040
Your Majesty,

165
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
Wan Yun Palace has sent someone to report just now

166
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,840
that Imperial Concubine Wan has been ill for several days.

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
Imperial Concubine Wan is sick?

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,560
Imperial Concubine Wan is sick,

169
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,400
so Your Majesty should go check on her.

170
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,280
But where we are going is also very important.

171
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,880
Life-and-death matter of

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
Imperial Concubine Wan outweighs that.

173
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
Fine. We'll go there another day.

174
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,880
But you have to escort me to the Wan Yun Palace.

175
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,040
Let's go.

176
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,760
His Majesty is coming.

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,840
Bow to Your Majesty.

178
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,400
Stop bowing.

179
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
Please forgive me for bowing on the bed.

180
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,560
I've heard you're sick.

181
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Xiaojiu and I are both worried about you.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,840
So we come to check on you especially.

183
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,760
Do you feel better, Sister?

184
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Thanks for your consideration, Your Majesty.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
Just minor illnesses.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm sorry to make Your Majesty and Madam Jiu worried.

187
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,000
I exclusively call Imperial Physician Hu

188
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,400
to check on you.

189
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,480
What's wrong?

190
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm incapable. The pulse manifestation
of Imperial Concubine Wan is strange.

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,040
I've never seen it in my entire life.

192
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
Is it that serious?

193
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,880
No, it's not.

194
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,560
I can't diagnose whether the disease is
serious or not from the pulse manifestation.

195
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm not sure...

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
What do you mean? Say it out loud.

197
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,880
The pulse has no rhythm.

198
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,800
It changes all the time, sometimes fast while sometimes slow.

199
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,360
It also shows the subtle sign of deeply poisoned,

200
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,520
but Imperial Concubine Wan hasn't showed any other symptom,

201
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,160
which means she isn't poisoned.

202
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm incapable of diagnosing anyway.

203
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,800
Please, please forgive my incompetence, Your Majesty.

204
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,520
Ji Heng belongs to the Demon Clan.

205
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,600
It's sure that her pulse manifestation
is different from that of the ordinary.

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,120
Your medical skill ranks the first

207
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,760
among imperial physicians.

208
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,040
You can't even diagnose the disease, can you?

209
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

210
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,680
I know how I feel myself.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,080
I just get a cold.

212
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,200
I'll be fine with two days of rest.

213
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,040
I hope so.

214
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,840
Since you have checked on her,

215
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,640
give a prescription.

216
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Yes. Your Majesty.

217
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm going to make up the prescription for opsonization.

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,920
It's because Imperial Physician Hu is getting old

219
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,480
that makes his medical skill less outstanding than before.

220
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,480
Otherwise, I call some other imperial physicians

221
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,560
to check on you.

222
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
Don't bother, Your Majesty.

223
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,680
Thanks for your consideration, Your Majesty.

224
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,320
Could I ask for one day or two rest?

225
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
I might be fine soon.

226
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,560
If I don't feel better after two days off

227
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,960
or I'm not cured,

228
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,040
I might call the consultation of imperial physicians as well.

229
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,640
That makes sense.

230
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,080
Xiaojiu, let's leave first

231
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,920
to allow Imperial Concubine Wan to have a good rest.

232
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,040
If you're satisfied with the prescription
that Imperial Physician Hu gives,

233
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,080
then have a try.

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,720
Let it go, if not.

235
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Yes. Your Majesty.

236
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,800
Then I will visit you another day, Sister.

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,720
Thanks, Madam Jiu.

238
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Now you're granted noble status,

239
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
you'd better call me Younger Sister.

240
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,080
That won't cause the misunderstanding of status.

241
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
Feel free from overelaborate etiquette, since you're sick.

242
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,480
Have a good rest.

243
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,680
I and Xiaojiu will look up you another day.

244
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,920
Your Highness,

245
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,920
what nonsense does Imperial Physician Hu talk?

246
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,720
We might call him Imperial Physician Nonsense as well.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,880
What the imperial physician says is true.

248
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,640
The pulse manifestation of mine is strange,

249
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,240
which Mr. Nie also said earlier.

250
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,160
He also said I'm born like this, so there's no need to worry.

251
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,760
That explains the matter.

252
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,120
Then I'll feel more relieved.

253
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,080
Have you noticed

254
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,840
how His Majesty looked at Madam Jiu?

255
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,720
I haven't noticed that,

256
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,440
because I was scared of

257
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,920
what that Imperial Physician Nonsense was saying.

258
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
In short,

259
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,040
no one can be compared with Madam Jiu

260
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,280
in the heart of His Majesty.

261
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,640
So it's impossible

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,560
to get Lingbi Stone

263
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
by winning the affection of His Majesty.

264
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
You don't have to give up so soon, Your Highness.

265
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,200
Maybe there's other favorable turn.

266
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,560
Your Majesty, here we are.

267
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,880
Come on.

268
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,760
Qingti,

269
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,480
wait for us here.

270
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,120
Yes. Your Majesty.

271
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,480
I haven't imagined there is a ground palace

272
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,280
under the Emperor's Tomb.

273
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,600
The construction of the Emperor's Tomb

274
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,840
is merely a cover.

275
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
What truly matters is the building
of mechanisms in the ground palace.

276
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,640
Each tunnel has its own mechanism.

277
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,520
On the right corner of wall

278
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,600
is the control switch of a mechanism.

279
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,280
You have to keep it in mind

280
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
to protect yourself from being hurt.

281
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,440
These mechanisms are extremely simple.

282
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,840
I can remember it with a glance.

283
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,480
So smart of you!

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,760
It's comfortable,

285
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,760
Your Majesty.

286
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,200
I'm so sorry to be impolite in front of Your Majesty.

287
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,070
Let's go.

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
Bai Fengjiu,

289
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
control yourself.

290
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,880
If you hinder His Majesty from
experiencing the romance misfortune,

291
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,920
you won't be able to make it up no matter how hard you try.

292
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,560
It's strange.

293
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,680
Why is the smell of the stone

294
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,520
so similar to that of the soul-locking jade?

295
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
Hadn't the soul-locking jade been broken

296
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,120
when we broke through the Ten-evil Lotus Land?

297
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,920
Xiaojiu,

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
this is the national treasure,

299
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,480
Lingbi Stone.

300
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
It's Lingbi Stone.

301
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
When the State of Chengyu was originally founded,

302
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,480
deceased grandfather led the troops
to resist the foreign enemies.

303
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,520
When he was driven to the last ditch,

304
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,480
the stone fell down from the sky and saved deceased grandfather.

305
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,800
After deceased grandfather repulsed the enemy troops,

306
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,160
he named the stone Lingbi Stone

307
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
and regarded it as the national treasure.

308
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,880
Falling down from the sky?

309
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,960
Isn't it the soul-locking jade belonging to His Majesty?

310
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,520
What a magical Lingbi Stone!

311
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
To prevent others from coveting the stone,

312
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,160
only the emperors of his generation

313
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
can know where it's located.

314
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
You're the only who gets to see the treasure

315
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
except for emperors.

316
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,120
Thank Your Majesty for trusting me, which I'll remember forever.

317
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,320
See.

318
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,960
Is Lingbi Stone giving out light when it's touched?

319
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,440
Not exactly.

320
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,760
It didn't give out light when my father touched it.

321
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,120
And my father said it hadn't given out light either

322
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,840
when deceased grandfather touched it.

323
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,080
But it did give out light

324
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,160
when I touched it for the first time.

325
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,240
Father said it was destiny.

326
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,280
It's God who allows me to protect Lingbi Stone.

327
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
Maybe it's because the soul-locking jade

328
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
originally belongs to you, Your Majesty.

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,760
Your Majesty is the one chosen by God,

330
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,400
who definitely can burden the
responsibility for defending the stone.

331
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,840
Xiaojiu,

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,400
have a try.

333
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,880
I dare not.

334
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Only Your Majesty can touch it.

335
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,320
How dare I?

336
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
Certainly you can, since I allow you.

337
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,320
Have a try.

338
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,200
It's unbelievable.

339
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,320
Why can I make it flash?

340
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,560
It's doomed.

341
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,280
It can't be wiser than I take you here.

342
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,760
You're the one who is sent by God

343
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,920
to assist me in defending Lingbi Stone.

344
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,520
How am I qualified to

345
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,160
assist Your Majesty in defending Lingbi Stone together?

346
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
Is it because of what happened in the Ten-evil Lotus Land?

347
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,080
So it can recognize me as well.

348
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
Then it should be able to recognize Ji Heng.

349
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,080
In fact, why I take you here

350
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
is not only to let you see Lingbi Stone

351
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
but also ask you to

352
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,840
help repair the mechanisms in the secret chamber.

353
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,160
Mechanisms?

354
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,440
Since the last harsh battle,

355
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
I always have an idea in mind.

356
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,640
I intend to not only repair the decadent and quondam mechanisms,

357
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,920
but also build a new set of

358
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
stronger ones.

359
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,040
The most important link of the new set is

360
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,040
to make the whole ground palace collapse, once it is triggered,

361
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,640
which can ensure the safety of Lingbi Stone.

362
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,120
It makes sense.

363
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,480
But I always have a variety of problems

364
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,400
and difficulties.

365
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
When you present me the design of short knife,

366
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,080
I especially consulted it for reference.

367
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,160
And I've made a major breakthrough.

368
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,160
But

369
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
I still have something difficult to figure out.

370
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,520
So what I can do is ask a favor of you.

371
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,840
I'll definitely do my utmost,

372
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
since Your Majesty trust me so much.

373
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,560
= Muning Hall =

374
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,880
Imperial Concubine Wan is coming.

375
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,080
Your Highness, His Majesty is not in the study now.

376
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,240
Where on earth is His Majesty going?

377
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,320
His Majesty goes wherever he wants to.

378
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
We don't dare to

379
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,760
ask at all.

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,440
Ling Xiang,

381
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,040
don't you know the manners?

382
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,560
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,040
Give the tureen to Eunuch Yang.

384
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,040
Eunuch Yang, thanks for the trouble.

385
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
If His Majesty is hungry when he comes back,

386
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,800
please heat the soup

387
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,120
and send it to His Majesty.

388
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,520
But if His Majesty doesn't come here,

389
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,520
or he doesn't want to have the soup,

390
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,480
then deal with it whatever you want.

391
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,680
As you wish, Your Highness.

392
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
I'm going back to my palace.

393
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,760
Ling Xiang,

394
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,320
it has been a while since you come to the imperial palace,

395
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,160
but why are you still so careless?

396
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,440
Those who serve His Majesty around

397
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,160
aren't easy to deal with, are they?

398
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,840
Especially Eunuch Yang,

399
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
his background is more complicated.

400
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,200
You have to be careful when you meet him later.

401
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,880
Your Highness, I was anxious

402
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,040
because I found His Majesty wasn't there

403
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,520
and Madam Jiu wasn't, either.

404
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
It's no surprising that

405
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,280
both His Majesty

406
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,120
and Madam Jiu aren't there.

407
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,720
Maybe they go traveling incognito,

408
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,080
or make a sightseeing tour.

409
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,120
What we have to do is to calm down.

410
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,960
Wait for our opportunity.

411
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,200
I think we have to make some adjustments here,

412
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:35,920
don't we?

413
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,360
Your Majesty,

414
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,600
we should modify this place.

415
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,360
All right.

416
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,840
Your Majesty,

417
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,560
the wood should be whittled into a cone.

418
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,720
No problem.

419
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,520
How gorgeous!

420
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
What's gorgeous?

421
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,560
It's you.

422
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,920
You Majesty,

423
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,880
what's up?

424
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,760
Let me have a look.

425
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm fine.

426
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:14,960
Just a small cut.

427
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,200
Is it called fine? You're bleeding.

428
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,920
I've told you to be careful, haven't I?

429
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,000
Is it

430
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,080
cotton rose ointment?

431
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,720
Yes, it is.

432
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,080
Luckily, I take some with me.

433
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,800
You're the first one who treats me this way.

434
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,440
It was urgent just now,

435
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,400
so I lost manners in front of Your Majesty.

436
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

437
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,000
I adore what you looked like just now so much.

438
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,800
I've never seen my mother,

439
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,040
but everyone says she's

440
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,080
the smartest and tenderest woman in the world.

441
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,880
Besides,

442
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,760
father and mother truly loved each other.

443
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,320
It's a pity that I've never witnessed

444
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,560
the way they're together.

445
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,200
But I guess

446
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,120
how mother treated father

447
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,520
must be like the way you treated me just now.

448
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,080
With both anger and worry.

449
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,360
You don't treat me as an emperor

450
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,880
but your closest husband.

451
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,360
Am I right?

452
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,400
Song Xuanren is just His Majesty's incarnation
in the mortal realm.

453
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,800
He's not His Majesty,

454
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,920
nor his rebirth.

455
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,400
He is just Song Xuanren.

456
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
And you are still Bai Fengjiu.

457
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,880
Your Majesty,

458
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,120
I suddenly come up with something.

459
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,240
There are still some points I can't figure out
on the design drawing.

460
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,120
It doesn't matter.

461
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,360
Take it easy.

462
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,880
We have enough time.

463
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,360
Your Majesty reads memorials to
the throne late in the night every day.

464
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,480
It's too hard.

465
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,720
You shall take good care of yourself.

466
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,360
As for these memorials to the throne,

467
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,120
if I don't read them for two days,

468
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,840
they will pile up.

469
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,680
If I don't read them,

470
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,720
will you do it for me?

471
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,560
Your Majesty is making fun of me.

472
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,040
How can I be qualified for the important job?

473
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,360
The moon looks beautiful tonight.

474
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,520
Yes.

475
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,400
It's rare to see such full moon,

476
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,040
and the sky is clear without a speck of cloud.

477
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,160
You send someone to notice Madam Jiu,

478
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,480
saying that I'm going to admire the moon in the Yue Hua Palace.

479
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,320
Yes.

480
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,920
What are you drawing?

481
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,040
Today His Majesty took me to the Emperor's Tomb.

482
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,440
And I saw the national treasure of their country, Lingbi Stone.

483
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,560
Why do you value so much

484
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,840
about a treasure in the mortal realm?

485
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,680
Because I think it looks like the soul-locking jade.

486
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
The soul-locking jade belongs to Emperor Dong Hua?

487
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,480
I do remember it has been broken

488
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,920
in the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

489
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,880
Maybe it just looks like.

490
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,240
Emperor Dong Hua is prestigious.

491
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,760
There are countless persons

492
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
who follow and imitate him during thousands of years.

493
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,280
It's no wonder

494
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,760
that several soul-locking jades are forged.

495
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,680
You're right.

496
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,440
Let it go.

497
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,560
Si Ming said Zhou Mengxi was dead.

498
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,800
Now you're experiencing the romance misfortune.

499
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,400
Don't mention it.

500
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,400
It's bothering me so much.

501
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,520
What do you think

502
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,160
can be counted as love in vain?

503
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,280
Listen. Let me teach you a lesson.

504
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,440
Say it out.

505
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,040
The so-called love in vain means

506
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,880
to make him fall in love but fail to get it.

507
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,560
So

508
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,520
attract him first, and then alienate him.

509
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Over and over.

510
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,640
It's done.

511
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,200
But just refusing and alienating him

512
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,400
will have made me go against my conscience.

513
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,280
Not to mention to attract him first, and then alienate him.

514
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
I can't do it at all.

515
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,720
Let me tell you.

516
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,480
If you alienate him all the time,

517
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
he will be downhearted and no longer show his love.

518
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,480
Then he will fail to experience the romance misfortune.

519
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,080
For men,

520
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,920
they always anxiously longing for

521
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,440
what they think they can obtain

522
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,440
but actually not.

523
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
But if I really do what you say,

524
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,360
it will be too miserable for His Majesty.

525
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,600
Miserable?

526
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,440
Bai Fengjiu,

527
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,080
have you forgotten how miserable

528
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,600
you were in the Tai Chen Palace that day?

529
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,760
Not to mention

530
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,160
that you're assisting him in experiencing the romance misfortune.

531
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,640
I get it.

532
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,640
You're promising to be taught.

533
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,080
Do you treat Lian Song this way?

534
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,240
Him?

535
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,440
I disdain to play some tricks on him.

536
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,960
You disdain to play tricks?

537
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,880
You're blushing.

538
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,880
You're the one who's blushing.

539
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,080
How can I blush? Look at yourself.

540
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,560
You really are blushing.

541
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,680
You, naughty girl!

542
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,440
You're the naughty one!

543
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,520
Your Highness.

544
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,600
Your Highness.

545
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,560
It's Muyun.

546
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,400
I'm leaving first.

547
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,120
Come in.

548
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,120
Your Highness,

549
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,920
I heard there seemed to be someone else in the room.

550
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,640
I'm reading the play and delivering an aside.

551
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
That's it.

552
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,800
What's up?

553
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Eunuch Yang has sent someone to leave the message,

554
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,240
saying His Majesty is coming to
the Yue Hua Palace to admire the moon.

555
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,320
Then you go make preparation for it.

556
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,400
Everything is ready.

557
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,560
Your Highness is the one who gets to make some preparations.

558
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,960
What should I prepare?

559
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,960
Dress up.

560
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,120
Why do Your Majesty suddenly want to admire the moon today?

561
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,960
It's full moon today.

562
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,520
Besides, the Yue Hua Palace

563
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,560
is the best place for admiring the moon.

564
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,240
So I come here.

565
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,560
Well,

566
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,600
I named the palace, Yue Hua Palace.

567
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,160
Your Majesty really gave a good name to the palace.

568
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,920
Well, Your Majesty,

569
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,480
how is the wound on your hand?

570
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,160
Much better. The scab is growing.

571
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,880
Use more cotton rose ointment,

572
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,400
and the scab can be removed.

573
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,400
Then it's cured.

574
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,280
Is it?

575
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,880
Muyun.

576
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,040
Allow me to apply it for Your Majesty.

577
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,600
You're tricky.

578
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,240
You're gorgeous.

579
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,840
The moon really looks pretty tonight.

580
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,320
Moonlight is shining, making the waves glittering.

581
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,480
What a beautiful name Your Majesty gave to the palace!

582
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,320
Since we're delighted today,

583
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,680
what about me playing a song for you?

584
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,720
Great. I'm all ears.

585
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,560
Your Majesty.

586
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,000
What about Crying Ospreys?

587
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,280

Xiaojiu.

610
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
Your Majesty, you wake up.

611
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,280
Xiaojiu.

612
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
Have some tea to sober up.

613
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Where is Madam Jiu?

614
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,240
Madam Jiu isn't here.

615
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,560
She is in the Yue Hua Palace.

616
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,760
Shouldn't I be in the Yue Hua Palace?

617
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
Your Majesty got drunk when admiring the moon and was comatose.

618
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,480
General Ye escorted you back.

619
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,040
Ye Qingti escorted me back?

620
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,040
Yes. Your Majesty.

621
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,440
Did Madam Jiu come with me?

622
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
No, she didn't.

623
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,960
Bow to Your Majesty.

624
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,880
Qingti,

625
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,840
did you escort me back the other day?

626
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Yes.

627
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Your Majesty got drunk and was comatose.

628
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
I happened to patrol to the Yue Hua Palace

629
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
and escorted Your Majesty back to your palace.

630
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,280
I didn't remember

631
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
anything about the drunk thing.

632
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,880
Did I talk some nonsense?

633
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Your Majesty was comatose

634
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
and didn't say anything.

635
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,520
Eunuch Yang and other eunuchs were all on site.

636
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
I don't dare to lie to you.

637
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,400
Relax, Qingti.

638
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,320
I'm just asking

639
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,880
and I don't mean to blame you.

640
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,200
Why I call you here today

641
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,920
is mainly to let you have a taste of this.

642
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,080
Roast sweet potatoes?

643
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,760
Have a try.

644
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,520
Please.

645
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,880
How is it?

646
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,000
It...

647
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,760
it's just an ordinary roast sweet potato.

648
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,960
I can't taste something different.

649
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,840
Then how does it taste, compared with ones you've eaten before?

650
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,760
I don't eat roast sweet potatoes often.

651
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,240
I can't tell the difference.

652
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,560
Then how is it, compared with ones you've roasted yourself?

653
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,040
I've never roasted a sweet potato in person.

654
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,480
You haven't roasted it before?

655
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,920
That's it.

656
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,920
It's fine. It's fine.

657
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,400
Come here. Give it to me.

658
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,480
Never roasted.

659
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,120
Come here.

660
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,160
Why does Your Majesty ask me this?

661
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,040
I've been

662
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,560
fond of sweet potatoes recently.

663
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,720
And I've been studying how to make

664
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,240
it taste better.

665
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,760
I intend to discuss about the skill

666
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
of roasting a sweet potato with you.

667
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,040
What a pity!

668
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,840
What a pity!

669
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
I haven't mastered the skill.

670
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,680
I'm afraid to let Your Majesty down.

671
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,640
Qingti.

672
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,200
Qingti,

673
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,360
you don't let me down at all.

674
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,600
You don't.

675
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,560
Your Majesty.

676
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,120
You've been working outside all day long.

677
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,200
It's dusty.

678
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,520
His Majesty is coming.

679
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,880
Xiaojiu.

680
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,080
Bow to you, Your Majesty.

681
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,680
Rise.

682
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Come here.

683
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,000
Your Majesty was drunk days before,

684
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,480
do you feel better now?

685
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm fine.

686
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,320
Xiaojiu,

687
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I know you're diligent in studying the blueprint of mechanisms,

688
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,480
so I make something to eat especially

689
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,560
to appreciate you.

690
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,400
Your Majesty.

691
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,160
See.

692
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,080
Sorrowless cake?

693
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,800
Is it made by Your Majesty yourself?

694
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,680
Certainly, it's made by me myself,

695
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,360
but it's not sorrowless cake.

696
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,640
Have a taste first.

697
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,000
It's delicious.

698
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,520
Is it?

699
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,160
It looks like sorrowless cake,

700
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,640
but tastes much sweeter.

701
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,640
I know you can taste the difference.

702
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,640
Actually, it's not made of sorrowless flower,

703
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,360
but another flower, is it?

704
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,600
Exactly not.

705
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,960
I specially choose lily to make it.

706
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,160
According to the secret recipe,

707
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
it's elaborately made

708
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,920
through three procedures.

709
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,800
I'll call it

710
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,600
lily cake.

711
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,240
Lily cake?

712
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,600
It's a good name.

713
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,160
Is it?

714
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,840
The name of sorrowless flower

715
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,960
means one can be carefree,

716
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,360
while lily

717
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,000
represents ones who worship each other

718
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
can have a harmonious union for a hundred years.

719
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,480
It's a common wish between the two.

720
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,640
Isn't the implied meaning of lily

721
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,760
much better than that of sorrowless flower?

722
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,600
How cute you are, Your Majesty!

723
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,360
Why you've tried so hard to make the lily cake

724
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,640
is to

725
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
outweigh the one I've mentioned before.

726
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,800
But what Your Majesty doesn't know is

727
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,840
that the one I've mentioned is you.

728
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,400
Have a little more.

729
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,840
If I keep eating,

730
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,480
I would become fat and ugly.

731
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,720
Do you want that?

732
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
You're so slender.

733
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,120
It might be better for you to add some weight.

734
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,960
It's impossible for you to become ugly.

735
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,400
You can't imagine

736
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,600
how gorgeous you look in my eyes.

737
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,240
Your Majesty has made so great dessert to make me happy,

738
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,720
and you're saying so many words to flatter me.

739
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,720
I don't even know how to respond.

740
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,960
You don't have to respond.

741
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,920
Just enjoy it.

742
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,080
What's your job on the mechanism blueprint?

743
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,520
I've well planned.

744
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
Then shall we go to the Emperor's Tomb today?

745
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,440
Well, how is Imperial Concubine Wan?

746
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,000
Has Your Majesty

747
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,120
visited her these days?

748
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,720
Imperial Concubine Wan.

749
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,600
She must have been recuperating.

750
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,840
We might not disturb her as well.

751
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,960
We shall accomplish the building of mechanisms
in the Emperor's Tomb as soon as possible.
