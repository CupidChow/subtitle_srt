1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 22

3
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,340
Your Majesty, you're finally back!

4
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,140
Do you feel uncomfortable?

5
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,740
I'm fine actually,

6
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,460
but somehow, I just feel sad.

7
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,580
It's like having a dream

8
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,820
in which I've gone through

9
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
various hardships and miseries,

10
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,420
but after I wake up,

11
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,260
I just can't remember anything.

12
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
Your Majesty, if you want to know what happened,

13
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,300
you can summon Si Ming and ask him.

14
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,300
No need.

15
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,540
Now that it's all passed,

16
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,380
I should let it go.

17
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,980
Your Majesty, what about your cultivation?

18
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,940
Much better.

19
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
Feel relieved.

20
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,260
It's terrific!

21
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Your Majesty should keep recuperating.

22
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
I believe you'll gain back all your cultivation in no time.

23
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,740
How's Miaoyi Chasm?

24
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,660
Every once in a while,

25
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,140
I would check that place in person.

26
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,860
Luckily, nothing has happened.

27
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:51,980
Good.

28
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,620
Your Highness,

29
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,500
Song Xuanren is dead,

30
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,340
and you've got the treasure. Why are you still worried?

31
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,620
I'm wondering whether I should submit the soul-locking jade

32
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,620
to the Demon King or not.

33
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,380
Forgive Mang for being foolish.

34
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,660
Your Highness, why not keep the treasure

35
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,020
to yourself?

36
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,220
Well,

37
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,940
I've studied it for several days.

38
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,700
It has no special effect

39
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,660
or special magic power.

40
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,180
Nor can it help me improve cultivation.

41
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,100
In my hands,

42
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,820
it's just an ordinary jade.

43
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,860
Then just submit it to Her Majesty.

44
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,980
If I submit it to her,

45
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,180
it can help her recover cultivation

46
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,700
and break out of the seal.

47
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,900
She once promised me that

48
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,540
she would let me lead all the demons in future.

49
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,740
In that case, Your Highness will only

50
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,340
be second to Her Majesty!

51
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,500
What if she doesn't intend to honor her promise?

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,060
Your Highness,

53
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,100
you mean...

54
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,180
If she breaks out of the seal

55
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,500
and goes back on her promise,

56
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,060
by then,

57
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,300
I won't be able to lead all the demons.

58
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,180
Moreover, I might even die!

59
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,140
Your Highness, you've made a point.

60
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,580
However, the soul-locking jade

61
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,700
is really useless to me.

62
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,620
Fine.

63
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,740
Any venture has its risks.

64
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,780
I'll take my chances!

65
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,100
You want to marry Ji Heng to Dong Hua?

66
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,860
The plan for the gods and demons are not for you to decide.

67
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,420
Guards! Take them back to Chihong Hall!

68
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,420
Min Su!

69
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,500
Father!

70
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,900
Min Su!

71
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,180
How about this time?

72
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,460
It still doesn't work?

73
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,540
It's the seventh magic art

74
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
we've tried.

75
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,860
If it still doesn't work,

76
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,100
I have no other way.

77
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,020
That's fine.

78
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
I'll figure out something else.

79
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,100
Demon Lord Yan.

80
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,460
You...

81
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,940
You remember me!

82
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,660
Now I remember

83
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,060
everything.

84
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,660
Wonderful!

85
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,980
This magic art really worked!

86
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,340
What a genius I am!

87
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,700
Are you OK?

88
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,580
I'm fine.

89
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,060
I'm just not used to it.

90
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,180
You just got your memories back.

91
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,540
It's natural to feel that.

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,340
You still have to rest quietly here for a while.

93
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,140
If you don't want to see Xu Yang,

94
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,380
just stay at my place.

95
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,580
If you don't like anything,

96
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,620
feel free to bring it up.

97
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,220
Why are you so nice to me?

98
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,740
You know why.

99
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,460
I like you. I certainly should treat you well.

100
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,340
I thought that among all the demons,

101
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,780
everyone that cared about me were dead.

102
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,260
Luckily, I still have you.

103
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,860
Ji Heng,

104
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,300
though I know nothing about the four arts

105
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,420
which you like,

106
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,100
tens of thousands of years have passed,

107
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,140
and I've never given up on you.

108
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,660
So please give me a little more time.

109
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,940
Maybe I'll suddenly

110
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,540
master all the skills one day.

111
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,940
Demon Lord Yan,

112
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,140
will you do me a favor?

113
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,420
Feel free to ask.

114
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,180
I remember that ten miles outside the Qingxuan Hall,

115
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,820
half way up of the mountain,

116
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,780
there's a fence,

117
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,940
inside which, there're seven types of herbs.

118
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,020
I know that place.

119
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Can you go and fetch me

120
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
those seven types of herbs.

121
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,020
I'd like to make a restorative with them

122
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,260
to recover faster.

123
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,060
Leave it to me!

124
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,140
It won't take long!

125
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,340
Thank you,

126
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,220
Demon Lord Yan.

127
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,340
But now I can't respond to your love.

128
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Nor do I want to delay you.

129
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,260
I've already got somewhere to go.

130
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,860
Your Majesty,

131
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,260
congratulations on experiencing your misfortune!

132
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,260
You've come fast.

133
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,460
Of course!

134
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,180
While you're gone,

135
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,260
I can't even find someone to play the game of go with me.

136
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,260
Really?

137
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,380
Have you improved your skills of playing the game of go?

138
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,380
No need to ask.

139
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,900
Certainly I've improved a lot!

140
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,100
So now you can survive a little longer in one game.

141
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,300
You've just come back,

142
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
but you're still sharp-tongued.

143
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,780
Has your cultivation fully recovered?

144
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,860
Anyhow, I just regained

145
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,780
70 or 80 percent of my cultivation.

146
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,420
Maybe I didn't experience the misfortune

147
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,060
so successfully.

148
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,740
70 or 80 percent.

149
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,140
That's far better than I expected.

150
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
That being said,

151
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,260
you seem to know something.

152
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,660
How is that possible?

153
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,020
Your Majesty, you don't even know.

154
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,220
How can I know?

155
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, rest well first.

156
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,220
I'm leaving.

157
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,140
I won't see you out.

158
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,900
Si Ming.

159
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,460
Your Highness.

160
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,780
I pay respect to Your Highness!

161
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,900
Are you going to submit the Book of Fate of His Majesty?

162
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,740
Well, His Majesty...

163
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,380
I just came from Tai Chen Palace.

164
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,460
How's His Majesty doing?

165
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,020
His Majesty has regained 70 or 80 percent of his cultivation.

166
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,820
No need to worry.

167
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,540
That's good.

168
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,260
Though something unexpected happened

169
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,500
during His Majesty's misfortune this time,

170
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,300
he kind of went through his misfortune smoothly.

171
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,100
Something unexpected?

172
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,540
What was that?

173
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,220
Your Highness, no need to ask.

174
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,540
Nor should you tell His Majesty about this.

175
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,500
If I can't keep my position,

176
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,420
the one who caused the change might also get into trouble.

177
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,140
Si Ming,

178
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,300
you've tried so hard to protect that person.

179
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,300
Are you in love?

180
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,740
Your Highness, you're kidding.

181
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,060
I'm not the one who wants to protect that person.

182
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,860
It's Lord Cheng Yu.

183
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,620
That person is the bosom friend of Lord Cheng Yu.

184
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,420
If Lord Cheng Yu knows about this...

185
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:43,980
Feel relieved.

186
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,020
I will keep my mouth shut.

187
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,180
Mentioning Lord Cheng Yu does work!

188
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,020
Is that person a man or a woman?

189
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,220
Your Highness, do you think

190
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,500
His Majesty would go through romance misfortune with a man?

191
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Love does make me a fool.

192
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,740
See you.

193
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,820
Love!

194
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,860
Your Majesty,

195
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,660
luckily, I didn't fail you.

196
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,700
I've found the soul-locking jade.

197
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,340
Really? Where is it?

198
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,860
So it is!

199
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,220
Nie Chuyin,

200
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,460
you've rendered outstanding service.

201
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,900
When I break out of the seal

202
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,900
and sweep the Eight Deserts and Six Directions in future,

203
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,540
I'll definitely have you lead all the demons.

204
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

205
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,300
Your Majesty,

206
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,900
there's another thing

207
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,620
I'd like to report.

208
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,740
The emperor of the State of Chengyu in the mortal realm

209
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,500
is the incarnation of Emperor Dong Hua
to go through the misfortune.

210
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,860
Really?

211
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,580
I didn't know it then.

212
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,420
When I knew it,

213
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,580
Dong Hua had already gone through the misfortune

214
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,140
and returned to the Sky Kingdom.

215
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,100
Forget it.

216
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,860
We've missed the perfect chance.

217
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,340
Your Majesty,

218
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,300
now that you've got the blood tear

219
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,700
and the soul-locking jade,

220
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,740
can you break out of the seal?

221
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,180
No hurry.

222
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,220
It takes time to absorb the soul-locking jade

223
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,540
to myself completely.

224
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,220
Now that I've got the blood tear back,

225
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,020
it surely will cause disturbance.

226
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,460
When I get back all my cultivation,

227
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,260
I can attack Dong Hua off guard.

228
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,780
Yes!

229
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,180
Ji Heng.

230
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,460
Ji Heng!

231
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,260
Demon Lord Yan, thank you for saving me.

232
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,060
See you. Don't look for me.

233
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,820
Yan Chiwu,

234
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,620
are you mad?

235
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,860
You despicable man!

236
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,780
Yan Chiwu,

237
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
just talk to me.

238
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,100
You're a jerk! I have nothing to talk to you.

239
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,460
If you want me dead,

240
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,900
you should at least tell me why.

241
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
A habitual liar as you are,

242
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,100
you even dare take advantage of Ji Heng!

243
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,900
I'm wronged!

244
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,460
When I met her,

245
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,940
she was dying.

246
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,420
Now only did I save her,

247
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,500
but I let her stay.

248
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,860
Bullshit!

249
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,140
You were clearly up to no good.

250
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,540
Otherwise, why did you leave her suffering in the mortal realm

251
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,820
instead of sending her back for treatment?

252
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,860
She stayed in the mortal realm out of her own will.

253
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,980
She was willing to stay.

254
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
You knew she lost her memories.

255
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,140
How dare you say she was willing to stay?

256
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,380
Stop! Stop!

257
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,460
Fine! Fine! Fine!

258
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,460
I saved her.

259
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,820
Would that offset my mistake?

260
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,660
If you don't believe me,

261
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,980
you can ask her.

262
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,540
I'll spare your life today.

263
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,140
She'll decide how to punish you in future.

264
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,740
When reaching the entrance of the Fanyin Valley,

265
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,420
use the magic art I taught you,

266
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,940
and you'll be able to enter the valley.

267
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,180
After living in your place for a while,

268
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,620
I feel much better.

269
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,260
It's time for me to go back to Qingqiu.

270
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,020
Your Highness, feel free to visit whenever you want.

271
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,900
As to Ye Qingti,

272
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,620
please take care of him for some time.

273
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,500
Your Highness, feel relieved.

274
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,380
Well,

275
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,420
do inform me in time

276
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
when the pimpon tree is about to bear fruits.

277
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,660
I see.

278
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,500
I'm leaving.

279
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,820
Your Highness,

280
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,180
I'm afraid you might not know this.

281
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,300
What?

282
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,940
Emperor Dong Hua has experienced his misfortune

283
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,500
and returned to the Sky Kingdom.

284
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,260
So fast.

285
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,420
I may not have anything to do with him in future.

286
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,220
Fengjiu!

287
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,780
You're back late.

288
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,380
It keeps me calm

289
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,140
in the Nether World.

290
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,660
Do you dress in white for Song Xuanren?

291
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,940
It's for Ye Qingti.

292
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,460
After going to the mortal realm this time,

293
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,060
you've almost repaid Emperor Dong Hua's favor.

294
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,980
Unexpectedly, you've owed your life to Ye Qingti.

295
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,300
After experiencing all these,

296
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,420
I finally realize that

297
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,860
though I kept talking about repaying Emperor Dong Hua's favor,

298
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,820
what I really couldn't let go of

299
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,580
was not his favor but him.

300
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,100
When going through the misfortune this time,

301
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,180
I almost ruined Emperor Dong Hua's misfortune.

302
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,380
Moreover, Ye Qingti died because of me.

303
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,740
Now,

304
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,180
I'm really over him.

305
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,300
Good for you!

306
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,620
You've made some progress after all.

307
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,420
I hope you mean what you say.

308
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,100
Flowers bloom and fade all the time.

309
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,900
Fate brings us together and separates us apart like a wind.

310
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
It's time to let you go.

311
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,220
Sister Fengjiu,

312
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,940
you're finally back.

313
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,660
You should've informed me when you arrived.

314
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,820
I saw you in a daze and chanting poems alone.

315
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,020
It was not like you.

316
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,140
I was just wondering.

317
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,780
What took you so long?

318
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I was not to blame.

319
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,980
The Fanyin Valley is about to open,

320
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,980
so God Bai Zhen kept watching me closely.

321
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,660
It took me a lot of trouble to sneak out.

322
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,740
Who asked you to steal

323
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,940
the fairy fruit

324
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,620
and offend the inseparable king birds?

325
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,340
Weren't it for my uncle,

326
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
you wouldn't have just lost all your feathers.

327
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,580
You!

328
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,940
You promised not to mention that!

329
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,820
The inseparable king birds
hide in the Fanyin Valley all the time.

330
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,660
I can't even settle scores with them.

331
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,820
Settle scores with them?

332
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,820
You'd better stay here.

333
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Weren't it for you,

334
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,420
our clans wouldn't have become enemies.

335
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,300
A bunch of cowards!

336
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,140
Well, Sister Fengjiu,

337
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,660
have you run into anything interesting in the mortal realm?

338
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,180
Nothing interesting.

339
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,780
Haven't you run into anything like those in stories?

340
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,660
Are all the things in stories interesting?

341
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,380
The mortal realm is boring?

342
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,460
The stories indicate otherwise.

343
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,300
Let me ask you.

344
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,740
Has my father noticed that I was gone?

345
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,100
God Bai Yi is out travelling.

346
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,900
God Bai Qian is about to get married,

347
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,260
so she has no time to pay attention to you.

348
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,700
That's good.

349
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,420
Aunt's wedding must be fun.

350
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,780
I'll go and visit my aunt.

351
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,540
Are those stories all deceptive?

352
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,700
The wedding ceremony is too complicated and tedious.

353
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
Now that you're here,

354
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,060
just come in.

355
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,500
Aunt,

356
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,700
I miss you so much!

357
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,620
Sister Fengjiu!

358
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,020
Sister Fengjiu, I also miss you.

359
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,740
You two!

360
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,220
Li,

361
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,100
how come you're so fat?

362
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,900
When I'm with my mother,

363
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,380
I certainly eat well all the time.

364
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,340
You're finally back!

365
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm too playful.

366
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,620
Sorry to worry you all.

367
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,540
Let me have a good look at you.

368
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,780
Pinning a white flower on head

369
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,100
is a tradition in the mortal realm
to mourn for closest relatives.

370
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,900
You disappeared for a while

371
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,060
after returning from the Sky Kingdom.

372
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,340
Where have you been?

373
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,540
I just went to pay back a favor.

374
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,580
Pay back a favor?

375
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,060
So be it.

376
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,700
But you're injured all over

377
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,300
after being backfired by magic arts.

378
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,780
What happened?

379
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,340
I paid back the favor in the mortal realm.

380
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,180
It's inevitable to get injured.

381
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,220
Only by getting injured can I show my sincerity.

382
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,300
Moreover...

383
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,060
Moreover, I'm fine now.

384
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,780
Your physical wounds

385
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,060
can be cured in Qingqiu.

386
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,260
However, to cure your wounds within,

387
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,860
you should fix the real problem.

388
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,820
You're the Princess of Qingqiu.

389
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,140
In future, you'll become the Empress of Qingqiu.

390
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,980
You can humiliate yourself,

391
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,260
but you shall never disgrace Qingqiu.

392
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,700
Moreover, the subjects who care about you and worship you

393
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,380
count on you to protect

394
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,020
their lives and possessions.

395
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:30,940
Aunt,

396
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,460
I've learned my lesson.

397
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,340
I'll never act willfully in future.

398
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,660
From now on,

399
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,420
I'll remember who I am.

400
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,300
You certainly understand it all.

401
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,340
I'll say no more.

402
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,140
I remember that

403
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,020
when your parents were out travelling,

404
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,860
I took care of you

405
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,740
for a long time.

406
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,940
I know you can do well.

407
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,740
By handing Qingqiu over to you,

408
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,260
we've got nothing to worry.

409
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,900
I'll write you a prescription later.

410
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,420
Twice a day.

411
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,660
Take the medicine on time.

412
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,620
Thank you, aunt.

413
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,900
Sister Fengjiu, are you taught by my mother?

414
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,220
Then will I be

415
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,540
as capable as you?

416
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,940
Will I be able to catch flying birds and swimming fishes

417
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,020
and become invincible in Qingqiu?

418
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,980
Don't say that!

419
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,420
When I was taught by your mother,

420
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,540
she was already

421
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,180
a majestic and dignified goddess.

422
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,340
What she taught me were all principles

423
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,220
to deal with people and things.

424
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,820
Those mischievous things I did in my childhood

425
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,740
had nothing to do with your mother.

426
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,780
As to me, though I've married into the Sky Kingdom,

427
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,300
you know we Qingqiu foxes

428
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,460
always favor relatives over justice.

429
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,260
If you're mistreated,

430
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,900
do tell me.

431
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,900
Whoever mistreats you, I'll make him pay.

432
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,660
Now that you're home,

433
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,140
no need to tolerate injustice.

434
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,260
As the Empress of Qingqiu,

435
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,540
you have to

436
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,620
tolerate injustice sometimes.

437
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,980
However, you're the only direct descendent of the Bais.

438
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,460
For some things,

439
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,540
we'll take the consequences for you.

440
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,700
Aunt,

441
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,100
none of my problems matter.

442
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,460
Your wedding is the most important.

443
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,660
I'll go and see what I can do to help.

444
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,900
Mother,

445
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,620
why does Sister Fengjiu pin a white flower

446
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,860
and wear a white dress?

447
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,100
Is it a bad thing?

448
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,140
She has dressed like that

449
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,900
since she was back from the mortal realm.

450
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,940
I guess she must be really hurt.

451
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,140
She was probably here to talk to me,

452
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,820
but she suddenly changed her mind.

453
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,020
Will you do me a favor

454
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,900
and take her out for a walk?

455
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,620
Mother, feel relieved.

456
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,420
Leave it to me.

457
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,260
I know what to do.

458
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,500
Go ahead.

459
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,940
Li,

460
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,100
why are you running?

461
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,660
Grandmother, sorry.

462
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,540
I just received a task from my mother.

463
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,740
I didn't notice you're outside the door.

464
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,540
Be careful!

465
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,380
Grandmother,

466
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,100
how come there're so many books?

467
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,020
My mother has read a large stack of them.

468
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,700
They're even taller than me if piled up.

469
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,820
To connect the gods
and us nine-tailed white fox clan by marriage,

470
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,660
rituals alone

471
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,220
have cost us 223 years of

472
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,100
arduous negotiations.

473
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,660
What your mother has read

474
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,860
is only a tip of an iceberg.

475
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,740
My mother is so amazing!

476
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,540
I don't want to get married in future.

477
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,420
Little as you are,

478
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,340
you even start to worry about your marriage.

479
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,060
I wonder who your Sister Fengjiu

480
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,300
will marry.

481
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,860
I don't know

482
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,140
who she will marry.

483
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,820
But I know who can make her happy.

484
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,220
You know that?

485
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,780
It's me!

486
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,420
After coming back,

487
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
she looks downhearted. But you...

488
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,300
You just said you received a task from your mother.

489
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,540
Is it to cheer her up?

490
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,260
Because

491
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,140
I'm the closest to Sister Fengjiu

492
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,780
in the entire Qingqiu

493
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,900
and the most reliable around my mother,

494
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,020
I'm the only one who can complete the task.

495
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,060
What a nice kid!

496
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,660
Li,

497
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,220
if you can cheer her up,

498
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,100
I'll make you something yummy to eat.

499
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,860
And you should keep me in Qingqiu for another three months,

500
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,060
without reciting books!

501
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,340
Deal!

502
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,460
I promise!

503
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,300
Just leave it to me.

504
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,180
Cheng Yu!

505
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,140
Cheng Yu, why are you running?

506
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,220
Are you avoiding me?

507
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,260
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

508
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,300
Several big events come in succession in the heavenly palace.

509
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,980
I'm really too busy,

510
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,740
so I've come to ask you for help.

511
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,980
The only big event in the heavenly palace

512
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,780
is the Crown Prince getting married.

513
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,020
It's your family thing.
Why should you ask a stranger like me for help?

514
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,380
Isn't my family thing

515
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,940
also your thing?

516
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,820
I'm just kidding.

517
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,980
Just kidding.

518
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,660
I really need your help.

519
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,180
I've come to ask you sincerely.

520
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,660
What big event can make you

521
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,300
come specially to trick me?

522
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,980
After the wedding ceremony of Ye Hua and Bai Qian,

523
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,300
there will be the Mile-fleurs Ceremony.

524
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,060
The Mile-fleurs Ceremony is only held every 60 years

525
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,940
and I'm also in charge.

526
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,780
Isn't it a big event?

527
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,980
Of course it is.

528
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,340
For the Mile-fleurs Ceremony,

529
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,540
even the ancient Buddhas in the Sukhavati

530
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,380
will come all the way to attend it.

531
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,180
They will also bring rare flowers

532
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,660
from the Ling Mountain.

533
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,260
By then, the Sky Kingdom is bound
to be boisterous and crowded once again.

534
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,060
It will become yet another feast!

535
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,580
Managed by me in person,

536
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,740
surely it will be marvelous!

537
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,980
For such a big event,

538
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,740
should you...

539
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,780
Wish you a successful ceremony!

540
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,620
I'll definitely come and congratulate you in person then.

541
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,740
I specially come to you for help.

542
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,220
I'm just an idle immortal.

543
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,580
His Majesty the Heavenly King granted me a nominal title of Lord

544
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,940
and I was suddenly in charge of the lotuses in the Jade Pool.

545
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,340
How can I help you?

546
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,540
There're so many high-ranking immortals in Yuan Ji Palace.

547
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,540
Why do you need my help?

548
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,380
I'm in charge of waters in the Four Seas,

549
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,700
while you're in charge of lotuses in the Jade Pool.

550
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,380
We'll make a perfect team to manage

551
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,220
the Mile-fleurs Ceremony together.

552
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,180
When word comes out later,

553
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,780
it will become a much told tale!

554
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,860
By then,

555
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,100
even the Buddhas from the Sukhavati

556
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,580
will call us

557
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,100
a heaven-made match.

558
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,180
If you dare keep talking nonsense and taking advantage of me,

559
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,700
you'll end up like this fan.

560
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,460
I find you worry about others

561
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,820
every day, so I try to

562
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,500
turn your attention to something else.

563
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,060
For such a sincere emotional entanglement,

564
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
if I were in your shoes,

565
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,380
I would definitely spread the word quickly

566
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,740
to every corner of the Sky Kingdom.

567
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,900
Sister Fengjiu,

568
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,260
do I really have to dress like this for the temple fair?

569
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,100
Li,

570
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,540
you do look delicate and pretty.

571
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,100
Sister Fengjiu, why should you bring a hat?

572
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,860
Why should I dress like a girl?

573
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,580
Because if anyone recognizes us,

574
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
we won't be able to have fun in the temple fair.

575
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,700
Qingqiu is so lively and boisterous.

576
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,780
The people here are simple and honest.

577
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,500
The villagers are pure and innocent.

578
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,540
It doesn't look like a fairy land.

579
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,420
It's more like a mortal realm.

580
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,700
You're right!

581
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,660
In charge of billions of rivers
and mountains in the mortal realm,

582
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,260
you live in the north desert throughout the year.

583
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,300
Now that you've got time to travel around,

584
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,980
you should really appreciate

585
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,820
the beautiful sceneries of the world.

586
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,180
The north desert is cold and silent all the year round.

587
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,500
If it can be as lively as Qingqiu,

588
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,580
it might add to the fun.

589
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,860
Tell me about it.

590
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,500
Is there anything interesting in Qingqiu?

591
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,020
I heard that

592
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,060
God Bai Qian and her niece from Qingqiu

593
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,580
are both unrivaled beauties

594
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,660
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

595
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,260
Above all, the little princess Bai Fengjiu

596
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,620
became the Empress of Qingqiu at a young age.

597
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,820
I also heard that

598
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,060
the little princess is forthright and sincere

599
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,660
and never adheres to customs or formalities rigidly.

600
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,860
She seems like a perfect match for you!

601
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,820
Tomatoes on sticks!

602
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,020
Li, look!

603
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,540
Li! Well...

604
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,460
Here you are!

605
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,460
Wait! Your change!

606
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:51,980
No need!

607
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,900
Good!

608
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,100
Good!

609
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,060
Good!

610
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,220
Good! Good!

611
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,540
Good! Good!

612
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,540
Good! Good!

613
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,580
Good! Good!

614
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,500
Good! Good!

615
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,620
Good! Good!

616
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,340
Good! Good!

617
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,940
Nice moves!

618
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,300
It's too dangerous!

619
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,980
Thank you for saving me.

620
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,660
You saved me today.

621
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
I'll definitely pay you back in future.

622
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,180
It's no big deal.

623
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
No need to keep it in mind.

624
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,620
Are you a foreigner?

625
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,180
I am one of the inseparable...

626
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,300
Indeed I am.

627
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,420
I've got the chance to sneak out this time,

628
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,020
hoping to travel around the outside world.

629
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,020
Thank you for saving me just now.

630
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,420
Oh, no! It's broken!

631
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,940
Take mine instead.

632
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,100
Here you are.

633
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,340
May I ask your name?

634
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,180
I am...

635
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,500
Sister Fengjiu, I've been looking for you for a long time.

636
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,460
What're you doing here?

637
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,660
Li!

638
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,180
It's Her Highness Fengjiu.

639
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,980
It's really her!

640
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,460
Her Highness Fengjiu!

641
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,980
We pay respect to Your Highness!

642
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,980
Now we can't have fun.

643
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,660
Fengjiu?

644
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,580
We have to go now.

645
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,180
Go!

646
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,060
Bai Fengjiu.

647
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,300
She's funny.

648
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,980
Well,

649
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,060
that's enough for today.

650
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,300
Go back to your mother.

651
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,660
Sister Fengjiu,

652
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,860
please let me stay with you.

653
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,140
It's a task given by grandmother.

654
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,700
Just go back.

655
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,820
No need to worry about me.

656
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,580
I'm fine.

657
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,620
Trapped by love!

658
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,340
What's wrong?

659
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,660
You still look unhappy.

660
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,700
Nothing.

661
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,740
I thought of a spoony woman in the mortal realm

662
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,060
and found her not easy.

663
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,660
I just feel sad for her.

664
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,580
A woman in the mortal realm?

665
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:07,980
Let me guess.

666
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,900
Is there also a man

667
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,180
who loves her dearly?

668
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
How do you know?

669
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,260
Let me make another guess.

670
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,180
Is there another man

671
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,100
who this woman loves dearly?

672
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
You're right again.

673
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,220
Aren't those stories all like this?

674
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,180
There must be three people to play a drama.

675
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,620
That's right.

676
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,940
In your eyes, everything is just a drama.

677
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,340
I'm just kidding.

678
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,060
I say that to cheer you up.

679
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,460
Why are you so sentimental?

680
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,940
I just feel that

681
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,140
these languishing youths and unhappy maidens,

682
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,420
though laughable and pitiful,

683
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,500
make me envious sometimes

684
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,060
for living so willfully.

685
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,260
We can also make others envious.

686
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,340
Why not take the chance of preparing
for the Mile-fleurs Ceremony?

687
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,500
Let's talk late into night,

688
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,980
drink all night long,

689
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,540
and...

690
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,420
Why do you leave before I finish my words again?

691
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,300
No need to hear those frivolous words.

692
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,020
Why do you have to be like those idiots?

693
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,180
Rather than find a spoony

694
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,460
to perceive human sufferings,

695
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,860
you'd better manage the Mile-fleurs Ceremony with me.

696
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,980
It's a golden opportunity to make a name.

697
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,460
After this, even the Buddhas

698
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,060
won't forget your name.

699
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,180
Why do I need the chance to make a name?

700
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,620
Isn't it enough with you bothering me?

701
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,900
Right.

702
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,700
It's enough with you bothering me,

703
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,580
but I really want to talk late into night with you,

704
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,340
drink all night long with you, and...

705
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,700
No way!

706
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,060
Just wake up!

707
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,700
As to my great pains,

708
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,700
who knows?

709
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,580
Just now, Lord Cheng Yu played with me

710
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,740
by the lotus pond regardless of etiquette.

711
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,140
You're allowed to spread the word in detail.
