00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 54

3
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,660
You're finally back.

4
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,620
Have you seen Dong Hua?

5
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,180
I waited for him for so long.

6
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,020
Why didn't he come back?

7
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,100
Why did he lie to me?

8
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,860
I waited for him for so long like a fool.

9
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,060
Which word he said is true?

10
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,580
Fengjiu,

11
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,020
you're pregnant.

12
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,500
Feel relieved.

13
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,100
Your uncle and I will be here for you.

14
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,780
Your Majesty!

15
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,980
I pay respect to Your Majesty!

16
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,380
I still need to cultivate in reclusion

17
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,900
to refine and blend the dark energy inside my body.

18
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,020
Your Majesty, I'm willing
to serve you at the expense of my life.

19
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,420
When I'm not around,

20
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,780
you shall be the one

21
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,980
to lead the demons.

22
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,140
Yes!

23
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,300
This is how it feels to have power.

24
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,340
Gods,

25
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,900
just wait!

26
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,340
Xiaojiu!

27
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,260
Xiaojiu!

28
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,140
Yan,

29
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,220
why are you here?

30
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,220
Aren't the demons...

31
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,180
I've got something urgent to attend to.

32
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,540
Do you know where Xiaojiu is?

33
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,060
Today is their wedding day.

34
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,380
How come they are both missing?

35
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,060
That's why I'm here.

36
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,780
For the demons, the ice face...

37
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,780
Your Highness!

38
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,900
- Chong Lin! - Chong Lin, how come you're...

39
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,620
Something bad has happened in the Fanyin Valley.

40
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,740
His Majesty asked you to meet him
at the entrance right away.

41
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,020
Your Majesty!

42
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,580
Miao Luo has broken out of the Miaoyi Chasm.

43
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,780
Please maintain the ward. I'm going inside.

44
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,220
The valley is filled with dark energy.

45
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,140
How can you go inside?

46
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,700
Protected by the golden blood,

47
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,900
the dark energy can't hurt me,

48
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,820
I'll leave it to you.

49
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,100
Miao Luo is out?

50
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,380
How are the demons now?

51
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,260
What about Xu Yang?

52
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,140
Didn't he stop Miao Luo from stealing the blood tear?

53
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,100
Demon Lord Xu Yang is dead.

54
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,100
Miao Luo!

55
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm gonna kill you!

56
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,900
Yan,

57
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,300
His Majesty is the only one
who can handle Miao Luo in the whole word.

58
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,660
If you go inside now, you'll get yourself killed.

59
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,540
So what?

60
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,820
I'll never spare her!

61
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,780
Calm down!

62
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,780
The royal members
of the inseparable king birds are probably dead.

63
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
If the Fanyin Valley opens,

64
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,100
all the living creatures
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts will suffer.

65
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,260
Guarding this place

66
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,140
is the first step to restrain Miao Luo.

67
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,060
All you know is to draw out your sword.
What's the use of that?

68
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,180
As a demon lord,

69
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,980
the last lesson you need to learn is that

70
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,940
putting away your sword is
for drawing out your sword better.

71
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
Fengjiu, are you OK?

72
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,660
How are you?

73
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,460
Haven't heard from you in the Sky Kingdom,

74
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,740
I came to visit you in Qingqiu.

75
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,740
His Majesty didn't come.

76
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,380
I've given him time,

77
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,900
but he still stays in the demon clan.

78
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,660
There's no one else here.

79
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,500
If you feel sad deep in your heart,

80
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,260
just have a good cry.

81
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,420
I don't want to cry.

82
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,300
I just can't understand it.

83
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,980
Fengjiu,

84
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,900
feel relieved.

85
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,140
No matter what happens, His Majesty is sure to come back.

86
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,900
By then, we'll definitely ask him

87
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,820
to explain to you until you're satisfied.

88
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,020
Cheng Yu,

89
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,340
His Majesty loved me a lot

90
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,580
in the Dream of Aranya.

91
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,380
If he finds Ji Heng pitiful

92
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,420
and wants to stay by her side,

93
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,820
he just needs to tell me.

94
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,140
I won't force him to marry me.

95
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,100
Even if I'm...

96
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,860
I won't force him to stay.

97
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,300
Fengjiu...

98
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,340
I dare not tell my father, either.

99
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm afraid that if he knows, he'll get mad

100
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,660
and go to argue with His Majesty.

101
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,060
After all,

102
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,340
love must be mutual.

103
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Fengjiu, wait for me.

104
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,580
I'll go and find Lian Song.

105
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,740
He surely knows where His Majesty is.

106
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,300
I'll definitely help you.

107
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,340
Having been refined by Miao Luo,
the dark energy in the Miaoyi Chasm

108
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
is harder to purify than that of the Ten-evil Lotus Land.

109
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,620
I have to find a way to suppress it.

110
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,420
I should find Miao Luo right away
and destroy her with the dark energy.

111
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,580
Send another one hundred demon soldiers
to the Baishui Mountain.

112
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,660
Yes!

113
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,620
Demon Lord Nie,

114
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,260
we haven't started a war against the gods yet.

115
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,340
Is it too...

116
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,620
You should figure out the current situation.

117
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,180
Who is the leader of the demons?

118
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,140
I'm calling the shots now.

119
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,620
You!

120
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,940
We're both demon lords. How can you...

121
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,700
Just leave.

122
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,060
Yes!

123
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,460
It's been three days.

124
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,860
Here are one fetus protection pill

125
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,300
and one abortion pill.

126
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,180
I'll keep your secret

127
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,580

His Majesty and I

160
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
have really gone a long way.

161
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,940
In the first half of the journey,
I was the one who kept chasing after him.

162
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,940
It was hard,

163
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,500
but luckily, I was blessed by heaven

164
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,540
and I finally caught up with him.

165
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,140
Because I was the one who wanted him from the very start,

166
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,580
however tired I was,

167
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,700
I felt OK.

168
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,940
He does love me,

169
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,180
but he may also have feelings for Ji Heng.

170
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,740
When I fell into the Dream of Aranya

171
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
and struggled between life and death,

172
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,900
he chose me.

173
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,460
But now Ji Heng is in danger,

174
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,340
so he chooses Ji Heng.

175
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,340
Having failed

176
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
to keep his word,

177
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,700
he's ashamed to meet me in Qingqiu.

178
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,580
This love was hard-earned,

179
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,500
and I've always wanted to treasure it.

180
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,020
But I'm really too tired.

181
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,340
Your Majesty, I've tried.

182
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,180
I've given you enough time.

183
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,380
As long as you can come,

184
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,300
I'll believe anything you say,

185
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,820
but you didn't come.

186
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,820
Now that I'm also pregnant,

187
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,340
♪ Hide the hopeless dream in the bedside sleeve. ♪

188
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,260
I can't stay in Qingqiu anymore.

189
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,420
Your Majesty,

190
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,940
♪ That's my craving for all my life. ♪

191
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,580
from now on,

192
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,940
I'll live my life without you.

193
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,940
♪ ...so torturous. ♪

194
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,180
I can't fully purify the dark energy inside.

195
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,900
On the opening date of the Fanyin Valley,

196
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,620
we won't be able to stop the dark energy
from leaking outside.

197
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,580
What shall we do?

198
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,140
We have to find a magic instrument

199
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,100
to seal the Fanyin Valley,

200
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,300
thus resolving future trouble once and for all.

201
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,220
Why are you all here?

202
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,020
Who's accompanying Xiaobai?

203
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,220
Oh, gosh!

204
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,500
I forgot to visit Xiaojiu on my way.

205
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:38,980
Your Majesty!

206
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,300
Ice face!

207
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,860
Your Majesty!

208
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,140
When he wakes up,

209
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,540
please teach him

210
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
some cultivation tips.

211
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,980
When he's ready to ascend to heaven,

212
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,900
I'll help him wash away the mortal dust
in the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool,

213
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,900
so that he can become an immortal.

214
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,860
You...

215
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,660
I'm fine.

216
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,100
I've thought through everything these days,

217
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,900
and I'm all set.

218
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,900
When I come back from the mortal realm,

219
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,260
I'll drink with you again.

220
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,820
You're going to the mortal realm?

221
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,220
According to the rituals of Qingqiu,

222
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,620
once I become the monarch,

223
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,300
I have to experience the mortal realm.

224
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,620
I was delayed by many things,

225
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,260
but it's not too late to go now.

226
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,260
Well,

227
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,740
I've got a charm for you. Put it away first.

228
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,700
If I'm still not back

229
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,900
when Qingti is about to ascend to heaven,

230
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,820
use it to inform me,

231
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,380
and then I'll come back to find you.

232
00:17:59,460 --> 00:17:59,820
OK.

233
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,820
I loved to eat sweet food the most,

234
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,740
but now I love to eat salty food.

235
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,780
Gungun, you like salty food, right?

236
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,260
Gungun,

237
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,820
you must be white and chubby.

238
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,100
After you grow up,

239
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,300
I'll take you to Qingqiu to meet our family.

240
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,500
But what I fear the most is that

241
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,900
your grandpa and grandma will force

242
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,580
your father to take his responsibilities.

243
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,220
So I have no choice but to act first and report afterwards.

244
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,340
Sorry to make you go through all this.

245
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,180
What to do now?

246
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,980
No wonder I couldn't find you however hard I tried.

247
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,060
Fengjiu went to experience the mortal realm

248
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,500
without leaving a message.

249
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,620
Who knew they would miss each other like that.

250
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,340
One day in heaven equals one year on earth.

251
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,620
How sad she will be when she stays in the mortal realm.

252
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,420
No!

253
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,380
I'll find Si Ming

254
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,380
and see if he's got some other ways.

255
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,260
Your Highness, please decide as early as possible.

256
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,620
Later,

257
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,220
the Sky Kingdom may not be so stable.

258
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,340
Though His Majesty is busy looking for Her Highness Fengjiu,

259
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,700
he still remembers to find a new place

260
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,140
for us to settle down.

261
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,180
Inseparable king birds are caring and loyal.

262
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,220
Your royal members sacrificed themselves in the valley

263
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,820
for the safety of the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

264
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,700
His Majesty won't forget the favor.

265
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,580
Leave the tragedy of the Fanyin Valley in the Fanyin Valley.

266
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,580
That's the wish of our royal members.

267
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,220
Immortal Official Chong Lin,

268
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,700
please tell His Majesty.

269
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,660
Since it's a disaster for the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

270
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
the inseparable king birds

271
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,580
certainly have no reason to avoid it.

272
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,140
I'd like to lead the inseparable king birds

273
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,580
to fight alongside the gods.

274
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,100
Your Highness.

275
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,180
All my families are gone.

276
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,660
I'm the only royal member left.

277
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
The inseparable king birds
have chosen me to be their monarch.

278
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Your Majesty.

279
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,060
My decision is the common decision of my people.

280
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,140
Miao Luo owes us a huge debt of blood.

281
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,180
We must make her pay.

282
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,340
If she's not killed,

283
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,140
no place is safe for us in the world.

284
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,780
I request His Majesty to keep us

285
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
to resist the enemies with gods.

286
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,420
However, Immortal Official Chong Lin,

287
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,740
please take the old, the weak, women,
and children of our clan somewhere safe

288
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,420
for they don't have the power to fight.

289
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,580
Yes.

290
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,620
I'll definitely report your resolution

291
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,940
to His Majesty.

292
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,580
Demon Lord Yan asked His Majesty

293
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,900
to send you a message.

294
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,340
He said that

295
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
now the demon clan is not stable.

296
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,740
After Miao Luo is killed,

297
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,900
he'd like to share his land

298
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,700
with the inseparable king birds.

299
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,340
Demon Lord Yan was always a good friend to my elder brother,

300
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,220
but the demon clan is not a good place
for the inseparable king birds.

301
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Immortal official Chong Lin, if there are still

302
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,420
inseparable king birds left after Miao Luo is killed,

303
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,220
please take them to Qingqiu.

304
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,660
My elder brother always

305
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,300
wanted to visit there.

306
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,580
Yes.

307
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,780
Elder brother,

308
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,700
did you have any regret in your heart?

309
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,380
Just let everything miserable come to end
after the tragedy of Aranya and the end of your life.

310
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,860
Though your love was not responded to,

311
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,060
you died for what you believed.

312
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,660
The tragedy of the Fanyin Valley won't repeat itself.

313
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,460
From today on,

314
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,300
I'll become a monarch of indomitable spirit!

315
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,100
Gungun has gone to school.

316
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,580
Life in the mortal realm is really boring.

317
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,380
I might as well find a quiet place

318
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,860
and live in reclusion for a while.

319
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,260
Mother! Mother! I'm back!

320
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,340
Gungun, you're back!

321
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,380
Your hair turns white.

322
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,700
Come on, it needs dyeing.

323
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,780
Sit down.

324
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,540
Mother,

325
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,700
why do other students at school

326
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,140
have black hair,

327
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,380
while my hair is born silver?

328
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,900
Because we're immortals.

329
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,220
The color of our hair is certainly different.

330
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,060
Do other little immortals look like me?

331
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,620
Of course not.

332
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,180
Of course, some of them do look like you.

333
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,820
When you go back

334
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,060
and see Li, you'll see.

335
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,980
Mother, who is Li?

336
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,180
He's also a little immortal.

337
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,100
You should call him "Uncle".

338
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,780
Does he also have silver hair?

339
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,180
No, his hair is black.

340
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,420
We're both little immortals.

341
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,020
How come we have different hair colors?

342
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,140
Actually, as immortals, we don't

343
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,780
care much about our hair colors,

344
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,300
but since we're in the mortal realm,

345
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,180
we have to follow the mortal rules.

346
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,260
Sit still. It's time to dye your hair.

347
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,300
Let's go back to the Sky Kingdom.

348
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,420
Then I don't have to dye my hair.

349
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,340
OK. We'll go back.

350
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,580
But I want to

351
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,220
take you around to see the mortal realm.

352
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,940
OK, as you wish.

353
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,900
Fengjiu is really good at cooking.

354
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,060
There's no dish she can't make in the world,

355
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,860
but there's only one dish that she doesn't make,

356
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,420
and that's the qilin plant.

357
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,020
It's not because

358
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,660
she hates it

359
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,540
due to its taste or property.

360
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,460
It's just that the qilin plant

361
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,260
only grows in the Sukhavati,

362
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,140
and it can't grow anywhere else.

363
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,820
As a child, she loved to eat the qilin plant,

364
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,500
so she wanted to grow one in Qingqiu.

365
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,780
It took her three hundred years.

366
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,460
She missed many classes

367
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,860
and was beaten cruelly by her father several times.

368
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,180
It really took a lot of work.

369
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,980
She felt so tired,

370
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,500
so she gave it up completely.

371
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,540
From then on,

372
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,740
she never ate the qilin plant,

373
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,020
let alone using it to make dishes.

374
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,940
She can be really stubborn

375
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,900
sometimes.

376
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,500
Cold-hearted as Bai Qian is,

377
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,420
she's actually warm-hearted

378
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,980
compared to Fengjiu.

379
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,260
What's more,

380
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,140
Fengjiu is not aware that

381
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,660
she's somewhat heartless.

382
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,060
Instead, she always finds herself sentimental and emotional.

383
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,220
It's just like she has never noticed that

384
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,500
she wouldn't eat the qilin plant any more.

385
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,500
What a great metaphor!

386
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,780
Now His Majesty

387
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,900
is another qilin plant abandoned by her.

388
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
As the Emperor of the Three Realms,

389
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,420
His Majesty has his own difficulties.

390
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,740
If the vast universe becomes unstable...

391
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,500
In our family, we don't restrain our children.

392
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,020
She can go anywhere she wants

393
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,540
to experience the world.

394
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,500
We never stop her.

395
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,780
If you ask me,

396
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,940
I really don't know where she has gone.

397
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,900
Actually, if His Majesty really wants to

398
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,420
find her, he should have a way.

399
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,020
However, I'm just worried that

400
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,620
His Majesty has given the last chance

401
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,740
to Her Highness Fengjiu.

402
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,740
Like His Majesty,

403
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,540
Gungun loves to eat the cakes I make.

404
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,540
Mother! Mother!

405
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,780
I'm back.

406
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,740
Look what I've made for you.

407
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
The chestnut cake!

408
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,100
Wash your hands before you eat.

409
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,300
Mother,

410
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,820
why do you have four pieces,

411
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,940
while I just have three?

412
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,580
Because I'm an adult,

413
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,020
and you're a little boy.

414
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,900
I can eat one more piece than you.

415
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,620
Mother,

416
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,580
my schoolmates' mothers

417
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,060
never grab their cakes.

418
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,620
But we're immortals.

419
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,020
As to such things, we certainly should

420
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,300
follow the immortal rules.

421
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,900
Is that so?

422
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,460
But you once said

423
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,980
we were in the mortal realm,

424
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,700
so we should follow the mortal rules.

425
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,540
Did I say that?

426
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,180
Under this circumstance,

427
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,220
we still have to follow the immortal rules.

428
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,940
Otherwise, what if we forget about the immortal rules

429
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,860
when we're back to the fairy land?

430
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,780
Fine.

431
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,740
We'll move to another place in a few days.

432
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,780
Mother,

433
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,100
we're fine living in the publishing house.

434
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,660
Why should we move?

435
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,660
If we move,

436
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,540
I won't be able to play with my friends.

437
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,740
Because you're a little immortal.

438
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,900
Your appearance

439
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
remains the same

440
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,100
for a very long time.

441
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,460
If we stay here

442
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,780
all the time,

443
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,980
those mortals will get suspicious.

444
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,100
So we have to keep moving.

445
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,940
I see.

446
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,780
Then after we move,

447
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,060
I'll go

448
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,620
wherever you go.

449
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,420
Eat another one!

450
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,740
In the mortal realm,

451
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,900
you saved Her Highness Fengjiu once.

452
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,540
To repay your favor,

453
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,020
Her Highness Fengjiu brought you back to life
with the pimpon fruit

454
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,580
and gave you half of her cultivation.

455
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,380
Time shifts and things change.

456
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,900
I suppose the mortal realm is completely different.

457
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,140
I should've been dead for a long time,
but now I'm an immortal.

458
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,460
Many mortal emperors have failed

459
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,460
to be immortal despite all their efforts.

460
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,180
By then,

461
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,060
according to the rules of Immortal Record Book,

462
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,060
the baptizing ceremony must be performed

463
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,300
by the one who gave you the body.

464
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,420
Her Highness Fengjiu will go to the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool

465
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,740
in person to baptize you

466
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,820
and help you ascend to heaven.

467
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,660
Get prepared.

468
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,140
What was my relationship
with Her Highness Fengjiu back then?

469
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,140
Reborn as an immortal, you forgot about

470
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,860
everything when you woke up.

471
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,700
It's good for you.

472
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,260
Why do you have to remember your dream

473
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,580
and add to your trouble?

474
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,460
Why did I have such a dream?

475
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,460
His Majesty is the Emperor of the Three Realms.

476
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,860
This won't happen to him for sure.

477
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,820
I suppose

478
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,940
he's fishing in Tai Chen Palace now.

479
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,540
What are you playing?

480
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,740
The spinning top. Haven't you played it before?

481
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,020
No.

482
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,500
It's so pretty.

483
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,420
Did you make it yourself?

484
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,500
No, my father made it.

485
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,780
Your father?

486
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,940
Yes, my father is awesome.

487
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,860
He can make not only spinning tops but kites.

488
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,060
If you like it,

489
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,660
you can ask your father to make one for you.

490
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,260
But I only have a mother. I don't have a father.

491
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,300
Why don't you have a father?

492
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,900
Isn't it enough to have a mother only?

493
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,580
But everyone has a mother and a father.

494
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,500
Everyone has a father?

495
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,500
Mother! Mother!

496
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
Gungun, what's up?

497
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,620
Do I have a father?

498
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,700
No.

499
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,140
I gave birth to you myself.

500
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,900
But my schoolmates

501
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,620
all have their own father.

502
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,060
But you're a little immortal.

503
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,860
In the immortal realm,

504
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,300
it's possible for someone to have a mother but no father.

505
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,420
Why is the fairy land so different from the mortal realm?

506
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,060
In the mortal realm, adults don't grab kids' cakes.

507
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,220
Adults get up at midnight

508
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,100
to tuck their kids in.

509
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,860
Every kid must have their father.

510
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,860
Mother,

511
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,540
are you using the fairy land as an excuse

512
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,060
because I can't seek confirmation?

513
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Gungun, you must be too stressful due to your schoolwork.

514
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,300
You're not obedient now.

515
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,580
How about this?

516
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,780
Cut class tomorrow.

517
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,260
I'll take you to the mountains

518
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,020
to absorb the essence of the nature.

519
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,300
Mother, don't threaten me with food

520
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,260
every time you're in the wrong.

521
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,260
Ordinary magic instruments won't be able
to suppress the dark energy

522
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,500
of the Miaoyi Chasm, let alone

523
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,180
the entire Fanyin Valley.

524
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,180
Even God Zhe Yan can't...

525
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:08,940
I found it!

526
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,740
Where?

527
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,700
There's actually a way to seal the dark energy.

528
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,220
Are you OK?

529
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,180
Be careful when you're back.

530
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,060
Remember.

531
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,980
You said each race has closed their gate.

532
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,780
What does that mean?

533
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,260
Well,

534
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,780
Your Highness,

535
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,020
no race can send demons

536
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,020
to feed Her Majesty any more.

537
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:20,980
Please...

538
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,980
Let's wait and see.

539
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,060
Ye Hua and Bai Qian are out travelling.

540
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,620
I've sent people to look for them.

541
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,940
In a few days,

542
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,660
God Zhe Yan and God Bai Zhen
will also come to the Sky Kingdom

543
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,740
to discuss the important matter.

544
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,380
The Fanyin Valley is about to open.

545
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,980
We can't wait.

546
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,980
The starlight ward is so dangerous.

547
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,380
Plus, Bihai Cangling is closely linked to you.

548
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,220
If anything goes wrong with Bihai Cangling,

549
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,700
will you be in danger?

550
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,300
We'll know by then.

551
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,620
Dong Hua!

552
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,180
I'm all set.

553
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,580
I just...

554
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,420
Just what?

555
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,300
I just want to see her again.

556
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,420
You...

557
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,580
What on earth did His Majesty say?

558
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,140
Go back now and keep looking.

559
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,300
So he still wants to use Bihai Cangling

560
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,140
to seal the Fanyin Valley?

561
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,580
Over tens of thousands of years,

562
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,620
no one has ever opened the starlight ward.

563
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,700
As to the consequences...

564
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,540
Let's go!

565
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,620
It's time to eat.

566
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,660
Stop reading. Let's eat.

567
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,780
= Please come back to the Nether World =

568
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,020
Mother, what's this?

569
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,820
Gungun, it's time for us to go back to the fairy land.

570
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,140
Since you refuse to send any demon,

571
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,860
I may send you instead.

572
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,860
Demon Lord Yan,

573
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,260
why are you here?

574
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,140
Are you kicked out by the gods?

575
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Nie Chuyin,

576
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,780
today will be your day to die.

577
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,380
I'm here to avenge Xu Yang's death.

578
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,940
Today,

579
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,300
I'll bury you with Xu Yang.

580
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,300
Tomorrow, when His Majesty decides the titles and ranks of

581
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,620
the immortals just ascending to heaven,

582
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,620
the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool will be opened for the last time.

583
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,740
In future, the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool
will be sealed forever.

584
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,260
The Sky Kingdom will no longer

585
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,900
list those who become immortals by rare chance

586
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
on the Immortal Record Book.

587
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,220
His Majesty wants to see you,

588
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,820
and he's finally thought of a good way

589
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,220
to find you.

590
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,060
If he had wanted to find me,

591
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,420
he would have found me long ago.

592
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,180
Now by doing so,

593
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,340
he's really cold-hearted.

594
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,300
He is...

595
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,900
Gungun is my son. His Majesty is his father.

596
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,100
He's the reason why you don't want to come back?

597
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,060
I'll go to the Sky Kingdom first.

598
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,100
As to him, could you

599
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,140
look after him for a couple of days?

600
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,660
Your Highness Fengjiu, please feel relieved.

601
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,940
Mother, can you take me with you?

602
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,500
I've never parted with you

603
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,420
my whole life.

604
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,780
Gungun, be a good boy.

605
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,220
I've really got something important to deal with.

606
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,820
I can't take you with me.

607
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,980
When it's finished,

608
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,500
I'll come back and pick you up right away.

609
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,580
Then promise me.

610
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,860
Make a promise. Keep it for one hundred years.

611
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,100
Please take care of him.

612
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,820
Thank you.

613
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,620
Yan,

614
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,100
see?

615
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,700
With your current cultivation,

616
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,220
you're no match for me.

617
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,660
Just go to hell!

618
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,460
No way!

619
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,340
I can

620
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,980
still fight!

621
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:42,940
Yan,

622
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,300
be reasonable.

623
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,700
As demons, we've been suppressed by gods
for tens of thousands of years.

624
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,100
Now,

625
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,260
after Dong Hua and Miao Luo are weakened by each other,

626
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,380
demons can

627
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,020
develop and flourish.

628
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,420
I'm afraid it'll be your golden opportunity

629
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,780
to replace the demon king.

630
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,860
If I can help demons develop and flourish,

631
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,220
why can't I replace her?

632
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,460
Don't chase rainbows!

633
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,940
Yan,

634
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,060
I'll give you one last chance.

635
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,020
Acknowledge allegiance to me,

636
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,780
and I'll guarantee the safety of your race.

637
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,300
Otherwise,

638
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,980
you'll die today.

639
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,660
Why are you laughing?

640
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,780
I'm laughing at you.

641
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,340
You're just a puppet.

642
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,540
You have no future.

643
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,820
Go to hell!

644
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,100
I've told you if you're disloyal,

645
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,420
you will come to no good end.

646
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,180
Your Majesty!

647
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,460
No! No!

648
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,500
Your Majesty!

649
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,140
No!

650
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,380
Miao Luo, I know Dong Hua's secret.

651
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,100
I'll tell you if you kill him.

652
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,260
Your Majesty, don't trust him.

653
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,940
He was close to Dong Hua in the Fanyin Valley.

654
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,020
They're on the same side.

655
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,420
Now it's your turn.

656
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,540
What's Dong Hua's secret?
