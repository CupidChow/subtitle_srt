1
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 28

3
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,940
Your Majesty,

4
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,460
has the war of Mount Fuyu not finished yet?

5
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,020
That Demon Lord Yan

6
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,980
is not a threat.

7
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,260
Now that the disaster is quelled,

8
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,220
Your Majesty, why are you still so worried?

9
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,900
I left her in the Fanyin Valley.

10
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,580
What have you left?

11
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,220
A silk handkerchief.

12
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,300
Leave me alone.

13
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,540
Yes.

14
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,660
Which man in the world

15
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,140
doesn't like Ji Heng?

16
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,340
In that case,

17
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,580
since His Majesty likes Ji Heng so much,

18
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,940
why did I hear that

19
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,100
when they got out of the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

20
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,740
Ji Heng asked His Majesty for a spiritual fox

21
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,220
they found together,

22
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,180
but His Majesty didn't give it to her?

23
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,100
What do you know?

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,700
It's a strategy.

25
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,380
It's just like you like ice face,

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,780
so you will try every means to connect with him.

27
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,860
He didn't give that spiritual fox

28
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,980
to Ji Heng

29
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,380
so that Ji Heng would visit Tai Chen Palace

30
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,420
frequently to see it later.

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,860
He's really cunning.

32
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,460
Though he talks casually,

33
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,300
he's pretty scrupulous.

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,940
I know you like him,

35
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,740
just as I like Ji Heng.

36
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,660
We have the same misfortune.

37
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,740
Take my advice.

38
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,740
It's never too late to mend your ways.

39
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,100
I don't know this sentence

40
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,380
can also be interpreted this way.

41
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,980
Just mend your ways.

42
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,260
However, the ice face failed to get married in the end.

43
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,420
Ji Heng ran away from the wedding.

44
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,700
He lost not only his empress

45
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,900
but also the spiritual fox.

46
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,580
How miserable he was!

47
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,580
You said you're from Qingqiu.

48
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,820
Do you know

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,900
where that spiritual fox is now?

50
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,420
It sounds ridiculous.

51
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,820
The ice face actually

52
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,900
came to me for the fox.

53
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
He thought I had abducted the fox.

54
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,660
Do I look like someone

55
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,620
who would abduct a fox?

56
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,260
He really underestimated me!

57
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,940
However,

58
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,540
I heard that he still hasn't found it after years of searching.

59
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,420
In my opinion,

60
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,820
that fox is probably dead.

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
I wonder what kind of a fox that is

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,260
to be so favored by him.

63
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,300
Warrior Yan,

64
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,660
after talking for so long,

65
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,940
you must be thirsty.

66
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,980
Shall we look for the exit?

67
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,300
We can't stay here

68
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,420
forever.

69
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,620
You've made a point.

70
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,740
Watch out!

71
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,380
After all, we've been through trouble together.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
I can't watch you fall down

73
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,380
and do nothing.

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,420
Forget it! I'm coming!

75
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,140
Today is really an auspicious day.

76
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,980
It's exceptionally easy to avoid those spies

77
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
in the imperial palace and get outside.

78
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,180
Let's go and have a look!

79
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,700
What's wrong?

80
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,220
Look over there!

81
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,980
Turn them over!

82
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,220
They hit someone.

83
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,220
Second Prince!

84
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,700
I pay respects to Your Highness!

85
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,020
How dare you!

86
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,180
You actually attacked
the Second Prince of the inseparable king bird!

87
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,900
I'm so unlucky

88
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,260
to have fallen into the nest of the inseparable king birds!

89
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,100
The inseparable king birds had a problem with Qingqiu.

90
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,180
I can't let them know

91
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,260
I'm from Qingqiu.

92
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,860
It seems that without suffering,

93
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,260
you won't know

94
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,100
how powerful we inseparable king birds are.

95
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,100
Guards!

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,260
Take them to the prison

97
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,180
to wait for execution!

98
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,220
- Yes! - Yes!

99
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:07,940
Go!

100
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,860
That girl

101
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,620
looks familiar.

102
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,300
Brother, you finally wake up!

103
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,420
You freaked me out.

104
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,580
Are you OK?

105
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,140
Brother, what're you doing?

106
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,100
Brother,

107
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,820
where are you going?

108
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,340
You were knocked out a moment ago.

109
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,380
The pharmacist said you should rest well.

110
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,460
Jielu,

111
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,580
you said I was knocked out?

112
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,380
Right!

113
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
And you were knocked out by two people.

114
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,700
Is my secret trip outside

115
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,860
the imperial palace exposed?

116
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,500
That I haven't heard of.

117
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,820
However, for us inseparable king birds,

118
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,340
traditionally, unmarried men
are not allowed to leave the valley alone.

119
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,180
Brother, why do you break the rule repeatedly?

120
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,700
You know that I've longed for

121
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,940
the colorful world outside the valley

122
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,060
and wanted to experience the outside world for a long time.

123
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,900
I've waited so long for the Jiazi Valley to open,

124
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,060
but now it's all ruined.

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,420
If...

126
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,980
If Her Majesty finds out...

127
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,660
Well...

128
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,620
So...

129
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,460
So I sneaked out.

130
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,020
Well,

131
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,380
where are the two people who knocked me out?

132
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,660
After hearing that they knocked you out,

133
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,820
Her Majesty ordered to put them into prison.

134
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,300
Just let me finish.

135
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,860
Luckily, you're not severely injured,

136
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,220
so they've been sent to the water dungeon instead.

137
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,500
I was the one who made the mistake.

138
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,060
I certainly can't get them in trouble.

139
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,140
Jielu, do you who knocked me out?

140
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,540
I only know it's a man and a woman.

141
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,820
Brother,

142
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,420
wait for me!

143
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,260
Get out!

144
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,060
Where're you taking me?

145
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,940
The water dungeon.

146
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,180
The water dungeon?

147
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,780
You birds do have many tricks.

148
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,900
Cut the crap!

149
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,940
Still feeling dizzy after falling down just now,

150
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,940
I don't feel like having a fight.

151
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,260
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to capture me.

152
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,300
Knocking out the prince of the inseparable king birds

153
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,620
can either be big or small.

154
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,180
If he can't wake up,

155
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,260
it's a big deal.

156
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,580
If he wakes up,

157
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,620
with others interceding for us,

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,340
there's hope.

159
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,940
Hurry up! Hurry up!

160
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,580
Her Majesty ordered

161
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,420
to escort them to the Palace Hall immediately.

162
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,780
It seems that he has woken up.

163
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,900
I just heard from the Second Prince that

164
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,220
you're the prince and princess of

165
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,500
the night owls across the river.

166
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,340
Admiring the Imperial College of our clan,

167
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,300
you took a study tour here.

168
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,780
You injured the Second Prince by accident.

169
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,260
Why did the Second Prince make up such a lie?

170
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,820
It appears that it's a misunderstanding after all.

171
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,620
Sorry for making you suffer.

172
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,380
You're honored guests coming from afar.

173
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,340
Well,

174
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,460
we should treat you well.

175
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,700
Thank you, Your Majesty!

176
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,660
Thank you, Your Majesty!

177
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,500
Since you admire our Imperial College,

178
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,940
I'll allow you to live in the Jifeng Courtyard of

179
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,180
the Imperial College.

180
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,180
On the one hand, your sincere wish

181
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,060
to study in the Imperial College can be satisfied.

182
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,260
On the other hand, it's convenient
for younger generations of our two clans

183
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,660
to exchange and compete with each other.

184
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,900
What do you think?

185
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,420
Your Majesty, thank you for your careful
and considerate arrangement.

186
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,060
We can't thank you enough.

187
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,780
We'll definitely study hard in the Imperial College.

188
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,180
Mother,

189
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,620
then I'll take them to the Jifeng Courtyard.

190
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,700
Go ahead.

191
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,820
Please.

192
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,500
Let's go!

193
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Go!

194
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,340
Wait outside.

195
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,340
Yes!

196
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,500
Your Highness, thank you for saving us on the hall just now.

197
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,860
But there's one thing we really can't understand.

198
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,100
Are you wondering

199
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,740
why I saved you?

200
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,420
Frankly speaking,

201
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,940
it's also for my own good.

202
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,980
You mean?

203
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
I went out of the valley without permission.

204
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,660
If my mother finds out,

205
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,060
she won't spare me easily.

206
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,260
But now,

207
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,900
you're safe,

208
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,500
and I can avoid being punished.

209
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,940
Please keep the secret for me.

210
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Your Highness, rest assured.

211
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,900
However,

212
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,660
when can we get out of the valley?

213
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,900
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for another 60 years.

214
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,060
60 years!

215
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,300
It's so long!

216
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,060
It's a long story.

217
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,300
We inseparable king birds

218
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,740
are born fragile and delicate.

219
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,300
A tiny bit of foul air in the mortal realm can make us sick.

220
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,100
Therefore,

221
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,740
many years ago, our ancestors

222
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,220
found the Fanyin Valley after untold hardships

223
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,860
and led our entire clan to live a reclusive life in the valley.

224
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,900
Does this have anything to do with us leaving the valley?

225
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,460
Take it easy.

226
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,660
I haven't finished yet.

227
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,580
There's foul air sealed at the core of our valley.

228
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,940
If we open the valley too often,

229
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,540
the foul air might leak.

230
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,540
Once the Fanyin Valley is polluted,

231
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,780
the Four Seas and Eight Deserts will be in danger.

232
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,940
So the Fanyin Valley only opens every 60 years,

233
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,060
and it only opens a crack

234
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,300
for a short period of time, so that

235
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,020
immortal messengers from the Sky Kingdom

236
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,420
on business to the valley can pass.

237
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,700
The day you fell down
happens to be the opening date of the valley.

238
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,100
Well,

239
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,860
is there any other way to get out?

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,740
Even the most perceptive immortal messenger from heaven

241
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,020
needs to practice for three thousand years

242
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,020
to pass that crack.

243
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,940
So long...

244
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,060
Take it easy.

245
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,820
Fate had us meet each other this way.

246
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,380
I'm Xiang Limeng.

247
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,780
I wonder what your names are.

248
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,980
You can call me Xiaojiu.

249
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,620
Xiaojiu?

250
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,540
Terrific!

251
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,900
The princess of the night owls whose identity you've borrowed

252
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,060
also has "Jiu" in her name.

253
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,980
She's named Jiuge.

254
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,740
It'll be convenient for you

255
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,620
to use her name in the Fanyin Valley later.

256
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,780
Then I'll call you Jiuge.

257
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,300
OK! Good!

258
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,220
The Jifeng Courtyard has two rooms,
the east room and the west room.

259
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,900
Feel relieved to live here.

260
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,100
Whatever you need, just tell the servants.

261
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,180
Your Highness, you're really considerate.

262
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,780
Just call me Meng.

263
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,740
Bro, I wonder how I should address you.

264
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,540
Warrior Yan!

265
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,420
Just call me Yan.

266
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,900
Jiuge. Yan.

267
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,460
Have a good rest then.

268
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm leaving.

269
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,100
I'll take the east room.

270
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,540
You can have the west room.

271
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,940
It's weird.

272
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,820
After entering the Fanyin Valley,

273
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,060
he seems infatuated.

274
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,300
What's wrong with him?

275
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,540
Get up!

276
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,700
What's wrong with you?

277
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,980
Get up now!

278
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,220
It's late at night! Why should I get up

279
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
instead of sleeping?

280
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
We've been trapped in the valley

281
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,140
for so long.

282
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,340
Rather than sit here and wait,

283
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,900
we'd better figure a way out on our own.

284
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,660
Meng said

285
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,940
there's no way other than waiting for the valley to open.

286
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,820
Hurry up and practice magic arts with me.

287
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:01,860
Xiaojiu!

288
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,980
Without telling me the destination,

289
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,780
how could I know where to go with my magic arts?

290
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,220
Here you are! It's for you!

291
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,860
Well...

292
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,620
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,580
I'm leaving.

294
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,220
It's so weird!

295
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,100
I've practiced the magic arts to get out of the city.

296
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,340
How come I'm back again?

297
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,260
What about you?

298
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,380
Have you got out of the city?

299
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,100
The Fanyin Valley is really weird.

300
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,060
Xiaojiu, Meng said that

301
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,700
even the most perceptive immortal messenger from heaven

302
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,660
needs to practice for three thousand years

303
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,980
to pass that crack.

304
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,940
Your tiny bit of magic arts won't work!

305
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,140
No!

306
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
I have to try again.

307
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,820
Jiuge, how come...

308
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,220
How come...

309
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,780
Well, it's a mistake! It's a mistake!

310
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,500
Sorry to interrupt!

311
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,180
You!

312
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,060
You!

313
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,260
You!

314
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,660
What happened?

315
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,540
It's so scary! It's so scary!

316
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,660
Luckily, I ran away fast.

317
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,340
Xiaojiu,

318
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,540
you're still there.

319
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,540
I told you it's useless.

320
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,020
It's midnight already.

321
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,060
Let's wash up and go to bed.

322
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,020
Haven't we made an appointment with Meng tomorrow morning?

323
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,540
I'm going to sleep.

324
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,940
Fine. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

325
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,420
Chong Lin,

326
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,420
when will winter come?

327
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,460
Your Majesty,

328
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,860
winter will come in half a year.

329
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,980
Protected by Tiangang Shield,

330
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,700
she'll be safe within half a year.

331
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,020
Your Majesty, who are you talking about?

332
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,940
You may leave.

333
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,300
Yes.

334
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,140
Sir,

335
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,980
come and have a look.

336
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,140
Here are more.

337
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,940
Warrior Yan,

338
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,780
I thought you would be worried that

339
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,100
we couldn't get out of the city.

340
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,180
It seems you're not worried at all.

341
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,980
With wine and meat,

342
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,180
as well as me, a handsome warrior, by your side,

343
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,460
what to be worried about?

344
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,780
Normally,

345
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,660
unruly as you are,

346
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,780
you wouldn't give up

347
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,100
without putting up a fight.

348
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,460
I thought you would rather stay in the water dungeon

349
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,620
than suffer the pain of reading books.

350
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,540
I didn't expect that after staring blankly for a while,

351
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,620
you just obeyed the arrangement of Her Majesty obediently.

352
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,700
Are you interested in that woman in white?

353
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,820
I just can't get it.

354
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,020
There're so many women in white in the world.

355
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,220
Warrior Yan,

356
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,380
will you answer my question.

357
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,060
Whatever you say,

358
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,060
I know you're anxious

359
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,500
because the ice face hasn't come to save you yet.

360
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,420
Of course.

361
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,940
I offended His Majesty before.

362
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,420
I didn't expect him to save me

363
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,380
in just two or three days.

364
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm offering him a transitional period

365
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,700
to calm down.

366
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,380
A grudge holder as he is,

367
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,540
how can you wait for him to save you?

368
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,140
As long as His Majesty

369
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,460
comes to my rescue within a month,

370
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,740
I will generously forgive him

371
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,860
for sending me to Mount Fuyu

372
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,540
and leaving me here to suffer.

373
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,380
That being said,

374
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,820
he should be able to get in.

375
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,020
With powerful magic arts accomplishments,

376
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,100
His Majesty

377
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,180
can go

378
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,620
wherever he wants.

379
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,420
Good.

380
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,620
Meng!

381
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,020
Come on! Have a drink!

382
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,380
Come on! Come on! Come on!

383
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,220
Come here! Come here!

384
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,900
I've been looking for you everywhere.

385
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,260
I didn't know you're here.

386
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,180
Jiuge,

387
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,340
why don't you take a bite?

388
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,940
Are you still thinking about leaving the valley?

389
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,220
I wanted to practice the teleportation trick that day

390
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,820
to see whether I could leave the city or not.

391
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,220
Unexpectedly, the trick suddenly failed.

392
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,500
So...

393
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,060
I forgot to tell you.

394
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,300
Magic arts can only be practiced
within the capital of the Fanyin Valley.

395
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,500
Once you step outside the capital,

396
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,980
even for half a step,

397
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,580
you won't be able to practice magic arts.

398
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
I see.

399
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,220
Sorry for offending you that day.

400
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,980
I, Xiaojiu...

401
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,340
I, Jiuge would like to propose a toast to you.

402
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:27,940
OK.

403
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,740
Just drink. Why do you talk so much?

404
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,140
Drink!

405
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,340
Sister Fengjiu! Sister Fengjiu!

406
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,700
Li!

407
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm here to save you!

408
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,220
Li,

409
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,140
I didn't care for you for nothing.

410
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:39,860
Let's go!

411
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,700
Sister Fengjiu,

412
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,540
with you on the cloud, I can't practice the cloud-riding trick.

413
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,100
Don't you have Wind Fire Wheels?

414
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,860
No!

415
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,380
My wheels will be crushed.

416
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,740
Sister Fengjiu,

417
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,900
can you wait here.

418
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,140
I'll look for help.

419
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,420
Li!

420
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,660
Li!

421
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,420
Li!

422
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,060
Li!

423
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,060
The knowledge of forging weapons

424
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,860
is profound and abstruse.

425
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,340
For example,

426
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,780
there're many ways to forge a sword.

427
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,180
As to choosing which way...

428
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,100
Yan.

429
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,460
...it depends on your own cultivation and aptitude.

430
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,260
Master knows nothing about

431
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,060
forging weapons,

432
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,540
but he actually talks nonsense

433
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,260
with a serious look.

434
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,180
He's shamelessly boastful!

435
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,140
Jiuge.

436
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,620
Do you have any question?

437
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,380
Master, well,

438
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,260
I want to ask

439
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,020
if I want to forge a short knife,

440
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,340
which can turn into either a sword

441
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,980
or a crossbow

442
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,900
and shoot hidden weapons when necessary,

443
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
how should I design the mechanism

444
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,140
for such a weapon.

445
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,540
Forging knives and swords depends on aptitude and cultivation.

446
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,740
Normal women had better read more books.

447
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,100
Master, you haven't answered my question yet.

448
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,420
Master, actually,

449
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,220
I've already drawn a sketch.

450
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,780
Please give me some advice.

451
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,660
You don't have to waste time

452
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,980
in these useless stuff.

453
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,420
Since you've got nothing to do,

454
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,580
you should go back and copy the Weapon Theories for five times

455
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,100
to remove the fickleness.

456
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,900
Master,

457
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,980
don't you know the answer?

458
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,620
You!

459
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,140
Master is gone.

460
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,340
He obviously knows nothing.

461
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,380
Let's go! Go!

462
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,020
Let's go!

463
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,500
Go! Go!

464
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,700
Come on, I'll take you to eat something delicious.

465
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,620
Let's go!

466
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,300
Xiaojiu, is that old man gone?

467
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,380
Yes.

468
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,580
Then I'll go to the temperament class.

469
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,180
You're actually interested in temperament!

470
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,740
Ji Heng,

471
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,340
I know you're here!

472
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,020
Do you know

473
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,900
how hard I've tried to find you?

474
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,380
How's your poison?

475
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,460
How do you feel?

476
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,300
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

477
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm Yan! Yan Chiwu!

478
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,140
Have you lost your memories again?

479
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,980
I'm the musician of this place.

480
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,700
I'm not Ji Heng.

481
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,620
Mr. Yan,

482
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,500
I'm afraid you're too caught up in the past.

483
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,180
Is it fun?

484
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,860
Wait!

485
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,460
Let me ask you.

486
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,900
Is it fun to you?

487
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,100
You!

488
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Wait for me!

489
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,180
What're you doing?

490
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,860
What a rude boor! Who are you?

491
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm the future Green Demon Lord.

492
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,820
Yan Chiwu!

493
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,620
Instead of paying respects to my elder brother,

494
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,900
you come to mess with me.

495
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,260
I'll tell my elder brother

496
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,700
to dismiss you from your position as the Demon Lord.

497
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,020
Wait!

498
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,140
Elder brother?

499
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,900
You must be Princess Ji Heng!

500
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,540
You're so cute!

501
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,500
You want to speak with Demon Lord Xu Yang.

502
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,580
I can go with you.

503
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,700
I'll ask your elder brother to make you my wife.

504
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,060
Cut the crap!

505
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,300
Princess Ji Heng,

506
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,900
I'll protect you. Wait for me!

507
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,500
Though you're wearing a veil,

508
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,260
I can still recognize you.

509
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,260
Moreover,

510
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,100
your voice remains the same.

511
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,780
Why don't you admit who you are? Is there a problem?

512
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,420
Last time, we talked happily together.

513
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,180
Did I piss you off somehow?

514
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,820
Why did you leave suddenly?

515
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,300
Was it because you don't like my palace.

516
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,100
Sure you don't.

517
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,180
It's not as peaceful and quiet as this place.

518
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:28,900
Rest assured.

519
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,940
When I go back, I'll...

520
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,580
Mr. Yan,

521
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm just an idler in the valley.

522
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Please stop wasting time on me.

523
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,300
Fine.

524
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,940
Whether you're Ji Heng or a musician,

525
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,260
it doesn't matter.

526
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,940
After all, I've found you.

527
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,500
As long as you stay in this valley,

528
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,340
I will go nowhere else.

529
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,820
I can protect you right here.

530
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,900
It's a deal!

531
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,900
Keep watering the flowers.

532
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,860
I won't disturb you.

533
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,740
The student tournament held by the Imperial College

534
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,060
every ten years is about to come.

535
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:11,900
Meng!

536
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,780
Meng!

537
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,340
Why did you have to lie that

538
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,980
we admire

539
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,740
the Imperial College

540
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,940
of your clan?

541
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Because of that,

542
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,620
I have to

543
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,300
attend this class now.

544
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,660
I...

545
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,740
Jiuge,

546
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,900
have you finished the task of book copying
I assigned you last time?

547
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,140
Master,

548
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,900
here's the thing.

549
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,620
I was

550
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,220
busy forging that short knife,

551
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,300
so I was too tired to engage myself

552
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,140
in useless stuff such as book copying.

553
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,980
I beg your pardon.

554
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,740
Go back and copy the Weapon Theories

555
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,420
for five more times!

556
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,660
Let's go.

557
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,900
Class is dismissed.

558
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,660
Go! Go! Go!

559
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,860
Jiuge!

560
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,700
Jiuge,

561
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,780
the tournament is about to start.

562
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,700
Will you sign up?

563
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,180
Tournament?

564
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,380
Look at you! You got distracted in class again!

565
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,900
The tournament of the inseparable king birds

566
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,260
is held every ten years.

567
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,620
This year, far more students have signed up,

568
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,620
and they are more excited than ever.

569
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,020
What's so special about

570
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,300
this tournament?

571
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,780
Those signing up this year

572
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,420
are so excited because of the prize.

573
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,820
What's the prize?

574
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,540
It's the pimpon fruit.

575
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
The pimpon fruit?

576
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,180
There is a kind of tree named pimpon,

577
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,580
which blossoms once every ten years

578
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
and bears fruits once every ten years.

579
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,460
According to the age of the tree,

580
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,620
the fruits can have different uses.

581
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,380
Fruits of certain age

582
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,860
can not only make a mortal back to life,

583
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,460
but can also turn a mortal into an immortal.

584
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,140
Isn't that the pimpon fruit

585
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,980
which can save Ye Qingti?

586
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,220
Jiuge, what did you say?

587
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,740
I mean

588
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,180
I've heard that

589
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,500
the pimpon fruit is really rare.

590
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,780
The pimpon tree blooms every ten years

591
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
and bears fruits every ten years.

592
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,740
Moreover, each tree can only bear one fruit.

593
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,140
The effects of these fruits are different

594
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,900
according to their harvest time.

595
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
It's so precious!

596
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:13,900
So it is!

597
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,500
The pimpon tree used to be

598
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,580
one of the five magic trees in the Sky Kingdom.

599
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,940
Somehow,

600
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,500
these trees all stopped bearing fruits.

601
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,820
Now in heaven and on earth,

602
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,580
only the pimpon tree beside the Jieyou Spring
inside the Fanyin Valley can bear fruits.

603
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,020
Well,

604
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,540
what's the effect of this pimpon fruit?

605
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,980
I heard that as to the fruit this year,

606
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,140
for mortals, it can add flesh to bones

607
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,620
and resurrect the dead,

608
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,820
and for immortals, it can improve cultivation

609
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,300
and maintain youth and beauty forever.

610
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,620
Compared to the peach in the Sky Kingdom,

611
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,940
it's far better.

612
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,220
Add flesh to bones and resurrect the dead.

613
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,100
Right.

614
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,620
The bones can also be turned into an immortal body.

615
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,580
Then I'll go and sign up.

616
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,780
Jiuge,

617
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,660
it only works on mortals.

618
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,540
As an immortal,

619
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,340
it won't work on you.

620
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,700
Didn't you just say

621
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,340
by eating it, immortals can maintain youth and beauty forever?

622
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,300
I see.

623
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,300
However,

624
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,700
the students signing up this year are more than ever.

625
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,020
Due to limited competition place,

626
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,140
my mother has ordered Master to screen the candidates in advance.

627
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
Only by passing his test

628
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,260
can the candidates get to the final.

629
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,660
To be screened by Master.

630
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,340
Well,

631
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,260
I've offended him repeatedly.

632
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,660
He won't let me get to the final for sure.

633
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,020
Jiuge, what're you murmuring about?

634
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,740
Nothing.

635
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,260
I said I have to go and sign up.

636
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,020
The pimpon fruit?

637
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,060
It's extremely good

638
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,420
for neutralizing my dark energy.

639
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,820
If the pimpon fruit can really resurrect the dead,

640
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,380
Qingti, I'll definitely save you.

641
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,460
I know you've got nothing good for me.

642
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,100
You've followed the bad example of the ice face.

643
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,620
Now you even smile as wickedly as he is.

644
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,140
If you have the strength to yell,

645
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,860
you might as well copy more characters for me.

646
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,460
Remember to imitate my handwriting.

647
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,180
You are really demanding!

648
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,220
How come it's so thick?

649
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,580
Didn't Master only punish you to copy the book for ten times?

650
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,740
I've offended

651
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,380
that local tyrant.

652
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,340
Also,

653
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,660
in order to join the competition,

654
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,740
I can take temporary setbacks

655
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,140
to curry favor with him. Is that OK?

656
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,500
He asked me to copy the book for ten times.

657
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,580
I'll copy it for twenty times.

658
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,540
I'm kind of trying to please him.

659
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,740
Isn't it too implicit?

660
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,180
Really?

661
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,940
May Master Ji Han

662
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,580
live a long and happy life.

663
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,460
May Mater Ji Han

664
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,860
live a blessed and prosperous life.

665
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,700
What do you think? Will this please him?

666
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,940
If he doesn't feel like reading to the end,

667
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,140
you've wasted time writing these words.

668
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,540
Well,

669
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,780
then I'll put the disgusting flattery

670
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,700
in front.

671
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,740
What do you think?

672
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,060
I think it's OK.

673
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,380
Wait!

674
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,780
What on earth is his name?

675
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,220
Ji Han or Han Ji?

676
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,940
Isn't he called "Master"?

677
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,740
Does he have another name?

678
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,380
Your Majesty,

679
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,580
why do you summon me late at night?

680
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,940
It's for the Miaoyi Chasm.

681
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,140
Your Majesty, thanks to your righteousness,

682
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,060
after secluding yourself for seven days and seven nights,

683
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,580
you created the Miaoyi Chasm

684
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,940
at the cost of your own cultivation,

685
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,660
thus keeping the mortal realm safe
for hundreds of thousands of years.

686
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,140
Judged from Your Majesty's look,

687
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,740
is there anything wrong with the Miaoyi Chasm?

688
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,420
The Miaoyi Chasm quaked three hundred years ago.

689
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,220
I took many days to mend it,

690
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,020
only to postpone

691
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,380
its collapse.

692
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,540
How long can it last?

693
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,980
I don't know, either.

694
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,260
I invite you over

695
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,580
to work out a strategy.

696
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,540
If the Miaoyi Chasm collapses,

697
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,860
it will be a disaster for all men and gods.

698
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
It's a life-and-death matter of heaven and earth.

699
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,580
We must consider carefully before making a decision.

700
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,580
Exactly.

701
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,620
Ever-victorious General,

702
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,980
why are you so dispirited with your head down?

703
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,060
Are you missing Her Highness Fengjiu from Qingqiu?

704
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,140
Just like me.

705
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,620
Take good care of it.

706
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,620
Yes!

707
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,260
Meng!

708
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,780
Jiuge,

709
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,420
can you be more ladylike?

710
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,140
Can you walk like a lady?

711
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,420
What's wrong with the way I walk?

712
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,860
I do walk like a lady.

713
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:17,940
Forget it.

714
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,340
What can I do for you?

715
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,820
Meng,

716
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,500
do you know the name of Master?

717
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,060
Master?

718
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,420
Why do you suddenly ask me this?

719
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,180
You must have thought of a prank.

720
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,300
What're you talking about?

721
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,060
Am I so mischievous?

722
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,900
Do you know it or not?

723
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,700
I actually don't know his real name.

724
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,100
I've called him "Master" since childhood.

725
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,940
It's weird.

726
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,940
How come his name

727
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,340
is even more confidential

728
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,260
than a girl's name?

729
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,580
I don't believe that

730
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,100
no one

731
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,100
in the entire Imperial College

732
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
knows his name!

733
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,140
Just wait!

734
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,860
I'll ask whoever I see later.

735
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
I can definitely get his name.

736
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,140
Wish you good luck!

737
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,300
Your Majesty,

738
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,140
Immortal Official Chong Lin, the Chief Immortal Messenger
of Tai Chen Palace has sent the word that

739
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,660
the tea class scheduled tomorrow

740
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,940
will be taught by another immortal official.

741
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,660
Busy as immortal official is,

742
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,620
we feel honored that he's willing to give a lecture in our clan.

743
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,980
Inform the Master. Ask him to arrange it properly.

744
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,380
Yes.

745
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,260
Isn't that His Majesty?

746
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:03,980
Yes.

747
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,140
Since His Majesty is gonna give the lecture

748
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,100
in the Fanyin Valley as usual,

749
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,340
why do you ask me to give the lecture about tea on his behalf?

750
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,780
Here's the thing.

751
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,500
Last night, His Majesty and His Highness Lian Song
discussed something important.

752
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,060
I thought he wouldn't come,

753
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,980
so I asked you to give the lecture on his behalf as usual.

754
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,580
I didn't expect

755
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,980
His Majesty would come.

756
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,780
With the Eight Deserts and Six Directions to be concerned about,

757
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,220
His Majesty even remembers to give a lecture.

758
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,540
The world is so blessed to have him as the emperor.

759
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,820
Your Excellency, sorry for bothering you.

760
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,180
Now that His Majesty is here in person,

761
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,060
Your Excellency may as well go back to the Sky Kingdom.

762
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,060
See you.

763
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,740
His Majesty didn't ask me to accompany him this time.

764
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,340
He actually went there alone.

765
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,780
Is he not here

766
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,580
for the Miaoyi Chasm?

767
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,780
OK. OK. OK.

768
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,900
Hurry up! Hurry up!

769
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,460
That's all?

770
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,020
Yes.

771
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,740
Princess Jielu,

772
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,060
I wonder why you set

773
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,020
these traps.

774
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,620
Right.

775
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,260
Haven't you heard Master yesterday?

776
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,340
Today, an immortal official

777
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,740
good at tea theories will give a lecture about tea instead.

778
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,820
I want to use these traps

779
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,260
to scare him away.

780
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,540
But if he's scared away,

781
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,020
no one will give us the lecture.

782
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,740
That's exactly what I want.

783
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
In that way,

784
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
the lecture can be given by the original master.

785
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,460
Right!

786
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,460
Your Highness, you're so clever.

787
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,780
Clever?

788
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,900
I find her too naive.

789
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,220
I wonder who on earth

790
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,180
that beloved and respected master is.

791
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:02,980
Give me a hand.

792
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,740
I know you love him deeply,

793
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,660
but he pays no attention to you.

794
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,580
You're as far apart as heaven and earth.

795
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,060
By doing so,

796
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,900
he might be annoyed

797
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,220
and may never give lectures in our clan again.

798
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,700
It's fine if he stops giving lectures here.

799
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,540
But if my mother wants to punish you for that,

800
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,140
don't blame me for not interceding for you.

801
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,860
If Her Majesty blames me,

802
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,740
I'll accept the punishment myself.

803
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,100
I don't need your help.

804
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,060
Then do you know

805
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,900
he's got a lover

806
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,420
in the Sky Kingdom.

807
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,580
When did that happen?

808
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,060
How come I've never heard about it?

809
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,500
I heard that though they haven't performed
the heaven-worshipping ritual,

810
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,020
he treats that fairy as his wife.

811
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,540
He not only treasures and favors her,

812
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,460
but sleeps and shares a bath with her.

813
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,580
Why are you crying?

814
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,500
Speaking of dandies in the Sky Kingdom,

815
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,220
Lian Song, the Third Prince of the Heavenly King,
is the most famous.

816
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,900
But I've heard nothing about him

817
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,860
sleeping and sharing a bath with a woman
before performing the heaven-worshipping ritual.

818
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,580
Which immortal official on earth is so wild and absurd?

819
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,260
It's quite impressive actually.

820
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,780
Stop crying!

821
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,660
I suck at dealing with girl's tears.

822
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,940
If you stop crying,

823
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll help you set the trap, OK?

824
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,540
I'll also cover for you in front of my mother.

825
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,820
You said that on purpose.

826
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,940
You love the Princess of Qingqiu secretly,

827
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,900
but your love is not responded,

828
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,900
so you hope that everyone in the world

829
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,820
can end up alone

830
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,700
and unaccompanied like you are.

831
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,740
Stop talking nonsense!

832
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,180
You're the one who talked nonsense!

833
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,860
Noble and unsullied as master is,

834
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,180
how could he do that?

835
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,220
I don't believe you!

836
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,660
Not a word!

837
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,180
Why is Her Highness crying?

838
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:10,740
Unbelievable!

839
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,220
The Princess of Qingqiu?

840
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,900
I didn't expect that in such a remote place,

841
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,020
there's still a young man so dejected

842
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,580
because of my aunt!

843
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,820
Awesome!

844
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,580
Jiuge,

845
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,620
come here.

846
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,300
Meng, what's up?

847
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,860
What's wrong?

848
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,020
You told me you're quite familiar with

849
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,700
setting traps.

850
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:35,940
Help me check this out.

851
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,740
To me,

852
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,460
Jielu's sketch has many flaws.

853
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,780
Now that she wants to set a trap,

854
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,820
we'd better make sure
the substitute teacher won't be able to get out

855
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,740
for two or three days to give the lecture

856
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,220
once he falls into the trap.

857
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,820
Let me see!

858
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,540
Look.

859
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,380
Here.

860
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
It's too rough.

861
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,660
Just remove it.

862
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,500
Also, here.

863
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,860
Practice a magic art here

864
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,900
to link it with the Sixing River,

865
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,300
and then just cover it up.

866
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,220
Later when he falls into the trap,

867
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,820
we won't be able to see him for over ten days.

868
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,660
Is that too ruthless?

869
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,100
If he blames us after going back,

870
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,660
what should we do?

871
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,540
What about this?

872
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,860
Fill the bottom of the pit with lethargy formula.

873
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,020
Make sure to cover it up tightly.

874
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,180
Once he falls into the pit,

875
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,540
he can sleep for as long as three days and three nights.

876
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,540
But it's also troublesome when he condemns us after waking up.

877
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,780
What can we do?

878
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,620
What about making him drift down

879
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,140
the Sixing River?
