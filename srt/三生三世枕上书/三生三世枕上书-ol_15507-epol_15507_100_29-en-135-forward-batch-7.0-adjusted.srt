00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 29

3
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,300
Jiuge, it's almost done.

4
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,980
Come to have a look.

5
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,780
How deep it is!

6
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,900
It's done.

7
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,780
Everything is ready.

8
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,820
Just wait to see the unlucky immortal uncle to fall into it.

9
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,820
Meng, I'm leaving first.

10
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,660
Remember

11
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,060
to tell me the course of the uncle's falling into the hole

12
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
in detail.

13
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,780
OK.

14
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,820
Bye.

15
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,580
You set up the trap.

16
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,860
Why don't stay to see the fun?

17
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
Lower your voice.

18
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,340
Do you want everybody to know that

19
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,180
I am absent from school?

20
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,380
Where are you going?

21
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,660
In the first class this afternoon,

22
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,660
it's said that the Master will announce

23
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,780
the names of those finally selected to attend
the student tournament.

24
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,300
I have to go back to copy the book,

25
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,620
otherwise all that I have copied will be in vain.

26
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,300
Then hurry to go back.

27
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,260
I will tell you in detail later.

28
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,300
Deal.

29
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,580
It's so strange.

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,340
Why isn't the Master in the academy?

31
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,940
My respects to you, Third Prince.

32
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,060
You have something to turn to His Majesty?

33
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,060
Third Prince, it is something you don't know.

34
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,140
The day before yesterday, the Buddha from Sukhavati came

35
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,620
to talk about Buddhist texts with His Majesty.

36
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,460
Actually he came to discuss the Miaoyi Chasm.

37
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,980
I thought the two supreme immortals

38
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,900
would discuss for a long time.

39
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Unexpectedly, His Majesty had another appointment.

40
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,140
It's such an important thing which is related to the survival
and downfall of the heaven and earth.

41
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,380
He even failed to keep the appointment.

42
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,540
Probably he really had something to do.

43
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,900
Taking the chance of getting back

44
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,500
His Majesty's Book of Fate in the human world,

45
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,340
today I want to pay a visit to him again.

46
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,660
I'm wondering if...

47
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,340
He is not in.

48
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,220
It's both coincidental and not.

49
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,860
I don't understand. Please explain it to me, Third Prince.

50
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,940
Coincidentally, it has something to do with you and me.

51
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,940
Unfortunately,

52
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,500
His Majesty won't be back in a short time.

53
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,900
He is coming.

54
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,540
The immortal uncle is coming.

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,300
Master is coming.

56
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,020
The immortal uncle is coming.

57
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,980
He is coming.

58
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,020
Hurry up.

59
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,260
This...

60
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,660
This...

61
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,460
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

62
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,260
Rise.

63
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,940
This way, please. Your Majesty.

64
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:37,740
You!

65
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,020
This...

66
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Ice face, stop here.

67
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,780
How dare you come again?

68
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,740
If it hadn't been for you,

69
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,260
I wouldn't have been trapped in Fanyin Valley

70
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,500
for half a year.

71
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,820
I will take revenge on you.

72
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,540
Shut up.

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,500
How bold you are!

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,980
How dare you be so rude to His Majesty?

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Rush back.

76
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,020
Rush back.

77
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,740
Please calm your anger, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,660
I should have controlled him rigidly.

79
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm sure to punish him after class.

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,460
Please sit here.

81
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,700
Your Majesty. Master.

82
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,140
It's a fine day today.

83
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,100
What about having lessons outside the academy?

84
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,860
Tea water is natural and fresh.

85
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,780
Taught in the White Dew Forest,

86
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,860
it's better for us students

87
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,380
to acquire the excellence of heaven and earth.

88
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,260
Yeah.

89
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,620
It's mischievous!

90
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,300
It's piercingly cold these days.

91
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,900
How could we bother His Majesty to teach outside?

92
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,860
After class,

93
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,820
you're all punished to copy texts.

94
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,060
Master, no need to be angry.

95
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,060
It's OK to teach outside.

96
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,500
Although it's windy today,

97
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,820
it's still sunny.

98
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,540
It's not bad to teach outside.

99
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,220
OK.

100
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,700
Your Majesty. Master.

101
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,780
Please go outside.

102
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,660
I've told you many times.

103
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,220
Since I am your master,

104
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,260
just call me master. That's OK.

105
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,180
OK.

106
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,660
Your Majesty, please go outside.

107
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,020
Won't you say thanks to me?

108
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,420
Say thanks?

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,980
Why?

110
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:20,980
Well,

111
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,500
don't you stay here

112
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,860
because of Ji Heng?

113
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,780
It's none of your business.

114
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,780
Listen.

115
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,420
They're not the same thing. Don't confuse them with each other.

116
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,980
Shut up.

117
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,260
You crazy!

118
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,660
How dare you be so rude to His Majesty?

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,700
Master, Master, Master.

120
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,740
Master.

121
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,340
I will send people to take the master out at once.

122
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,420
Hurry up.

123
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,140
Hurry up.

124
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,740
Go go go.

125
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,460
Hurry up.

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,420
Quickly.

127
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,220
What do you want to say?

128
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,100
Meng.

129
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,180
Where are you going?

130
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,940
What's wrong?

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,060
Jiuge.

132
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,500
The master said he would skin you.

133
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,740
Take care of yourself.

134
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,100
Since the master is so angry with me,

135
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,780
is it better for me to send

136
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,100
the handwritten copies to him as quickly as possible?

137
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,460
Yan. What are you doing?

138
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,220
Xiaojiu.

139
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,020
Is it good for me to

140
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,140
scratch like this

141
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
or first scratch like this

142
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,940
and then scratch like this?

143
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,540
I think scratching several times like this

144
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,180
will make you look heroic.

145
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,020
You also think

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,420
it's not heroic of me to behave always like this, right?

147
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,460
What's wrong with you?

148
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,180
What about growing a beard?

149
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,860
Have you taken the wrong medicine?

150
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,340
I'm talking seriously.

151
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,900
Ice face promised to me by himself that

152
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,660
he wouldn't intervene my contact with Ji Heng any more.

153
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,580
What are you talking? Who are Ice face and Ji Heng?

154
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,100
Tell me

155
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,620
why the master said he would skin me.

156
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,700
Didn't Meng tell you?

157
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,700
No.

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,220
Did I offend the Master?

159
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,180
Seeing that you're here

160
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,420
with no worry to escape,

161
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,860
I think you are a hero

162
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,060
in my heart.

163
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,260
It turns out to be that you know nothing.

164
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,260
Don't talk nonsense. Tell me quickly.

165
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,060
Why did the master say that he would skin me?

166
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,620
Actually there is nothing serious.

167
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,700
It's mingled hope and fear to you.

168
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,460
Is the idiom right?

169
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,780
It's the trap that you set up.

170
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,020
You failed to trap the one you wanted to trap

171
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,220
but the master who you are looking for.

172
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,980
When he lost his temper,

173
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,340
he...

174
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,060
Yan.

175
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,980
I feel so relieved.

176
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,620
Eventually you know that girls don't like to play with you

177
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,060
because you have

178
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,300
such a beautiful face.

179
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,300
In a word, it was the master

180
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,700
who fell into the trap.

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,980
What?

182
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,540
However, he is OK,

183
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,380
getting out of trap half an hour later.

184
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,380
Then he said he would skin you.

185
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,900
Since he will skin me,

186
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,140
I'm wondering if I should give the handwritten copy

187
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
to him.

188
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,180
In my opinion, even if you presented them to him
while kneeling and bowling,

189
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,980
he won't forgive you.

190
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,340
What can I do?

191
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,500
Don't worry.

192
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,300
As I said,

193
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,700
ice face...

194
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,540
Jiuge, stand there.

195
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,860
I haven't finished my words yet.

196
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,940
It's more important to escape.

197
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,780
Isn't she looking forward to His Majesty's arrival?

198
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,100
His Majesty.

199
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,460
How could His Majesty

200
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,860
turn up here now?

201
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,940
Since he didn't come here in time half a year ago,

202
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,100
it's not possible for him to come here half a year later.

203
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,060
Naturally he should be somewhere

204
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,020
in the Sky Kingdom now,

205
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,420
fishing while reading Buddhist texts.

206
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,060
I must be haunted by ghosts today.

207
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,020
I'm afraid it's I who is haunted by ghosts.

208
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,260
Master.

209
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,060
I almost fell into your trap.

210
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,180
Escape.

211
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,380
Escape.

212
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,100
Where can you escape?

213
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,900
According to what you did today,

214
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,700
you will be punished to stay in the water dungeon.

215
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,140
Do you think you are undeserved?

216
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,100
Master, please calm your anger first.

217
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,860
I...

218
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,140
I... You... Look.

219
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,100
Look. Master.

220
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
You asked me to copy the texts for 10 times.

221
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,500
I have copied them for 20 times.

222
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,100
Since I am so sincere,

223
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,540
please forgive me.

224
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,380
Besides, it's so cold.

225
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,180
Staying in the water dungeon,

226
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,980
I will be so frozen that my immortal body will be hurt.

227
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,860
For the sake of the good relationship

228
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,060
between night owl clan and you inseparable king bird clan,

229
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,540
Master,

230
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,860
please don't be too hard on me this time.
Have a little punishment, OK?

231
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,740
How dare you bargain with me?

232
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,020
I'm going to use the immortal restraint strap

233
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,900
to lock your immortal bounties

234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,540
and make you learn a lesson.

235
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,580
Just punish me.

236
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,900
It's no use talking something righteous.

237
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,500
If I frown,

238
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm not a hero.

239
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,700
OK.

240
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,780
If I can't teach you a lesson today,

241
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,740
I will resign my job in this Imperial College.

242
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,980
Go with me.

243
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,060
You ask her to stay in the water dungeon,

244
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,220
then who can serve me?

245
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,660
Your Majesty.

246
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,220
Your Majesty, this...

247
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,980
Do you know

248
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,740
why he escaped so quickly

249
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,140
Why are you not saying anything?

250
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,060
Are you not going to say anything
about what happened just now?

251
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,700
Are you expecting that I say thank you?

252
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,140
Could take that.

253
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,740
So you're here to save me?

254
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,300
Where were you half a year ago?

255
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,260
You remember me now.

256
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,860
Listen! I don't care.

257
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,300
Get out of the way.

258
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,980
Since I'm here to save you,

259
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
are there any differences between half a year ago or later?

260
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,580
Of course they're different.

261
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,300
Get out of the way.

262
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,580
So

263
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,940
you are in a huff?

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,420
No.

265
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,100
You still have feeling to play tricks on the Master.

266
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,100
In the valley, I don't think

267
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,260
you feel unhappy.

268
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,060
Then you can change yourself
into a silk handkerchief to experience it.

269
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,820
Change yourself into a silk handkerchief.
Then someone takes you to experience a duel,

270
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,060
with worry and fear all the way,

271
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,460
and finally fall into a cliff,

272
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,180
where you are trapped for half a year.

273
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,860
You can experience it.

274
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,340
See?

275
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,060
If you keep asking me such silly questions,

276
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,540
you will have the same fate

277
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,740
as this pine branch.

278
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,580
When I was little and one time when I lost my temper,

279
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,140
I have even quarreled with

280
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,100
the Buddha from the Sukhavati.

281
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,740
Although I didn't have a good end,

282
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,860
beaten by my father

283
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,980
with a big stick

284
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
bitterly,

285
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,940
yet only in this way can it show

286
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,740
the heroic spirit of the red fox of Qingqiu that

287
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,580
females are as excellent as their male peers.

288
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,700
Could you please tell me

289
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,340
who dares to challenge the Buddha

290
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
face to face in the world?

291
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,060
I dare.

292
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,540
Besides,

293
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,460
who in the world dares to say face to face

294
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,300
that you will be beaten

295
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,980
like a broken pine branch?

296
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,380
I made it.

297
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,580
So you admire yourself

298
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,140
very much,

299
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,660
feeling cool

300
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,140
and interesting?

301
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,220
Probably you are also angry.

302
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
As a big shot,

303
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,500
you can't stand being bullied.

304
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,500
It's likely that

305
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,980
you can't let me go safely.

306
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,900
Then let's have a fight

307
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,860
to end the gratitude and resentment between us
to make both of us feel refreshed.

308
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,740
Although it's most likely that it's you who can beat me

309
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,220
like a broken pine branch,

310
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,620
it all depends on our own abilities to

311
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,620
perform in the fight.

312
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,340
So you mean

313
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,260
you are very angry because you changed into a silk handkerchief

314
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
and were trapped here?

315
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,220
If I would like to try to

316
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,260
change into a silk handkerchief,

317
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,620
ordered by you at random,

318
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,740
maybe you won't be so angry, right?

319
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,700
It's not difficult.

320
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,260
Is it illusion?

321
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,980
I didn't ask you to change into a silk handkerchief.

322
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,340
Compared with the flower on my square silk handkerchief,

323
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,980
this one is much better.

324
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,820
White sandalwood.

325
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,380
Hold it firmly.

326
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,940
Don't drop it on the ground. I'm afraid of coldness.

327
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,900
What else are you afraid of?

328
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,300
♪ Falling flowers have a soft voice. ♪

329
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,860

Why don't you speak?

331
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,940
So it is.

332
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,180
One word from a man is as heavy as nine tripods.

333
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,820
Since you have changed yourself into a handkerchief on your own,

334
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,540
I won't let you down.

335
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,740

You are afraid of coldness, right?

338
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,980
Then I will bathe you in the water.

339
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,420
♪ She gets lovesick ♪

340
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,860
♪ when failing to see him. ♪

♪ Acacia sees time flying and the yearning between lovers. ♪

342
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,220
You said if it could work off my anger,

343
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
I could do anything. Right?

344
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,740
Then don't blame me for my being heartless and cruel.

345
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,140
♪ How much yearning she has for him? ♪

346
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,300

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,420
It seems that His Majesty didn't magically
change himself into this handkerchief randomly.

360
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,700
Maybe Ji Heng had ever given him a handkerchief.

361
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,260
When he shifted his shape,

362
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,980
unconsciously he became

363
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,420
that handkerchief.

364
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,260
Jiuge, you were scared yesterday.

365
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,820
Today I specially prepare a feast to apologize to you.

366
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,700
Let's drink.

367
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,980
It was really dangerous yesterday.

368
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,980
Luckily the Master fell into the trap

369
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,260
instead of the master.

370
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,940
It was clearly reported that
an immortal uncle would come to teach us.

371
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,260
How could it be the master come by himself at last?

372
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,900
Is it true that His Majesty specially

373
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,660
came to save me?

374
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,180
The ice face...

375
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,740
No.

376
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,980
Does Dong Hua come here every ten years?

377
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,020
Yes.

378
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,980
The master comes to the valley
to give us lectures every ten years.

379
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,940
Speaking of this, I'm very angry.

380
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,820
Since the musician came to the Fanyin Valley,

381
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,340
she has been serving His Majesty every time
he comes to give lectures.

382
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,820
I heard that she is also an old acquaintance of His Majesty.

383
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,980
The musician has secluded herself.

384
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,700
She doesn't need to serve him, right?

385
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,220
As soon as His Majesty comes to the valley,

386
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,420
she stops secluding.

387
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,580
Yeah.

388
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,660
It's possible that she has moved to the

389
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,020
Yulin Garden where His Majesty often lives.

390
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,740
What?

391
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,380
No.

392
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,340
You really end your seclusion?

393
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,740
Ji Heng.

394
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,780
I met ice face in the valley.

395
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,100
He told me by himself

396
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,180
that you were here.

397
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,020
Now you can't deny.

398
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,940
Whether I am Ji Heng or not

399
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,300
is not very important.

400
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,500
Why?

401
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,900
Ice face told me that

402
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,700
he wouldn't intervene my contact with you anymore.

403
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,340
Things in the past have been canceled totally.

404
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,620
Ji Heng. You are free.

405
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,980
Demon Lord Yan. I...

406
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,540
Finally you admit me.

407
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm really grateful to you that you ever saved me,

408
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,860
but...

409
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,100
It has been for a long time.

410
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,580
Unworthy of mentioning.

411
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,780
Demon Lord Yan.

412
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,860
As for your kindness to me,

413
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,300
if there is a chance someday,

414
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm sure to repay your kindness.

415
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,820
It's just...

416
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,220
It's just His Majesty.

417
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,060
I owe much more to him.

418
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,980
I have sworn that

419
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,700
I will stay in the valley

420
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,940
to serve His Majesty whenever he comes.

421
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
So Demon Lord Yan.

422
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,820
Please don't waste your feelings on me.

423
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,660
I know you suffered much sorrow in the past.

424
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,100
However, it has gone.

425
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,500
I can accompany you

426
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,380
and tell you jokes every day. OK?

427
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,580
It's different.

428
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,940
Why?

429
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,740
No matter what ice face can do or not,

430
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,380
I can do it.

431
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,780
Don't serve him.

432
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,500
Let me serve you, OK?

433
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,820
To serve or not,

434
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,700
it's about His Majesty and me.

435
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,660
It's none of your business.

436
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,300
That's all.

437
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I'm going to

438
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,540
prepare the tea sets for His Majesty to use in the tea lesson.

439
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,300
Demon Lord Yan, you can do anything as you please.

440
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,300
Do you know

441
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
your coming without being invited

442
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,940
is not respectful.

443
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,020
Please go out

444
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,060
and close the door for me.

445
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,140
I don't think the ice face is good.

446
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,540
Why does Ji Heng constantly bear him in mind?

447
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,860
Having stayed in the Fanyin Valley for several days,

448
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,260
do you discover anything wrong with Miaoyi Chasm?

449
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,140
This is

450
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,900
the legendary time-folding magic?

451
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,740
As expected,

452
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,740
the dark energy is accumulated day by day.

453
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,700
Luckily, everything is still under control.

454
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,780
Several days later,

455
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,860
I will go to purify and suppress it by myself.

456
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,460
It has been bathed in water,

457
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,660
backed in fire

458
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,540
and taken by Yan to

459
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,820
wipe the table.

460
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,460
I think

461
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm not as angry as before.

462
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,500
After you're dried,

463
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,820
let's make up with each other.

464
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,140
Yan. What's wrong with you?

465
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,140
Why are you quiet, sighing all the time?

466
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,100
I just washed the handkerchief.

467
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,900
What did you say?

468
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,900
It's nothing. Let me serve you some water.

469
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,460
No, thanks.

470
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,940
I always think

471
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,540
my cultivation is

472
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,460
as powerful as that of ice face.

473
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,860
But

474
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,300
when I passed by water-moon pool just now,

475
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,700
Unexpectedly, I saw him conjuring time-folding magic.

476
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Time-folding magic?

477
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,420
Is it to fold two different

478
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,340
space-time

479
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,660
together?

480
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,220
Yes.

481
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,780
He showed the Fanyin Valley and the Sky Kingdom

482
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,900
at the same time.

483
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,980
I heard this magic is really very difficult.

484
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,340
If there is still an alternative,

485
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,660
nobody will use it.

486
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,180
Is it because something is wrong with the Sky Kingdom?

487
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,540
He is playing the game of go.

488
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,860
Playing the game of go?

489
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,900
I was angry

490
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,260
because he used the time-folding magic

491
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,420
to make it convenient for him

492
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,060
to play the game of go with his friend in the heaven.

493
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,820
Seeing him playing the game of go

494
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,860
with the playboy in the heaven,

495
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,500
I felt I failed.

496
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,260
Though he is superior to you in this skill,

497
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,780
you also have some strengths

498
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,060
that he can't compare with you.

499
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,740
There is no need to compare your weaknesses
with others' strengths.

500
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,180
My strengths?

501
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,180
Such as...

502
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,860
Like...

503
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,860
For example,

504
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,260
you are more attractive and beautiful than him.

505
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,100
Wait.

506
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,700
You said Dong Hua was playing the game of go with Lian Song.

507
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,540
When were they playing the game of go?

508
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,100
Just now.

509
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,020
Maybe they are still playing the game of go now.

510
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:58,900
As an immortal,

511
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,540
how could you be so shameless?

512
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,100
You!

513
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,100
Who is shameless?

514
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,740
If this can be endured, what else can't be?

515
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,020
When you decided to cheat me,

516
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,700
didn't you think that

517
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,700
if I discovered the hoax,

518
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,780
I would hate you for my lifetime?

519
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,940
Or do you just think

520
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,940
I'm not wise enough

521
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,380
to discover your hoax?

522
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
Just wait.

523
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,100
Since we knew each other,

524
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,380
there have been many fairies showing flattery to you.

525
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,260
I haven't seen

526
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,420
you are interested in any fairy.

527
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,060
Recently,

528
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,820
you regard the Princess of Qingqiu

529
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,380
with special attention.

530
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,980
Good move.

531
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,180
You've just been in the Fanyin Valley for several days.

532
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,260
How did you offend

533
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,380
the Princess of Qingqiu?

534
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,300
She is coming angrily.

535
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,900
It seems that she will chop you into several pieces.

536
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,860
It's nothing.

537
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,300
I underestimated her wisdom.

538
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,700
It's too bad.

539
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,660
Unexpectedly, my nine tails were forced
to turn up by the time-folding magic.

540
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,740
How could I look murderous like this?

541
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,340
Maybe it can make him think that

542
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,740
I'm strange and cute.

543
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,220
Do you think it interesting to play tricks on me like this?

544
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,700
Why are you staring at me?

545
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,340
Have we met before?

546
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,260
What did you say?

547
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,180
I asked if we had met before.

548
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,580
You have never seen the Princess of Qingqiu.

549
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,620
When you were young,

550
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,340
did I ever save you?

551
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,180
I remember there seemed to be such a thing.

552
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,380
Your Majesty, you are kind to all living creatures,

553
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,420
it's certain that you don't put such things in your heart.

554
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,220
I have saved you once

555
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,060
and you haven't repaid my kindness.

556
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,580
I cheated you.

557
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,060
Don't fuss about it. Just regard it as repaying my kindness.

558
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,220
Give me my handkerchief.

559
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,540
The color is fading.

560
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,060
I won't fuss about it with you.

561
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,380
I have repaid your kindness.

562
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,140
What?

563
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,580
This handkerchief.

564
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,860
You want to get it back so much.

565
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,580
Is it because the flower on it

566
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,380
was embroidered by Ji Heng?

567
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,220
Indeed she is much more lively

568
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,380
than she was in the Sky Kingdom

569
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,220
half a year ago.

570
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,100
Actually I seem to know that

571
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,580
she was angry

572
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
because you cheated her to change yourself into a handkerchief.

573
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,620
You have also figured out that
changing yourself into a handkerchief

574
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,900
to be bullied by her can lessen her anger.

575
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,060
But why did you change into a false one

576
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,020
to cheat her?

577
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,780
I'm not foolish.

578
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,780
Of course you're not foolish.

579
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,180
Facing such a bad situation,

580
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,220
if you can deal with it efficiently and smoothly,

581
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,740
I will call you grandpa

582
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,980
when I see you another day.

583
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,780
I heard the Supreme Venerable Lord

584
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,180
refined an elixir recently.

585
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,980
After taking it, one can have selective amnesia.

586
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,100
Without antidote, one can't get that lost memory.

587
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,780
Go to take one bottle for me some day.

588
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,420
Do you think you are shameless by doing this?

589
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,260
I don't think so.

590
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Next time you see me,

591
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,060
call me grandpa.

592
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,100
Dong Hua.

593
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,780
Is this still His Majesty who is the most strong-minded,

594
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,140
making us

595
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,780
who are not completely free from human desires and passions

596
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,380
feel inferior to and far behind to catch up with him?

597
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,580
Si Ming.

598
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,820
As you can see,

599
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
since we got along with His Majesty,

600
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,900
we haven't got hold of any evidence to overturn his image.

601
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,900
Both you and I are gossips.

602
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,580
How meaningless it is!

603
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,660
Now he pays special regard to the little princess
who is only about thirty thousand years old,

604
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,940
not mature enough.

605
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,780
Don't you think it's just like...

606
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,260
A lightning strike?

607
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,420
So...

608
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,060
so it is.

609
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
You also think so, right?

610
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,740
No.

611
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,780
I mean,

612
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,060
according to your facial expression,

613
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,540
it seems that you were hit by a lightning strike.

614
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,780
Don't you feel it strange?

615
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,620
Don't you have such a feeling?

616
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,100
Third Prince, have you forgotten that,

617
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,900
His Majesty has many likes,

618
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,660
one of which is a mammal,

619
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,340
the original body of Princess Fengjiu.

620
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,220
Few people can resist it.

621
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,820
When she was very young,

622
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,380
she was naughty.

623
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,820
Once she put croton into God Bai Zhen's food,

624
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,540
which made him suffer from diarrhea

625
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,780
for three days.

626
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,940
The little princess just showed her original shape,

627
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,380
then she was forgiven by God Bai Zhen.

628
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,140
The little princess...

629
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,740
Is there anything that you hide from me?

630
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,820
No.

631
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,940
Tell me.

632
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,980
Jiuge. Yan.

633
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,300
The names of those finally selected to attend
the student tournament will be announced today.

634
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,940
Won't you stay to see them?

635
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,540
What to see?

636
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,820
It can't include me.

637
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,860
Why?

638
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm not interested in it.

639
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,420
It's not because you have no interest in it,

640
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,260
but the Master won't keep you in the name list.

641
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,780
Speaking of the name list,

642
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,300
I don't have much interest in it.

643
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,620
After all, I am always the first to contend for the championship.

644
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,740
It's not attractive at all.

645
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,940
How could you talk about me?

646
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,900
What about you?

647
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,460
According to my relationship with the Master,

648
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,620
I'm afraid that I'm not included in the name list either.

649
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,220
Brother.

650
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,500
Brother.

651
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,780
Her Majesty has something to discuss with you,

652
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,180
ordering me to look for you.

653
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,220
I know.

654
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
I won't accompany you

655
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,260
waiting for the name list.

656
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,460
But

657
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,740
don't worry.

658
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,180
Maybe there is a turn for the better.

659
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,300
Let's go.

660
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,180
Farewell.

661
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,220
The name list is released!

662
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,460
It's released.

663
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:42,900
Let's go.

664
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,420
Look at this part.

665
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,900
There isn't.

666
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm in the name list. I'm in the name list.

667
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I saw it.

668
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,300
Both Xiang Limeng and Jielu are in the name list.

669
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,020
You...

670
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,900
That's all. Don't look at it anymore.

671
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,620
I'm not included.

672
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,020
I mean

673
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,020
since the Master knew

674
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,300
you are an old acquaintance of the ice face

675
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,100
and you are an intimate friend of the ice face...

676
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,300
Don't use intimate friend here.

677
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,460
Besides,

678
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,860
I have nothing to do with him now.

679
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,460
I mean

680
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,700
the Master should do a favor to the ice face.

681
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,340
Is it possible that the one who copied
the name list missed your name?

682
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,940
I don't think he is a man who fears power.

683
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,380
Forget it!

684
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,500
Anyhow the student tournament

685
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,460
is nothing interesting.

686
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,660
Do you think if I admit my mistake

687
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,820
and go to his home to apologize to him,

688
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,940
will he give me a way out

689
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,900
to include me in the name list?

690
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,980
What if he refuses in defense of his honor?

691
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,460
Why are you so interested in

692
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,300
this student tournament?

693
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,260
In my opinion.

694
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
I think I should have a try.

695
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,580
You can never let me finish my words.

696
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,020
Come in.

697
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,460
Princess Jiuge.

698
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,020
Master.

699
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,300
You.

700
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,940
Why are you here?

701
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,580
Master.

702
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,940
I'm naughty.

703
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,420
Actually, I set up the trap

704
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,660
at school

705
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,900
to make fun of my classmates.

706
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,420
Unexpectedly, you fell into it.

707
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,700
I'm here to apologize to you!

708
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,820
It's a piece of cake.

709
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,180
Never mind. Princess Jiuge.

710
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,220
Master, this medicine is good for curing cold.

711
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,140
If it was because of me that

712
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,820
you fell into the trap

713
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,020
and had a cold,

714
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,540
I really made a big mistake.

715
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,780
How could I bother you to come here?

716
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,700
How is His Majesty these days?

717
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,900
He?

718
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,020
How could I know anything about him?

719
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,780
Master.

720
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,660
As for the names of those finally
selected to attend the student tournament,

721
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,540
did you miss my name?

722
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,700
In Imperial College, tournament is just the later stage.

723
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,460
Without a solid foundation,

724
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,340
I'm afraid it's not suitable for you
to take part in the tournament.

725
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,780
If you are injured,

726
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,180
how can I explain to His Majesty?

727
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,020
Right?

728
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,500
Well, go back.

729
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,100
If you have something to say, just ask me to see you.

730
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,460
Do you need me to send you back?

731
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,140
Master, have a good rest.

732
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,900
I'm leaving.

733
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,460
Xiaojiu.

734
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,260
Xiaojiu.

735
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,540
Meng said there were some dancing girls
coming to Zuilixian Restaurant recently

736
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,540
with excellent dances.

737
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,820
He asked us to have a look with him.

738
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:32,980
What's wrong with you?

739
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,620
Didn't the Master agree?

740
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,660
I have told you

741
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,820
you are an intimate friend of the ice face.

742
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,420
If you ask the ice face to help you,

743
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,500
it can be solved early.

744
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,460
It's none of his business.

745
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,980
Didn't I tell you so?

746
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,700
Besides, isn't he your enemy?

747
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,740
Why do you always mention him?

748
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,020
You made up with each other, right?

749
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,540
Actually, the first day the ice face came to the Fanyin Valley,

750
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,140
I came into unavoidable confrontation with him,

751
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,340
making an appointment with him that

752
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,700
as long as he doesn't intervene

753
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,780
my contact with Ji Heng,

754
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,460
I won't avenge myself and I will cancel out my hatred.

755
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,340
What's the relationship between him and Ji Heng?

756
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
I forgot to tell you that

757
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,060
Ji Heng is also in the valley.

758
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,900
Ji Heng is also in the valley?

759
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,700
She is the aulic musician that

760
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,860
Meng and Jielu refer to.

761
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,860
Actually I recognized her very early.

762
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,700
She refused to admit it.

763
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,300
How did she come to the Fanyin Valley?

764
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,180
She didn't tell me.

765
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,340
Anyhow, with a strange combination of circumstances,
she came to the valley

766
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,100
and stayed here as a musician.

767
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,700
She admitted that she is Ji Heng?

768
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,940
Every time the ice face comes to give lectures,

769
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,500
she will stop secluding to serve him.

770
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,540
Seeing it's impossible for her to deny, so she admitted it.

771
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,540
Do you think

772
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,260
we are destined to see each other?

773
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,940
I'm talking with you.

774
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,060
It turns out that they have seen each other early.

775
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,140
These years,

776
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,140
His Majesty keeps in touch with Ji Heng.

777
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,260
So what?

778
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,740
He is really kind to her.

779
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,020
Even though she escaped marriage, he wouldn't fuss about it.

780
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,700
Though His Majesty doesn't have memory,

781
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,940
yet in the human world,

782
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,580
Ji Heng attempted to help others

783
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,860
to stole the Lingbi Stone.

784
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,580
However...

785
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,820
His kindness to her is useless. Ji Heng is mine.

786
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,060
She lost all her memory.

787
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,100
It was I who helped her to get back her memory little by little.

788
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,500
It was a pity that she was taken advantage of

789
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,420
when she was stranding in the human world.

790
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,940
Don't think about it. Meng is still waiting for us.

791
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,660
Let's go.

792
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,380
I won't go there. Just go by yourselves.

793
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,980
OK. I'm leaving.

794
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,300
I thought His Majesty came to the Fanyin Valley to save me.

795
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,660
Clearly,

796
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,340
he just does it simultaneously.

797
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,260
Forget it. I won't think about him.

798
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,580
What is urgent is to get the pimpon fruit.

799
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,780
Since it's helpless to turn to the Master,

800
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,740
I can only think about another way.

801
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,580
You want to steal the pimpon fruit?

802
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,060
Be quiet.

803
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,540
Meng, tell me

804
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,980
if I am not included in the name list,

805
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,300
I have no alternative

806
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,860
but to steal it, right?

807
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,260
It's not easy

808
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,300
to steal the pimpon fruit.

809
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,500
Apparently, nobody guards the tree.

810
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,260
But there are four stone statues standing around the tree.

811
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,540
They're just four stone statues.

812
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,220
If anyone believes

813
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,700
it's just stone statues,

814
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,020
he is really too naive.

815
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Is it possible that there are some mechanism
in the stone statues?

816
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,540
The mechanism is that

817
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,260
there is a boa constrictors in each stone statue,

818
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,180
specially guarding the pimpon tree.

819
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,900
As for anybody who wants to get the pimpon fruit,

820
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
before his hand gets close to the fruit,

821
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
crackly,

822
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,220
his head will have been bitten off by the boa constrictors.

823
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,260
So

824
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,100
I advise you to give up stealing

825
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,300
the pimpon fruit.

826
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,980
I was just asking.

827
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,420
Since it's so dangerous,

828
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,860
there is no need to become food in the stomach of the boa constrictors.

829
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,180
Life is more important.

830
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,100
Jiuge.

831
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,300
I'm not kidding.

832
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,260
Never take the risk.

833
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,300
I still have something else to do. I'm leaving first.

834
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,300
How are you? Are you afraid?

835
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,020
I'm afraid of nothing.

836
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,140
No no.

837
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,620
I'm afraid of snakes the most.

838
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,740
Xiaojiu.

839
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,420
Xiaojiu.

840
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,740
Xiaojiu.

841
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,660
Where have you been? You're so scared.

842
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,100
I was nearly frightened to death.

843
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,220
I was not on purpose.

844
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,780
I saw you coming here in a hurry.

845
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,820
It seems that you are frightened.

846
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,100
You don't answer me when I call you.

847
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,140
So I come to have a look.

848
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,860
I'm OK.

849
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,020
Hmm.

850
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,500
Will you go to have tea lessons tomorrow?

851
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,860
I won't go to listen the ice face's lesson.

852
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,900
I just like Ji Heng's rhythm lesson.

853
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,020
- Ji Heng is good at lyre-playing, the game of go, calligraphy
and painting. - Stop.

854
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,420
I know you have a deep love for Ji Heng.

855
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,100
You don't need to talk about it every time.

856
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,420
I have lessons tomorrow.

857
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,020
Go back. I'm going to sleep.

858
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,340
Hurry up. Xiaojiu.

859
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,220
As brothers,

860
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,540
we should share fortunes and take risks together.

861
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,500
If you have something weighing in your mind,

862
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,780
I'd like to listen patiently.

863
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,620
I know. Go to bed early.

864
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,820
Master.

865
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,900
Master. Worrying that you may have a cold at night,

866
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,620
I specially come to send you a silk quit.

867
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:41,940
OK.

868
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,180
Please have some tea, master.

869
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,140
Did your Qiushui Cold Toxin recur?

870
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,620
Thank you for your care.

871
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,460
According to your suggestion,

872
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,660
in my spare time,

873
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,580
I seclude to recuperate in the valley.

874
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,420
It's nothing serious now.

875
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,100
It's good.

876
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,820
Then

877
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,300
as for the tea lesson tomorrow,

878
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,020
just prepare as usual.

879
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,260
Yes.

880
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,420
Master, as for your giving lectures in the valley this time,

881
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,860
will you stay in the valley for half a month as usual?

882
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,860
I haven't decided yet.

883
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,980
Maybe I will stay for longer.

884
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,060
Yes.

885
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,820
Then have a rest.
