00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 19

3
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
Your Majesty.

4
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Have you found anything?

5
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
I have checked it out.

6
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
There were no storytellers in the capital

7
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,080
telling the story about the emperor and the beauty yesterday.

8
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
You mean

9
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,800
she cheated on me?

10
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,920
It turns out

11
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
that she knew nothing about my heart.

12
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,640
I really don't understand.

13
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,800
Why does Your Majesty expend so much care and thought

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,320
on Madam Jiu?

15
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,160
Leave me alone.

16
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,880
Well, Your Majesty.

18
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
General Ye has visited you today for several times.

19
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you...

20
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,120
No.

21
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
How is that?

22
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,880
General Ye.

23
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,800
His Majesty is extremely busy on the official affairs today.

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,640
I'm afraid he has no time to see you.

25
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
But the guard affairs in the palace are so heavy,

26
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
I have a lot of emergencies

27
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
to discuss with His Majesty.

28
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
We can't delay.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,760
General Ye.

30
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,840
You really don't know

31
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,880
why His Majesty doesn't want to see you?

32
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
I think

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
I don't need to make it too clear.

34
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Do you think so?

35
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
General Ye.

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Please go back.

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,160
Good.

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,640
It's so good.

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
I've given it to you.

40
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,920
But what I asked you to do...

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,000
Your Highness.

42
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
The Emperor's Tomb is not far from the palace.

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,080
If only I get the Lingbi Stone,

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,440
we can force him to give up the throne at that time.

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,320
Your Highness, please rest assured.

46
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,160
I will get all men you need ready for you.

47
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,600
At that time we can work together.

48
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
And then you can ascend to the throne

49
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
and take the throne.

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Your Highness, there is only one step left.

51
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
When will we take actions?

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Just wait and see.

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,440
Wait for the moment.

54
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,160
How is it?

55
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
Let me go inside and have a look.

56
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,560
As you wish.

57
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,920
Do you want to drink?

58
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
Mother.

59
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
Why are you here?

60
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
Ren'er.

61
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,840
Look at you now.

62
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,600
When will you stop behaving like this?

63
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,800
Mother.

64
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Nowadays, voices of discontent are heard in the imperial harem.

65
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,720
The court affairs are in mess.

66
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,560
As the emperor,

67
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,600
do you really want to lose yourself like this?

68
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't you think

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
you will let people in the world down?

70
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,240
And you will let your late mother down?

71
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,280
I know I am wrong.

72
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,960
Ren'er.

73
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Your father and I had placed
high hopes on you since you were little.

74
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,400
The future of State of Chengyu

75
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,720
depends on you.

76
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,560
You should not destroy the whole state

77
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,120
because of your love for that woman.

78
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
Do you understand?

79
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,320
I...

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
I understand.

81
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,080
Ren'er.

82
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,960
I have one thing to discuss with you.

83
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Please say it. Mother.

84
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,440
The imperial harem is in chaos now.

85
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,320
A imperial harem in good order
could help you deal with the official affairs.

86
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,040
You are not young now.

87
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,000
It's time for you to choose a woman
having both ability and moral integrity

88
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,320
as your empress to lead the harem and set an example.

89
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,040
Empress?

90
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,440
In ancient times, a good emperor
must have a good empress by his side.

91
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,560
If the harem is in good order, the world will be peaceful.

92
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,480
What do you think?

93
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,880
I... I will think about your suggestion.

94
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,480
I won't say anything more.

95
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
The last thing

96
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,960
I want to remind you is that

97
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,240
the empress of State of Chengyu should always come from

98
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,760
a reputable family with a good background

99
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
or a descendant of royal lineage.

100
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,840
Those women with unknown origin shouldn't have been qualified

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,080
to enter the harem.

102
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,760
So they won't have the chance to be the empress.

103
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,480
Well.

104
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm leaving.

105
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
You think it over yourself.

106
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,440
I will.

107
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,080
Don't drink too much. It's not good for your health.

108
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,600
Your Highness, why are you here relaxing yourself?

109
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,080
Something big is going to happen in the imperial harem.

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,520
What is it?

111
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,600
I went to the Funing Palace and

112
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,360
a servant girl of Madam Ying told me that

113
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,200
the His Majesty is going to have a empress.

114
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Madam Ying has been summoned by Her Majesty just now.

115
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,240
Empress?

116
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,400
Yeah.

117
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
Your Highness. His Majesty hasn't been here for days.

118
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,120
It is a good chance for us this time.

119
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,280
You go and ask His Majesty

120
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,200
what on earth his plan is.

121
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Whatever happens, You will make some efforts.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,120
For what?

123
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,880
I have no final say, do I?

124
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,240
Why are you here?

125
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,880
I saw you were depressed under the moon in the heaven,

126
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
so I come here to see you.

127
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,520
You come here to laugh at me, don't you?

128
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,360
I know well about your feeling.

129
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
Do you think it's weird?

130
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
He's already decided to have a empress.

131
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,360
I should feel happy for him.

132
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,920
Yeah.

133
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
He loves you, but can't have you.

134
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
So he shifts his love to another woman.

135
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
It could be called a romance misfortune.

136
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,360
You should feel happy.

137
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160
But I don't feel happy at all.

138
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,200
Last time, Qingti and I ran out secretly.

139
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,040
He should know that.

140
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,160
He'd better know that.

141
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,800
But since then, he has never visited me.

142
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,040
We are drifting apart finally.

143
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,960
Today I saw that script.

144
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,360
There is a sentence which can exactly describe my feeling now.

145
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,760
Which one?

146
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,520
All my efforts have been wasted,

147
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,440
I really regret to see him.

148
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,480
Cheng Yu.

149
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Do you know whom he will choose to be his empress?

150
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,080
Is it Madam Ying

151
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
or Madam Yuan?

152
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Or Madam Ye?

153
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,120
Madam Ying was born from a prominent family

154
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,520
and Her Majesty likes her very much.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,680
So I think it would be her.

156
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
As for Madam Yuan,

157
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,680
she often copies scriptures,

158
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,120
it seems like that she is boring.

159
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,040
As for Madam Ye,

160
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,400
she is always competing with me,

161
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
but fails all the time.

162
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,560
Cheng Yu.

163
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Which one do you think he will choose as his empress?

164
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,280
I think as long as he won't choose you,

165
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,720
anyone is the best one.

166
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,160
Yeah.

167
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,360
As long as he won't choose me,

168
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
anyone would be fine.

169
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,320
You are in good mood today.

170
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,600
It seems that Your Majesty have made up your mind.

171
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,920
If so,

172
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,200
Her Majesty will rest assured.

173
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Stop talking.

174
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,360
Okay.

175
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
It's a big event.

176
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,680
His Majesty is here!

177
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Long live Your Majesty.

178
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,960
On your feet, everyone.

179
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,000
Her Majesty once mentioned about choosing a empress for me.

180
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,320
And you all have your own suggestions.

181
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,920
I've thought it over

182
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,560
and today I will tell you my decision.

183
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,600
Come.

184
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,680
Your Majesty.

185
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,760
Read the edict.

186
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,080
Your Majesty.

187
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,280
Read it.

188
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,640
I've heard that if the heaven and the earth
stay the same, everything will not go well.

189
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
If Yin and Yang don't change, everything will not flourish.

190
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,000
Madam Bai is gentle and meek since her childhood.

191
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,440
She is wise and able,
and behaves according to the Classic of Rites.

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,680
She speaks according to historical experience,
and has a kindly face and good behaviors.

193
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,320
I think she is the suitable person to be the empress.

194
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,040
So I've made up my mind to take her as my empress.

195
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
I have ordered people to choose a good day

196
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,720
to hold the ceremony on the eighth day of the eighth lunar month.

197
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,800
This is my order.

198
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,320
Your Majesty, please forgive my plain speaking.

199
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,160
How can you choose Madam Jiu as your empress?

200
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,680
Your Majesty, Madam Jiu's identity is not clear,

201
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,760
it is improper to keep her in the palace.

202
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,360
There are so many madams

203
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,520
who are honorable than her in the palace.

204
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,640
I want to ask you how she could
set a good example for the world people,

205
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,240
and how she could make all people obey her?

206
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,280
This is a big joke, isn't it?

207
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,720
Your Majesty,

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,280
since Madam Jiu lives in the palace,
rumors have been spreading everywhere.

209
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Moreover, rumors have it that she is a demon.

210
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm afraid she would get the State of Chengyu into big troubles.

211
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,160
Your Majesty, if you insist,

212
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm afraid it may cause disturbance of the State
and the world would be in chaos.

213
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
I hope you can think it over.

214
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,960
Your Majesty.

215
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,160
You always govern the world with your kindness and wisdom.

216
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,720
This is a big event,

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,520
but you didn't ask for our advice and directly issue the order,

218
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,200
I think it's not reasonable or proper for you to do it like this.

219
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
Today, I venture to

220
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,000
talk about this event.

221
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,040
I hope Your Majesty could think twice
before you make the decision.

222
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,480
Think twice, Your Majesty.

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,720
Well.

224
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,480
Have you all finished it?

225
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
Anyone wants to express his opinions?

226
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,120
General Ye.

227
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,360
Do you have anything to say?

228
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,200
I have nothing to say.

229
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
You are a weird man.

230
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
Don't you see that they all go against me?

231
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,280
Will you do that?

232
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I agree with you.

233
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,280
Fine.

234
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,720
On your feet. Rise.

235
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,920
I've made up my mind.

236
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,960
You should know it today.

237
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,200
I will hold the ceremony
on the eighth day of the next lunar month.

238
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
It is a big event.

239
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,320
I hope everyone of you could do your job well.

240
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,760
As for every detail of the ceremony,

241
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
I will decide it on my own.

242
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,520
You all leave now.

243
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Your Majesty, see you.

244
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,880
Ridiculous!

245
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,440
So ridiculous!

246
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,800
Your Majesty, please calm down.

247
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,160
Go. Get him here.

248
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,800
I want to see what he would say.

249
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,200
- As you wish. - His Majesty is here!

250
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,680
Mother.

251
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't call me mother.

252
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,240
I am not qualified to

253
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,040
have such a promising son as you.

254
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,760
Mother.

255
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,800
I have made the decision myself today.

256
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,960
I hope

257
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,200
you can forgive me.

258
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,080
But about this event,

259
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,160
I didn't do it at free will.

260
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,840
I have thought it twice.

261
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,120
What?

262
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,920
You chose her as the empress and

263
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,920
say that you have thought it over?

264
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,880
Yes.

265
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,000
Let me ask you. Who is she?

266
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,320
She is an ordinary woman.

267
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
Just an ordinary woman.

268
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,160
Yeah. She once saved you.

269
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,640
But that couldn't be the reason that

270
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,680
you do what you wish without restraint and disobey rules!

271
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
I think Bai Xiaojiu's identity

272
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,040
is not clear,

273
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
and she must be an evil woman

274
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,840
with no good family background.

275
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,440
She went inside the palace and got close to you on purpose.

276
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,680
Haven't you heard

277
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,880
those rumors?

278
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
I've heard some.

279
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,640
But Xiaojiu is pure and kind,

280
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,000
she and I love each other.

281
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,200
You ignore the official affairs

282
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,280
and the state affairs,

283
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,440
and even other concubines. Fine!

284
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,960
Now I finally figure out a way

285
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,080
to choose a empress for you.

286
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,480
But you

287
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,480
just directly issued your order

288
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,560
and you don't care to go against all officials

289
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,000
and you don't care to go against me.

290
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,640
If she is pure and kind,

291
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,320
it is simply the biggest joke in the world.

292
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,360
Mother.

293
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,480
You must get her wrong.

294
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,120
I have nothing to explain.

295
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,760
But in my heart,

296
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,080
she is the most suitable woman.

297
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
I didn't discuss it with the officials

298
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
and directly issued the order,

299
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,160
because I have to stand on my ground to

300
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
make her the empress.

301
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Why?

302
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,240
Because

303
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,160
she is the only woman

304
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
in my heart.

305
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,640
And there is

306
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,480
one more thing

307
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,920
that I haven't mentioned to you.

308
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,240
I have taken Xiaojiu

309
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,480
to see the Lingbi Stone.

310
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,840
Lingbi Stone has magical reaction on her.

311
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,920
I believe that

312
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
God asks Xiaojiu

313
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,440
to help me protect the Lingbi Stone.

314
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,400
Xiaojiu,

315
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,840
have a try.

316
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,120
I dare not.

317
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,160
Only Your Majesty can touch it.

318
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,520
How dare I?

319
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,960
Certainly you can, since I allow you.

320
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,320
Have a try.

321
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,000
How could it be that?

322
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,320
Yeah.

323
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,720
This is indeed a serious matter.

324
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,400
I don't dare to lie to you.

325
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,040
Such being the case,

326
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,280
you go back to your palace first.

327
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,880
Well, do you agree?

328
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,240
I...

329
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,240
Thank you, mother.

330
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,240
The Lingbi Stone...

331
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,480
Is he out of his mind?

332
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,840
He even chose me as the empress.

333
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,200
Muyun.

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,160
Do you know why His Majesty chose me as the empress?

335
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,080
I have no idea,

336
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
I only know that I have to put all rewards

337
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
from His Majesty in order today.

338
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,040
His Majesty likes you so much,

339
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,760
you will get more and more rewards in the future.

340
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm afraid I will have no enough time to put them in order.

341
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,480
Your Highness, do you think the happiness comes from heaven

342
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,120
and you just can't accept it, right?

343
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,240
To be honest,

344
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,000
nobody would accept it.

345
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,600
When I got up today,

346
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,760
I saw these rewards lining up

347
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,120
in a long queue.

348
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,440
Your Highness, in my whole life...

349
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,600
no, no, no,

350
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,960
in my next life I will never have the chance
to see so many rewards.

351
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,480
Moreover, do you know

352
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,760
how His Majesty did it?

353
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,560
I've heard about it.

354
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,320
He never discussed it with the officials.

355
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,120
He just directly issued the edict.

356
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,720
The officials were stunned.

357
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Your Highness,

358
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
His Majesty falls deeply in love with you.

359
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,120
It happens once in hundreds of years

360
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,200
in the State of Chengyu.

361
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,840
Crap!

362
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,400
The efforts I made before were in vain.

363
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,400
Your Highness, do you know that?

364
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,720
Because of you,

365
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,560
all servants in the Yue Hua Palace have got rewards

366
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,200
and our monthly salary has been increased a lot.

367
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,240
I represent other servants to thank Your Majesty.

368
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,480
Alright. Don't kneel down.

369
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Your Majesty.

370
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,280
Don't you feel happy to be the empress?

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,760
No, I don't.

372
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,440
I am very happy.

373
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,680
That would be fine.

374
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,200
Your Majesty, this is the reward list.

375
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,840
Your Majesty, did you have a good sleep last night?

376
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,720
I didn't sleep well for the whole night

377
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,600
because I felt so happy for you.

378
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,320
But it's so weird.

379
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Why hasn't His Majesty come to see you?

380
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,680
It's not early now.

381
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,120
You are now the emperor and the empress,

382
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,840
you should show your love to each other.

383
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,640
Your Majesty,

384
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,920
how about we going to the Muning Hall tonight?

385
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,760
Muyun, leave me alone.

386
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,120
I want to enjoy the flowers alone.

387
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,640
As you wish.

388
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,680
I never expected that

389
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,520
it's only been several days,

390
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,120
and it has been like this.

391
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah.

392
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,560
I never expected that.

393
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
Sorry, Xiaojiu.

394
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,400
I don't know what to say.

395
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,320
I even don't know

396
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,040
if I should congratulate you.

397
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,640
On the position that I shouldn't be,

398
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,440
I don't know what will happen in the future.

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,080
So it's too early to say that.

400
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,360
Are you happy?

401
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
I should be happy, shouldn't I?

402
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,040
But...

403
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,360
If you don't feel happy,

404
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
please tell me.

405
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,960
Do you have any plan to

406
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,720
help me escape from all these things?

407
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,200
Don't be silly.

408
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,720
Xiaojiu.

409
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,080
I've always

410
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,960
had some words for you.

411
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,720
I've written it down.

412
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,960
Xiaojiu.

413
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,440
I've heard that

414
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
you have been promoted as the empress.

415
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,840
I feel like I've lost something and feel absentminded.

416
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,200
I shed tears and wet my clothes.

417
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,360
I force myself to smile but feel so sad.

418
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,280
I feel pity that I've lost you.

419
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,680
I regret for the decision I made that year.

420
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Because of that, you have to stay in the palace

421
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,160
and feel depressed everyday.

422
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,920
Today I write to you and want you to know that someday

423
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,480
if you want to leave the palace,

424
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,120
I will follow you wherever you go.

425
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,200
I will keep your company

426
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
every day and night

427
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,480
till death.

428
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
It finally showed up.

429
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,560
You scared me! Si Ming.

430
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,080
What showed up?

431
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,760
A chance.

432
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,720
This letter from Ye Qingti is your chance.

433
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,040
Si Ming, I'm telling you.

434
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,800
His Majesty treats me well now.

435
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,040
I am considering

436
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,120
if he continues treating me like this,

437
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,520
when will the romance misfortune complete.

438
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,520
I didn't expect that

439
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,720
His Majesty just puts down his dignity as the emperor.

440
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,560
But Ye Qingti really likes you.

441
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,320
Maybe it's a good chance for you
to experience the romance misfortune.

442
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,960
What do you mean?

443
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,320
I thought Song Xuanren would forget you

444
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,960
and chose other woman as the empress.

445
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,960
And then the romance misfortune could be completed.

446
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,240
But now

447
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,160
Emperor Dong Hua has no enough time.

448
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,320
And you have less time now.

449
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,720
I know what you mean.

450
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,200
But...

451
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,760
But His Majesty...

452
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
What's more,

453
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,840
originally

454
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,040
Ye Qingti has nothing

455
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,720
to do with it.

456
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,640
Moreover,

457
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,040
Zhou Mengxi didn't get others involved, did she?

458
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,560
But he has been got involved in it.

459
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,720
When you changed the romance misfortune

460
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,240
that Zhou Mengxi should suffer,

461
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,200
everything will change with it.

462
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,000
Zhou Mengxi was alone and helpless for her whole life.

463
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,440
She led a miserable life in the palace.

464
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,040
She didn't love Song Xuanren,

465
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
but had to deal with

466
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,880
Song Xuanren's affection on her,

467
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,840
but you always respond Song Xuanren with true love.

468
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,320
It causes the changes of
the romance misfortune of Emperor Dong Hua

469
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,800
and that he can't recover his cultivation for so long a time.

470
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,520
Your Highness.

471
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
Your Majesty. His Majesty arrives.

472
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,360
Your Majesty.

473
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,720
Why are you here?

474
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,160
I just told Muyun that I wanted to visit you.

475
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,800
I miss you.

476
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,200
You miss me, don't you?

477
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,560
Are you scared?

478
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,560
Why?

479
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,480
I didn't do it well before

480
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,680
which made you upset.

481
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,360
In the future, you don't need to be afraid.

482
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,960
In the palace,

483
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,440
my love for you is the most powerful weapon for you.

484
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,000
You can use it at your free will.

485
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
You can do whatever you want to do.

486
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,360
I believe that

487
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,880
one day

488
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,280
you will entrust me.

489
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,040
Your Majesty,

490
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,000
if I don't make up my mind now,

491
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
it would be more complicated.

492
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
Please don't blame me.

493
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,960
Why haven't they finished the three long gowns

494
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,840
I asked them to make last month?

495
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,800
Go ask them.

496
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,440
Your Highness. I have urged them.

497
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,120
But they don't

498
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,120
have enough people to make them.

499
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,200
They are busy making the clothing for the Crowning Ceremony.

500
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
We really have no idea.

501
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,360
There are so many embroidery maids in the palace.

502
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,880
They don't need all of them to make the clothing for the empress.

503
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,600
It's obvious that they put me off.

504
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,640
Go urge them again.

505
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,960
I've heard that

506
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,040
the ceremony is the unprecedented big event in the palace.

507
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
I've been told that they will make one ceremonial dress,

508
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,240
nine brocade clothing,

509
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,520
three phoenix coronets,

510
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
one snow weasel fur,

511
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,800
one sky horse fur

512
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,520
and one pelt fur.

513
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,640
His Majesty said that

514
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,720
all concubines and officials would be presented with fine clothes

515
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,720
to participate in the ceremony.

516
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,680
Alright. Stop it!

517
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,760
Leave me alone.

518
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,200
As you wish.

519
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,680
Your Highness.

520
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,120
What's wrong again?

521
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,840
Someone told me that he found the letter

522
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,040
out of the door.

523
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:38,880
Give it to me.

524
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,680
You can leave now.

525
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,680
As you wish.

526
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Why do you ask me here?

527
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,200
Your Highness.

528
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I went back to the State of Chong'an to deploy forces.

529
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
We've got ready.

530
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,960
Now,

531
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,520
we just need you to find a proper chance.

532
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,960
Then we can work together

533
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,960
and make it.

534
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,080
What do you want me to do?

535
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,600
You can find a chance

536
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,800
and ask your people to open the gate for me.

537
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,480
My people can go inside the city and make troubles.

538
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,400
And then we look one way and row another,
and then attack the Emperor's Tomb.

539
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,400
At that time, we can kill two birds with one stone.

540
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,320
I can take back the Lingbi Stone.

541
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,200
And His Majesty will die of the internal disorder.

542
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,800
No one will doubt it's you who did it.

543
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,640
And then Your Highness can succeed to the throne.

544
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,280
I really have one good chance.

545
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,520
What is it?

546
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
On the eighth day of this month,

547
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,760
when the Crowning Ceremony for the empress is held in the palace,

548
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,240
maids in the palace at that time

549
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,120
will keep the empress's company to go out of the palace

550
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,680
and worship the heaven and earth.

551
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,440
Imperial bodyguards will keep
the company of His Majesty and Her Majesty

552
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,440
to leave the palace.

553
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,800
Maybe it's a good chance.

554
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
That's so good.

555
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,960
Your Highness.

556
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,760
Will General Ye leave the palace?

557
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,280
Do you also know Ye Qingti?

558
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,160
When I was in the State of Chong'an, I've heard about him.

559
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,160
I heard that he is brave and skillful in warfare.

560
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,960
If he stays in the palace,

561
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,040
our plan will be influenced.

562
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,520
If he doesn't,

563
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,200
that would be fine.

564
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,920
During this period of time,

565
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,520
Mang will protect you by your side

566
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,880
and pass messages for us.

567
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,400
You only need to seize the chance.

568
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,280
General. Do you want to try this new clothes on?

569
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,760
It is no different from the former ones.

570
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,760
It's so different.

571
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,480
Her Majesty is so kind that

572
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,040
we all have new clothes to wear on her Crowning Ceremony.

573
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,800
The ceremony is going to be held tomorrow.

574
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,840
You'd better try it on in advance.

575
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,800
Alright.

576
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,720
Leave me alone.

577
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,720
You all, leave me alone.

578
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,160
As you wish.

579
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
You are so gorgeous.

580
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,520
It's too magnificent.

581
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,840
This is the ceremonial robe for the Crowning Ceremony.

582
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,000
For my empress,

583
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,880
the more magnificent the better.

584
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,160
As for me,

585
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,240
it's not just a Crowning Ceremony for the empress,

586
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,360
it's our marriage ceremony.

587
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
This ceremonial robe is not only for the empress

588
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,080
but also for our marriage.

589
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,160
I want you to have the most beautiful

590
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,400
and most unforgettable ceremony.

591
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,400
After tomorrow,

592
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,240
you will be the empress of State of Chengyu

593
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,240
and we are going to have a new life.

594
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,520
What's wrong with you?

595
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,280
Why are you crying?

596
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,080
You won't look beautiful if your eyes are swollen.

597
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,160
Alright.

598
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,040
Sorry.

599
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,040
Your Majesty.

600
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,120
Sorry.

601
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,080
Hurry.

602
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,880
You can't miss the time.

603
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,120
Your Majesty.

604
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
Your Majesty, wake up. Get up now!

605
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,200
You should set out. Your Majesty.

606
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Today is a big day.

607
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,480
We can't miss the time.

608
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,120
Your Majesty.

609
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,920
Her Majesty...

610
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Her Majesty is missing.

611
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,680
What?

612
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,680
Ren'er.

613
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,240
Mother.

614
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,360
Look at you!

615
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,440
Just wait quietly!

616
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,960
Sit.

617
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,600
Well, I am short-tempered.

618
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,440
Xiaojiu is late.

619
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
It's probably that she feels nervous to meet you

620
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,720
for the first time

621
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,080
as the empress.

622
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Look at you!

623
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,360
I didn't say anything.

624
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,840
Why are you so worried?

625
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,960
Yeah.

626
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Has my empress arrived?

627
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,960
Your Majesties.

628
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Bad news.

629
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,360
Her Majesty...

630
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,440
What happened?

631
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
Her Majesty is missing.

632
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,600
What do you mean?

633
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,280
People from the Yue Hua Palace reported that

634
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,760
Her Majesty was missing in the early morning.

635
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,280
What are you waiting for?

636
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,040
Ask Ye Qingti to send the Imperial Guards to find her back.

637
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,120
Well...

638
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
What are you waiting for?

639
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,600
Go!

640
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,720
General Ye is missing too.

641
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,080
Search now!

642
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,240
- Yes. - Yes.

643
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
General, we found some letters.

644
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,360
You can leave now.

645
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,320
Yes.

646
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,240
Xiaojiu.

647
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,520
I've heard that you have been promoted as the empress.

648
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,080
I feel like I've lost something and feel absentminded.

649
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,000
Today I write to you and

650
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,440
want you to know that someday

651
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,160
if you can leave the palace,

652
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
I will follow you

653
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,680
wherever you go.

654
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,360
I will keep your company every day and night

655
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,600
till death.

656
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,520
I don't want to go to the Crowning Ceremony

657
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,680
the day after tomorrow.

658
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,840
I have some difficulties that I can't tell you.

659
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,920
Please take me away.

660
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,320
You are trapped in the palace,

661
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,000
it's my mistake.

662
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,280
If you want to leave the palace,

663
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,720
I will leave it with you till death.

664
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,400
At 3 a.m. on the eighth day,

665
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,760
I will wait for you in the gravel corridor outside the palace.

666
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,640
I've got everything prepared.

667
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,640
Your Highness.

668
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,640
You can't burn it.

669
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
What are you doing, Si Ming?

670
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,080
Si Ming, you...

671
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,080
If only he knows the two of you have feelings for each other,

672
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,680
he would give it up.

673
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,040
But if so, Ye Qingti may get hurt.

674
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,840
Now that he has made his choice,

675
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,400
he won't care about life and death

676
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,280
to keep your company.

677
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,720
Go after them.

678
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,280
Even you have to go to the remotest corners,

679
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,720
you will take them back.

680
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,600
Yes!
