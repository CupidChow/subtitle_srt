Eternal Love of Dream

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 15

3
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,100
Your Majesty, we have reached the Yue Hua Palace.

4
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Will you go inside, Your Majesty?

5
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,420
= Yue Hua Palace =

6
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,580
Unconsciously,

7
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,740
we are here.

8
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,820
It used to be a busy and cheering place,

9
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,460
but now

10
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,620
it's cold and cheerless.

11
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,380
I won't go inside.

12
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,980
Have a walk with me.

13
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,500
Yes.

14
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,660
Mother,

15
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,140
I have been married to His Majesty of the State of Chengyu.

16
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,660
His Majesty was depressed recently.

17
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,260
I hope your spirit

18
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,220
can bless His Majesty everything going well.

19
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,100
Imperial Concubine Wan.

20
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,220
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

21
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,420
Rise.

22
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

23
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
It's so late. Who are you worshiping?

24
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,540
I...

25
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,660
It's your mother's memorial day.

26
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,860
Please forgive me.

27
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,020
I didn't want to violate the rules of the palace purposely,

28
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,980
having a worship in the palace without permission.

29
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,580
Today is my mother's memorial day.

30
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Missing my mother so much,

31
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,460
I came here to worship her under
the cover of night when few people went here.

32
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,260
Please punish me.

33
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,740
It doesn't matter.

34
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,180
It's human nature to worship deceased family members.

35
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,020
You showed filial piety to your mother.

36
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,980
How could I punish you?

37
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,500
It's your birthday today, right?

39
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,540
I promised to celebrate your birthday with you.

40
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,980
But because of the business in the palace,

41
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,300
I forgot it.

42
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,220
It's not important to celebrate my birthday.

43
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,740
Recently, you're worrying about Sister Jiu's case,

44
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,820
finding no way out.

45
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,660
I feel regretful that

46
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,340
I can't share your worry.

47
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,900
Worshiping your mother here,

48
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,020
why do you take a Qin along with you?

49
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,340
Your Majesty.

50
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,820
When I was young, my father told me that

51
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,060
my mother liked to listen to the music of my hometown.

52
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,980
Therefore, each time I worship my mother,

53
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,940
I will take the Qin

54
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,540
and play for her.

55
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,220
Since it is so,

56
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
play a tune for your mother.

57
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,380
I also want to hear it.

58
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,620
Thank you for helping me, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,140
Is the melody from the palace?

60
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,620
Your Highness, do you know

61
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,700
what His Majesty is doing now?

62
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,420
Your Majesty,

63
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
this is the second time that you have locked me up.

64
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,020
Will the ending be the same as the last time?

65
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,580
Your Highness,

66
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,940
His Majesty must be busy with

67
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,340
our case.

68
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,060
He will prove us innocent soon.

69
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,020
Right?

70
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,980
If I was killed this time,

71
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,820
would His Majesty

72
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,420
go through his romance misfortune?

73
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,540
How is everything going, Qingti?

74
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,380
Your Majesty.

75
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,500
Having investigated related people,

76
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,740
I haven't had a clue yet.

77
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,340
With seven days' limitation, the deadline is near.

78
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,300
But you said you hadn't found a clue yet.

79
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,300
General Ye,

80
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,620
how did you investigate the case?

81
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Although there is no direct evidence

82
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,500
to prove Her Highness Jiu's innocence,

83
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,900
I think

84
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,540
Her Highness must be guiltless.

85
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,300
Why?

86
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,940
If she intended to plot to assassinate,

87
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
she would have acted before Double Seventh Festival

88
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,820
to put Your Majesty to death.

89
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,580
Why did she delay it?

90
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,060
Moreover,

91
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,220
she ever saved Your Majesty

92
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,460
and me in the battlefield.

93
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,660
She has no motive to kill me.

94
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,940
I know it.

95
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,900
Being naive, kind and straightforward,

96
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,900
Her Highness Jiu is not shrew and deep.

97
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
Your Majesty, please have an upright judgement.

98
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,780
All the evidences are not good for Xiaojiu.

99
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,460
How can I protect her?

100
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,540
It's possible that the person
who poisoned would destroy the evidence.

101
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,580
Even though there isn't evidence,

102
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,220
Her Highness Jiu is still innocent.

103
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,260
Your Majesty,

104
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,660
she is your concubine.

105
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,940
If you don't protect her,

106
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,300
then...

107
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,460
I know she is innocent from the beginning.

108
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,100
Qingti.

109
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,500
I'm the emperor,

110
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,580
not a common person.

111
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,980
This is the palace,

112
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,700
not a citizen's home.

113
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,060
Trust can't save her life.

114
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,340
Your Majesty.

115
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,220
What I need is the evidence that can prove her innocence

116
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,460
to get rid of the bad thoughts of those who have bad intentions,

117
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,980
not your nonsense.

118
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,100
I know.

119
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,140
I'm sure to try my best to find out the evidence to

120
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,500
prove Her Highness Jiu's innocence before the deadline.

121
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,140
General Ye.

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,180
Tell me

123
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,020
how to make sorrowless cake in detail.

124
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,020
You still don't believe me, right?

125
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,300
No.

126
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,580
I have interrogated those involved,

127
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,220
only to find that they don't have the chance to poison.

128
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,220
In the whole palace, only you can make sorrowless cake.

129
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,700
If I can't find strong evidences,

130
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,900
it's hard for me to exonerate you.

131
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,420
What are the ingredients?

132
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,140
Tell me.

133
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,820
Then I can ask the imperial physician to verify them.

134
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,900
But both you and His Majesty

135
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,140
have ever eaten the sorrowless cake that I made.

136
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,860
If I want to murder you,

137
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,420
then....

138
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,980
Xiaojiu.

139
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,060
The deadline is near.

140
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,820
You're in the situation of life and death now.

141
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
If you don't clarify everything,

142
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,980
I can't save you even though I want.

143
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,940
Sorrowless flower.

144
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,220
What's it?

145
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,500
I've never heard of it.

146
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,300
It's a kind of flower from my hometown.

147
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:11,900
OK.

148
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,700
Where is your hometown?

149
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,500
I...

150
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,780
You still want to hide something?

151
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,460
Since we knew each other,

152
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,820
you have hidden your family background.

153
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,620
Could it be that you are an escaped prisoner?

154
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,100
No, I'm not.

155
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,380
Since you're not an escaped prisoner,

156
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,460
why can't you tell me your family background?

157
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,460
Why did you come to the palace?

158
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,460
You always ask me to look for Zhou Mengxi,

159
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,580
but you even don't know

160
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,420
what she is.

161
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,940
It's hard to avoid being suspected.

162
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,180
If you can't make it clear,

163
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,860
I can't help to exonerate you.

164
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,860
You can leave, General Ye.

165
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,260
You...

166
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,540
If you can't believe me,

167
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,580
I have no ways to help you.

168
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,220
Guards.

169
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,300
Take her back.

170
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,060
Yes.

171
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,820
Your Majesty.

172
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,660
I didn't do you a favor

173
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,260
but added some trouble.

174
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,060
Muyun,

175
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,300
I

176
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,660
didn't tell my background to General Ye.

177
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,500
Will you blame me?

178
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,300
No.

179
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,180
These days,

180
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,900
I have been staying with you,

181
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,540
knowing what kind of person you are, Your Highness.

182
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,740
Your Highness, you must have your own reason
so that you are reluctant to tell him.

183
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,700
Thank you for understanding me.

184
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,380
However,

185
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,620
the deadline is near.

186
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,260
If General Ye still can't find anything,

187
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,620
we...

188
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,820
If he can't find anything,

189
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,100
I'm sure to save you.

190
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,100
I won't let you die here wrongly.

191
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,660
Your Highness.

192
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,340
You've been in the prison.

193
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,180
What's your solution?

194
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,460
I'm sure to save you.

195
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,620
Don't you believe me?

196
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:40,780
I believe.

197
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,260
I believe you forever.

198
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,900
Take it easy. Mufeng Butterfly.

199
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,620
I got you into trouble last time.

200
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,300
Even though I suffered the backfire this time,

201
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,660
I won't let you die because of me again.

202
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,300
Demon Lord.

203
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,140
It says in the letter that Chu Wan is winning

204
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,700
the trust of His Majesty of State of Chengyu.

205
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,780
It appears that we will know
the whereabouts of Lingbi Stone soon.

206
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,300
Soon?

207
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,580
It means we still don't know the whereabouts.

208
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,100
Since Princess Ji Heng is wise,

209
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,420
I'm sure that she can find some clues,

210
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,060
hoping you can focus on recovering your body.

211
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,540
It's better for us to wait for more days.

212
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,060
There must be good news at that time.

213
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,140
Your Majesty,

214
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,140
Imperial Concubine Wan is here.

215
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,340
Let her in.

216
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:49,980
Yes.

217
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,500
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

218
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,980
It's so late.

219
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,220
Why do you come here?

220
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,940
Hearing that you don't have a good appetite these days,

221
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,780
I specially made the Osmanthus Jiuniang,

222
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,300
hoping you can taste it.

223
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,420
You specially come to send me this?

224
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,020
No.

225
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,940
Recently, I've learned some refreshing skills

226
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,140
from the servants in the palace.

227
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,900
Your Majesty, you are busy with
memorials to the throne these days.

228
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,860
If you don't mind,

229
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,140
I'd like to show my skills

230
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,500
to relax your body.

231
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,140
Since you are so considerate,

232
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
how can I refuse your kindness?

233
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,340
Xiaojiu.

234
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,020
Your Majesty.

235
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,260
Xiaojiu.

236
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,980
Imperial Concubine Wan.

237
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,620
Why are you here?

238
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,580
Your Majesty.

239
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,380
You had a dream?

240
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,260
How can I fall asleep?

241
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,420
Maybe it's because I put wine in the Osmanthus porridge

242
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,220
that I made,

243
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,300
and you are tired from reading memorials to the throne,

244
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,780
you fell asleep unconsciously.

245
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,140
Your Majesty,

246
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,060
you're busy with work.

247
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,780
It's not convenient for me to be here disturbing you.

248
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,140
OK.

249
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,820
Guards.

250
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,620
Here.

251
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,060
Send Imperial Concubine Wan back to her palace.

252
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,060
Yes.

253
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,660
Your Highness, please.

254
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,220
I'm leaving.

255
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:43,860
Yang Shun.

256
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,620
Your Majesty.

257
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,460
Go out with me.

258
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,300
Yes.

259
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,500
Your Highness.

260
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,620
So you mean

261
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,860
Lingbi Stone is not in His Majesty's resting place.

262
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,540
Your Majesty.

263
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,580
Your Majesty.

264
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,580
No.

265
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,100
No. Xiaojiu.

266
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,260
I have searched over the whole palace.

267
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,420
Could it be somewhere that I missed?

268
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,220
Your Highness.

269
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,500
Ling Xiang.

270
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,180
In my view,

271
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,900
the palace is so big.

272
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,900
It's possible that

273
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,500
we didn't search every place carefully.

274
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,060
From tomorrow,

275
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,140
you search everywhere again

276
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,220
in case there's somewhere we missed.

277
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,660
I know.

278
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,900
You suffered, Xiaojiu.

279
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,860
Your Majesty.

280
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,300
Is it true that I'm going to be executed,

281
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,140
so you come to see me the last time?

282
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,020
I'm here to take you away.

283
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,580
Take me away?

284
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,180
Won't the Empress Dowager investigate it anymore?

285
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,540
As long as you can tell me everything,

286
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,660
I'm sure you are safe in front of the Empress Dowager.

287
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,780
You don't believe me?

288
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,460
Of course I believe you.

289
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,700
But if you don't say anything,

290
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,420
how can I save you?

291
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,660
What should I say?

292
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,060
Just tell

293
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,420
where the sorrowless flower comes from

294
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,700
and where you are from.

295
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,020
I can't say that.

296
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,540
You can't tell?

297
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,900
I'm saving you.

298
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,740
But I can't say that.

299
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,500
Why?

300
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,620
No reason.

301
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,020
It's not time to get angry now.

302
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,620
If you are angry with me

303
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,780
because I put you into prison,

304
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,540
after you get out of here,

305
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm at your disposal.

306
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,020
But you must tell me now.

307
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,580
Your Majesty.

308
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,940
Do you really love me?

309
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,100
Do you love me sincerely?

310
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,900
Or do you just think I'm fresh and interesting?

311
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,500
I can't sleep all night because of you.

312
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,060
Even the state affairs have been delayed.

313
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,980
Do you still suspect me?

314
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
If you love me sincerely

315
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,220
and I die wrongly this time,

316
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,700
when everything is clear later,

317
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,100
you must feel deep pain because of losing your beloved forever.

318
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,100
In this way can you go through your romance misfortune

319
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,500
smoothly?

320
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,020
I dare not.

321
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,780
I have my reasons.

322
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,460
So I can't tell you.

323
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,700
Your Majesty, are you willing to believe me?

324
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,420
You...

325
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,060
Why?

326
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,580
In the palace,

327
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,180
even my favor

328
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
can't compete against the law.

329
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,300
Could it be that you really have another purpose?

330
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,460
Xiaojiu.

331
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,060
Talk with me.

332
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,300
Xiaojiu, raise your head and look at me.

333
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,940
Why did you come to the palace?

334
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,180
Why did you come to the palace?

335
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,860
What you said

336
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,580
are all false to me, right?

337
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,340
How can I tell you that

338
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,460
I'm here in the mortal realm to help
you go through your romance misfortune?

339
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,020
How can I tell you

340
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,220
I'm the Princess of Qingqiu.

341
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,940
Everything I do is to repay your kindness.

342
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,860
So that's what it is.

343
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,460
What you did...

344
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,980
I see.

345
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,100
Eventually God will

346
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,500
take back the wrong fate.

347
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,260
You said Fengjiu would be executed.

348
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:28,900
What's wrong?

349
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,140
Don't worry, Lord.

350
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,380
Her Highness went to the mortal realm to have some experiences.

351
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,260
It's different from His Majesty who went to
the mortal realm as a common person.

352
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,300
Even though in the mortal realm,
Her Highness is still an immortal.

353
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,700
She can use magic arts to protect herself.

354
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,820
Won't she be backfired?

355
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,940
Why are you still peaceful?

356
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,980
Peaceful?

357
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,820
Don't worry.

358
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,980
Her Highness has a life full of lucky escapes.

359
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,500
She has solutions to go through the misfortune.

360
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:53,980
OK.

361
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,540
Since you don't save her, I will save her.

362
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,380
Lord.

363
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,580
Wait me to finish my words.

364
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,740
Zhou Mengxi has been dead.

365
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,580
At present, Her Highness is the
romance misfortune that His Majesty would go through.

366
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:06,980
What?

367
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,860
All the changes in the mortal realm

368
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,420
were caused because Her Highness went there privately.

369
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,380
She disturbed the fortunes in the mortal realm

370
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,660
as well as the fates among people.

371
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,620
So the misfortune came into being.

372
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,540
Neither you nor I can offer help.

373
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,300
Otherwise,

374
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,900
the situation in the mortal realm

375
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,740
will be worse and worse.

376
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,660
Then how can it end?

377
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,540
How unlucky she is!

378
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,180
If she becomes the romance misfortune

379
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,250
and we can't be involved,

380
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
how can we help her?

381
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,020
Right.

382
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,740
She is suffering in the prison.

383
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,740
Can I just stand by without doing anything?

384
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,260
Her Highness went to the mortal realm this time.

385
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,580
There exists a fixed fate.

386
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Maybe she has her own fate.

387
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,670
Moreover,

388
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,140
before the end of the romance misfortune,

389
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,300
there must be some hints in my Book of Fate.

390
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,180
Naturally I will give her a helping hand at that time.

391
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,260
It's not the right time now.

392
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,460
The lotus in the lotus pond came into being by human heart.

393
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,780
I'm afraid in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions

394
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,460
you can't find more beautiful lotus.

395
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm wondering if you like them?

396
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,300
Very beautiful.

397
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,260
Having agreed to appreciate the lotus here,

398
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,100
why do you have a worried face?

399
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,100
It doesn't count this time.

400
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,080
The more you get, the more you want.

401
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,380
Do all the men behave like this,

402
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,580
just thinking of yourselves?

403
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,820
Why do you think so?

404
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,540
It's about Emperor Dong Hua.

405
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,980
He just went to the mortal realm to experience his misfortune.

406
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,420
Why did he bother...

407
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,900
Forget it. You won't understand.

408
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,100
You always say that I don't understand.

409
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,900
How do you know that I can't understand?

410
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,180
What about telling me in detail?

411
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,420
I don't know how to say it

412
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,020
and where to begin.

413
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,820
All the women are the same.

414
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,740
His Majesty is in the Sky Kingdom.

415
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,500
He doesn't know everything.

416
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,460
Now he is in the mortal realm,

417
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,220
so it's certain that he lost his memory.

418
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,580
All...

419
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,620
All the women?

420
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,580
Birds of a feather.

421
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,940
Why do you leave so suddenly?

422
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,660
Xiaojiu.

423
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,820
General Ye.

424
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,860
Are you here to see me off?

425
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,460
Are you so easy to give up?

426
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,020
What can I do if I don't give up?

427
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,860
His Majesty has given me up.

428
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,500
His Majesty gives you up.

429
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,500
Then you will give up yourself, right?

430
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,580
Since you give up so easily,

431
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,850
is there any difference between you

432
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,700
and the weak girls in the world?

433
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,940
What do you want me to do?

434
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,140
I've been locked in the prison.

435
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,220
If you don't want to tell your background.

436
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,590
Then think of the situation that day

437
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,340
in detail

438
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,820
to say if there's something you didn't notice.

439
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,860
This is the only way to save you

440
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,500
and them now.

441
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,900
Your Highness.

442
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,860
Time isn't up.

443
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,380
As long as there is chance,

444
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,220
don't give up.

445
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,100
I asked Muyun to send the sorrowless cake that I made

446
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,020
to the Imperial Kitchen,

447
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,580
as for the rest things, I didn't take in charge.

448
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,980
Later,

449
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,700
as for the sorrowless cake in the banquet,

450
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,140
just from the surface,

451
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,060
do you think if there were some signs that it was changed?

452
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,300
One tray of sorrowless cake is ready.

453
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,140
Muyun.

454
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,740
I'll put them in the plate for you
before you serve them to the Imperial Kitchen.

455
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,900
The people from the Imperial Kitchen
will spread these for them tomorrow.

456
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,980
Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,900
They were changed.

458
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,300
What?

459
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,300
The sorrowless cake that I gave Muyun

460
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,780
were put in a five-petal plate.

461
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,820
But the plate in the palace was changed.

462
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,900
Could it be someone...

463
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,700
How can't I expect that?

464
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,460
I haven't finished my words.

465
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:25,980
General.

466
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,260
You have checked the sorrowless cake, haven't you?

467
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,940
Indeed there exists Lophophora williamsii poison.

468
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,180
Where is the porcelain where the sorrowless cake were put?

469
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,660
It has been lost.

470
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,180
Your Majesty.

471
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,710
It's cold.

472
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,020
Take care of your health.

473
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,580
Do you think what I did

474
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,220
is right?

475
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,540
Your Majesty,

476
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,140
in my heart,

477
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,500
I also feel pity for Sister Jiu.

478
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,740
But we need an explanation

479
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,100
to Empress Dowager,

480
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,820
dukes, ministers

481
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,620
and the Chief Eunuch who died wrongly.

482
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:56,980
More importantly,

483
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,900
it's to those who have bad intentions.

484
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,980
Grind the ink for me.

485
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:09,740
Yes.

486
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,740
Your Majesty.

487
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,060
I'm curious about one thing.

488
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,740
I want to turn to you.

489
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,660
Say it.

490
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,900
When I was in state of Chong'an,

491
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,460
I heard that there was a national treasure in State of Chengyu,

492
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
called

493
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,180
Lingbi Stone.

494
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,820
It's said that State of Chengyu was built

495
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,820
because of the protection and blessing of this precious stone.

496
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,380
I'm wondering if there is any difference

497
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,580
between this stone and the other stones.

498
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,260
If I'm lucky enough,

499
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,220
I want to have a look.

500
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,140
Since it's a legend,

501
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,900
it's exaggerated unavoidably.

502
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,340
No need to take it seriously.

503
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,740
Now that you love jewelry,

504
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,820
I will order the craftsman to make one for you.

505
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,900
Your Majesty.

506
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,460
I'm happy to be spoiled by you.

507
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,620
= Chengming Hall =

508
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
Rise.

509
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,500
General Ye.

510
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,100
Time is up.

511
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,620
As for the case of sorrowless cake,

512
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,580
I'm wondering if there is any progress.

513
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,820
I just want to report it to you.

514
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,140
Your Majesty.

515
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,780
After seven-days investigations and finding evidences,

516
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,980
I have made some progress.

517
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,500
Please send an imperial edict,

518
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,780
permitting me to take some human testimony
and physical evidences to the palace

519
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,060
to show you

520
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,580
how to disclose the truth of the poison case.

521
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,100
Disclose it as quickly as possible.

522
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,220
Come in.

523
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:22,700
Look.

524
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,980
He is pulling a dog.

525
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,940
Hmm.

526
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,660
How abrupt!

527
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,060
Everybody,

528
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,500
the sorrowless cake is not poisonous.

529
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,220
I'd like to try them.

530
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,260
General Ye, don't eat it.

531
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,260
General Ye.

532
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,020
Your Majesty.

533
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,340
Everybody.

534
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,580
I'd like to risk my life to show you
the sorrowless cake is nontoxic.

535
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,540
If I'm unlucky to die by eating it,

536
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,060
that's because I didn't handle the case well and I deserve it.

537
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,860
I'd like to apologize for my offense with death.

538
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,620
He really ate it.

539
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,500
He isn't afraid.

540
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,460
Is he OK?

541
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,100
He really ate it.

542
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,820
How brave he is!

543
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,300
Maybe you're wondering

544
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,260
why I'm OK after eating it.

545
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,220
But the Chief Eunuch just had a bite

546
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,420
and died because of poison.

547
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,340
Now I will show you again.

548
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,300
Watch carefully.

549
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,020
What are the differences between the two cakes?

550
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,460
Well.

551
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,660
How could it be this?

552
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,260
Yeah.

553
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,460
It's toxic.

554
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,580
Why is it so?

555
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,740
What's the matter?

556
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,700
It's the same cake.

557
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,100
Why am I fine after eating it

558
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,220
while the dog died after eating it?

559
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,780
Of course,

560
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,060
I didn't take antidote in advance.

561
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,660
Could it be that

562
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,180
it's not poisonous on the surface of the sorrowless cake?

563
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,380
The part

564
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,020
close to the vessel is poisonous.

565
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,580
The upper part is safe.

566
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,980
So the real murderer

567
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,420
is not Her Highness Jiu, the maker of the sorrowless cake,

568
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,780
but the servant who secretly changed the plate.

569
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,220
General Ye.

570
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,500
Do you have conclusive evidence?

571
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,580
The vessel that the sorrowless cake was put

572
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,540
was broken by the Chief Eunuch.

573
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,580
Then you don't have evidence.

574
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,380
It's just your guess.

575
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,580
No.

576
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,540
I have the evidence.

577
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,300
This fragment was found

578
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:02,860
under the potting of the banquet that day.

579
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,740
Search it.

580
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,740
Yes.

581
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,540
General.

582
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,380
The crumbles left on the fragment

583
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,340
is the same with those

584
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,060
scraped from the sorrowless cake.

585
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,420
There is Lophophora williamsii poison in it.

586
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,140
I can confirm that

587
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,140
the poisoner is the person who changed the vessel,

588
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,660
not Her Highness Jiu.

589
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,340
Then who is

590
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,580
the poisoner on earth?

591
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,140
Guards.

592
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,580
Take the maid, Sang here.

593
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,060
I have queried all Imperial Cooks.

594
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,140
They said they were in the Imperial Kitchen checking

595
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,940
the cakes and food sent from different palaces.

596
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,980
Different palaces use

597
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,180
different vessels.

598
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,580
For example, the Wan Yun Palace used a celadon saucer,

599
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,780
while Yue Hua Palace used a white porcelain five-petal plate.

600
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,900
Her Highness Jiu

601
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,580
presented the cake in a white porcelain five-petal plate.

602
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,860
All the Imperial Cooks can prove it.

603
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Why was the vessel containing the sorrowless cake

604
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,540
changed into a white porcelain round plate at last?

605
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:08,780
I...

606
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,260
Your Majesty.

607
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,180
I don't know anything.

608
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,220
She changed it.

609
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,180
All the people's words

610
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,300
can evidence for themselves.

611
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,900
Only this maid, Sang firmly claimed that

612
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,300
it was the vessel from Yue Hua Palace.

613
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,980
But she didn't know what the vessel in Yue Hua Palace

614
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,860
looked like.

615
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,060
The maid didn't tell the truth.

616
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,020
It's hard to evidence with those of the Imperial Cooks.

617
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,260
With my interrogation, she confessed that

618
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,540
she was the prisoner.

619
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,100
Why did you poison me?

620
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,900
Because you are not qualified

621
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,820
to be the emperor of state of Chengyu.

622
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,140
How bold you are!

623
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,940
How dare you be so rude to His Majesty?

624
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,340
His Majesty?

625
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,050
You are just a fatuous person

626
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,540
hankering after beautiful women.

627
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,740
You are not qualified to be the emperor of state of Chengyu.

628
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,140
She is killed?

629
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,300
It was so dangerous just now.

630
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,100
Your Majesty, you're frightened.

631
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
The real murderer has been executed.

632
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,460
Take it easy. Your Majesty.

633
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,300
She deserved to be killed.

634
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm here to take you home.

635
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,980
Your Majesty.

636
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,740
What happened? Do you believe me?

637
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,620
Qingti has investigated that

638
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,220
the prisoner was someone else.

639
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,460
You were wronged.

640
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,860
Sorry to hurt you.

641
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,180
You'd like to believe me?

642
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,900
I misunderstood you,

643
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,380
saying some harsh words.

644
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,500
I

645
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,260
am sorry for you.

646
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
You'd like to believe me?

647
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,180
Will you forgive me?

648
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,740
I have never blamed you.

649
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,500
Never.

650
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:36,900
Your Majesty.

651
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,580
I miss you so much.

652
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,940
It's time to screen

653
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,820
the maids and eunuchs in the palace.

654
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,340
Yes.

655
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,500
Sorry to frighten you.

656
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,460
Xiaojiu, owing you much,

657
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,420
I plan to confer the title of Madam Jiu on you.

658
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,500
Madam?

659
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,900
I will confer you the title of Madam Jiu,

660
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,900
granting you to live in Xi Ning Palace.

661
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,620
Your Majesty, is it too hasty for you to make this decision?

662
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,700
I want to do something for you.

663
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,780
Don't refuse me.

664
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,340
Thank you for your favor and kindness.

665
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,340
I have a request.

666
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,380
Say it.

667
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,500
Can I keep living in Yue Hua Palace

668
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,980
instead of going to Xi Ning Palace?

669
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Yue Hua Palace also has complete furnishings,

670
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,100
but it's a little small.

671
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,780
According to your present status,

672
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,500
you should live in a bigger palace.

673
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,580
Each time I change my living place,

674
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,540
naturally I can't sleep well at night.

675
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,020
It's not easy for me to be used to living in Yue Hua Palace.

676
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,340
I don't want to move to Xi Ning Palace.

677
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,500
OK.

678
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,780
As you like,

679
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,580
you can still live in Yue Hua Palace.

680
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
Thank you. Your Majesty.

681
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,860
As for the awards matching your status of Madam,

682
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,220
I will order the servants to prepare

683
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,100
and send them to Yue Hua Palace as soon as possible.

684
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,140
No need.

685
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,100
I always don't like these things.

686
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,220
Just keep them simple.

687
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,340
You shouldn't been treated shabbily.

688
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,300
You are the Madam now,

689
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,780
but your parents can't share the good life with you.

690
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,220
It's not perfect.

691
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,380
What about my telling all the people in the state

692
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,100
to look for your parents?

693
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,460
Thank you for your favor. Your Majesty.

694
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,020
Maybe my parents are

695
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,620
travelling in another state now.

696
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,940
It's not an effective way.

697
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,740
Besides, you drag people to look for my parents so abruptly.

698
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,820
I don't want Your Majesty and me to bear the criticism.

699
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,220
OK.

700
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,060
Just put it aside.

701
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,980
I'm so greedy that I didn't solve it properly.

702
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,980
If things continue this way,

703
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,060
how can I make His Majesty safe?

704
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,900
It's better for me to make a decision early.

705
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,060
Your Majesty.

706
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,640
As for the awards, I have prepared them well.

707
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,500
Please have a look.

708
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,340
OK.

709
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:19,980
By the way,

710
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,860
send the nerve soothing incense that I concocted for Madam Jiu

711
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,020
and the gilding censer decorated with a wandering dragon

712
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,020
to her as well.

713
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,780
Yes.

714
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,500
Your Majesty,

715
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,860
you are really sincere to Madam Jiu.

716
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,750
It's good for you to know it.
