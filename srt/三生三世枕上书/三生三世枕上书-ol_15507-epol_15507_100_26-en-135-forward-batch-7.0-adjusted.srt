00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 26

3
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,940
Si Ming.

4
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,460
These days I heard

5
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,220
the gossip about Lord Cheng Yu and Third Prince Lian Song,

6
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,820
which has been spread all over the Sky Kingdom.

7
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,780
What happened to them on earth?

8
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,100
How could there be so much discussion?

9
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,300
It's not a hot topic any more.

10
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,140
Recently,

11
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,820
there has been another anecdote

12
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,220
spreading in the Sky Kingdom.

13
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,820
I'm not interested in it.

14
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,940
It's just too popular.

15
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,220
Obviously, you're not interested in gossips.

16
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,700
Neither am I.

17
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,020
But

18
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,860
tell me something about it.

19
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,740
Frankly speaking,

20
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,460
neither you nor I like gossiping.

21
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,860
It doesn't matter for us to have a talk about it.

22
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,660
Your Highness, you can never imagine that

23
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,500
His Majesty who we usually think

24
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,340
upright with self-discipline

25
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,020
can't be judged by his looks.

26
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,420
Your fate with him was stopped that year.

27
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,860
In my opinion,

28
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,260
it was to protect you,

29
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,260
which is really worthy.

30
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,180
What's wrong with His Majesty?

31
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,100
I heard that

32
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,380
His Majesty had a stunning fairy

33
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,940
in Tai Chen Palace

34
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,740
who is greatly favored by him.

35
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,340
So it appears that

36
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,780
this is the reason

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,060
why he doesn't leave Tai Chen Palace for these years.

38
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,540
Indeed,

39
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,460
with a beauty's company,

40
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,420
even though he doesn't leave the palace,

41
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,060
he won't feel lonely.

42
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,820
Your Highness, don't care about it.

43
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,180
Anyhow, you have nothing to do with him now.

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,380
I told you this

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,060
not to worry you.

46
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,540
Which fairy does His Majesty have a fancy for?

47
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,180
I'm not interested in it.

48
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,340
I'm just asking casually.

49
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,500
In private, we...

50
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,780
They have different predictions of this fairy.

51
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,420
But it's really a mismatch between His Majesty and love affairs.

52
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,260
Except his foster sister Princess Zhihe,

53
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,340
they don't have other predictions.

54
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,340
But Princess Zhihe

55
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,860
has been serving her punishment in the West Desert.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,820
In my opinion,

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,940
it's less likely to be her.

58
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,700
As for the fairy,

59
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
actually

60
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,140
there was only one exact thing.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,140
It was said that, six or seven days ago,

62
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,340
Third Prince Lian song saw His Majesty

63
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,380
taking the fairy to bathe in the hot spring in Tai Chen Palace.

64
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,420
Bathe in the hot spring?

65
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,060
You don't believe it, right?

66
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,460
I was also very surprised after hearing it.

67
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,300
Unbelievable!

68
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,940
Well, speaking of this,

69
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,780
there was also another talk the day before yesterday,

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,820
which was well organized, analyzed

71
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,860
and a little believable.

72
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,020
Unexpectedly, the figure in the talk

73
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,460
is someone around us.

74
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,980
We have never heard of it.

75
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980
Who is she?

76
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,980
She is your good friend, Lord Cheng Yu.

77
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,420
It's said that Lord Cheng Yu

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,020
is the illegitimate daughter of His Majesty and the fairy.

79
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,660
Your Highness.

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,180
You are really clinging when you insist on something

81
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,300
while you feel free when you let it go.

82
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,260
It's an advantage which even God Bai Qian is lack of.

83
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,140
When God Bai Qian meets

84
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,300
something elusive,

85
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,980
she won't give up until she makes it clear.

86
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,980
However, you just deal with everything
according to your capability.

87
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,780
Admirable!

88
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,580
To be honest,

89
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm really qualified to bear

90
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,620
this title.

91
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,060
I didn't prepare well then,

92
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,140
so there were some jokes.

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,620
But now

94
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,980
I remember one of my mottoes.

95
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,780
You've been living for more than thirty thousand years

96
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,060
with numerous mottoes

97
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,220
collected.

98
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,420
Which one do you mean?

99
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,420
Never fall in love with a man who is involved with another woman.

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,740
Incisive!

101
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,500
Lord Cheng Yu.

102
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,100
Lord Cheng Yu is quite beautiful.

103
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,660
If she was really the illegitimate daughter of His Majesty,

104
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,420
the fairy must have been a national beauty.

105
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm going to see Lord Cheng Yu,

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,980
Find a right chance to ask her something about it.

107
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,060
I have helped you get the schedule of His Majesty.

108
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,740
Cheng Yu.

109
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,820
You really do me a great favor.

110
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,780
All right.

111
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,700
Let's get down to business.

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,220
As the respected immortal among the gods,

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,660
Emperor Dong Hua has lived in seclusion
in Yi Shi San Heaven partly,

114
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,620
but there are still some responsibilities that
he doesn't discharge to the Heavenly King,

115
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,460
such as taking charge of the name book of the immortals.

116
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,380
Each year on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month,

117
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,660
the immortals who have finished cultivating in the world

118
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
need to climb to the 36th Heaven, Daluo Heaven

119
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,940
to pay a visit to His Majesty in Qingyun Hall,

120
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,980
asking him to give them a suitable rank.

121
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,660
However, there are so many immortals.

122
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,140
As for my thing, the fewer people are involved, the better.

123
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,300
There are so many people here.

124
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,700
Just wait me to finish my words.

125
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,060
According to the routine,

126
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,100
after all the immortals leave when the worship is over,

127
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,900
His Majesty will incidentally check Lianxin Mirror

128
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,540
in the Qingyun Hall

129
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,020
and stay there for a while.

130
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,340
Then in this moment,

131
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,220
I can go to get back my bracelet.

132
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,980
It's the fifth day of the fifth lunar month tomorrow.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,220
Well,

134
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,860
I still have something to do in my palace. I'm leaving first.

135
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,620
Cheng Yu.

136
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,460
You really do me a great favor.

137
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,580
The fifth day of the fifth lunar month.

138
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,740
My mother told me that

139
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,580
when asking for payment of debt,

140
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,500
someone must act quickly, accurately and cruelly,

141
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,260
avoiding others' denying of the debt at the very beginning

142
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,660
with enough vigour

143
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,820
and properly affirming the debt

144
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,620
to others.

145
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,020
Only in this way can the person

146
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,740
give you a perfect answer.

147
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,940
Sister, I won't grab it with you.

148
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,940
Eat slowly.

149
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm full. Just enjoy your food.

150
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,820
With something else to do, I'm leaving first.

151
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,220
Sister Fengjiu.

152
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,340
Where are you going? I also want to go with you.

153
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,780
With something urgent to do,

154
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,940
I can't take you along with me.

155
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,060
Let me go.

156
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,140
Sister, tell me where you are going.

157
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,860
I'm sure not to cause you any trouble.

158
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,980
Who annoys you?

159
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
It's not bad to have more helpers during a fight.

160
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,020
You can't compete against him.

161
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,140
Fengjiu.

162
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,100
No,no, no. It's not what you saw and heard.

163
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,620
You teach your younger brother like this?

164
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,940
No. No.

165
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,700
Li. I will bring you some delicious food.

166
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,380
Study hard!

167
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,460
Sister Fengjiu.

168
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,140
Sister Fengjiu.

169
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,420
Why is Sister Fengjiu so busy recently?

170
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,700
She always takes me along with her.

171
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,740
Maybe there are something new in the heaven.

172
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,540
She's just joining the fun.

173
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,700
Maybe the worship meeting has been over.

174
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,220
Is His Majesty is inside alone?

175
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,260
Who are you?

176
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,260
Bai Qian from Qingqiu.

177
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,980
Your Highness.

178
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,540
His Majesty is inside.

179
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,220
It's just the right time.

180
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,420
I'm going to discuss something important with His Majesty.

181
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,220
Don't let any other people go inside.

182
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,340
I'm sure to award you later.

183
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,820
It's true that His Majesty is here alone.

184
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,420
Was my tea-crystal bracelet

185
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,820
left here that night?

186
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
I am sleepwalking,

187
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,620
going to the wrong place.

188
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,860
It's true that you left your bracelet here.

189
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,380
There was also a hairpin

190
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,100
as well as this

191
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,940
pinning flower you dropped in the hot spring.

192
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,860
Just come for it.

193
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,020
Really I am sleepwalking, going to the wrong place.

194
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:55,780
And...

195
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,180
I seem to be sober suddenly,

196
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,660
spiritually clear,

197
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,380
maybe thanks to the great miraculous brightness here.

198
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,460
Your Majesty.

199
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,140
Indeed I have something

200
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,300
to take back from you.

201
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
I didn't come to the wrong place.

202
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,740
Please keep them for me.

203
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,100
I'll get them back later.

204
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,140
Owing to my obtrusion,

205
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,740
your worship meeting is disturbed.

206
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,420
I'm sincerely sorry for that.

207
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm sure to specially hold an assembly

208
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,060
to apologize to you another day.

209
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,020
OK.

210
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,500
You won't take them by yourself

211
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,180
but wait for me to send them to your hand, right?

212
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,220
See? she runs away.

213
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,620
She is shy.

214
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,500
She is shy.

215
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,620
Her Highness Fengjiu.

216
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,740
Really it's her.

217
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,500
I heard that, today in Qingyun Hall,

218
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,300
you played tricks on Fengjiu in front of all the immortals.

219
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,460
The Immortal Official

220
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,460
named Chong Lin who is loyal and upright

221
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
is very worried,

222
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,580
hoping to keep your image of

223
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,140
integrity and justice.

224
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,140
He even came to discuss with me.

225
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,700
Have a discussion about integrity and justice with you?

226
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,340
Is he over drunk?

227
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,860
Forget it.

228
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,380
I won't fuss about it with you.

229
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,620
I'm here to tell you something serious.

230
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,300
With your interruption, I nearly forget it.

231
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,420
The demons in the South Desert
have some unusual movements recently.

232
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,580
Xu Yang became depressed

233
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,780
because of his sister Ji Heng.

234
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,940
Nie Chuyin is healing his wounds.

235
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,300
And the man

236
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,420
called...

237
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,460
Called what?

238
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,180
How could I forget his name?

239
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,380
He is Yan Chiwu, one of the seven lords of the demons.

240
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,420
Because of the joint-marriage between you

241
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
and First Princess of the demons,

242
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,700
he asked for a fight with you.

243
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,940
Without precaution,

244
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,860
you were locked in Ten-evil Lotus Land
by him with soul-locking jade,

245
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,460
which made you quite embarrassed like a drowned rat.

246
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Do you still remember him?

247
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,860
What's wrong with him?

248
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,700
If it hadn't been the red fox,

249
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,620
half of your cultivation would have been spoiled by

250
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,660
the demons and evils.

251
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,380
You destroyed his deployment.

252
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,100
Yan Chiwu was ashamed of you.

253
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,100
It was said that he was taking action again recently,

254
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,500
getting even with you.

255
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,900
I'm waiting for his battle letter.

256
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,580
I heard that you were cultivating your mind recently.

257
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,900
With decreasing care of fighting, you're not interested in it.

258
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,620
Is it possible that you think it was he

259
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
who caught the red fox?

260
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,980
Unexpectedly, there is something you care so much.

261
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,780
Yeah.

262
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,300
Fengjiu from Qingqiu is also a red fox.

263
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,900
Is it likely that you show appreciation for her

264
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,580
because of this?

265
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,420
How imaginative you are!

266
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,780
Why not go to Hebi House to tell stories?

267
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,540
Uncle.

268
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,340
I have just run away from the dating feast.

269
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,500
I don't think it's good for me to go out
to be seen in the public like this.

270
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,820
Yesterday God Zhe Yan went to the heaven,

271
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,660
preparing to tame the Red-fire Beast to be my new mount.

272
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,100
It appears that you want to tame the Red-fire Beast with him.

273
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,340
It doesn't matter if I go out to be seen in public sometimes.

274
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,180
It doesn't matter.

275
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,580
It's beneficial to my body and mind.

276
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,660
That's right.

277
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,740
Go out for a walk often.

278
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,980
Maybe you can meet your Mr. Right.

279
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,140
Then you won't let down your father.

280
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,660
What's your purpose to her?

281
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,380
Do you think she is good?

282
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,060
I think she is interesting.

283
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,140
Interesting?

284
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,020
It's really difficult to get your words from your mouth.

285
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,220
Here comes the Heavenly King.

286
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,500
I will go there first. Hurry up.

287
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,420
This way, please.

288
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,060
Please.

289
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,780
Unexpectedly, a fairy who is under punishment

290
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,500
could be so brilliant.

291
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,580
Since you have been here
serving your punishment for hundreds of years,

292
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,380
you can return to the Sky Kingdom.

293
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,180
What do you think, Your Majesty?

294
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,100
OK.

295
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,820
Thank you, Heavenly King.

296
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

297
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,100
The Heavenly King
is discussing something serious with the officials.

298
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,900
As the Princess of Qingqiu,

299
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,140
you can meet the prestige of heaven

300
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,820
and hear His Majesty's instructions.

301
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,980
Why not listen calmly, attentively and respectfully?

302
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,580
How could there be smiles all over your face?

303
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,180
I dare not.

304
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,500
Something just occurred to me.

305
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,620
In Qingqiu, if an immortal

306
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,380
is guilty of something,

307
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,260
only after he makes a great contribution

308
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,540
can he be listed among the immortals again.

309
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,620
Unexpectedly, as for the gods,

310
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,660
one can be so easily forgiven by having a dance.

311
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,940
At first, I was worried about Princess Zhihe,

312
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,700
so smiled with a relief.

313
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,980
Later, I felt the laws of the gods

314
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,420
are liberal and full of kindness,

315
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,340
so I smiled with appreciation.

316
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,220
However, it suddenly occurred to me that

317
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,460
Princess Zhihe is talented and skilled.

318
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,060
Naturally she will be absolved.

319
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,380
What if an immortal

320
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,300
who is neither talented nor skilled

321
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,780
committed a crime?

322
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,220
So I smiled with doubts.

323
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,540
It's just my superficial opinion.

324
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,060
Please don't laugh at me.

325
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,700
When it comes to harsh words,

326
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,140
she has a glib tongue.

327
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,300
She is no worse than you today.

328
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,340
I speak more briefly than her.

329
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,220
The doubts of the Princess of Qingqiu is really good.

330
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,420
The laws of the Sky Kingdom are always strict and impartial.

331
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,420
If Princess Zhihe wants to return to the Sky Kingdom,

332
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,380
she must make a contribution in the battlefield.

333
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,940
This is also a law in the heaven,

334
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,340
a clear rule.

335
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Since it is so,

336
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,540
as for Princess Zhihe's return to the Sky Kingdom,

337
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,140
let's talk about it later.

338
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,660
I can go to the battlefield instead of her

339
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,020
If she has to make contributions in the battlefield

340
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,980
for the purpose of returning to the Sky Kingdom.

341
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,260
When in Qingqiu,

342
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,660
we heard Princess Zhihe's parents who have passed away

343
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,780
ever fostered Your Majesty.

344
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,180
You really have affection and faith. Your Majesty.

345
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,540
As foster brother and sister, His Majesty and Princess Zhihe
are really kind and respectful to each other.

346
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,380
OK, just let it be.

347
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,740
It's just a casual party.

348
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,340
You can freely walk around to know each other.

349
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,780
No need to crowd here.

350
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,460
There is scenery everywhere in Baoyueguang Garden.

351
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,940
You don't need to stand on ceremony.

352
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,340
Thank you for your kindness, Heavenly King.

353
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,660
So long, Heavenly King.

354
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,180
Having known Your Highness for a long time,

355
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,060
I feel so lucky

356
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,540
to see you by myself today.

357
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,260
I've long been looking forward to meeting you.

358
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,300
You look abnormal. What are you doing?

359
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,980
Stand still. Don't move.

360
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,940
I planned to rehearse for more days to show you,

361
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,100
but

362
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,420
it's good to show you tonight.

363
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,020
As you said, you are repaying my kindness, right?

364
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,060
Enjoying the beauty of flowers with Lord Cheng Yu,

365
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,460
I feel greatly honored.

366
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,580
There is something that I need to explain to you clearly.

367
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,740
If it's something bad,

368
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,780
don't talk about it tonight.

369
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,980
No.

370
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,340
I just appreciate God Zhe Yan

371
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,820
without any other meanings.

372
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,460
I know you have feeling for me.

373
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,900
They are not the same thing.

374
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,940
Don't talk nonsense.

375
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,820
Cheng Yu, we...

376
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,660
Shut up.

377
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,380
Are you OK?

378
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,220
No.

379
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,020
It doesn't count this time.

380
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,820
Turn to me next time you are in trouble.

381
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,860
Cheng Yu, have you ever thought that

382
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,540
maybe this is the will of heaven?

383
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,540
We can never pay off to each other.

384
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,540
It's so strange!

385
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,740
Why does my heart beat so fast?

386
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,860
Am I sick?

387
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,900
It must be.

388
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,780
What are you doing here?

389
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,740
I'm drinking juice.

390
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,940
This is wine.

391
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,140
Are you going to fight with someone?

392
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,060
Can you take me along with you?

393
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm so little.

394
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,660
I won't cause you any trouble.

395
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,500
Can you take me?

396
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,820
You're drunk.

397
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,700
Maybe.

398
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,500
I feel dizzy.

399
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,900
Do you still remember the way?

400
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,460
Let me send you back.

401
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,100
You're lying.

402
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,020
You told me that you were going to give

403
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,660
someone a lesson.

404
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,660
Then you asked me to wait you here.

405
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,940
But you didn't come back.

406
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,020
It's I who went to look for you.

407
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,940
When did it happen?

408
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,380
Not long ago.

Who am I?

417
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,580
Your Majesty.

418
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,660
But

419
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,540

Why?

422
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,700
You said I was a pet.

423
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,500
You didn't ask me to stay when I left.

I don't remember

426
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,060
I told so.

427
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,060
It turns out to be that this morning in Qingyun Hall,

428
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,020
the fairy that Emperor Dong Hua played tricks on

429
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,500
is the Princess of Qingqiu
who has long enjoyed a good reputation,

430
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,580
Her Highness Fengjiu.

431
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,140
His Majesty protects his foster sister so much.

432
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,660
I'm wondering how Her Highness Fengjiu feels in her heart.

433
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,980
I can see something in essence,

434
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,820
which can be understood in another way.

435
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,660
I am seated far away from the main seat.

436
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
I'm not sure if my opinion is right.

437
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,860
Tell me.

438
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,140
In the mortal realm,

439
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,140
actually it's something about

440
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,460
the younger sister striving for her elder brother's favor
with her sister-in-law.

441
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,580
Probably the younger sister

442
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,140
has some attachment to her elder brother.

443
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,940
The sister-in-law also hates to see the younger sister.

444
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,900
Then the dispute came into being.

445
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,780
It's really what you said.

446
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,620
You have strong perception and a clear mind.

447
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,580
I'm wondering who is your commander.

448
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,700
You really have a promising future.

449
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,820
What's this?

450
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,500
It's...

451
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,260
It's His Majesty's clothing.

452
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,020
How could it be here?

453
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,100
What happened?

454
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,340
It's Brother Dong Hua's clothing, right?

455
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,140
When your father was young,

456
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,060
he called Dong Hua uncle.

457
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,780
Should I call him according to Sister Fengjiu's address

458
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,860
or my father's?

459
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,900
What happened on earth?

460
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,420
It's nothing serious.

461
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
You were drunk last night.

462
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,860
His Majesty did a good deed, sending you back to Qingyun Hall.

463
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,300
But you were so drunk,

464
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,380
holding the front of his gown tightly without loosing your hand.

465
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,300
Unable to wake you up,

466
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,740
he can do nothing

467
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,300
but take off his gown and leave it here.

468
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,460
Hmm,

469
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,180
maybe he was also on the way.

470
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,700
Anyhow, he did a good deed.

471
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,340
Neither his good name

472
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,940
nor my good name was damaged, which is good.

473
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,180
As you know,

474
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,500
His Majesty can't stay overnight in Qingyun Hall.

475
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,020
With his gown leaving to you,

476
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,260
it's not convenient for him to go out.

477
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,940
Besides, in Qingyun Hall,

478
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,900
there aren't any clothes which are suitable for His Majesty.

479
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,380
So Li went to borrow clothes

480
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,460
from Bai Qian.

481
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,220
However, it was the wedding day of Bai Qian and Ye Hua.

482
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,940
Maybe they had a sound sleep.

483
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,180
So Li yelled loudly in the yard.

484
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,460
I'm afraid all the people in Xiwu Palace could hear it.

485
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,180
What did you say?

486
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,860
Just tell the truth.

487
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,860
Brother Dong Hua took sister Fengjiu back to Qingyun Hall.

488
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,420
Sister Fengjiu prevented him going back,

489
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,980
so Brother Dong Hua accompanied her for a while.

490
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,380
By the way, he also took off his gown.

491
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,660
He has no gown to wear.

492
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,780
So I came to borrow a gown from father.

493
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,740
Mother.

494
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,540
Is my father in your room?

495
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
I yelled like this.

496
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,580
I said I would forget you.

497
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,820
Why do you always turn up in front of me?

498
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,020
Sister Fengjiu.

499
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,860
You frighten me.

500
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,140
What's wrong?

501
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,180
My mother asked me to give uncle's letter to you.

502
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,500
= Fengjiu, I miss you so much.
You take Li back now! Father Bai Yi =

503
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,260
What does he say?

504
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,660
He said it was not long before I went back to Qingqiu

505
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,740
and asked me to have a good preparation.

506
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,060
Time passes so quickly.

507
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,820
I don't want you to go back.

508
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,540
These days,

509
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,540
I can have a good time with you.

510
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,860
Later,

511
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,860
when you miss me,

512
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,300
just go to Qingqiu to see me.

513
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,940
Fine. When can we go to play?

514
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
After I send these things back,

515
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,100
then we can go.

516
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,100
OK.

517
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,180
Foster brother.

518
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,820
Is there something strange about this gown?

519
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,580
The court banquet has been over.

520
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,500
Choose someday to go to the West Desert.

521
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,900
Foster brother.

522
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,420
Sister Fengjiu. Hurry up.

523
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,380
I'm coming.

524
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,980
Let's go.

525
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,140
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

526
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,100
Sister Fengjiu, shall we still go out?

527
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,100
Of course.

528
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,740
We shouldn't let down the good days.

529
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,660
Let's go.

530
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,460
Princess Zhihe.

531
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,260
You haven't gone to the West Desert yet.

532
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,620
Foster brother has tender affection for me,

533
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,020
asking me to stay for more days.

534
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,100
His Majesty and Princess Zhihe
are really kind and respectful to each other.

535
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,700
Probably you can get along well with His Majesty,

536
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,140
living happily.

537
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,820
Tell me

538
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,020
if it was you

539
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,820
who threw the purple gown to Tai Chen Palace just now.

540
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,660
Don't attempt to bewitch my foster brother.

541
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,500
You'd better give up the idea.

542
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,660
Zhihe.

543
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,300
For one thing, you haven't returned to the West Desert with sin.

544
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,820
For another, you look down upon the laws of heaven, offending me.

545
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,900
With a good mood today,

546
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,020
I won't fuss about it with you.

547
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,660
Am I right?

548
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,820
Who are you?

549
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,420
Bai Fengjiu.

550
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,380
You must have something to do with Xiaojiu.

551
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,180
Don't bully Sister Fengjiu.

552
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,900
Don't attempt to bewitch my foster brother.

553
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,020
Your Highness.

554
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,900
Sister Fengjiu. Look.

555
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,140
Your Highness.

556
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,660
Your Highness.

557
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,540
Your Highness.

558
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,020
It seems that

559
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,380
the birds droppings and you bring out the best of each other.

560
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,540
Let's go.

561
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,860
Bai Fengjiu, just wait.

562
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,620
Her Highness Fengjiu.

563
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,900
Princess Zhihe.

564
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,100
Sister Fengjiu, what are they doing?

565
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,180
I don't know.

566
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,460
As for our identities,

567
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,180
we mustn't eavesdrop anything.

568
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,620
Sister Fengjiu.

569
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,700
I really want to know.

570
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,780
Are you curious about it?

571
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,140
Yes.

572
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,580
So you must be very careful.

573
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,020
Don't expose your identity.

574
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,740
You know?

575
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,980
Yes.

576
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,940
Come here. Li.

577
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,820
Hurry up.

578
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,420
What are they doing?

579
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,300
They are having a bet of long match.

580
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,540
They are betting on Brother Dong Hua.

581
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,420
Uncle.

582
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,420
Grandpa.

583
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,620
They're betting on Grandpa Dong Hua

584
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
whether he will marry you

585
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,060
or Princess Zhihe.

586
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,780
You are so little.

587
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,260
Do you know what is a long match?

588
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,620
I don't know,

589
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,500
but I am eager for knowledge.

590
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,460
I asked an onlooker immortal

591
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,660
about it.

592
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,140
He didn't have a clear explanation,

593
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,260
but just told me

594
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,620
there were 25 bets on Princess Zhihe

595
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,860
with only three bets on you,

596
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,220
which are bet wrongly with carelessness.

597
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,020
I still don't understand.

598
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
But I don't want you to wait for long,

599
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,140
so I came back secretly.

600
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,780
Just before I left,

601
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,900
I saw him arguing with a brother,

602
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,100
asking if he could transfer his three bets

603
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,900
to Princess Zhihe.

604
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,860
Have 200 bets

605
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,300
on me.

606
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,220
I am so young. How could you teach me to cheat?

607
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,580
That's because,

608
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,740
as for anything related to Qingqiu,

609
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,940
I wouldn't like

610
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,380
to be inferior to others.

611
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Maybe this is the spirit of a monarch.

612
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,780
If you don't believe me, just think about the past.

613
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,460
According to younger uncle,

614
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,100
you never won first in your study.

615
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,780
All your subjects are inferior to others,

616
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,780
some of which even rank the last.

617
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,500
That's because

618
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,620
no one is perfect in everything.

619
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,420
It's not likely that you never rank the last.

620
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,300
Nonsense.

621
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,820
I never won the last.

622
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,860
Take it.

623
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,260
Just bet on me.

624
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,740
Besides,

625
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,460
you have never won the last

626
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,220
because you haven't had a Buddhist theories.

627
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,180
You can't imagine how difficult it is.

628
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,500
Is it so difficult?

629
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
I saw Brother Dong Hua...

630
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,780
Grandpa Dong Hua

631
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,940
fishing while reading a Buddhism book

632
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,980
for fun.

633
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,660
He is abnormal.

634
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:54,740
No.

635
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,500
The fragrance is so heavy.

636
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,420
I can't resist it.

637
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,060
I will wait for you in the forest ahead.

638
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,140
What did you do to her?

639
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,620
She praised you like this.

640
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,580
Praise?

641
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,780
Cheng Yu praised you like this?

642
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,660
No.

643
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,940
Cheng Yu praised me that I was a rascal.

644
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,340
You have bet on me?

645
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,660
Several brothers laughed at me
that I didn't have a good judgement.

646
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,140
But I still firmly

647
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,580
bet on you.

648
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,980
Good.

649
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,460
Although we suffered financial loss today,

650
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,340
yet

651
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,060
we reversed the losing game.

652
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,260
I'm so happy today. I will take you to have a spring field trip.

653
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,860
I heard, several days ago,

654
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,340
you received the battle letter from Yan Chiwu

655
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,660
and would go to Mount Fuyu in two days.

656
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,300
Chong Lin specially took Canghe Sword,

657
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,220
asking me to polish it.

658
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,100
But I don't think it's such a situation.

659
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,700
How could I meet him here?

660
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,580
I...

661
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,180
Hmm...

662
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,180
If he comes here,

663
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,780
just say that you're catching butterflies here by yourself.

664
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,660
What did you think when you made Canghe Sword?

665
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
On the area as small as a palm,

666
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,980
you tried hard to chisel

667
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,300
over ten thousand sections with zirconite

668
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,620
and over five thousand holes in different depths.

669
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,500
It really caused me much mental fatigue to repair and clear it.

670
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,900
Is it possible that you hide

671
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,020
some secret mechanisms in it?

672
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,700
No.

673
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,740
I just had too much free time.

674
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,140
Unexpectedly, in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

675
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,460
you are always eulogized

676
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,460
peaceful in mind,

677
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,860
integrity and upright.

678
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,420
With nobody to disclose you,

679
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,620
how does Chong Lin make it?

680
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,260
As you said,

681
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,220
What do you think?

682
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,100
I also think it's hard for him to do that.

683
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,020
Glad to see you, Your Majesty.

684
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,100
Glad to see you, Third Grandpa.

685
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,540
Li.

686
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,900
What are you doing here?

687
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,340
Grandpa.

688
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,460
I am catching butterflies here.

689
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:07,980
Lightly.

690
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,620
You are pulling my ear.

691
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,420
This is...

692
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,140
I lost a handkerchief.

693
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,060
I have looked for it for several days.

694
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,140
Lightly.

695
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,940
Feng...

696
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,980
The handkerchief may feel painful.

697
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,020
It's clear that the handkerchief has the style of women.

698
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,140
How could it be?

699
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,020
I heard that someone said I was abnormal.

700
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,260
An abnormal person uses a handkerchief with the style of women.

701
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,540
Is it strange?

702
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,460
No.

703
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,260
As you said,

704
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,100
it's not strange at all.

705
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,900
It's too late.

706
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,860
Aren't you going to enjoy the lotus by boat?

707
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,340
Yes.

708
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,060
In the afternoon when it's not windy,
there won't be elegant taste.

709
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:01,980
Let's go now.

710
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,900
Li.

711
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,220
We'll play with you next time.

712
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,340
So long, Your Majesty. Third Grandpa.

713
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,180
Am I hunted by ghosts

714
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,580
to change myself into a handkerchief?

715
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,500
It's better to be a tree.

716
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,940
According to His Majesty's cultivation,

717
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,580
even he can see through my camouflage at one sight,

718
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,260
he can't root me up

719
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
and carry me back on his back.

720
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,820
Since it is so,

721
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,300
it's most likely that he has known

722
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,220
who I am.

723
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,540
With such a performance,

724
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,740
he just waits to make a fool of me.

725
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,820
Now that it is so,

726
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,220
I still can't

727
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,100
show myself as the Princess of Qingqiu in front of him

728
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,940
to lose the face of Qingqiu.

729
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,460
Anyway, I won't confess that

730
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,700
I am Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

731
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,220
I just disguise myself as a real handkerchief.

732
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,540
Maybe when he finds me not interesting,

733
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,940
he will throw me away.

734
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,380
As long as I close my four senses,

735
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,620
he can do nothing to me.

736
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,620
Where are they going?

737
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,460
I am so dizzy.
