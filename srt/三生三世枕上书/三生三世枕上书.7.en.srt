1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 7

3
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Si Ming, silly you!

4
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

5
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,400
I would rather knock her out to send her down

6
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,960
than leave her here

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,160
to be mistreated like this.

8
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,240
It's too late to say that.

9
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Her Highness has decided to leave.

10
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,250
I can't tolerate it even if you can.

11
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,560
After all, he's the Emperor.

12
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,760
So what?

13
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,840
Can the Emperor mistreat anyone?

14
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,340
Now, she...

15
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,240
I've visited Immortal Hanshan.

16
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
Immortal Hanshan...

17
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,200
His Book of Fate records the fates of gods.

18
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,160
- Si Ming, you... - They're not meant to be.

19
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,160
However hard you force it,

20
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,720
you can't change Emperor Dong Hua's fate.

21
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,200
In fact, it has nothing to do with Emperor Dong Hua.

22
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,360
So we can only sit back

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
and watch Fengjiu suffer?

24
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,560
We can still help her on one thing.

25
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,320
That's a deal.

26
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
We'll get back at that Demon Lord for Fengjiu.

27
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,680
Lord, mind your words.

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,080
The less people know about it, the better.

29
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,160
It concerns Her Highness's reputation.

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,160
Your Excellency!

31
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,380
Your Excellency,

32
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,960
you haven't decided which gift
to take to the banquet in Tai Chen Palace tomorrow.

33
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,280
I've chosen one.

34
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Is it OK?

35
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,760
Prepare another one.

36
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,680
Yes.

37
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,510
Your Excellency, whose name should I write?

38
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Qingqiu.

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
From someone anonymous.

40
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,320
Yes.

41
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,630
Your Excellency, the Third Prince is here.

42
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,200
Tomorrow morning,
send these two celadon-glazed lotus candlesticks

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,020
to Tai Chen Palace.

44
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,600
Yes.

45
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,880
Be extra careful!

46
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,280
Yes.

47
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,240
Watch out!

48
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Si Ming.

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
No need to be so courteous

50
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
to welcome me.

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Your Highness!

52
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
Your Highness, what brings you here

53
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
late at night?

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,440
Is Cheng Yu here?

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,480
No, she's not.

56
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,000
Really?

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,120
Yes.

58
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,440
Dare you swear to

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,560
the candlestick?

60
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,240
I swear if I lied,

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll end up alone with no wife or child.

62
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,120
Fengjiu! Fengjiu!

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,360
Silly you!

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,040
Fengjiu,

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
listen to me.

66
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
There's no future.

67
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,160
I...

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,080
It won't end well.

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Gods of the Sky Kingdom

70
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
are hypocritical and false-hearted.

71
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,600
No, Lord, that's not true.

72
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
Fengjiu, I'll have another drink with you.

73
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,440
Please!

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,600
Lord Cheng Yu, I didn't expect you to be so active.

75
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm so flattered.

76
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm at your disposal.

77
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,240
Let's...

78
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't pull my collar!

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,920
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

80
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
Your Highness, your wedding dress is here.

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
Look, it's so beautiful!

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,760
Really? Let me have a look.

83
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,120
Your Highness,

84
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
I have something important to report.

85
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,280
What's up?

86
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
His Majesty has chosen Ji Heng,
the First Princess of the demons,

87
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
to be the Queen, and the marriage
will be held on an auspicious day.

88
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,640
What?

89
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go back to the Palace now!

90
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,960
Yes.

91
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,000
♪ Whisper love in dreams. ♪

92
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,840
♪ Everything I think is for my love. ♪

93
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,000
♪ In one moment, I forget about what confuses me. ♪

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,080
♪ Because I'm surrounded by love. ♪

95
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,600
♪ Until I get hurt after giving all I have, ♪

96
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,040
♪ I finally understand how cruel you are. ♪

97
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,400
♪ I'm just afraid the fate might not recognize lovers, ♪

98
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,600
♪ Setting hundreds of tests to keep them apart. ♪

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,080
♪ It's like falling leaves tapping on the gate. ♪

100
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,760
Even if I have to cut our connections,

101
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,080
I'll always remember

102
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,400
how you cared for me these days.

103
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,520
You saved me before.

104
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,840
I have nothing to pay you back.

105
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,400
These sweet potatoes are roasted by me.

106
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,520
I'll give them to you as your wedding gift.

107
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,080
I don't know

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,080
whether you can get them or not.

109
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,800
Will you think of me

110
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,400
when seeing them?

111
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,880
It's fine, anyway.

112
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,160
♪ Go far away in your shadow. ♪

113
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,440
♪ I'm free but I have nothing. ♪

114
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,000
♪ Let memories gather dust. ♪

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,240
♪ I can't see us be together forever. ♪

116
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,440
Your Majesty, you've done nothing wrong.

117
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,720
You don't know I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

118
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
You don't know I like you.

119
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,920
You don't know how hard

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,560
I've tried to win your love.

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,040
We're just not meant to be.

122
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,440
Your Majesty,

123
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,680
I failed to win your love,

124
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,960
but I've tried my best.

125
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
I won't fight for us anymore.

126
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
I give up.

127
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,680
Your Highness,

128
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,400
if anything goes wrong now,

129
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
how should Tai Chen Palace explain

130
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,000
to the guests when they come
to congratulate His Majesty tomorrow?

131
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,320
Explain?

132
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,910
You should worry about

133
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,800
how that demon princess should explain to me first.

134
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,040
Rather than watch her

135
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,400
take away my foster brother and humiliate me,

136
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,360
I might as well...

137
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,800
Your Highness.

138
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,800
Your Majesty, please.

139
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,040
As to Princess Ji Heng...

140
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,040
What banquet?

141
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,880
What Tai Chen Palace?

142
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,840
Dong Hua,

143
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
you idiot!

144
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
How can I take advantage of you?

145
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm so pissed by Emperor Dong Hua!

146
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,920
His Majesty and Princess Ji Heng are made for each other.

147
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
You don't have to...

148
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,880
Nonsense!

149
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,640
He's just a conscienceless idiot!

150
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,640
His Majesty didn't refuse it himself.

151
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,920
Why should we?

152
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,760
Forget it.

153
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,800
It's useless talking to you.

154
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
What happened to you?

155
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,720
You tell me.

156
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Damn it!

157
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,160
I forgot about my task.

158
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,690
Cheng Yu!

159
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,120
Let's go to the banquet together.

160
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,640
I've something to attend to.

161
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Your Emperor is getting married.

162
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
You should go and congratulate him yourself.

163
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,600
I've got something more important.

164
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,720
What's more important than His Majesty's marriage?

165
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
However precious those furs are,

166
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,480
they're no match for you.

167
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,520
Gorgeous!

168
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
Really gorgeous!

169
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,040
You!

170
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,680
You gods are really arrogant.

171
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,080
You show no respect to us demons.

172
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,680
Demon Lord Nie, though you're extremely daring

173
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,080
to look down upon Qingqiu,

174
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,840
you're really a good judge of people.

175
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,760
God Zhe Yan, that doesn't sound like a compliment.

176
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,720
What's the point of humiliating me?

177
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
Humiliate?

178
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,800
Well,

179
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,280
do we need a reason

180
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
to humiliate a Demon Lord?

181
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,000
Fine.

182
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I dare not provoke you.

183
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,080
Let's go to the Sky Kingdom

184
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,800
and let the Heavenly King rule.

185
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,520
Let the Heavenly King rule?

186
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,040
When tricking Fengjiu,

187
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,720
did you ask the Heavenly King to rule?

188
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,960
You tricked Fengjiu into giving you
the fur with your silver tongue.

189
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,720
We can't blame you for that.

190
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,000
So...

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,160
So if we grab the fur

192
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,960
with our own skills,

193
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,240
you can't blame us, either.

194
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,160
Well, cut the crap!

195
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Let's fight!

196
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,880
Fengjiu has been out for so many days

197
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,000
without any message.

198
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,040
As her uncle,

199
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,800
how can you still read travel notes?

200
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,120
Father,

201
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
you've become more verbose in recent years.

202
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,040
Compared to what I've done in the early years,

203
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,560
the trouble she's caused now

204
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,280
is really nothing.

205
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,280
You!

206
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,200
When Bai Yi is back,

207
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,000
ask him to discipline his daughter well.

208
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,760
Also, as her uncle,

209
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,560
you should pay attention

210
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,360
to find her a good husband.

211
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,520
Her father is not worried.

212
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,240
As her grandfather, why do you have to worry?

213
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,160
You!

214
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,800
Listen to yourself!

215
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,080
Bai Qian has waited so long to get married.

216
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Should we let Fengjiu make the same mistake?

217
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,200
Father, rest assured.

218
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Well...

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,960
Li,

220
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,760
why are you here?

221
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,560
Grandpa, I went to Shili Peach Forest

222
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
and grabbed some good peach blossom branches.

223
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,320
Sister Fengjiu told me she had planted

224
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,800
peach trees from Shili Peach Forest in Qingqiu for many times,

225
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,280
but none of them grew.

226
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,960
If I can succeed in growing the peach trees,

227
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,520
Sister Fengjiu is sure to praise me

228
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,640
when she comes back and sees them.

229
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,000
I shouldn't have asked Bai Qian

230
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,120
to guide Fengjiu back then.

231
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,400
Following Bai Qian,

232
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Fengjiu became so mischievous

233
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
that she often climbed trees to catch birds

234
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
and went into rivers to get fish.

235
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,760
Once, when her uncle was napping,

236
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,110
she actually plucked

237
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,440
all the feathers of Jingwei.

238
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,160
Sister Fengjiu is so awesome!

239
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,520
I made one mistake before.

240
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,200
I won't make it again.

241
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,110
Li,

242
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,640
if you follow those two mischievous troublemakers,

243
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,960
I can't imagine how naughty you'll become.

244
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,640
Where're you going?

245
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
The fourth generation of our Bai family

246
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,560
should be well-mannered.

247
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,600
Come with Grandpa!

248
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,000
Grandpa, what does this have to do with me?

249
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,600
I'm wronged! I'm wronged!

250
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,720
Let's go! Who wronged you?

251
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,200
How have I wronged you?

252
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
If I see you

253
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,560
do such a vicious thing again,

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,040
from heaven to earth,

255
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,160
wherever you go,

256
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
I'll make you pay.

257
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,280
I won't calculate the interests

258
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,320
for keeping the fur these days.

259
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,560
But dare you appear in front of Fengjiu again,

260
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,790
I'll destroy your entire clan.

261
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,080
Don't worry.

262
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
The fire will go out

263
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,680
when those furs are burnt down.

264
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,920
Hope you'll keep this in mind,
and do good deeds more often.

265
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,040
Si Ming,

266
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,080
today is the big day for Tai Chen Palace.

267
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
If they see me, I'm afraid I'll have to

268
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,800
endure many unnecessary and overelaborate formalities.

269
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
Can you send Fengjiu back to Peach Forest?

270
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,080
Your Highness, rest assured.

271
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,960
Lord.

272
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,360
I have to send Her Highness back to Qingqiu.

273
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,920
Can you go to Tai Chen Palace first

274
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,680
and receive the guests for me?

275
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,930
Don't worry.

276
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,470
Don't ever mention Emperor Dong Hua in front of her again.

277
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes.

278
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,480
Come here.

279
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,320
It's been warm these days with gentle spring breezes,

280
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
and the Yi Shi San Heaven is bursting with happiness.

281
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,480
Your Majesty, I congratulate you

282
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,040
for tying the knot with Princess Ji Heng.

283
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,950
Right! Right!

284
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,960
Where is Si Ming?

285
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,160
What have you been up to lately?

286
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,330
Your Majesty, I've long heard that

287
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,920
you've got a spiritual fox by your side.

288
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,840
Rumor has it that it's clever and lovely,

289
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,640
and it can even read people's minds.

290
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,920
Ignorant and ill-informed as I am,

291
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,040
I'd really want to take this chance to see the spiritual fox.

292
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Your Majesty, please grant my wish.

293
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,560
The little fox is mischievous.

294
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,840
It's now in confinement.

295
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,720
I'll show it to you

296
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,560
when it's more obedient.

297
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,840
Lord Cheng Yu,

298
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,240
recently, I've thought several ways

299
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,800
to make food with tea.

300
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,280
A moment, please.

301
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,600
Let's talk in private.

302
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,560
What're you doing? I haven't finished yet.

303
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,950
Let's talk in private.

304
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,800
You're so audacious.

305
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,370
If His Majesty is not in a good mood today,

306
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,560
you're bound to be punished severely.

307
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
I just want to destroy his good mood.

308
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,760
Heartless as he is,

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
I just want to dampen his spirits.

310
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,720
What're you talking about?

311
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,160
In the vast universe,
who doesn't want to offer His Majesty gifts

312
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,480
to add joy to this happy occasion?

313
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,840
But you just...

314
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,320
Well,

315
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,160
I've also prepared your gift.

316
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,840
Remember, don't say it wrong.

317
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,400
Who asked you to do that?

318
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
Everyone wants to flatter him.

319
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,000
Not me!

320
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
Fine! Fine! Fine! I see.

321
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,600
You remain aloof from the world.

322
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,760
You...

323
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,320
What a meddler!

324
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,440
Lian Song,

325
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,320
when I endured hardships
in the mortal realm to become an immortal,

326
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,880
you really helped me a lot.

327
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,760
But I know,

328
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,320
this is just your way of tricking women.

329
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,080
in the future,

330
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
please don't mind my business.

331
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,240
But do you know

332
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,800
why you went to the mortal realm to endure hardships?

333
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,720
Sister Fengjiu!

334
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,680
Sister Fengjiu,

335
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,480
what happened to you?

336
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,600
Her Highness was injured in the Sky Kingdom.

337
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,200
Now she's short of magic power.

338
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,280
You must take good care of her.

339
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,600
I see.

340
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,240
Today, I have a lot of official business to attend to.

341
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,360
I can't stay here for long.

342
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,520
Just take her to God Zhe Yan.

343
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,480
Remember,

344
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,640
don't let elders of Qingqiu know about this.

345
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,040
OK.

346
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Your Highness, you really don't want me

347
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,520
to cure the wounds on your neck first?

348
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,720
No need.

349
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,360
I want them to heal by themselves.

350
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,800
Your Highness, take care.

351
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
Sister Fengjiu, what happened?

352
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,080
I embarrassed myself.

353
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,600
I disgraced Qingqiu.

354
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,920
It's no big deal.

355
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,280
You've done plenty of things
to embarrass yourself since childhood.

356
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Get up where you fall.

357
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,560
You were the one who told me that.

358
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
Jingwei,

359
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,360
you do keep my words in mind.

360
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,200
Your Highness!

361
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,600
You're back.

362
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,440
I heard someone grabbed your fur.

363
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,720
Who on earth hurt you?

364
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,920
A Demon Lord

365
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,640
or someone from the Yi Shi San Heaven?

366
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,760
It had nothing to do with him.

367
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,480
I was to blame for not being careful.

368
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,360
So you got hurt in the Yi Shi San Heaven.

369
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,960
Well,

370
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,320
I can't beat him,

371
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,960
but I can blow off the roof

372
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,320
of Tai Chen Palace.

373
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Shall I give it a try?

374
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,520
It really had nothing to do with him!

375
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,160
He knew nothing.

376
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,960
He just doesn't like me.

377
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,840
He just treated me

378
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,440
as a disobedient pet

379
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,840
till the end.

380
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,160
Emperor Dong Hua

381
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
is not the lucky guy.

382
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,200
Stop crying.

383
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,360
If your uncle sees you like this,

384
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,640
how sad will he be?

385
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,040
If your aunt sees this,

386
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,960
she will tear down Tai Chen Palace

387
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,600
before I do.

388
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,080
Your families are very protective. You know that.

389
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,120
I disgraced Qingqiu.

390
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,320
I'm glad you know it.

391
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
You should gain your dignity back bit by bit.

392
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,000
How?

393
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,240
It's quiet easy.

394
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:53,920
Your Highness!

395
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
Leave me alone.

396
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't come inside without my order.

397
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,880
Yes.

398
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
Finally, someone's here.

399
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,840
Xuan Demon Lord Nie Chuyin pays respects to Your Majesty.

400
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,320
You're the leader of Xuan Demon Clan.

401
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,520
You actually know me.

402
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Your Majesty,

403
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,560
I didn't expect to see you here.

404
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,200
I put a drop of blood tear among demons.

405
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,000
Over tens of thousands of years,

406
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,440
no one actually dared to summon me.

407
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,440
What do you want?

408
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,240
Your Majesty, please tell me how to break the seal.

409
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,440
I want to serve you.

410
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,040
Really?

411
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes.

412
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,800
Your Majesty, after you were sealed,

413
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,560
demons declined gradually.

414
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,680
Though I have low cultivation,

415
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,840
I do want to bring back our past glory.

416
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,280
I never believed

417
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,120
such high-sounding reasons.

418
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,040
Just tell me what you want.

419
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Now that Demon Lord Xu Yang
is content with the current situation

420
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,960
and shows no interest in challenging the gods,

421
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,880
I'm afraid the grand cause of reviving our race will be delayed.

422
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,640
I want to...

423
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,160
Take his place.

424
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Your Majesty, to be honest,

425
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
though I'm of limited cultivation,

426
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,160
I do want to exhaust my abilities to revive our race.

427
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,560
More importantly,

428
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,400
I want to do my bit

429
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,240
in setting you free.

430
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Aren't you afraid to see the world in utter disorder?

431
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,160
In utter disorder?

432
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,600
That's better than being bullied and oppressed by the gods.

433
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,680
Good!

434
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,040
You're really a descendent of demons.

435
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,680
To help me break the seal,

436
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,120
you should bring me the soul-locking jade first.

437
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,680
The soul-locking jade?

438
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
After the War of Mount Fuyu,

439
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,040
it turned into dust

440
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,280
and went with the wind.

441
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,100
Mount Fuyu is located

442
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,560
at the border between the fairy land and the mortal realm.

443
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,440
Even if the dust fell into the mortal realm,

444
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,520
given the chaos and disorder caused by endless war,

445
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,800
it would surely absorb all the hostile energy

446
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,160
and form the soul-locking jade again.

447
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
Your Majesty, I'm willing to

448
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
risk any danger to serve you.

449
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,480
Come to me after finding the soul-locking jade.

450
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,960
Yes!

451
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,400
What a happy day!

452
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,600
Yes.

453
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,640
Wonderful!

454
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,920
What a happy occasion!

455
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,240
We haven't had such a big gathering for a long time.

456
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
Look, how magnificent!

457
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,320
Yes!

458
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,600
It's your big day. Can't you just smile?

459
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,080
How come it's you?!

460
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
Zhihe?

461
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,840
Go and invite the Heavenly King over.

462
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,040
Yes.

463
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,440
Yan Chiwu?

464
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,040
Where did you hide Ji Heng?

465
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,680
Foster brother.

466
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,920
Call me "Your Majesty".

467
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,120
Ji Heng...

468
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
Ji Heng disappeared last night.

469
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,720
I...

470
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,720
I've made a big mistake because I got confused temporarily.

471
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,760
Your Majesty, please show mercy!

472
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Do you know you've committed the sin of deceiving me?

473
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,960
-Your Majesty! -Your Majesty! -Your Majesty!

474
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,000
What happened?

475
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,040
Ji Heng is missing.

476
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
Ji Heng doesn't deserve my foster brother!

477
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,880
Shut up!

478
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,560
Father, I failed to manage the wedding well.

479
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,120
Please punish me.

480
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,200
Zhihe deceived Emperor Dong Hua
and Lian Song failed to fulfill his duty.

481
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,360
The wedding shall be canceled today.

482
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,680
Guards!

483
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes!

484
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,320
Put them into prison.

485
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,320
After figuring out the truth,

486
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,600
I'll definitely give Emperor Dong Hua an explanation.

487
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,040
Yes!

488
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,040
Ji Heng!

489
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,480
Princess!

490
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,600
How dare you!

491
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,400
Ji Heng, what are you doing?

492
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,840
Yu Ru!

493
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
Guards! Guards...

494
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,520
Yu Ru! Yu Ru!

495
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,520
As the future wife of my foster brother,

496
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,240
how dare you...

497
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,240
So don't tell anyone else.

498
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,000
As the future wife of Emperor Dong Hua,

499
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,520
I made such a big mistake.

500
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,680
How should Tai Chen Palace and the demons...

501
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,680
So, Princess Zhihe,

502
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,120
why not let me leave quietly tomorrow.

503
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,000
Without the bride,

504
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,560
there will be no wedding tomorrow for sure.

505
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,360
in the future, His Majesty will still be that dignified
and aloof Emperor high above.

506
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,760
Is that OK?

507
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,360
Foster brother's wedding ceremony,

508
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,320
can not become a joke.

509
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,840
You don't want the wedding dressing.

510
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,200
I want it.

511
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
It must be a conspiracy of the demons.

512
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,840
Now that Ji Heng is missing,

513
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Demon Lord Xu Yang will surely

514
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,400
take the chance to attack us.

515
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,920
In my opinion, we should declare war against the demons first.

516
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,840
-Right! -Declare war! -Declare war!

517
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,520
Declare war against the demons!

518
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,640
We absolutely can't!

519
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,600
If we fight the demons, all the living creatures will suffer.

520
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,680
In my opinion,

521
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,280
we should find Ji Heng first.

522
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,240
After figuring out the truth,

523
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
we can still declare war against the demons.

524
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,150
It's a waste of time looking for her.

525
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,840
Right! Right!

526
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,190
You!

527
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,120
Everyone, don't act rashly

528
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,800
to make the world suffer.

529
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,360
Right, we can't act rashly!

530
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
The Heavenly King is here.

531
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,600
Your Majesty!

532
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,560
Xu Yang pays respects to Your Majesty.

533
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,040
Xu Yang, you've come at the right time.

534
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,240
I have something to discuss with you.

535
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
Me, too.

536
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,040
I need an explanation for the whole thing.

537
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,720
Bring him here.

538
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,000
Yes!

539
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,200
Old Heavenly King,

540
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,960
release me if you dare.

541
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,440
How despicable of you to fight me when I was outnumbered.

542
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,090
Yan Chiwu!

543
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,000
Xu Yang?

544
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,280
Look at me! Why are you still talking to them?

545
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,200
What're you waiting for?

546
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,640
Don't be rude!

547
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,840
Your Majesty,

548
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,760
Ji Heng ran away from the wedding first.

549
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,760
Then Yan Chiwu tried to snatch the bride in public.

550
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,400
As to this marriage,

551
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,360
the demons were so impudent that
they should be punished severely.

552
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Cut the crap!

553
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,440
Give Ji Heng back to us!

554
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Otherwise, I'll beat the crap out of you!

555
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,400
How dare you?!

556
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,800
Your Majesty!

557
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,040
Your Majesty, it concerns the two races this time.

558
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,960
It's better to decide after figuring out the truth.

559
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,000
Fine.

560
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,080
Ice Face,

561
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,400
don't think I'll thank you...

562
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,120
For releasing me.

563
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,120
Let's go.

564
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,680
Your Majesty,

565
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,160
is it appropriate to do so?

566
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,000
It's a private matter. I'll handle it.

567
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,200
Your Majesty, do not be bothered.

568
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,960
You shouldn't have stopped me.

569
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,600
I haven't finished yet.

570
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Ji Heng must have been hidden by that Ice Face.

571
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,280
Good for him.

572
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
He actually blames us instead.

573
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,360
In my opinion, no need to talk with them.

574
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,880
We should've fought them directly.

575
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,240
Look at you!

576
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,920
You're a Demon Lord after all!

577
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,440
Coward!

578
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,160
Shame!

579
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,320
Yan Chiwu,

580
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,720
how dared you snatch the bride?

581
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,480
You almost got us in trouble.

582
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,280
It's a waste of time

583
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
talking to a mindless demon as you are.

584
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,280
Trouble! Trouble!

585
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,400
That's all you know.

586
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,640
You even dared not defend your own sister.

587
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,720
Coward!

588
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,240
I don't want to talk to you because I despise you!

589
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,200
Pooh!

590
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,120
Say that again!

591
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,880
Pooh!

592
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,600
Yan Chiwu!

593
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,840
Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!

594
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,400
Your Highness.

595
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,480
What's up?

596
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,880
According to reports from guards,

597
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,920
Min Su is also missing.

598
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,720
This is odd.

599
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,800
Have they planned to escape in advance?

600
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,920
Your Highness, don't worry.

601
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,640
Demon Lord Xuan was afraid that

602
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,200
Min Su might try to ruin Princess's wedding,

603
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,200
so he specially asked me

604
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,360
to put soul-tracking fragrance on Min Su.

605
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,760
He'll expose himself sooner or later.

606
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,120
Send more guards to search for them at once.

607
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,280
Yes.

608
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,800
Chong Lin pays respects to Your Majesty.

609
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,570
What's up?

610
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,620
His Highness Lian Song urged me repeatedly

611
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,040
before being sent to prison

612
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,680
to send you a message with his exact words.

613
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,600
Go ahead.

614
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,840
Dong Hua, thanks to you,

615
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,480
now I have to be in prison.

616
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,960
Actually, it's fine to be in prison.

617
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,040
I can be graceful and charming

618
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,400
even I'm in prison.

619
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,280
It's just that you actually didn't involve me

620
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,040
in the marriage escaping plan.

621
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,600
I've really wasted my trust on you.

622
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,160
That's almost all.

623
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,160
Chong Lin.

624
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,680
It seems that Lian Song is punishing you.

626
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,480
Go and finish your task.

627
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,320
She can only rely on herself in the future.

628
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,240
Yes.

629
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,040
Take care.

630
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,840
Your Highness.

631
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,160
Without the help of His Majesty,

632
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,880
I might not be able to see you again.

633
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,200
This time, the Qiushui Cold Toxin
can be suppressed much longer.

634
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,040
Follow the plan.

635
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,540
Set aside your worries and rest well

636
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
after reaching the Fanyin Valley.

637
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,200
Your Majesty,

638
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,680
thank you for suppressing the Qiushui Cold Toxin for me repeatedly

639
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,840
with your cultivation.

640
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,120
I'm deeply grateful.

641
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,800
Your Highness,

642
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,480
I have to tell you something.

643
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,280
No hurry. There's ample time ahead.

644
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,040
It's late. Let's leave now.

645
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,080
Your Majesty, how are you?

646
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,480
After getting injured

647
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,000
in the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

648
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,600
you were not fully recovered.

649
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,880
These days, you've used lots of cultivation

650
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,720
to help Princess Ji Heng

651
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,600
suppress the Qiushui Cold Toxin repeatedly.

652
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,480
Why not leave everything behind for the moment
and take a rest to recuperate?

653
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm fine.

654
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,240
But I didn't expect

655
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,200
Zhihe to be

656
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,840
so obsessed.

657
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,580
How's she doing?

658
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,280
Princess Zhihe remained silent after being sent to prison.

659
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,920
She has to undo the knot

660
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,080
on her own.

661
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,040
Your Highness, has His Majesty

662
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,000
found the cure for the Qiushui Cold Toxin?

663
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,040
Not yet.

664
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,480
But this time,

665
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,200
His Majesty used lots of cultivation

666
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,240
to suppress the poison.

667
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,200
And he specially chose

668
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,440
the Fanyin Valley for me.

669
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,120
He said it's clean and pure inside the valley,

670
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,980
which is good for my rest.

671
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,400
His Majesty is really kind and righteous.

672
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,560
Yes.

673
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,440
Indifferent as His Majesty is,

674
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,760
I didn't expect him to value his former subordinate so much.

675
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,720
This time, for a promise to my father,

676
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,560
he did his best to help us escape.

677
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
I don't know

678
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,320
when I can

679
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,440
repay his kindness.

680
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,920
However, Your Highness told me

681
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,200
His Majesty is not the one you love.

682
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,520
Otherwise...

683
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,720
Why do you bring it up again?

684
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,320
I'll repay His Majesty's kindness some other day.

685
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,800
Now, the most important thing for us  is

686
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,080
to run away from this place.

687
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,840
It's late. Let's go now!
