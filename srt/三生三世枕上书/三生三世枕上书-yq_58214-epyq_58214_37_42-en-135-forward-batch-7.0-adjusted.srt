Eternal Love of Dream

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 42

3
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,900
How come I'm lying in it?

4
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,860
Is it the real me?

5
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,900
Your Majesty?

6
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,820
Your Majesty.

7
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,940
Xiaobai,

8
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,700
you're back.

9
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,620
It's great.

10
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,860
Be careful, Your Majesty.

11
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,100
Hide yourself.

12
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,980
What's on earth going on here?

13
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,020
Is that banshee

14
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,180
the one who fought with His Majesty

15
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,860
in the Fanyin Valley earlier?

16
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,700
Your Majesty.

17
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,060
Your Majesty.

18
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,860
It's fine, Nuo.

19
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,380
Everything's fine.

20
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,860
Shen Ye has finally saved you.

21
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,540
Mother, did you go beg him to save me?

22
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,940
Your father once saved him when he was alive,

23
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,740
which can be regarded as a great favor for him and his mother.

24
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,100
That he saved your life this time

25
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,060
can be counted as a reward from him.

26
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,940
But I feel sorry to

27
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,180
get Shen Ye involved.

28
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,020
I know what you're thinking.

29
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,900
You always have a thing for Shen Ye,

30
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,820
and there's an engagement between you.

31
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,540
But

32
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,460
his feeling for you is always ambiguous.

33
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,740
You made the mistake,

34
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,380
since you weren't willing to accept the way he treated you.

35
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,700
You made the mistake in a moment of weakness.

36
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,620
If there should be someone to take the responsibility,

37
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,380
Shen Ye should take it.

38
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,700
I'm not a filial daughter.

39
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,900
I let you down, mother.

40
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,980
Don't worry, Nuo.

41
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
Xiangli Que has promised me

42
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,900
that you can live in the imperial palace for more days.

43
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,740
Feel free to live here

44
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,060
and nurse your health.

45
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,100
Later,

46
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,060
I'll make good preparations

47
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,700
for your leaving in person.

48
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,300
Remember,

49
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,500
I will choose the proper timing

50
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,860
to make you return to the imperial palace.

51
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,620
What a strong smell of blood!

52
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,660
Your Majesty.

53
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,540
Your Majesty.

54
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,900
Your Majesty.

55
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,300
Xiaobai,

56
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
you finally wake up.

57
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,340
Your Majesty,

58
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,980

You... You can't just lean against me.

77
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,180
You have to lie down

But I didn't ask you to push me to the stone.

83
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,980
I didn't feel the pain when I pushed you, so I did it.

Don't make me talk to you.

85
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,380
I can feel the pain when I talk to you.

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,820
Do you think you can subdue me

115
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,620
the same as you did in the Fanyin Valley that year?

116
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,620
Only a shape can hurt you.

118
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,540
Wait and see.

119
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,900
You don't feel the pain anymore?

120
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,460
Can you talk to me for a while?

121
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,500
Of course.

122
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,660
I'm afraid I can only shout

123
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,860
due to the distance between us.

124
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,260
Why do you come here, Your Majesty?

125
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,300
Because you're here.

126
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,780
I come here for you.

127
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,740
For me?

128
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,220
Why do you come to me

129
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,540
rather than staying with your Ji Heng?

130
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,860
My Ji Heng?

131
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,380
Why do you think so?

132
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,740
Because I have remembered everything.

133
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
I've remembered

134
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,780
how hard

135
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,900
I tried to find pimpon fruit earlier.

136
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,060
You gave it to her

137
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,100
as soon as she asked.

138
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,460
If you hadn't fallen for Ji Heng and wanted to flatter her,

139
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
why would you have given it to her so easily?

140
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,220
I'm sorry for the pimpon fruit thing.

141
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,540
I didn't intend to give it to you at the first place.

142
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,220
Ji Heng came to me later,

143
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,100
and she said pimpon fruit could detoxify her Qiushui Cold Toxin.

144
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,620
The fruit was useless to me,

145
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,220
so I gave it to her without a hitch.

146
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,540
So it means

147
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,780
that Ji Heng got pimpon fruit

148
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,860
wasn't well planned by you at the first place.

149
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,500
It's because you never intended to give me,

150
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,980
and you gave it to her without a hitch.

151
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,340
Why didn't you want to give it to me?

152
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,020
Because

153
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,060
I thought you would make a cake

154
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,300
with pimpon fruit for Yan Chiwu.

155
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
I was jealous of him.

156
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,780
You were jealous?

157
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,380
That you were jealous of Yan wasn't because of Ji Heng?

158
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,540
Xiaobai,

159
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,820
why do you always mention those who don't matter?

160
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,220
Are you still mad at me?

161
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,980
What can I do

162
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,140
to make you believe that I like you, Xiaobai?

163
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
What do you want me to do?

164
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,860
Will giving my heart to you work?

165
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,540
If I hadn't liked you,

166
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,980
why should I have stepped into the Dream of Aranya?

167
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,660
Your Majesty.

168
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,020
I've already known

169
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,740
what you've done for me, Xiaobai.

170
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
You're bleeding again.

171
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,140
It doesn't matter.

172
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
When the banshee attacked you,

173
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,780
why didn't you dodge?

174
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,340
And you made yourself hurt.

175
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,420
What are you saying?

176
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,660
I can't hear you.

177
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,180
You can hear me clearly.

178
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,580
Are you sure

179
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,740
that you want to ask me these

180
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,380
instead of others?

181
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,460
You could have used your magic arts.

182
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,900
Why not use them?

183
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,980
Maybe

184
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,220
I want to show off my superb kung fu.

185
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,220
Xiaobai,

186
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,060
that you don't talk to me

187
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,940
is because I didn't kiss you well just now,

188
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,420
or I didn't flatter you?

189
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,340
Please excuse me.

190
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,580
I don't have much experience in this aspect,

191
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,140
and I'll learn from you in the future.

192
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,660
Learn from me?

193
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
You're as bold as brass.

194
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,140
I think you're supposed to prefer
some pure and naive immortal nymph.

195
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
It all depends.

196
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,340
It all depends?

197
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,020
It depends on you, Xiaobai.

198
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,460
You don't intend to respond me, do you?

199
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,100
Respond you?

200
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,780
Who knows you're telling the truth or just kidding me this time?

201
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,940
There's

202
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,540
something that I can almost recall,

203
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,580
but I don't seem to recall it clearly.

204
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,500
There may be something wrong.

205
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,620
Your Majesty,

206
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,300
do you really come here for me?

207
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm used to being alone.

208
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,460
But if you cheat on me over and over,

209
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,740
even I won't be able to stand it.

210
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,060
Xiaobai,

211
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,540
there's too much misunderstanding between us.

212
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,020
Dream of Aranya is bizarre and motley.

213
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,980
And your primordial spirit just came back to your own body.

214
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,860
Your primordial spirit wasn't peaceful,

215
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,620
and now there's other spiritual one mixed in,

216
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,060
which will lead to more odds.

217
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,780
We shouldn't talk here for too long.

218
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,740
When we leave the Dream of Aranya,

219
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,460
I'll tell you the truth to clear up
all the misunderstandings on your mind.

220
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,460
Xiaobai,

221
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,660
you have no idea why you're here.

222
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,420
It's because you were hurt heavily.

223
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,180
I nursed your health with my blood for a long time.

224
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,300
To make you recover soon,

225
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,260
I led you to the Dream of Aranya for recuperation.

226
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,780
I didn't lie to you.

227
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,260
I came here for you.

228
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,220
In the Dream of Aranya, I'm Xi Ze,

229
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
and you're Aranya.

230
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,980
We're supposed to be a couple.

231
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,460
I'll definitely protect you.

232
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,060
When everything comes to an end,

233
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,780
I'll tell you the truth in person.

234
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,580
You're Xi Ze,

235
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,300
and we are married.

236
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,660
You took me to see Yueling flowers,

237
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,620
and sang a song for me.

238
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,220
I remembered. I remembered it all.

239
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,340
Then sing one more for me.

240
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,020
Why should I?

241
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,900
I feel too painful to fall asleep.

242
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,940
If such a brave person says it hurts,

243
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,220
he must be badly hurt.

244
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,660
Come here.

245
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:17,980
Sing it.

246
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,780
Yueling flowers, the snow in the sky.

247
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,740
They start to wither when they just bloom.

248
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,780
Once exuberant, once withered.

249
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,580
Once exuberant, once withered.

250
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,620
They wither when the moon comes out.

251
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,420
They bloom when the moon disappears.

252
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,180
Yueling flowers don't know

253
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,300
they never meet the moon.

254
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,780
They bloom in an instant.

255
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,260
They wither in an instant.

256
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,020
The instants witness their blooming and withering.

257
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,220
They wither when the moon comes out.

258
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,220
They bloom when the moon disappears.

259
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,060
Xiaobai,

260
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,780
I won't hurt your feelings anymore.

261
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,860
You still remember what I said that night.

262
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,540
More than what you said that night.

263
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,580
I also heard a song when I was a child,

264
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,020
which was different from what you sang.

265
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,380
Let me sing it for you.

266
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,660
You can also sing?

267
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,500
When a full moon night comes,

268
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,340
Moonlight shines on the mountain.

269
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,300
Down the mountain stands a short fence.

270
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,300
A girl sows a pile of green beans.

271
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,340
Green vines twine the fence.

272
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,380
On the green vines bloom green flowers.

273
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,540
Pick a green flower to make the nectar.

274
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,020
Pick a green flower to make sweets.

275
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,500
I also heard the song,

276
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,180
but the last lyric

277
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,260
should be "pick a green flower as a dowry."

278
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,420
On the green vines bloom green flowers.

279
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,220
Pick a green flower as a dowry.

280
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,020
The lyric should be like this,

281
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,620
but you change the last one.

282
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,380
You like to have sweets?

283
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,300
Your Majesty,

284
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,300
if you like to have sweets,

285
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,220
don't be too embarrassed to acknowledge it.

286
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,420
There's nothing embarrassing

287
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,980
that a man likes to have sweets.

288
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,220
If I had sweets,

289
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,100
I should like them.

290
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,900
I've never seen my parents,

291
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,940
and I haven't had sweets since I was a child.

292
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,340
When I see someone having sweets,

293
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,820
I may feel envious.

294
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,740
Will you make sweets for me?

295
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,740
I'll make sweets for you.

296
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,020
I'm an expert at making sweets.

297
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
When we come out,

298
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,980
I'll take you home.

299
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,220
I didn't feel homesick,

300
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,700
since I forgot everything.

301
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,620
But now I've been

302
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
in the Dream of Aranya for a while.

303
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,060
It has been long since I left Qingqiu.

304
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,500
I feel homesick.

305
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,900
Then we'll go back to Qingqiu first after we leave here.

306
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,180
Well,

307
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,540
Moye said

308
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,820
if I want to leave the Dream of Aranya,

309
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,900
I should go through Aranya's life

310
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,540
as same as she did.

311
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,340
It's fine that you do what he said.

312
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,740
I'll take care of the rest.

313
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,860
I know you prefer a quiet place,

314
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,660
so I especially arrange the secluded Mengchun Courtyard for you.

315
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,620
If you're not satisfied,

316
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,100
there are other courtyards that can be arranged in the mansion.

317
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,780
If you need anything,

318
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,020
just instruct me.

319
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,260
Hard to divert myself from troubles.

320
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
Why so urgent?

321
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,260
Life has diversity.

322
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,060
Fate is sealed.

323
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,580
Worry and horror

324
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,140
will always come to an end.

325
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,260
Her Highness usually likes to practice calligraphy.

326
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,220
She always writes some inscriptions.

327
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,500
It's the one Her Highness wrote in person.

328
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,980
I know.

329
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,020
I can recognize her handwriting.

330
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,380
Let's go.

331
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,420
Yes, Your Excellency.

332
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,100
It's been two hundred years.

333
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,620
We finally reach the last step

334
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,620
after countless repetitions.

335
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,820
Xiaobai looks almost the same as Aranya.

336
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,460
Now Xiaobai's primordial spirit
comes to her own body spontaneously,

337
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,540
which is really uncanny.

338
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,420
Aranya's body is still in the Water Moon Pond.

339
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,180
Xiaobai's primordial spirit comes to her own body

340
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,940
while Aranya's body disappears.

341
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
Does it mean Xiaobai replace Aranya?

342
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,260
Aranya was born hundreds of years ago,

343
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,020
when Xiaobai should be cultivated in Qingqiu.

344
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,780
The only time that she was away from Qingqiu for a long time

345
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,820
was when she went to the mortal realm
to experience misfortune for me.

346
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,900
It means

347
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,900
when Aranya was born,

348
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,060
it's impossible for Xiaobai to be in the Fanyin Valley.

349
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,380
But there must be some connections between them.

350
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,220
If I have Miaohua Mirror

351
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,020
to help discover the past and present life of Aranya,

352
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,940
I'll figure out everything.

353
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,660
You wake up?

354
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,020
Get up, if you wake up.

355
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,060
I didn't seem to have a good sleep last night.

356
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,420
How come I feel sore all over my body?

357
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,620
Are you sure that the one who didn't have a good sleep

358
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,580
is you instead of me?

359
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,140
I have to go back to the Qi Nan Palace.

360
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,780
You have a good rest here.

361
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,420
You can go to the Qi Nan Palace, if you need me.

362
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,340
You have to be Aranya here

363
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,180
while I have to be Lord Xi Ze.

364
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,100
To avoid troubles,

365
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,580
I've wiped off the phoenix feather flower on your forehead,

366
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,300
and cast the Correction Magic on everyone here.

367
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,500
They will confirmedly believe

368
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,100
that you're Aranya.

369
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,300
Xiaobai,

370
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,940
there won't be any danger for you.

371
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,700
Well,

372
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,220
you exactly remind me.

373
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
Shall I make a cut

374
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,100
on my hand?

375
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,780
Otherwise they may not regard me as Aranya.

376
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,940
Aren't you afraid of pain?

377
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,460
Forget it. I'm afraid of pain. Let's not do it.

378
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,420
I'm done.

379
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,100
You got smarter.

380
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,140
Is it like the paw you bandaged

381
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,220
for the little fox in the Ten-evil Lotus Land?

382
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,140
At that time, you were so stupid

383
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,420
to get your hand hurt

384
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,980
by the fireball you spat out yourself.

385
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,380
I was not stupid. I didn't act like that normally.

386
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,900
I will only be away for a few days.

387
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,100
You go back first.

388
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,060
You should take good care of your wound.

389
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,860
Behave yourself.

390
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,300
Your Highness, you wake up.

391
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,340
Do you feel well?

392
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,980
Do you feel uncomfortable?

393
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,860
Does your wound hurt?

394
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,180
Chacha,

395
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,820
you've asked so many questions,

396
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,220
which one shall I answer first?

397
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,820
Yesterday Mr. Su said you were badly hurt and fainted away.

398
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,900
I didn't know what was going on

399
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,540
after Lord Xi Ze took you away.

400
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,340
I was so worried about you.

401
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,100
See,

402
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,740
I'm fine.

403
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,780
But why is your hand bandaged like this, Your Highness?

404
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,020
It may be painful for a while.

405
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,300
It's just a small wound. It doesn't matter.

406
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,860
It'll be fine in a few days.

407
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,740
Well, Your Highness,

408
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,740
His Excellency Shen Ye moved to the mansion yesterday.

409
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,140
The elder steward has arranged him in the Mengchun Courtyard.

410
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,500
Is he satisfied?

411
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,780
I heard from the elder steward that

412
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,580
His Excellency Shen Ye seemed to know well

413
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,540
of the environment in the mansion after he came here.

414
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,860
He even didn't need the elder steward to lead the way for him.

415
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,300
But I remember

416
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,980
His Excellency Shen Ye has never been to our mansion.

417
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,260
Is it true?

418
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,700
He's a guest anyway.

419
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,340
You take good care of him.

420
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,460
Yes, Your Highness.

421
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,180
Send him

422
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,580
whatever he wants.

423
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,340
What a good day today!

424
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,980
Chacha,

425
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,580
brew a pot of good tea and send it to the courtyard.

426
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,260
Yes. I'm on my way.

427
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,860
There're so many troubles in the Dream of Aranya,

428
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,140
but His Majesty and I

429
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,340
can live a peaceful life happily for a while

430
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,380
in the name of

431
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,860
Aranya and Lord Xi Ze's conjugal relation,

432
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,700
which can be counted as a hard-won blessing.

433
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,660
Your Highness,

434
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,540
how is

435
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,740
your wound?

436
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,940
Moye,

437
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,700
do you still think you didn't cheat me?

438
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,540
See.

439
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,580
I am almost killed

440
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,300
by that white-fronted tiger.

441
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,380
I'll definitely report to uncle

442
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,420
about everything you've done to me when I leave here.

443
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,220
I didn't expect that sacrificing your blood to the sword

444
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,340
would make you hurt so heavily.

445
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,860
Your Highness, I'm so sorry.

446
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,500
I'm kidding.

447
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,100
I'm lucky to have His Majesty by my side.

448
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,620
He has healed me in time.

449
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,140
I'm almost healed now.

450
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,700
You get your memory back?

451
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,020
That I am badly hurt this time
can be regarded as a blessing in disguise.

452
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,820
Not only I get my memory back,

453
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,660
but my primordial spirit also comes back to my body.

454
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,820
What?

455
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,580
This...

456
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,700
this is your own body?

457
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,620
Exactly.

458
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,900
Now

459
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,740
I'm the original Bai Fengjiu of Qingqiu.

460
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,460
Aranya and you resemble each other too much.

461
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,380
I can see no difference.

462
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,660
Come here.

463
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,620
Let me tell you the difference.

464
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:46,940
See.

465
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,260
There's no cut on your hand.

466
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,500
Now do you believe me?

467
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,460
Well,

468
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,380
then

469
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,300
where did you go yesterday?

470
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,420
I didn't see you go back to Aranya's mansion,

471
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,900
and I worried so much about your wound.

472
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,140
I even went to the Qi Nan Palace,

473
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,660
but I didn't find you there.

474
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,540
It's a long story.

475
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,260
When I woke up yesterday,

476
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,980
I found myself lying at the side of Water Moon Pond.

477
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,700
There's a freezing coffin right at the side of the pond.

478
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,260
My original body was preserved in the freezing coffin.

479
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,180
Once I touched my original body,

480
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,860
my primordial spirit returned

481
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,620
to my own body.

482
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,860
And I got my memory back at the same time.

483
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
What about Aranya's body?

484
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,060
That's the strangest part

485
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,540
that Aranya's body disappeared.

486
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,220
Disappeared?

487
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
How could it happen?

488
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,740
I don't know.

489
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,780
Well,

490
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,860
Moye,

491
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,860
you have asked me

492
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
to invite Lord Shen Ye to the mansion, haven't you?

493
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,540
Now he is in the mansion.

494
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,260
What shall we do next?

495
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,820
Aranya's body disappeared.

496
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,340
How could it happen?

497
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,580
Moye.

498
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,740
Moye.

499
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,580
What's wrong with you?

500
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,740
Well,

501
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,820
when Shen Ye lived in the mansion that year,

502
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,780
he never stepped out of the side chamber

503
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,580
because of his bad mood.

504
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,380
Aranya wrote to him from time to time

505
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,940
and talked with him,

506
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,660
when she noticed it.

507
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,100
Now I have to ask you

508
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,660
to write some letters to Shen Ye

509
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,900
in Aranya's handwriting.

510
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,340
Are these letters the ones you showed me,

511
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
when I just arrived here?

512
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,380
Not exactly.

513
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,140
Those letters are ones she wrote to me sometimes.

514
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,340
These are ones she especially wrote to Shen Ye.

515
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,260
But my handwriting isn't that good.

516
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,980
If compared with Aranya's,

517
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,500
mine will be far worse than Aranya's.

518
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,540
You'll have to give me more time to practice my handwriting.

519
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,100
Forget it. Forget it.

520
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,260
You take good care of yourself first.

521
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,420
I'll deal with the letter thing.

522
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,860
Your Highness,

523
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,300
do you think

524
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,020
the Dream of Aranya is too bizarre?

525
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,020
I'm even too bewitched to

526
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,980
distinguish whether my feelings at the moment

527
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,940
belong to me in the dream world

528
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,860
or the original me in the real world,

529
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,300
when I stay here for long.

530
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,060
Your Highness, there's an ambiguous connection

531
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,500
between Aranya and you.

532
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,340
I'm afraid what's happening now is tricky.

533
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,180
You'd better be careful.

534
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,860
Moye,

535
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,540
your feeling bewitched may be

536
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,860
because the dream world

537
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,540
is essentially a part of your life.

538
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,980
It's sure that an insider will feel more bewitched.

539
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,180
You look romantic and unruly,

540
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,420
but deep in your heart,

541
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,980
you always care for Aranya.

542
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,460
Perhaps you feel like this

543
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,940
because of the devil inside.

544
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I don't feel the same as you,

545
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,940
since this is not my life.

546
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,180
All that I care about is His Majesty.

547
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,540
As long as His Majesty is here,

548
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,460
I'll have nothing to worry about.

549
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,220
I'm bewitched.

550
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,460
Thank you for enlightening me, Your Highness.

551
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,540
Not at all. Not at all.

552
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,500
Moye, let's hasten

553
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,300
to go through the whole life of Aranya.

554
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,140
You can get the answer you want

555
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,020
while we can go back

556
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,660
to our real world.

557
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,740
As long as the Miaohua Mirror is made,

558
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,180
I'll get to know the connection between Xiaobai and Aranya.

559
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,180
With you,

560
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,900
I can start to run the furnace and make the mirror.
