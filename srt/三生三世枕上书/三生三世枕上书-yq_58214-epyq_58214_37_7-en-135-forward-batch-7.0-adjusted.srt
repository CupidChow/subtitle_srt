1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 7

3
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Si Ming, silly you!

4
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

5
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,400
I would rather knock her out to send her down

6
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,960
than leave her here

7
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
to be mistreated like this.

8
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240
It's too late to say that.

9
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,200
Her Highness has decided to leave.

10
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,250
I can't tolerate it even if you can.

11
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,560
After all, he's the Emperor.

12
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
So what?

13
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
Can the Emperor mistreat anyone?

14
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,340
Now, she...

15
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,240
I've visited Immortal Hanshan.

16
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,560
Immortal Hanshan...

17
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,200
His Book of Fate records the fates of gods.

18
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
- Si Ming, you... - They're not meant to be.

19
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,160
However hard you force it,

20
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,720
you can't change Emperor Dong Hua's fate.

21
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,200
In fact, it has nothing to do with Emperor Dong Hua.

22
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,360
So we can only sit back

23
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,520
and watch Fengjiu suffer?

24
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
We can still help her on one thing.

25
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,320
That's a deal.

26
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
We'll get back at that Demon Lord for Fengjiu.

27
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
Lord, mind your words.

28
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
The less people know about it, the better.

29
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,160
It concerns Her Highness's reputation.

30
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,160
Your Excellency!

31
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,380
Your Excellency,

32
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,960
you haven't decided which gift
to take to the banquet in Tai Chen Palace tomorrow.

33
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,280
I've chosen one.

34
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,520
Is it OK?

35
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,760
Prepare another one.

36
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,680
Yes.

37
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,510
Your Excellency, whose name should I write?

38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Qingqiu.

39
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
From someone anonymous.

40
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,320
Yes.

41
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,630
Your Excellency, the Third Prince is here.

42
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,200
Tomorrow morning,
send these two celadon-glazed lotus candlesticks

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,020
to Tai Chen Palace.

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,600
Yes.

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
Be extra careful!

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes.

47
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,240
Watch out!

48
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,800
Si Ming.

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,360
No need to be so courteous

50
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
to welcome me.

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Your Highness!

52
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,080
Your Highness, what brings you here

53
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
late at night?

54
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Is Cheng Yu here?

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,480
No, she's not.

56
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Really?

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes.

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,440
Dare you swear to

59
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,560
the candlestick?

60
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
I swear if I lied,

61
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll end up alone with no wife or child.

62
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Fengjiu! Fengjiu!

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,360
Silly you!

64
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,040
Fengjiu,

65
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,560
listen to me.

66
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
There's no future.

67
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,160
I...

68
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,080
It won't end well.

69
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Gods of the Sky Kingdom

70
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
are hypocritical and false-hearted.

71
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,600
No, Lord, that's not true.

72
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,240
Fengjiu, I'll have another drink with you.

73
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,440
Please!

74
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,600
Lord Cheng Yu, I didn't expect you to be so active.

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
I'm so flattered.

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm at your disposal.

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,240
Let's...

78
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,680
Don't pull my collar!

79
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,920
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

80
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,000
Your Highness, your wedding dress is here.

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,680
Look, it's so beautiful!

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,760
Really? Let me have a look.

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Your Highness,

84
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
I have something important to report.

85
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,280
What's up?

86
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
His Majesty has chosen Ji Heng,
the First Princess of the demons,

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,520
to be the Queen, and the marriage
will be held on an auspicious day.

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,640
What?

89
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's go back to the Palace now!

90
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,960
Yes.

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
♪ Whisper love in dreams. ♪

92
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,840
♪ Everything I think is for my love. ♪

93
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
♪ In one moment, I forget about what confuses me. ♪

94
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
♪ Because I'm surrounded by love. ♪

95
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,600
♪ Until I get hurt after giving all I have, ♪

96
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,040
♪ I finally understand how cruel you are. ♪

97
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,400
♪ I'm just afraid the fate might not recognize lovers, ♪

98
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,600
♪ Setting hundreds of tests to keep them apart. ♪

99
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,080
♪ It's like falling leaves tapping on the gate. ♪

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,760
Even if I have to cut our connections,

101
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll always remember

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,400
how you cared for me these days.

103
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
You saved me before.

104
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,840
I have nothing to pay you back.

105
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,400
These sweet potatoes are roasted by me.

106
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,520
I'll give them to you as your wedding gift.

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,080
I don't know

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
whether you can get them or not.

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
Will you think of me

110
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,400
when seeing them?

111
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,880
It's fine, anyway.

112
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,160
♪ Go far away in your shadow. ♪

113
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,440
♪ I'm free but I have nothing. ♪

114
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,000
♪ Let memories gather dust. ♪

115
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,240
♪ I can't see us be together forever. ♪

116
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,440
Your Majesty, you've done nothing wrong.

117
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
You don't know I'm Bai Fengjiu from Qingqiu.

118
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
You don't know I like you.

119
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,920
You don't know how hard

120
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,560
I've tried to win your love.

121
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,040
We're just not meant to be.

122
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,440
Your Majesty,

123
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,680
I failed to win your love,

124
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
but I've tried my best.

125
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,240
I won't fight for us anymore.

126
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
I give up.

127
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Your Highness,

128
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,400
if anything goes wrong now,

129
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
how should Tai Chen Palace explain

130
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,000
to the guests when they come
to congratulate His Majesty tomorrow?

131
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,320
Explain?

132
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,910
You should worry about

133
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,800
how that demon princess should explain to me first.

134
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,040
Rather than watch her

135
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,400
take away my foster brother and humiliate me,

136
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,360
I might as well...

137
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Your Highness.

138
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,800
Your Majesty, please.

139
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
As to Princess Ji Heng...

140
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
What banquet?

141
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,880
What Tai Chen Palace?

142
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Dong Hua,

143
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,000
you idiot!

144
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,840
How can I take advantage of you?

145
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm so pissed by Emperor Dong Hua!

146
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,920
His Majesty and Princess Ji Heng are made for each other.

147
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
You don't have to...

148
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,880
Nonsense!

149
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,640
He's just a conscienceless idiot!

150
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,640
His Majesty didn't refuse it himself.

151
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,920
Why should we?

152
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,760
Forget it.

153
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,800
It's useless talking to you.

154
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
What happened to you?

155
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,720
You tell me.

156
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,040
Damn it!

157
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,160
I forgot about my task.

158
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,690
Cheng Yu!

159
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,120
Let's go to the banquet together.

160
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,640
I've something to attend to.

161
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,880
Your Emperor is getting married.

162
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
You should go and congratulate him yourself.

163
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,600
I've got something more important.

164
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
What's more important than His Majesty's marriage?

165
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,360
However precious those furs are,

166
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,480
they're no match for you.

167
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,520
Gorgeous!

168
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,000
Really gorgeous!

169
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,040
You!

170
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
You gods are really arrogant.

171
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,080
You show no respect to us demons.

172
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,680
Demon Lord Nie, though you're extremely daring

173
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,080
to look down upon Qingqiu,

174
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,840
you're really a good judge of people.

175
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
God Zhe Yan, that doesn't sound like a compliment.

176
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,720
What's the point of humiliating me?

177
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,440
Humiliate?

178
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,800
Well,

179
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
do we need a reason

180
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,920
to humiliate a Demon Lord?

181
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,000
Fine.

182
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I dare not provoke you.

183
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,080
Let's go to the Sky Kingdom

184
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,800
and let the Heavenly King rule.

185
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,520
Let the Heavenly King rule?

186
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,040
When tricking Fengjiu,

187
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
did you ask the Heavenly King to rule?

188
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,960
You tricked Fengjiu into giving you
the fur with your silver tongue.

189
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
We can't blame you for that.

190
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,000
So...

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,160
So if we grab the fur

192
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,960
with our own skills,

193
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,240
you can't blame us, either.

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Well, cut the crap!

195
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
Let's fight!

196
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,880
Fengjiu has been out for so many days

197
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,000
without any message.

198
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
As her uncle,

199
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,800
how can you still read travel notes?

200
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,120
Father,

201
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
you've become more verbose in recent years.

202
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,040
Compared to what I've done in the early years,

203
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,560
the trouble she's caused now

204
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,280
is really nothing.

205
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,280
You!

206
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,200
When Bai Yi is back,

207
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,000
ask him to discipline his daughter well.

208
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,760
Also, as her uncle,

209
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,560
you should pay attention

210
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,360
to find her a good husband.

211
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,520
Her father is not worried.

212
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,240
As her grandfather, why do you have to worry?

213
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,160
You!

214
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,800
Listen to yourself!

215
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,080
Bai Qian has waited so long to get married.

216
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Should we let Fengjiu make the same mistake?

217
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Father, rest assured.

218
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Well...

219
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,960
Li,

220
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,760
why are you here?

221
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,560
Grandpa, I went to Shili Peach Forest

222
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,800
and grabbed some good peach blossom branches.

223
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,320
Sister Fengjiu told me she had planted

224
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,800
peach trees from Shili Peach Forest in Qingqiu for many times,

225
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,280
but none of them grew.

226
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,960
If I can succeed in growing the peach trees,

227
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,520
Sister Fengjiu is sure to praise me

228
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,640
when she comes back and sees them.

229
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,000
I shouldn't have asked Bai Qian

230
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,120
to guide Fengjiu back then.

231
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,400
Following Bai Qian,

232
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Fengjiu became so mischievous

233
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,760
that she often climbed trees to catch birds

234
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,360
and went into rivers to get fish.

235
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
Once, when her uncle was napping,

236
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,110
she actually plucked

237
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,440
all the feathers of Jingwei.

238
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,160
Sister Fengjiu is so awesome!

239
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,520
I made one mistake before.

240
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,200
I won't make it again.

241
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,110
Li,

242
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,640
if you follow those two mischievous troublemakers,

243
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,960
I can't imagine how naughty you'll become.

244
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,640
Where're you going?

245
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,400
The fourth generation of our Bai family

246
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,560
should be well-mannered.

247
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,600
Come with Grandpa!

248
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,000
Grandpa, what does this have to do with me?

249
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm wronged! I'm wronged!

250
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,720
Let's go! Who wronged you?

251
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,200
How have I wronged you?

252
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,120
If I see you

253
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,560
do such a vicious thing again,

254
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,040
from heaven to earth,

255
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
wherever you go,

256
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,960
I'll make you pay.

257
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,280
I won't calculate the interests

258
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,320
for keeping the fur these days.

259
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,560
But dare you appear in front of Fengjiu again,

260
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,790
I'll destroy your entire clan.

261
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,080
Don't worry.

262
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,600
The fire will go out

263
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,680
when those furs are burnt down.

264
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,920
Hope you'll keep this in mind,
and do good deeds more often.

265
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Si Ming,

266
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,080
today is the big day for Tai Chen Palace.

267
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
If they see me, I'm afraid I'll have to

268
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
endure many unnecessary and overelaborate formalities.

269
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,080
Can you send Fengjiu back to Peach Forest?

270
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,080
Your Highness, rest assured.

271
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,960
Lord.

272
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,360
I have to send Her Highness back to Qingqiu.

273
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,920
Can you go to Tai Chen Palace first

274
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,680
and receive the guests for me?

275
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,930
Don't worry.

276
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,470
Don't ever mention Emperor Dong Hua in front of her again.

277
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,240
Yes.

278
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,480
Come here.

279
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,320
It's been warm these days with gentle spring breezes,

280
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,200
and the Yi Shi San Heaven is bursting with happiness.

281
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,480
Your Majesty, I congratulate you

282
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,040
for tying the knot with Princess Ji Heng.

283
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,950
Right! Right!

284
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,960
Where is Si Ming?

285
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,160
What have you been up to lately?

286
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,330
Your Majesty, I've long heard that

287
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,920
you've got a spiritual fox by your side.

288
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,840
Rumor has it that it's clever and lovely,

289
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,640
and it can even read people's minds.

290
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,920
Ignorant and ill-informed as I am,

291
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,040
I'd really want to take this chance to see the spiritual fox.

292
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
Your Majesty, please grant my wish.

293
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,560
The little fox is mischievous.

294
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,840
It's now in confinement.

295
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,720
I'll show it to you

296
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,560
when it's more obedient.

297
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,840
Lord Cheng Yu,

298
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,240
recently, I've thought several ways

299
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
to make food with tea.

300
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,280
A moment, please.

301
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,600
Let's talk in private.

302
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,560
What're you doing? I haven't finished yet.

303
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,950
Let's talk in private.

304
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,800
You're so audacious.

305
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,370
If His Majesty is not in a good mood today,

306
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,560
you're bound to be punished severely.

307
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
I just want to destroy his good mood.

308
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,760
Heartless as he is,

309
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
I just want to dampen his spirits.

310
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,720
What're you talking about?

311
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,160
In the vast universe,
who doesn't want to offer His Majesty gifts

312
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,480
to add joy to this happy occasion?

313
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,840
But you just...

314
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,320
Well,

315
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,160
I've also prepared your gift.

316
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,840
Remember, don't say it wrong.

317
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
Who asked you to do that?

318
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,000
Everyone wants to flatter him.

319
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,000
Not me!

320
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,440
Fine! Fine! Fine! I see.

321
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,600
You remain aloof from the world.

322
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
You...

323
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,320
What a meddler!

324
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,440
Lian Song,

325
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,320
when I endured hardships
in the mortal realm to become an immortal,

326
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
you really helped me a lot.

327
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,760
But I know,

328
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,320
this is just your way of tricking women.

329
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,080
in the future,

330
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,760
please don't mind my business.

331
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,240
But do you know

332
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,800
why you went to the mortal realm to endure hardships?

333
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,720
Sister Fengjiu!

334
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,680
Sister Fengjiu,

335
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,480
what happened to you?

336
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,600
Her Highness was injured in the Sky Kingdom.

337
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,200
Now she's short of magic power.

338
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,280
You must take good care of her.

339
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,600
I see.

340
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Today, I have a lot of official business to attend to.

341
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,360
I can't stay here for long.

342
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,520
Just take her to God Zhe Yan.

343
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,480
Remember,

344
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,640
don't let elders of Qingqiu know about this.

345
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,040
OK.

346
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,880
Your Highness, you really don't want me

347
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,520
to cure the wounds on your neck first?

348
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,720
No need.

349
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,360
I want them to heal by themselves.

350
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,800
Your Highness, take care.

351
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
Sister Fengjiu, what happened?

352
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,080
I embarrassed myself.

353
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,600
I disgraced Qingqiu.

354
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,920
It's no big deal.

355
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,280
You've done plenty of things
to embarrass yourself since childhood.

356
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Get up where you fall.

357
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,560
You were the one who told me that.

358
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,760
Jingwei,

359
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
you do keep my words in mind.

360
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,200
Your Highness!

361
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,600
You're back.

362
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
I heard someone grabbed your fur.

363
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,720
Who on earth hurt you?

364
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,920
A Demon Lord

365
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
or someone from the Yi Shi San Heaven?

366
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,760
It had nothing to do with him.

367
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,480
I was to blame for not being careful.

368
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,360
So you got hurt in the Yi Shi San Heaven.

369
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,960
Well,

370
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,320
I can't beat him,

371
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,960
but I can blow off the roof

372
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,320
of Tai Chen Palace.

373
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Shall I give it a try?

374
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,520
It really had nothing to do with him!

375
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,160
He knew nothing.

376
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,960
He just doesn't like me.

377
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,840
He just treated me

378
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,440
as a disobedient pet

379
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,840
till the end.

380
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,160
Emperor Dong Hua

381
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,160
is not the lucky guy.

382
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Stop crying.

383
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,360
If your uncle sees you like this,

384
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,640
how sad will he be?

385
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,040
If your aunt sees this,

386
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,960
she will tear down Tai Chen Palace

387
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,600
before I do.

388
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,080
Your families are very protective. You know that.

389
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,120
I disgraced Qingqiu.

390
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,320
I'm glad you know it.

391
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,960
You should gain your dignity back bit by bit.

392
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,000
How?

393
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,240
It's quiet easy.

394
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:00,920
Your Highness!

395
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,760
Leave me alone.

396
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,520
Don't come inside without my order.

397
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,880
Yes.

398
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,000
Finally, someone's here.

399
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,840
Xuan Demon Lord Nie Chuyin pays respects to Your Majesty.

400
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,320
You're the leader of Xuan Demon Clan.

401
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,520
You actually know me.

402
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Your Majesty,

403
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,560
I didn't expect to see you here.

404
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,200
I put a drop of blood tear among demons.

405
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,000
Over tens of thousands of years,

406
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,440
no one actually dared to summon me.

407
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,440
What do you want?

408
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,240
Your Majesty, please tell me how to break the seal.

409
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,440
I want to serve you.

410
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,040
Really?

411
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes.

412
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,800
Your Majesty, after you were sealed,

413
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,560
demons declined gradually.

414
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,680
Though I have low cultivation,

415
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,840
I do want to bring back our past glory.

416
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,280
I never believed

417
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,120
such high-sounding reasons.

418
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,040
Just tell me what you want.

419
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,880
Now that Demon Lord Xu Yang
is content with the current situation

420
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,960
and shows no interest in challenging the gods,

421
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm afraid the grand cause of reviving our race will be delayed.

422
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,640
I want to...

423
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Take his place.

424
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,120
Your Majesty, to be honest,

425
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,400
though I'm of limited cultivation,

426
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,160
I do want to exhaust my abilities to revive our race.

427
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,560
More importantly,

428
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
I want to do my bit

429
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,240
in setting you free.

430
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Aren't you afraid to see the world in utter disorder?

431
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,160
In utter disorder?

432
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,600
That's better than being bullied and oppressed by the gods.

433
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,680
Good!

434
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,040
You're really a descendent of demons.

435
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,680
To help me break the seal,

436
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,120
you should bring me the soul-locking jade first.

437
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,680
The soul-locking jade?

438
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
After the War of Mount Fuyu,

439
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,040
it turned into dust

440
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
and went with the wind.

441
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,100
Mount Fuyu is located

442
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,560
at the border between the fairy land and the mortal realm.

443
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,440
Even if the dust fell into the mortal realm,

444
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,520
given the chaos and disorder caused by endless war,

445
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,800
it would surely absorb all the hostile energy

446
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,160
and form the soul-locking jade again.

447
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
Your Majesty, I'm willing to

448
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
risk any danger to serve you.

449
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
Come to me after finding the soul-locking jade.

450
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,960
Yes!

451
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
What a happy day!

452
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,600
Yes.

453
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,640
Wonderful!

454
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,920
What a happy occasion!

455
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,240
We haven't had such a big gathering for a long time.

456
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,520
Look, how magnificent!

457
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,320
Yes!

458
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
It's your big day. Can't you just smile?

459
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,080
How come it's you?!

460
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
Zhihe?

461
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,840
Go and invite the Heavenly King over.

462
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,040
Yes.

463
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,440
Yan Chiwu?

464
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
Where did you hide Ji Heng?

465
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,680
Foster brother.

466
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,920
Call me "Your Majesty".

467
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,120
Ji Heng...

468
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,520
Ji Heng disappeared last night.

469
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,720
I...

470
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,720
I've made a big mistake because I got confused temporarily.

471
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,760
Your Majesty, please show mercy!

472
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Do you know you've committed the sin of deceiving me?

473
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,960
-Your Majesty! -Your Majesty! -Your Majesty!

474
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,000
What happened?

475
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,040
Ji Heng is missing.

476
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,960
Ji Heng doesn't deserve my foster brother!

477
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,880
Shut up!

478
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,560
Father, I failed to manage the wedding well.

479
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,120
Please punish me.

480
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,200
Zhihe deceived Emperor Dong Hua
and Lian Song failed to fulfill his duty.

481
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,360
The wedding shall be canceled today.

482
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,680
Guards!

483
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,960
Yes!

484
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,320
Put them into prison.

485
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,320
After figuring out the truth,

486
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
I'll definitely give Emperor Dong Hua an explanation.

487
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
Yes!

488
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,040
Ji Heng!

489
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,480
Princess!

490
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,600
How dare you!

491
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,400
Ji Heng, what are you doing?

492
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,840
Yu Ru!

493
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,200
Guards! Guards...

494
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,520
Yu Ru! Yu Ru!

495
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,520
As the future wife of my foster brother,

496
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,240
how dare you...

497
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
So don't tell anyone else.

498
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
As the future wife of Emperor Dong Hua,

499
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,520
I made such a big mistake.

500
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,680
How should Tai Chen Palace and the demons...

501
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,680
So, Princess Zhihe,

502
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,120
why not let me leave quietly tomorrow.

503
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,000
Without the bride,

504
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,560
there will be no wedding tomorrow for sure.

505
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,360
in the future, His Majesty will still be that dignified
and aloof Emperor high above.

506
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,760
Is that OK?

507
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,360
Foster brother's wedding ceremony,

508
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,320
can not become a joke.

509
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,840
You don't want the wedding dressing.

510
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,200
I want it.

511
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,200
It must be a conspiracy of the demons.

512
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,840
Now that Ji Heng is missing,

513
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,000
Demon Lord Xu Yang will surely

514
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,400
take the chance to attack us.

515
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,920
In my opinion, we should declare war against the demons first.

516
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,840
-Right! -Declare war! -Declare war!

517
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,520
Declare war against the demons!

518
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,640
We absolutely can't!

519
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,600
If we fight the demons, all the living creatures will suffer.

520
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,680
In my opinion,

521
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,280
we should find Ji Heng first.

522
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,240
After figuring out the truth,

523
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,920
we can still declare war against the demons.

524
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,150
It's a waste of time looking for her.

525
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,840
Right! Right!

526
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,190
You!

527
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,120
Everyone, don't act rashly

528
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,800
to make the world suffer.

529
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,360
Right, we can't act rashly!

530
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,000
The Heavenly King is here.

531
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,600
Your Majesty!

532
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,560
Xu Yang pays respects to Your Majesty.

533
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,040
Xu Yang, you've come at the right time.

534
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,240
I have something to discuss with you.

535
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,040
Me, too.

536
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,040
I need an explanation for the whole thing.

537
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,720
Bring him here.

538
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,000
Yes!

539
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,200
Old Heavenly King,

540
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,960
release me if you dare.

541
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,440
How despicable of you to fight me when I was outnumbered.

542
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,090
Yan Chiwu!

543
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,000
Xu Yang?

544
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
Look at me! Why are you still talking to them?

545
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,200
What're you waiting for?

546
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,640
Don't be rude!

547
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,840
Your Majesty,

548
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,760
Ji Heng ran away from the wedding first.

549
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,760
Then Yan Chiwu tried to snatch the bride in public.

550
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,400
As to this marriage,

551
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,360
the demons were so impudent that
they should be punished severely.

552
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Cut the crap!

553
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,440
Give Ji Heng back to us!

554
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,200
Otherwise, I'll beat the crap out of you!

555
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,400
How dare you?!

556
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
Your Majesty!

557
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,040
Your Majesty, it concerns the two races this time.

558
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,960
It's better to decide after figuring out the truth.

559
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,000
Fine.

560
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,080
Ice Face,

561
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,400
don't think I'll thank you...

562
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,120
For releasing me.

563
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,120
Let's go.

564
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,680
Your Majesty,

565
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:02,160
is it appropriate to do so?

566
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,000
It's a private matter. I'll handle it.

567
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,200
Your Majesty, do not be bothered.

568
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,960
You shouldn't have stopped me.

569
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
I haven't finished yet.

570
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Ji Heng must have been hidden by that Ice Face.

571
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,280
Good for him.

572
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
He actually blames us instead.

573
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,360
In my opinion, no need to talk with them.

574
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,880
We should've fought them directly.

575
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,240
Look at you!

576
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,920
You're a Demon Lord after all!

577
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,440
Coward!

578
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,160
Shame!

579
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,320
Yan Chiwu,

580
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,720
how dared you snatch the bride?

581
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,480
You almost got us in trouble.

582
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,280
It's a waste of time

583
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560
talking to a mindless demon as you are.

584
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,280
Trouble! Trouble!

585
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,400
That's all you know.

586
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,640
You even dared not defend your own sister.

587
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,720
Coward!

588
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,240
I don't want to talk to you because I despise you!

589
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,200
Pooh!

590
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,120
Say that again!

591
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,880
Pooh!

592
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,600
Yan Chiwu!

593
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,840
Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!

594
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,400
Your Highness.

595
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,480
What's up?

596
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,880
According to reports from guards,

597
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,920
Min Su is also missing.

598
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,720
This is odd.

599
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,800
Have they planned to escape in advance?

600
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,920
Your Highness, don't worry.

601
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,640
Demon Lord Xuan was afraid that

602
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,200
Min Su might try to ruin Princess's wedding,

603
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,200
so he specially asked me

604
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,360
to put soul-tracking fragrance on Min Su.

605
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,760
He'll expose himself sooner or later.

606
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,120
Send more guards to search for them at once.

607
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,280
Yes.

608
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,800
Chong Lin pays respects to Your Majesty.

609
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,570
What's up?

610
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,620
His Highness Lian Song urged me repeatedly

611
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,040
before being sent to prison

612
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,680
to send you a message with his exact words.

613
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,600
Go ahead.

614
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,840
Dong Hua, thanks to you,

615
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,480
now I have to be in prison.

616
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,960
Actually, it's fine to be in prison.

617
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,040
I can be graceful and charming

618
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,400
even I'm in prison.

619
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,280
It's just that you actually didn't involve me

620
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,040
in the marriage escaping plan.

621
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,600
I've really wasted my trust on you.

622
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,160
That's almost all.

623
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,160
Chong Lin.

624
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,680
It seems that Lian Song is punishing you.

626
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,480
Go and finish your task.

627
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,320
She can only rely on herself in the future.

628
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,240
Yes.

629
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,040
Take care.

630
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Your Highness.

631
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,160
Without the help of His Majesty,

632
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,880
I might not be able to see you again.

633
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,200
This time, the Qiushui Cold Toxin
can be suppressed much longer.

634
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,040
Follow the plan.

635
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,540
Set aside your worries and rest well

636
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,700
after reaching the Fanyin Valley.

637
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,200
Your Majesty,

638
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,680
thank you for suppressing the Qiushui Cold Toxin for me repeatedly

639
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,840
with your cultivation.

640
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,120
I'm deeply grateful.

641
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,800
Your Highness,

642
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,480
I have to tell you something.

643
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,280
No hurry. There's ample time ahead.

644
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,040
It's late. Let's leave now.

645
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,080
Your Majesty, how are you?

646
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,480
After getting injured

647
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,000
in the Ten-evil Lotus Land,

648
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,600
you were not fully recovered.

649
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,880
These days, you've used lots of cultivation

650
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,720
to help Princess Ji Heng

651
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,600
suppress the Qiushui Cold Toxin repeatedly.

652
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,480
Why not leave everything behind for the moment
and take a rest to recuperate?

653
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm fine.

654
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,240
But I didn't expect

655
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,200
Zhihe to be

656
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,840
so obsessed.

657
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,580
How's she doing?

658
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,280
Princess Zhihe remained silent after being sent to prison.

659
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,920
She has to undo the knot

660
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,080
on her own.

661
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,040
Your Highness, has His Majesty

662
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,000
found the cure for the Qiushui Cold Toxin?

663
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,040
Not yet.

664
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,480
But this time,

665
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,200
His Majesty used lots of cultivation

666
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,240
to suppress the poison.

667
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,200
And he specially chose

668
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,440
the Fanyin Valley for me.

669
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,120
He said it's clean and pure inside the valley,

670
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,980
which is good for my rest.

671
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,400
His Majesty is really kind and righteous.

672
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,560
Yes.

673
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,440
Indifferent as His Majesty is,

674
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,760
I didn't expect him to value his former subordinate so much.

675
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,720
This time, for a promise to my father,

676
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,560
he did his best to help us escape.

677
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
I don't know

678
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,320
when I can

679
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,440
repay his kindness.

680
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,920
However, Your Highness told me

681
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,200
His Majesty is not the one you love.

682
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,520
Otherwise...

683
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,720
Why do you bring it up again?

684
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,320
I'll repay His Majesty's kindness some other day.

685
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,800
Now, the most important thing for us  is

686
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,080
to run away from this place.

687
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,840
It's late. Let's go now!
