00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 14

3
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,700
The backfire is unexpectedly strong.

4
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,820
It resulted in a sudden pass-out this time.

5
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,660
Nobody can tell what will happen next time.

6
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,260
And as His Majesty is...

7
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,940
No!

8
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,220
I've gotta leave here as soon as I can.

9
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,300
Your Highness,

10
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,620
doesn't the food suit your taste?

11
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,820
Shall I bake

12
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
some sweet potatoes for you?

13
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,860
The master is right to say.

14
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,420
Muyun understands me well.

15
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,380
What are you thinking

16
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,860
so attentively?

17
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,540
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

18
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,340
Why don't you take the food?

19
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,500
They're not good?

20
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,500
Try this!

21
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,900
I baked this in person.

22
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,100
Baked sweet potato?

23
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,380
Have a try!

24
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,700
See if it tastes the same as the ones you baked.

25
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,780
The sweet potato you baked for me

26
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,580
in the Ten-evil Lotus Land tasted exactly like this.

27
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,140
Why are you about to cry?

28
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,140
Does it taste so bad?

29
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,540
I'm just so touched

30
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,060
that Your Majesty baked

31
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,420
sweet potato for me in person.

32
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,380
Is it good?

33
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,020
Yeah!

34
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,900
How is it

35
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,100
compared with the ones baked by the other guy?

36
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,820
Which guy?

37
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,900
That guy...

38
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,340
Didn't you say someone
baked sweet potatoes for you before

39
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,660
which are the best you've had

40
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,500
and you couldn't forget about it?

41
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,380
So are the ones I baked better

42
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,580
or the ones

43
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,780
he baked better?

44
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,380
Your Majesty,

45
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,140
it was you.

46
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,060
You are the only one who has baked sweet potato for me.

47
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900
I just think

48
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,020
Your Majesty remember the words

49
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
I said without much thinking.

50
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,620
Xiaojiu,

51
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,340
as long as you like,

52
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,300
I'd bake sweet potatoes for you for my whole life.

53
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,940
What happened to your hand?

54
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,180
Never mind!

55
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,060
It's burnt by the charcoal fire
while I was baking the sweet potato.

56
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,940
Hold on a second.

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,020
I'll get the unguent for you.

58
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,260
Your Majesty,

59
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,540
let me apply the ointment for you.

60
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,500
Sure!

61
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,860
Come!

62
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,540
Try to spit a fireball again!

63
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Make it thick

64
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,700
so that it won't burn through easily.

65
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,980
What's up?

66
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,580
What are you thinking?

67
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,060
I'll take you to the hunting ground tomorrow

68
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,060
for a stroll.

69
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,460
Your Majesty is really nice to me.

70
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,540
Come on!

71
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,460
Finish the baked sweet potato,

72
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,540
or it will cool down.

73
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll take it as well.

74
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,900
Your Majesty,

75
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,940
did I put on the wrong address?

76
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,900
Seeing the martial attire you're in,

77
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,100
I suddenly recall what happened on the battlefield.

78
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
If it hadn't been you,

79
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,580
I wouldn't even have survived.

80
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,740
Your Majesty is joking.

81
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,460
Actually, that was meant to pay a debt of gratitude.

82
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,860
What?

83
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,020
That was meant to serve the country.

84
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,580
You're so different from any girls

85
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,260
I've met before.

86
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,300
I come from the countryside.

87
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,980
Please excuse me for that.

88
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,660
No!

89
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,540
You're just good!

90
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,660
Too good that I don't know how to treat you.

91
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,780
Your Majesty,

92
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,740
the view in the front looks good.

93
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,220
Let's take a look together.

94
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,820
Sit tight!

95
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,220
Your Majesty,

96
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,340
maybe it's our destiny

97
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,940
to make the best of a mistake.

98
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,420
You took me as a little spiritual fox

99
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,500
that can't incarnate at the start.

100
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,940
I took advantage of it to occupy the place in your arms.

101
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,020
Now,

102
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,700
I stagger your destiny and that of Zhou Mengxi's

103
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,460
and occupy the place in your arms again.

104
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,900
Two!

105
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,820
Four!

106
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,260
Six!

107
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,140
Your Highness, what are you doing?

108
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,300
That's really beautiful flowers that I have never seen before.

109
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm making desserts

110
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,100
so as to thank His Majesty's entertainment

111
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,300
in the past days.

112
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,140
Then I'll get the Imperial Kitchen set!

113
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,940
Don't bother!

114
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,900
I'll do it myself

115
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
to show my gratitude.

116
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,860
It's so nice that His Majesty

117
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,460
and Your Highness love each other so deeply.

118
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,020
This is love?

119
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,580
Qingti,

120
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,660
you're right on time.

121
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,140
Come!

122
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,340
Have a try of this incense.

123
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,220
Your Majesty!

124
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:58,940
Rise! Rise!

125
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,420
Xiaojiu is just cured.

126
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,700
I've long wanted to modulate a type of incense
to soothe her nerves,

127
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,340
so that she won't faint again as she is physically weak.

128
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,940
Have a try!

129
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,060
Does it give you the feeling

130
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,820
that you're walking on the path in the field?

131
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm too dumb

132
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,980
to understand that.

133
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
So why do you come to me?

134
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,940
Do you have problems again with any weapon forging?

135
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,420
Your Majesty is brilliant!

136
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,020
The graphic drawn by Her Highness
contains too many mechanics.

137
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,540
I have doubts over a few of them

138
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,220
and need to ask Imperial Lady Jiu for help.

139
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,860
Please approve, Your Majesty!

140
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,260
What kind of weapon can't you forge?

141
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,020
Approved!

142
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,340
After I finish this memorial,

143
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,740
I'll check it out too.

144
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,500
Please excuse me!

145
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,300
Doesn't it have?

146
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,940
Your Highness!

147
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,500
I pay respects to Your Highness!

148
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,180
Why do you come?

149
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,660
I have a few doubts

150
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,100
over the graphic drawn by Your Highness!

151
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,260
As His Majesty approved, I came here to seek your help.

152
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,780
This...

153
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,500
is a mechanical metal plate.

154
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,900
You can turn it into a sword

155
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,180
by pulling off the metal plate.

156
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,260
Understood?

157
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,260
Now this dagger can work as a sword

158
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,260
as well as a crossbow

159
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,500
which is much more convenient.

160
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,940
But this mechanical design

161
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,700
works better as a mechanism.

162
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,180
It's really exaggerating

163
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,140
to use it as a weapon.

164
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,340
However, I think it's better

165
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,540
if it's used as a spatula

166
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,260
because it can either become a spoon or a kitchen knife.

167
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,620
Eh...

168
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,620
you've got a smear on your face.

169
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,660
Is it still there?

170
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,860
No...

171
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
By the way,

172
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,380
did you use the ointment

173
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:45,980
I gave you last time?

174
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,340
Not yet!

175
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,100
It's too precious to be used.

176
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,820
What's precious about that?

177
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,220
It's not worthy of much money.

178
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,660
Let me know when you use it up!

179
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,900
But again,

180
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,780
how did you get the injury?

181
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,100
His Majesty was trapped in the battle at the border.

182
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,860
I was injured by the enemy

183
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,340
when I tried to rescue His Majesty.

184
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,580
Then fortunately, you appeared in time

185
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,300
and helped His Majesty out.

186
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,700
It's wide spread that

187
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,020
His Majesty and you are as close as brothers.

188
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,420
That seems right.

189
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,220
So,

190
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,620
as you're so close with His Majesty,

191
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,740
you must know

192
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,220
what flavor he likes for desserts.

193
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,780
His Majesty barely takes any sweet food in daily life.

194
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,460
It's hard for me to tell.

195
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,980
Come with me!

196
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,060
Try this for me.

197
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,940
Wait a minute!

198
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,180
Your hands are a bit dirty!

199
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,460
Let me feed you!

200
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,740
Hurry up!

201
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,340
How is it?

202
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,300
Is it good?

203
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,260
Yeah!

204
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,420
Fortunately, you think it's good.

205
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,460
Otherwise my hard work will be in vain.

206
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,940
I've never seen this type of dessert before.

207
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,940
What is it called?

208
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,500
Sorrowless cake!

209
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,260
You haven't answered me yet!

210
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,860
Will His Majesty like it?

211
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,580
The look of this cake is so exquisite.

212
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,980
His Majesty likes exquisite and elegant stuff.

213
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,940
That's great!

214
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,220
It's reassuring to me.

215
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,140
Put them all in the steamer

216
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,140
in case they get cold.

217
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,980
That's fine!

218
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,780
It won't be a problem.

219
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,300
This sorrowless cake tastes better

220
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
after it totally cools down.

221
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,100
Is this a specialty

222
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,500
from Your Highness's hometown?

223
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,700
Yes, it is!

224
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Your Highness have ever said your hometown
is at the frontier juncture

225
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,780
which is my regular place of garrison.

226
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,020
Why have I never seen this food before?

227
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,820
That's because I travelled to a lot of places since I was young

228
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,020
even though my hometown is at the frontier juncture.

229
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,580
So all the specialties I learned

230
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,340
from different places can be considered

231
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,900
my hometown specialty.

232
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,780
Alright!

233
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,940
All set now!

234
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm sending these to His Majesty!

235
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,300
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

236
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,340
What do you come to me for at this time?

237
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,580
I've made some desserts

238
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,740
for Your Majesty to try and make some comments.

239
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,060
So you are in a good spirit?

240
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,700
What's it called?

241
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,380
Sorrowless cake!

242
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,060
Sorrowless cake?

243
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,380
Why do you name it like that?

244
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,500
My hometown has a flower called sorrowless flower.

245
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,180
When its blossom season comes,

246
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,740
it blooms everywhere like a flower rain in the sky

247
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
which gives you a bath in the spring breeze.

248
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,500
That scenery is just inexplicably entertaining.

249
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,580
All of your sorrows will just dissipate.

250
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,540
So I made sorrowless cake

251
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,020
based on this concept

252
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,660
in hope that Your Majesty can forget all sorrows

253
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,060
and stay happy after taking it.

254
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,860
Come here!

255
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,060
Let's finish it together!

256
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,860
Yes!

257
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,740
Please, Your Majesty!

258
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,780
It looks exquisite

259
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,700
and smells softly fragrant.

260
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,900
I've entered into a fantastic state before I even take a bite.

261
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,700
It must make me sorrow-free after eating it.

262
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,780
Xiaojiu,

263
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,900
how many more secrets have you held back from me?

264
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,260
I appreciate Your Majesty's daily help to me.

265
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,580
I don't have any expertise

266
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,300
other than making desserts

267
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,100
to entertain Your Majesty.

268
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,660
Well said!

269
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,780
So am I the first one

270
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,140
to have this cake after you made it?

271
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,020
Not exactly!

272
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,260
No?

273
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,140
Good!

274
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,820
Who else had it?

275
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,260
A friend.

276
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,380
What kind of friend?

277
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,860
A friend who has helped me before.

278
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,060
Taciturn as he might be in daily life

279
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,900
or a bit offensive while speaking,

280
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,420
he's caring to the world and brave and wise.

281
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,300
How is it?

282
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,020
Is it good?

283
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:17,980
Yeah!

284
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,180
That's a very important friend

285
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,100
in your eyes.

286
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,140
So in your eyes,

287
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,420
I don't deserve to be the first one to take it?

288
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
That's not what I mean.

289
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,660
Then what is it?

290
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,620
If you intended to make this cake for me,

291
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,860
you must let me take it first

292
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,900
regardless of whether it's good or bad.

293
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,660
Am I not any special to you at all

294
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,900
in your eyes?

295
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,980
No! I...

296
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,460
Fine!

297
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,460
Leave me

298
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,780
if you don't have any other business.

299
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,700
What happened to His Majesty?

300
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,980
Did he take pepper in lunch?

301
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,620
Please excuse me!

302
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,900
She really left.

303
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
How could it be so good?

304
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,140
I wouldn't have let her leave if I knew this earlier.

305
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,380
It would be fantastic if we can have it together.

306
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,420
Your Majesty,

307
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,660
Wan Yun Palace sent someone to ask

308
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,700
whether today's dinner will be held in Wan Yun Palace.

309
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,020
Its host has prepared exquisite desserts

310
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
for Your Majesty to enjoy.

311
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,740
Fine!

312
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,140
Tell her I'll come later.

313
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,860
Here comes His Majesty!

314
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,180
Welcome Your Majesty's esteemed presence.

315
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,020
Rise!

316
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,820
What's this?

317
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,140
Your Majesty,

318
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,940
this is butterfly cake.

319
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,180
It's my hometown specialty,

320
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,900
usually made by lovesick ladies for their loved ones.

321
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,740
If Your Majesty don't mind,

322
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,140
please have a try.

323
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,420
What's wrong?

324
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,500
Doesn't it suit your taste?

325
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,980
Love gives people sorrow.

326
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,100
Sorrow disappears if one becomes heartless.

327
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,740
Your Majesty, are you...

328
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:08,980
Nothing.

329
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,700
The butterfly cake

330
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,820
is well implied.

331
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,340
It's Double Seventh Festival now.

332
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,780
Mother has got on in years.

333
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,660
You are caring and thoughtful.

334
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,500
You shall take full charge on this matter.

335
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,340
Yes, Your Majesty!

336
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,580
If anything is unclear,

337
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,220
seek help from mother.

338
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,140
I don't dare to bother Her Majesty,

339
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,500
but I heard sister Jiu has physically become a lot stronger.

340
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,180
Shall I have her to help me

341
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,420
with the preparation

342
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
for the palace feast?

343
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,620
She can help you

344
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,700
if you need.

345
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,580
Sure!

346
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,780
The sorrowless cake she made is marvelous.

347
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,380
Let her to prepare some for the Double Seventh Festival.

348
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,940
Yes, Your Majesty!

349
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,220
I'm leaving for now.

350
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,620
So long, Your Majesty!

351
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,020
Done!

352
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,700
One tray of sorrowless cake is ready.

353
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,740
Muyun,

354
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,820
I'll put them in the plate for you
before you serve them to the Imperial Kitchen.

355
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,100
The people from the Imperial Kitchen

356
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,140
will spread these for them tomorrow.

357
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,020
Yes, Your Highness!

358
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,140
Clean it here again!

359
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,020
Put it here.

360
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,300
Sure!

361
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,940
Put it there!

362
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,300
Give it to me.

363
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:38,700
Yes!

364
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,220
Be careful!

365
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,140
Clean here again!

366
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,220
Ling Xiang,

367
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,220
go check out the desserts and snacks

368
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,820
from different palaces at the Imperial Kitchen!

369
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,220
If they are not all ready,

370
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,460
send someone to push.

371
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Don't get the palace feast delayed.

372
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,060
Got that, Your Highness!

373
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,780
Ling Xiang!

374
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,740
- Your Highness! - What are you doing?

375
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,140
Your Highness!

376
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,580
Why are you doing this?

377
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,820
Why are you doing this?

378
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,140
I...

379
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,740
If you don't say it,

380
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,300
I'll have to do the needful

381
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,700
and report it to the female official in palace.

382
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,380
Your Highness,

383
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,900
I'm doing this to help Your Highness!

384
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,780
Please don't delate me.

385
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,140
To help me?

386
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,740
Do you know

387
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,020
you're applying poison?

388
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,020
This is not poison.

389
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,740
It is merely common laxative.

390
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,020
Then why

391
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,340
do you want to put laxative into the sorrowless cake?

392
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,500
Because Your Highness cannot win His Majesty's heart.

393
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,140
Mr. Nie's plan can't be carried out.

394
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,260
I think Your Highness have done everything you can,

395
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,900
but Her Highness Jiu always breaks in from the middle.

396
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,700
That's why I got the idea

397
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,540
to apply laxative in the desserts made by Her Highness Jiu.

398
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,780
His Majesty and Her Majesty

399
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,980
must punish her after taking it.

400
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,900
Enough, Ling Xiang!

401
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,300
Do you really think

402
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,020
you can secretly apply laxative in the sorrowless cake

403
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,540
without being found out by anyone?

404
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,460
If it breaks out

405
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,420
and we're found out,

406
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,820
are we able to get away with it safely?

407
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:39,940
Eh...

408
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,620
Do you know why

409
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,220
I let Imperial Lady Jiu to make the sorrowless cake?

410
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,980
Despite that His Majesty loves Imperial Lady Jiu,

411
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,500
he designated me

412
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,980
to prepare for the Double Seventh Festival.

413
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,060
Imperial Lady Jiu makes good desserts.

414
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,740
I just need to make the best of her advantage.

415
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,300
As long as we can successfully hold the palace feast,

416
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,980
His Majesty will gradually trust me.

417
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,220
More haste less speed.

418
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,100
Do you understand it, Ling Xiang?

419
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,900
Your Highness is brilliant.

420
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,140
Please forgive me for my mistake.

421
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,380
Imperial Concubine Wan has done a great job

422
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,020
in holding today's palace feast.

423
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,340
Well done!

424
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,300
Thank you, Your Majesty!

425
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,780
Ren'er,

426
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,180
Imperial Concubine Wan is a talented person.

427
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,220
You're lucky!

428
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,740
As far as I see it,

429
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,900
you are the lucky one here today.

430
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,940
Imperial Lady Jiu has made some desserts as well

431
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,900
with good taste.

432
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,860
You must like it.

433
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,860
I thought she is only good at martial arts.

434
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,140
So her cooking skill is also good?

435
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,220
That's surprisingly impressive.

436
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,940
You may not know that

437
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,460
this dessert is the specialty from her hometown.

438
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,140
Your Majesty,

439
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,660
shall we have them

440
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,220
present the sorrowless cake

441
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,700
so that Imperial Lady Jiu can tell us about it

442
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,660
while we're having it?

443
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,580
Sure!

444
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,260
Serve the cakes then!

445
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,500
Serve sorrowless cake!

446
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:06,980
Mother.

447
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,420
Looks good!

448
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,020
Your Majesties,

449
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,020
according to the tradition,

450
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,260
I should foretaste the food

451
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,980
for you.

452
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,100
Then I'll not be the first one to try sorrowless cake again.

453
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:26,780
Never mind for this time!

454
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,340
Come!

455
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,300
Your Majesty,

456
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,940
safety comes first.

457
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,300
Please allow me to foretaste for the first bite.

458
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,820
Alright! As you like!

459
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,660
Don't you eat them all!

460
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,940
The sorrowless cake

461
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,340
has premium taste.

462
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
What's happening?

463
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,940
Imperial physician!

464
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,060
Where is the imperial physician?

465
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,580
I am here!

466
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,460
Come and check it out!

467
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,740
Your Majesties!

468
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,420
Your Majesties!

469
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,700
His death resulted from poison.

470
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,380
It seems to be the lophophora williamsii poison

471
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,820
which is a rarely strong poison.

472
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,140
I need to testify it thoroughly.

473
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,300
Poison?

474
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,980
Is it

475
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,740
because of the sorrowless cake?

476
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,020
Testify it!

477
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,540
Yes, Your Majesty!

478
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,540
This is...

479
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,420
Poisonous!

480
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:21,900
What?

481
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,340
How did it happen?

482
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,700
How is it?

483
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,140
The sorrowless cake is indeed poisonous.

484
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,220
That's impossible!

485
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,100
It can't have poison!

486
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,220
Your Majesty,

487
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,740
Imperial Lady Jiu is the only one

488
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,980
who can make the cake.

489
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
For the sake of your safety,

490
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,060
I humbly beg Your Majesty

491
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,900
to take Imperial Lady Jiu under custody

492
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,220
and have her interrogated.

493
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,780
I didn't put poison in the sorrowless cake.

494
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,540
I sent it to the Imperial Kitchen

495
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,100
after I made it.

496
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,020
The sorrowless cake doesn't have any clearer origin

497
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,580
than Imperial Lady Jiu which is very suspicious.

498
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,300
I always suspect that

499
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Her Highness Jiu lurks beside Your Majesty

500
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,780
for an opportunity of assassination.

501
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,220
Don't you frame me up!

502
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,180
Do you dare to tell us where your hometown is

503
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,020
and who taught you to make the sorrowless cake?

504
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:18,940
Your Majesty.

505
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,460
I...

506
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,780
We can't keep someone like this

507
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,260
from an unknown origin.

508
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,100
I didn't put the poison.

509
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,900
Your Majesty,

510
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,580
you've gotta trust me.

511
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,660
Ren'er,

512
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,940
it's a serious crime to poison the Emperor.

513
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,540
Strict interrogation is a must.

514
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,580
Imperial Lady Jiu is most suspicious

515
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,980
among all the people here.

516
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,900
Even though she is your most loved concubine,

517
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,420
her life shall not be spared.

518
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,300
If she is innocent,

519
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,940
we shall get her justified.

520
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,820
Mother!

521
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,900
Ren'er.

522
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,100
Ye Qingti!

523
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,020
Yes, Your Majesty!

524
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,460
Take Imperial Lady Jiu and everyone else involved

525
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,220
to the cell at the Ministry of Penalty

526
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
for interrogation.

527
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,020
Yes, Your Majesty!

528
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,900
Did you really not do it?

529
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,700
No!

530
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,060
After Your Highness talked to me,

531
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,580
I really didn't get into the Imperial Kitchen for another step.

532
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,420
If Her Highness Jiu is to kill Your Majesty,

533
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,620
she's got the chance long time back.

534
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,980
It's totally unnecessary for her to have rescued Your Majesty

535
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,780
on the battlefield at the time.

536
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,380
In my opinion,

537
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,620
someone else is behind it.

538
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,220
Of course I know that.

539
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,340
But the Chief Eunuch died on site in front of everybody

540
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,060
after taking the sorrowless cake.

541
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,420
Xiaojiu can't get away with suspicion

542
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,540
without any evidence.

543
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,100
Her Highness Jiu might be suspicious,

544
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,140
but aren't the chef from Imperial kitchen,

545
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,820
the eunuch and the imperial maid

546
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,340
from the feast suspicious as well?

547
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,980
The problem now is not about who put the poison

548
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,740
but that mother and Prince Ying

549
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,220
all think she is the murderer.

550
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,940
We know nothing about

551
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,980
Xiaojiu's identity and family background.

552
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,420
Neither did she tell us anything

553
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,980
about her family.

554
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,900
I wouldn't know where to start

555
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,900
if I wanted to intercede for her.

556
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,180
Your Majesty,

557
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,500
though we don't know

558
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,340
where Her Highness Jiu comes from,

559
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,820
she doesn't have the intention for killing.

560
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,420
You think she is innocent?

561
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,460
But there is indeed some suspicion about this case

562
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,540
which needs to be investigated.

563
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,820
OK!

564
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,540
I'll give you time to investigate.

565
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,940
Ye Qingti!

566
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:15,940
Yes, Your Majesty!

567
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,540
I'm giving you seven days

568
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,100
to thoroughly investigate

569
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,340
the sorrowless cake case.

570
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,260
Remember!

571
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,260
I let you investigate

572
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,060
to wipe out her charges.

573
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,220
I need evidence!

574
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,180
You must make it clear.

575
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,580
Yes, Your Majesty!

576
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,260
General Ye is impartial.

577
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,820
I believe he can get to the bottom of it.

578
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,380
Mother,

579
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,380
it's true that General Ye is impartial,

580
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,260
but he's as close to His Majesty as brothers.

581
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,420
In His Majesty's heart,

582
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,060
Imperial Lady Jiu is innocent.

583
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,980
I hold the same opinion with you.

584
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,540
The Imperial Lady Jiu is sycophantic,
which confuses His Majesty!

585
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,740
Ever since she came,

586
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,500
His Majesty visited the Imperial Harem quite frequently.

587
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,820
If it keeps going on,

588
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
I'm afraid His Majesty will spoil

589
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,260
the power of the throne.

590
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,420
Besides, the Imperial Lady Jiu's origin is quite odd.

591
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,780
Keeping her in the palace is like
keeping a stagger under the bed.

592
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,940
His Majesty has escaped it this time,

593
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,380
but it's hard to ensure

594
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,500
no accident will happen again.

595
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,300
Do you mean

596
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,900
General Ye will be controlled by Ren'er's will

597
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,860
to forgive that girl?

598
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,100
It is because she is too crafty.

599
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,620
She may talk to His Majesty into exonerating herself.

600
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
If we don't punish her,

601
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm afraid His Majesty will...

602
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,540
OK!

603
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,740
Enough of that!

604
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,860
I'll investigate this case in person.

605
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,100
If anyone has evil intents,

606
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,940
I'll have no mercy.

607
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,020
That's most brilliant!

608
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,500
Let me go!

609
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,300
Your Highness!

610
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,780
Your Highness! Let me go!

611
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,260
No!

612
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,660
This is all because of me!

613
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,700
You're all innocent.

614
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:03,900
Give it to me!

615
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,340
Your Highness!

616
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,340
You're just as innocent.

617
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,340
How can you humiliate

618
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,620
His Majesty's concubine like this?

619
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,020
His Majesty will never forgive you

620
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,620
if he knows this.

621
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,260
Everyone here are criminals.

622
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,220
There is no highness!

623
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,340
You'd better confess what you did

624
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,500
to avoid more sufferings.

625
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,140
Her Highness barely

626
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,140
walks out of her room

627
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,420
or had any contact with the palace.

628
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,100
How can you wrong us like this?

629
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,540
The dessert was made
as requested by Imperial Concubine Wan.

630
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,580
Why don't you interrogate her without discrimination?

631
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,220
You just bully Her Highness as she is friendless and helpless.

632
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,340
Are you still reluctant to confess?

633
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,740
I'll have to

634
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,060
take some serious actions.

635
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,100
Who is it?

636
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:46,980
Damn you!

637
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
Are you going to make them
confess to false charges under torture?

638
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,260
Damn!

639
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,740
General Ye,

640
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,260
you are not productive.

641
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,180
I'm here to supervise it according to Her Majesty's order.

642
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,140
Do you want to disobey it?

643
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,620
His Majesty gave me full right to investigate this case.

644
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,820
I have seven days.

645
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,620
You tried beat them into coma

646
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,100
before I even start the principal trial.

647
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,980
Do you want to prevent me from investigating on purpose

648
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,420
against His Majesty's will?

649
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,580
You can go ahead

650
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,860
with the investigation.

651
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,780
But I have to remind you that

652
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,780
this case has caught the attention of the Empress Dowager.

653
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,500
Her Majesty will

654
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,940
bring severe punishments

655
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,780
on whoever dares to bend the law for personal plan.

656
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,660
Fetch water quickly!

657
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,500
Yes!

658
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,140
I'll have someone send you

659
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,860
some unguent after a while.

660
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,100
General Ye,

661
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,780
I beg you to please help us.

662
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,500
We really did not put poison in the sorrowless cake.

663
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,500
Now that His Majesty has
designated me to investigate this case,

664
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,100
I'll surely do it with impartiality.

665
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,100
I hope you could cooperate as well

666
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,420
and tell me the truth.

667
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,620
I swear to the god that

668
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,260
I didn't put poison in the sorrowless cake.

669
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,180
General Ye,

670
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,340
please help us.

671
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,220
Don't worry!

672
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,580
I'll surely find out the truth.

673
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,500
His Majesty is also waiting for you to come out.

674
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Does His Majesty believe in me?

675
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,700
It is His Majesty who

676
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,980
gave me the right to investigate it.

677
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,380
He told me to bring justice to you.

678
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,180
He believes in you. Don't you believe in him?

but I've never forgotten you

683
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,020
since then.

684
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,420
So, I want to always stay

Please trust me!

699
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,780
It must not be you.

700
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,540
Ren'er!

701
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,060
Mother!

702
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,220
Ren'er!

703
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,220
Now we have concrete evidence.

704
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Do you still hold any hope

705
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,340
towards a girl

706
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,620
from an unknow origin?

707
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,620
Mother,

708
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,460
I've designated Ye Qingti to thoroughly investigate this case.

709
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,660
Only one day has pass for the seven-day deadline.

710
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,660
I hope these seven days is the time

711
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,780
you give to yourself for a thorough breakup.

712
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
You can't lose the principle as an Emperor

713
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,180
because of the feelings in your heart.

714
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,540
Don't worry, mother!

715
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,340
Xiaojiu is kind and straightforward.

716
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,420
It can't be done by her.

717
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,220
Ren'er,

718
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,740
your father once talked to me when he was alive.

719
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,460
He said that you're all good

720
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,820
except one point that made him worried.

721
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,780
You're too merciful.

722
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,500
Mother!

723
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,580
Being merciful is actually not something bad.

724
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,460
But it is

725
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,300
if you want to sit on the throne.

726
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,500
Your mercy will be an advantage for others to take.

727
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,580
Do you understand?

728
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,220
Yes, mother!

729
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,180
I'll bear your words in mind!

730
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,540
Yang Shun!

731
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
I pay respects to Your Majesty!

732
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,780
The Chief Eunuch started to serve us

733
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,500
when your father is still alive.

734
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,140
It's a great pity

735
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,180
that he died for you.

736
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,620
I've had him buried with dignity.

737
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,420
You can't fall short of servants either.

738
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,820
Yang Shun followed me since he was young.

739
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,020
He is an honest and reliable kid.

740
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,220
Let him stay beside you from today on

741
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,220
to take care of your daily life.

742
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,420
I have no objection, mother!
