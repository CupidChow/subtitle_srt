1
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,660
Episode 30

3
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,220
How can I steal the pimpon fruit?

4
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,460
Jiuge.

5
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,580
What are you thinking? You seem so obsessed.

6
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,660
Nothing.

7
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,860
Why are you so early, Jielu?

8
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,220
Cause I want to get a good seat

9
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,820
where I can be close to the master.

10
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,140
I may fail to get one if I'm late.

11
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,380
Jiuge.

12
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,780
Are you here for a seat, too?

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,860
No, I just woke up early.

14
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,420
I thought you were going to fight over the master with me.

15
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,300
Is there anyone else?

16
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,620
Who else will there be?

17
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,060
Of course the musician.

18
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,540
Every time when the master is giving a lesson,

19
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,660
she is always showing her attention nearby.

20
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,020
I wonder if Ji Heng still remember

21
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,860
what happened in the mortal world.

22
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,380
Jiuge,

23
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,740
are you listening to me?

24
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,860
Yes, I'm listening.

25
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,980
The musician came to

26
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,700
inseparable king birds in distress over 200 years ago.

27
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,980
And the master came here to give lectures

28
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,340
the second year after that.

29
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,220
For all these years,

30
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,900
only she has been there to serve him.

31
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,580
Turns out Ji Heng is the reason

32
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,620
why His Majesty is here.

33
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,700
That's typical of him.

34
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,220
The master particularly sets the tea class

35
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,460
in Water Moon Pond,

36
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,460
where the surroundings change from

37
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,220
the season of winter to
what seems to be spring in just a few days.

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,940
It is so fantastic!

39
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,580
Anything that takes more time and patience,

40
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,540
he's more intrigued.

41
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,860
That's one of his ways of killing time
for he's been living for too long.

42
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
The master's here. The master's here.

43
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,100
Come on. Sit.

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,380
Sit down.

45
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,820
Yan, come and have a seat.

46
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,500
Xiaojiu, why didn't you call me when you leave?

47
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm almost late.

48
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,700
You said you didn't want to take the tea class.

49
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,300
But Ji Heng is here.

50
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,860
Master,

51
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,140
are we drinking Xieyanqing Tea today?

52
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,340
I want to take the liberty of

53
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,420
using the tea ware of Rose Green as containers.

54
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,060
Why?

55
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,340
Master, I know you often use Black Glaze.

56
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,980
But I think

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,340
the color of the celadon

58
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,820
is a great match with that of Xieyanqing Tea,

59
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,060
which conveys a sense of freshness,

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,420
and highlights the scenery today.

61
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,220
Why making it so complicated?

62
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,620
I'd go the easy way.

63
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,820
The spirit of drinking tea

64
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,620
lies in the process of making tea.

65
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,740
There are three boiling stages.

66
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,620
Observing and listening are important during the process.

67
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,380
When water boils like fish blowing bubbles
in water with slight sound,

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,660
it's the first step of boiling.

69
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,620
When it's like spring gushing over the rim with louder sound,

70
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,860
it comes to the second stage.

71
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,020
When it's like sea rolling its waves with intense sound,

72
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,340
it is the third stage.

73
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,620
Ji Heng can stay by His Majesty's side

74
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,740
like the way she did in Tai Chen Palace.

75
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,140
While I can only look at them from a distance.

76
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,380
I have explained the method of making tea

77
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,660
very clearly.

78
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,500
Now it's your time to get yourselves familiar with it.

79
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,500
Master,

80
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,140
can I make

81
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,860
a proposal?

82
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,980
Sure.

83
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,460
Why don't we have a tea competition?

84
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,980
Master will be the judge,

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,860
and the students will compete against one another.

86
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,740
It can be a good way to test

87
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,540
if the students ever listened carefully in class

88
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,140
and for them to show what they've learnt.

89
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,540
It works out for everyone.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,860
Nice.

91
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,900
Yan. Let's make a group.

92
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,900
I thought you've been getting well with Princess Jiuge.

93
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
Why don't you choose her?

94
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,020
I know she's not good at tea art,

95
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,660
so I won't go up against her.

96
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
Fine, I will lose to anyone anyway.

97
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,580
All 15 students have got matched

98
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,820
except Princess Jiuge.

99
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,020
Are you willing to be my rival, Princess Jiuge?

100
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,620
It's unfair.

101
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,500
Everyone knows musician is exceptionally skillful in tea art.

102
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,820
Jiuge is a beginner.

103
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,300
Musician is too strong for her.

104
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,820
I learn my tea art from master.

105
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,500
Me and Princess Jiuge

106
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,220
are both master's students.

107
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,940
Why can't

108
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,420
we compete against each other?

109
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,500
Besides,

110
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Princess Jiuge hasn't said anything yet.

111
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,860
Princess Jielu, why are you so concerned?

112
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,780
Okay.

113
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,980
Let's do this.

114
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,340
I'm not afraid.

115
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,140
Great.

116
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,820
Then let's do it first.

117
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,300
The tea made by musician has a delightful aroma,
and it tastes sweet and smooth.

118
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,180
Very good tea making skills.

119
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,620
And the tea made by Princess Jiuge

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,260
has a bright color.

121
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,460
It's tasteless at first sip,

122
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,900
but the sweet taste lingers on at second sip.

123
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,100
Very unique way.

124
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,540
Both teas have their strong points.

125
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,100
It's too close to call.

126
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,700
Musician said it earlier

127
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,220
that the tea competition

128
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,820
is to test if students listened carefully in class.

129
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,620
Jiuge.

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,380
Do you remember

131
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,140
what I said about the first step?

132
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,060
Water first or tea first?

133
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,220
Musician is the winner

134
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,780
in this round.

135
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,980
Let's take a break for a quarter of an hour.

136
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,700
Next group. Jielu and Yan Chiwu.

137
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,820
Wait.

138
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,340
You got something to say to me?

139
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,580
I would take it if I'm less skillful.

140
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,780
But you just decided that I lost

141
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,540
by inventing a reason.

142
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,580
What was that all about?

143
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,740
Have you listened to

144
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,420
what I just said?

145
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,420
Just because I didn't listen carefully in your class?

146
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,900
I didn't know that you like holding a grudge.

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Clearly you were not listening to me.

148
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,900
Did I have to listen to what you said?

149
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,140
I shouldn't have asked you.

150
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,820
Don't move.

151
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,860
What?

152
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,300
You can go now.

153
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,820
Do you know that Ji Heng talked to me today

154
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,460
for quite a few words?

155
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,180
Your group is up. Go.

156
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,300
Yan, don't just sit there and watch.

157
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,380
Get started now.

158
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,700
Alright, time's up.

159
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,580
Yan,

160
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,260
your water overflowed.

161
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,180
I think

162
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,340
she might have an intention of accepting me.

163
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,780
So she started talking to me over the competition.

164
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,180
I was talking to you.

165
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,220
Your tea has gone cold. Don't drink it.

166
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,140
What did he mean?

167
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,260
Xiaojiu.

168
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,260
What's wrong with you lately?

169
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,780
You have been drifting off.

170
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,820
I am talking to you.

171
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,060
What did you say?

172
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
I said,

173
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,140
don't care what the ice face said.

174
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,140
I came for you today

175
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,940
because Meng asked us to go drinking in Zuilixian Restaurant.

176
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,460
Go drinking again?

177
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,540
I told you last time.

178
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,100
There are some new dancers in Zuilixian Restaurant.

179
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,580
Let's go and have a look.

180
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,340
Okay, let's go.

181
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,740
Why hasn't Jielu come here?

182
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Well, she has been in lock-in for a few days.

183
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,700
Why does she have to go for a lock-in?

184
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,660
It's said that pimpon fruit of this year

185
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,260
can help keep you forever young.

186
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,380
So she wants that.

187
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,300
The tournament is about to begin.

188
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,780
But Imperial College does not arrange His Majesty
to give lessons recently.

189
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,780
So she thought she might as well lock herself in to do training.

190
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,300
Well, that explains it.

191
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,180
Meng,

192
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,620
these are the new dancers you were talking about?

193
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,900
Yeah.

194
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,140
What do you think? Not bad, huh?

195
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,180
Way worse than Musician Ji Heng.

196
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,940
The tournament is going to begin so soon.

197
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,260
I guess

198
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,020
I have to speed up.

199
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,780
The dancers dance so well and are so good-looking.

200
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,660
Meng, you do have a good eye.

201
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,820
I'll propose a toast to you.

202
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,420
Cheers.

203
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,420
Fanyin Valley is such a good place.

204
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,740
Beautiful views and beautiful girls.

205
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,300
And the one and only fruiting pimpon tree

206
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,820
in the universe is here.

207
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,660
I thought you wanted to leave here.

208
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,460
Why are you praising it today?

209
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,780
I didn't get used to it when I just got here.

210
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,660
It's lucky for me to have you guys as my friends.

211
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,580
Meng,

212
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,460
cheers.

213
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,260
Meng,

214
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,820
cheers.

215
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,860
I'll fill you up.

216
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,820
Cheers.

217
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,620
Speaking of pimpon tree,

218
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,020
I heard the sound of boa constrictors

219
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
when I passed by Jieyou Spring the other day.

220
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,300
I was so scared that I almost fell to the ground.

221
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,940
I didn't know you could be scared of anything.

222
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,860
I fell into a snake nest by accident

223
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,180
when I was little.

224
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,940
Haven't you heard the saying that

225
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,980
a burnt child dreads the fire?

226
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,460
The four boa constrictors are super fierce.

227
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,780
You have to be extremely careful.

228
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,340
Stay away from the snake form.

229
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,060
Will they come out?

230
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,100
Don't worry.

231
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,060
They won't.

232
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,540
They are there to protect pimpon tree.

233
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,700
They won't leave easily.

234
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,580
As long as you don't go steal pimpon fruit,

235
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,980
they won't hurt you.

236
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,100
They won't leave easily?

237
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,180
You mean

238
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,540
they do leave there at some time?

239
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,100
Meng, let's drink.

240
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,980
Okay.

241
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Cheers.

242
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,740
Top it off.

243
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,620
Let me tell you a secret.

244
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,820
During the full moon,

245
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,020
when Yin Qi reaches its prime,

246
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,060
the four boa constrictors will leave there for a few hours

247
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,180
to absorb spirits of heaven and earth.

248
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,700
Spiritual snakes.

249
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,460
Meng,

250
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,260
drink.

251
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Okay, cheers.

252
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,780
Warrior Yan.

253
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,260
Meng said that during the full moon,

254
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,100
the four boa constrictors will leave, right?

255
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,420
I know you want to steal the fruit.

256
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,020
There are a few hours for you

257
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
to try some luck.

258
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,860
Wait a second.

259
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,180
Hello, I want two tomatoes on sticks.

260
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,100
You can keep the change.

261
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,180
You...

262
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,420
Okay, you can take as many as you want.

263
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,500
Okay, thank you.

264
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,140
There you go.

265
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,020
Warrior Yan.

266
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,500
Let's go steal pimpon fruit.

267
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,500
No.

268
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,780
I heard the pimpon fruit this year

269
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
can help you improve your cultivation.

270
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,820
I am good enough.

271
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,780
I don't need pimpon fruit for that.

272
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,540
Take it.

273
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,380
I heard the pimpon fruit this year

274
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,900
can not only improve your cultivation,

275
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
but also has the effect of keeping female immortals forever young

276
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,660
and making male immortals stronger and more handsome.

277
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,700
Do you think

278
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,060
Ji Heng prefers a strong and handsome man

279
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,380
or a man with porcelain skin like you?

280
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,460
I'll go with you.

281
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,220
Half each when we get the fruit.

282
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,220
Deal.

283
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,780
Just let me know if I can be of any help.

284
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,420
I've already done some research.

285
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,180
Pimpon fruit is in the middle,

286
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,420
surrounded by the boa constrictors.

287
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,940
We won't be able to get it

288
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
if we go in there bare-handed.

289
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,100
Do you have a better way?

290
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,060
According to Meng,

291
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,020
the four boa constrictors

292
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,780
will leave there for a few hours.

293
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,980
We can dig a tunnel

294
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,420
to pimpon tree

295
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,820
and come out

296
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,420
when the four boa constrictors

297
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,700
leave to absorb spirits of heaven and earth.

298
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,900
And then we leave from the tunnel after we get pimpon fruit.

299
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,980
In that way, no one will even know about it.

300
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,420
You are so smart.

301
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,700
Let's go dig the tunnel today

302
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,060
and start to take action tomorrow.

303
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,420
Cool.

304
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,540
Is it done?

305
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,540
Yes.

306
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,460
Do you think we should go down and have a check?

307
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,820
Can the tunnel really connect to pimpon tree?

308
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,620
It's not necessary.

309
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,100
My Locating Magic can't go wrong.

310
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,780
Let's go back.

311
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,260
We'll come here at this time tomorrow.

312
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Wait.

313
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,140
I think you should find something

314
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,220
to cover the hole.

315
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
It will be obvious

316
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,460
when the day breaks.

317
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,420
You're right.

318
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,380
Done.

319
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:46,900
Let's go.

320
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,460
Okay.

321
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,020
Master, you're back.

322
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,380
Master,

323
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,580
I've heated the soup for you.

324
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,820
Please drink it while it's hot.

325
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,260
You don't need to

326
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,620
take care of such trivial matters.

327
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,460
Looking after master

328
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,620
is my way of repaying your favors.

329
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,940
It won't consume much of my cultivation

330
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,660
to suppress Qiushui Toxin in you.

331
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,500
You don't have to worry about it.

332
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,620
Master, you have been so good to me.

333
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,300
For my happiness,

334
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,180
you helped me escape the wedding

335
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,620
at the risk of sacrificing your own reputation.

336
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,180
I'm very grateful for all that you've done for me.

337
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,300
As immortals, we have endless time in the world.

338
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,460
Don't be obsessed with things in the past.

339
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,340
But what have happened

340
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,540
is still so vivid to me.

341
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,260
Master, you come to Fanyin Valley once in ten years.

342
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,340
When you are not around,

343
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,380
Fanyin Valley is just

344
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,300
a silent place for cultivation for me,

345
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,740
with no enjoyment at all.

346
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,220
Only when master is around,

347
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,900
can this place be lively again.

348
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,420
I hope master can stay here longer.

349
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,420
So that

350
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,100
I can savor it in the following ten years.

351
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,820
This time,

352
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
I will try my best to cure Qiushui Cold Toxin in you.

353
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,980
Since you are not willing to go back to the world of the demons,

354
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,300
you can go

355
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,220
wherever you like

356
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,460
in the three worlds.

357
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,700
Master, don't get me wrong.

358
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,380
I don't expect anything else.

359
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,460
It was me who insisted on leaving.

360
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,500
Now

361
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,980
I'm too shamed to ask for any title.

362
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,660
All I want is an opportunity

363
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,060
to stay by your side,

364
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,820
so that I can repay your favors.

365
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,260
You don't need to stay by my side.

366
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,460
Is there someone

367
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,820
by your side already?

368
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,580
Or

369
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
is there someone on your mind already?

370
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,340
Is it...

371
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,820
Is it Princess Jiuge?

372
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,740
It's late.

373
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,940
Go back and sleep.

374
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,620
Okay.

375
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,940
All right.

376
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,140
I'll go down first since there's no one around.

377
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,420
What's wrong?

378
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,740
I think I should go check first, just in case.

379
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,900
Wait for me.

380
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,060
Be careful.

381
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,500
It's weird.

382
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,660
I remember I only dug one tunnel.

383
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Why are there three sideways?

384
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,260
It's halfway past the time.

385
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,620
Why hasn't Yan Chiwu come back?

386
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,940
Does he...

387
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,500
Yan is a good person.

388
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,980
But he used to be a demon lord

389
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,540
who did many evil things.

390
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,700
Is he so damned that he got eaten up

391
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,220
by the boa constrictors?

392
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,780
What the hell is this place?

393
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,780
I'm supposed to come out from under pimpon tree.

394
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
Did I dig in the wrong direction?

395
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,980
Never mind.

396
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,500
I'll see if pimpon tree is nearby?

397
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,140
Why...

398
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,620
why did Yan Chiwu dig three tunnels?

399
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,420
We need only one.

400
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,660
It's taking too long for him to check the way.

401
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Could he go the wrong way?

402
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
Where on earth is this place?

403
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,540
It's bad.

404
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,460
Sign of a red moon.

405
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,340
Evil spirits are going to come out.

406
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,100
Am I walking into a forbidden area

407
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,660
where evil spirits are bound?

408
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Why don't you even look at me in the eyes, Your Majesty?

409
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,420
Am I not

410
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,380
beautiful enough?

411
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,540
Your Majesty.

412
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,660
You come here only once in ten years.

413
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,380
Do you know how hard and torturing it is

414
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,700
expecting you?

415
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,860
You Majesty.

416
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,460
I'll get mad if you

417
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,140
don't look at me.

418
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,500
Your Majesty, you are dating a banshee here?

419
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,260
What are you doing here?

420
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,100
Your Majesty, you are the most unromantic man

421
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,940
in the Eight Deserts and Six Directions.

422
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,700
Why are you bringing two friends while dating me?

423
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,740
Don't you know that I will be mad?

424
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Oh, His Majesty was talking to her, not me.

425
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,580
Girl, you are so stubborn.

426
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,580
Why don't you leave with your friend?

427
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Do you want to see me

428
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,900
and His Majesty spend the night?

429
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
Keep doing what you are doing.

430
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,740
I don't mind watching from aside.

431
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,620
You can tell.

432
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,220
The flowing currents in both of your bodies

433
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,820
are the result of

434
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,180
confrontation between strong spirits.

435
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,180
Foling Flower is the holly flower of Sky Kingdom.

436
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,020
It must be summoned here

437
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,620
by His Majesty

438
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,060
for cleansing his breath.

439
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,660
You seem intimate with each other,

440
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,900
but you are actually having a tough fight in disguise.

441
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,620
Who

442
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,300
are you?

443
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,540
Since you can see it,

444
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,020
you should leave right now.

445
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,700
Since you want to be a part of it,

446
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,900
I will give you the satisfaction.

447
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,260
You are just nobody.

448
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,660
How dare you challenge me?

449
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,380
In every move, mind should go earlier than hands.

450
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,100
The sword has to be drawn by the mind.

451
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,900
That's what it takes to win the battle.

452
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,580
Watch closely.

453
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,180
Ji Heng?

454
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,540
Ji Heng.

455
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,820
Why are you here alone

456
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,420
in the middle of the night?

457
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,900
You are crying.

458
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,660
Did the ice face pick on you?

459
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,900
I'll go confront him.

460
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,660
It's none of his business.

461
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,980
I...

462
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,420
I came out for a walk and got lost.

463
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,660
And I happened to see the sad
and beautiful lotus pool under moonlight.

464
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,940
So I couldn't help being sentimental here.

465
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,660
No wonder.

466
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,300
Are you lost, too?

467
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,740
I got lost too.

468
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,900
Fanyin Valley is such a weird place.

469
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,340
Let me escort you back.

470
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,020
Thank you, Yan.

471
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,340
What did you call me?

472
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,100
Demon Lord

473
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,580
Yan.

474
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,340
No, no, no. Don't add Demon Lord.

475
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,060
Just call me Yan. It sounds friendlier.

476
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,940
I like you calling me Yan.

477
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,020
It's over?

478
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,060
Yes, it's over.

479
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,340
Why are you here?

480
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,060
Who's the banshee?

481
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,380
Wait.

482
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,180
You asked me why I was here?

483
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,580
Did I sound like I was talking to myself?

484
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,460
No.

485
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,500
I thought you asked Ji Heng why she was here.

486
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,380
So you were actually asking me.

487
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,780
Of course.

488
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,460
You haven't answered me yet.

489
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,460
Why are you here?

490
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,140
I...

491
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,180
I'm supposed to be

492
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,260
stealing pimpon fruit at this time.

493
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,660
But impulsion ran over me.

494
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,820
And the moment I drew pottery-made sword,

495
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,100
I completely forgot what I was supposed to do.

496
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,980
And I have no idea how much time is left for me.

497
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,340
I've got things to do. I have to go now.

498
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,220
Aren't you going to take me with you?

499
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,780
Why would I do that?

500
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,380
I'm hurt.

501
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,460
Do you want to leave me here alone?

502
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,140
Don't you think it's unsafe for me?

503
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,940
No.

504
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,180
Not at all.

505
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,100
You...

506
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,940
Looks like you don't feel safe leaving me here.

507
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,660
I'm sorry that

508
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,820
I fail to tell

509
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,460
you're hurt,

510
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,140
judging from your charming bearing now.

511
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,100
Legend has it that since Your Majesty

512
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,860
took the throne,

513
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,100
you've never shed a drop of blood.

514
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,700
How surprising it is to see you

515
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,820
get hurt today.

516
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Have you had enough?

517
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,340
The red blood is even mixed with goldenness.

518
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,940
Your Majesty's blood is indeed different.

519
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,580
I also heard that

520
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,740
a cup of Your Majesty's blood,

521
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,580
is worth an immortal's cultivation of a thousand years.

522
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,020
I'm wondering if it's true.

523
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,620
Generally,

524
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,700
what comes to your mind first

525
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,580
should be helping me stop the bleeding.

526
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,060
You have fooled me several times.

527
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,860
Who knows if this is your camouflage trick or not?

528
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,580
I'm no fool.

529
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,700
You are a lot smarter than before.

530
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,100
But didn't your master who taught you magic art

531
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,220
tell you in your childhood that

532
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,140
the camouflage with bleeding can only deceit a mortal,

533
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,660
but not an immortal?

534
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,700
The wound is real?

535
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,860
But

536
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,940
you are not like all the heroes I have met.

537
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,220
Take my uncle for example.

538
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,140
No matter how badly injured he was,

539
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,500
he would try everything he could think of

540
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,980
to keep my aunt from knowing it.

541
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,700
It's the first time I saw

542
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,020
someone who had such an overreaction.

543
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,140
Because I am weaker

544
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,820
than those heroes you know.

545
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,940
Am I exaggerating?

546
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,100
Sorry.

547
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,780
Thank you

548
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,980
for escorting me back.

549
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,260
I got lucky

550
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,980
to run into Ji Heng while I was lost.

551
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,180
Oh no.

552
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,340
I forgot about Xiaojiu.

553
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,940
What are you looking at?

554
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,020
I'm thinking.

555
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,340
Thinking about what?

556
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,180
Thinking about you.

557
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,860
Why did you come all the way to Jieyou Spring
in the middle of the night?

558
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,660
Damn, I totally forgot it.

559
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,820
Yan...

560
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,860
I...

561
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,020
Oh,

562
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,100
I've got something to do. Bye now.

563
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,820
Leaving so soon?

564
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,900
Is that your way of doing things in Qingqiu?

565
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,260
Of course.

566
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,100
I have my own business.

567
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,300
And I've patched you up.

568
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,260
Excuse me if there's nothing else.

569
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,460
I forgot to tell you that

570
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,700
Miao Luo's breaking in will trigger the shut-down,

571
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,300
so she will be trapped here.

572
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,980
Although she's put down,

573
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,100
the shut-down won't go away

574
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,260
until 24 hours later

575
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,020
for making sure nothing goes wrong.

576
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,100
I'm afraid

577
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,020
you can't go out for now.

578
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,660
24 hours.

579
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,100
What's so urgent

580
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,860
that you have to go out now?

581
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,460
I have...

582
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,380
I have an appointment with Yan Chiwu.

583
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,300
Stealing pimpon fruit

584
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,260
is not something I can talk about proudly

585
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,820
with others.

586
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,060
I have an appointment with Yan.

587
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:09,820
Your Majesty,

588
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,860
do you think

589
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,940
I patched you up well?

590
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,780
Do you owe me once?

591
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,260
Do you want to return the favor?

592
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,420
It's just so-so.

593
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,060
What do you want from me in return?

594
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,180
It's very simple.

595
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,820
Such a place

596
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,860
can only trap low-level immortals

597
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,460
like me.

598
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,140
Those immortals with high cultivation

599
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,060
like you

600
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,700
can't be trapped.

601
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,980
If Your Majesty

602
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,180
can help me get out of here,

603
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,540
I will forgive you for

604
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,380
your not coming to rescue me for over half a year

605
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,820
after leaving me in Fanyin Valley

606
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,980
and your turning into a handkerchief

607
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,380
to deceive me into forgiving you.

608
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,460
What do you think?

609
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,980
I think

610
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,620
you are holding a grudge against me.

611
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,340
I'm not.

612
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,300
Of course,

613
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,420
no one will offend me except you.

614
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,900
What about Yan Chiwu?

615
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,460
Yan.

616
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,180
Well, he's very nice.

617
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,540
So, Your Majesty,

618
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,020
are you going to help me get out

619
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,300
or not?

620
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,220
Why would I help you get out?

621
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
Because I helped you.

622
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,580
I helped you at a crucial time.

623
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,380
And you should help me once too.

624
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,740
That's what we call fairness.

625
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,740
I don't know how to get you out.

626
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,700
No matter how important your appointment is,

627
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,220
you have to wait until 24 hours later.

628
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,100
Xiaojiu.

629
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,100
Xiaojiu.

630
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,660
Where is she?

631
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,500
If I miss the chance tonight,

632
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,060
I have to wait until the 15th of next lunar month.

633
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,620
It's one more month to go.

634
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,300
I dragged Yan into this.

635
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,140
Now he couldn't find me.

636
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,620
He must be very anxious.

637
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,940
I didn't know that you are so worried about Yan.

638
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,860
I'm afraid he won't help me steal pimpon fruit again

639
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,580
next month.

640
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,380
No.

641
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,900
Nothing.

642
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,820
So you planned to steal pimpon fruit

643
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,460
with Yan Chiwu.

644
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,060
No.

645
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,060
I am the princess of Qingqiu.

646
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,940
I won't do such a thing.

647
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,300
No, you heard it wrong.

648
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,660
Maybe I did hear it wrong.

649
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,140
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

650
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,620
Come here.

651
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Lend me your shoulder.

652
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,660
Your Majesty.

653
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,220
You may feel uncomfortable leaning on me.

654
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,220
I can conjure a pillow for you.

655
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,540
I feel like I recall something.

656
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,500
You said the 15th of next lunar month...

657
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,700
Your Majesty,

658
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,380
are you feeling comfortable now?

659
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,380
I can lie down for you to lean on.

660
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,700
Should I lie down with my face up

661
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,860
or my back up?

662
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,820
Do you feel better sitting or lying?

663
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,740
If I lie down,

664
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,060
it means both of us are lying.

665
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,860
I think sitting is better.

666
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,620
Okay.

667
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,580
Xiaojiu.

668
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,380
Xiaojiu.

669
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,060
I lost too much blood earlier.

670
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,580
My hands are cold.

671
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,180
Do you mind

672
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,900
warming me up a little?

673
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,340
It's improper for men and women to have physical contact.

674
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,700
Sure.

675
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,660
I want to meet the empress of inseparable king birds

676
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,220
in a few days.

677
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,780
I'll ask her how to plant pimpon tree.

678
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,460
Do you think I should...

679
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,420
Well, I don't think

680
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,180
it's improper for men and women to have physical contact.

681
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,540
That's the most ridiculous thing

682
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
moralists come up with

683
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,900
since the creation of the universe.

684
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,620
I'm not sure if my hands are warm enough

685
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,700
for you, Your Majesty.

686
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,620
Quick learner.

687
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,100
I'm tired.

688
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,700
I want to get some sleep.

689
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,300
Suit yourself.

690
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,900
You just stood there

691
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,460
and watched the whole thing.

692
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,820
You're so cheeky to say you're tired.

693
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,740
I just fought a tough fight and I even have to serve you.

694
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,180
I'm much more tired than you.

695
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,860
I know what's in your head.

696
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,580
You think all I did was standing there and watching.

697
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,100
I was encouraging you

698
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,020
very seriously.

699
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,340
I will take you out

700
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,940
after I have enough rest.

701
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,220
I went this way earlier.

702
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,820
Xiaojiu must have gone either of the two ways.

703
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,740
What if she went alone to steal pimpon fruit

704
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,580
and got eaten up by the four boa constrictors?

705
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,620
I have to find her soon.

706
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,820
There are always people out there
trying to seek protection from me.

707
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,980
It's the first time I met someone

708
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,620
who wants to protect me instead.
