You filled the whole imperial city with a dreamscape?

72
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,580
It's true that's a small trick,

73
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,260
but you did it on a large scale.

74
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,300
It must've consumed you a lot of energy.

75
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,300

76
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,020

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,220
why you did such a thing

79
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,380
that made you lose more than you gain.

80
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,740
When I was in the yard, I forgot

81
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,260
you haven't been fully recovered.

82
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,860

I'm in good mood tonight.

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,380
You've been stern-faced

85
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,180
since I got to know you.

86
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,860
Why are you in good mood today?

87
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Is it because

88
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,540
you've finished the magic instrument?

89
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,900
Because you sent me this.

90
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,780
Are you so happy just because I sent you some sugar foxes?

91
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,340
You were

92
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,220
not as happy as now

93
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,140
when I made you sweet and sour fish.

94
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,580
I knew nothing about that,

95
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,580
so I missed a lot.

96
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,180
Now I just want to do more things

97
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,380
to make you happy.

98
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,260
Only one left?

99
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,100
You ate the other nine?

100
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,660
And the five for Su Moye.

101
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,220
You really have a sweet tooth.

102
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,100
If you want to eat something

103
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
or there is something you don't have but others do,

104
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,060
just let me know.

105
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,580
I'll get it all for you.

106
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm good at cooking.

107
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm not a picky eater.

108
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
I like everything you cook.

109
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,780
Xiaobai, you care about me so much.

110
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,740
I'm so happy.

111
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,380
Your Majesty,

112
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
you must've been

113
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
a considerate and sweet kid in your childhood.

114
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
You must've been wronged many times

115
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,140
before you grew up.

116
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:03,860
But,

117
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,340
from now on, as the Big Devil of Qingqiu,

118
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,100
I'll take you

119
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,140
to see what you've never seen

120
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,900
and play what you've never played.

121
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,660
I'll let you enjoy yourself to the full.

122
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,220
Let's go have fun.

123
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,460
Go.

124
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,620
Look.

125
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,060
Do you like this Konghou?

126
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,700
You have good taste.

127
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
I'm known as "Dough Figurine Tang",

128
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,900
but actually,

129
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,580
I'm best at making Konghou.

130
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,780
So, many young men

131
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,460

132
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,380

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,300
who will definitely like it.

134
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,180
This is the last one.

135
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,180
If you like it...

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
- I'll buy it. - I'll wrap...

137
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,940
Wrap it up.

138
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,700
It's on her?

139
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,020
You didn't play with dough figurines, right?

140
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,580
It's made of rice and flour,

141
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,180
but it's not edible.

142
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,980
Just play with it for a few days.

143
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,180
If you want something to eat,

144
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,940
there is sugar painting over there.

145
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,580
Let's go and have a look.

146
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,580
Okay.

147
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,700
Do you like this mini Konghou?

148
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,980
Sure.

149
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,700

150
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,700
Here is the change.

151
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,540
Keep it.

152
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,500

153
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,660
Keep the change as a reward.

154
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,980
Let's go.

155
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,420
Excuse me.

156
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,140
What do you want, miss?

157
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,140
Look over there.

159
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,140
Look.

160
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,940
Sir, I want two.

161
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,180
Okay! Just one minute.

162
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,420
Look.

163
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
This is a monkey.

164
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,900
This is a horse.

165
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,700
It has no legs.

166
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,980
Are they eaten?

167
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,980
What's this?

168
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,300
A wolfhound.

169
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,860
Here you are.

170
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Thanks.

171
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,860
This dragon looks nice.

172
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,100
This fox looks like you.

173
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,100
But it's not as good as that I made.

174
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,500
Sir.

175
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,340
Okay. Here is the change.

176
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,220
Keep it as a reward.

177
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,220
Thank you.

178
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,140
Do you like it?

179
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,420
Yes.

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,980
I'm good.

181
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,060
It's for you.

182
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,660
Both of them are yours.

183
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,860
When I went to a fair in my childhood,

184
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,780
what I liked most was

185
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,700
to buy everything I wanted.

186
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,420
I kept buying till I had to go home.

187
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,460
The happiness of holding what I liked

188
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,700
could last a very long time.

189
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,300
So, whatever you want to buy today,

190
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,020
I'll get it for you. Okay?

191
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,500
Okay.

192
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,580
Xiaobai.

193
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,380
Stay close to me.

194
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,100
Buy more and you'll get a discount.

195
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,100
Is it fresh?

196
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,900
Absolutely.

197
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,700
Masks.

198
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,220
Look at the masks.

199
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,220
Look.

200
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,540
Do you want a mask?

201
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,180
Look at the masks.

202
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
Look at this.

203
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,580
A fox mask.

204
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,940
Its eyebrows can move.

205
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,940
Interesting, right?

206
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,460
Do you want this?

207
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,060
Here you are.

208
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,460
I'll give you the change.

209
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,620
Keep it as a reward.

210
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Thank you.

211
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,340
Great.

212
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,180
Now you look like a fox.

213
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,660
You're a member of my family.

214
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
Yes, I am.

215
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,460
Let's go.

216
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,540
You also gave me a cypress mask that night

217
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,780
when we went to the Duanchang Mountain for the Yueling flowers.

218
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,460
At that time, I mistook you as Su Moye

219
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,940
and told you a lot of things.

220
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,860
You came here on purpose to save me,

221
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,860
but I failed to recognize you

222
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,460
because of memory disorder.

223
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,660
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,820
I didn't know

225
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,340
why you changed your attitude suddenly,

226
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,380
but seeing you care about me,

227
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,540
I was quite moved.

228
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,540
It turns out

229
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,860
you have been staying with me.

230
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,100
Xiaobai.

231
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,780
Wherever you go in the future,

232
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
I'll always stay by your side.

233
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,420
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

234
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,540
Have a look.

235
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,780
Masks.

236
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,380
Look at these masks.

237
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,180
Miss, do you want a mask?

238
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,460
Miss, you haven't paid for it.

239
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Your Highness Fengjiu,

240
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,700
you just sent the sugar foxes at the wrong time.

241
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,060
It's the critical moment to make the mirror,

242
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,180
but to make you happy,

243
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,260
Dong Hua has totally ignored it.

244
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,060
Fine. Forget about it.

245
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,380
The night is darker here.

246
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,860
It makes the sea of Foling flowers more beautiful.

247
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,340
Give it to me.

248
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,540
Look at those kids.

249
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,860
When I was young,

250
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,020
I often ran around like them.

251
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,060
My fourth uncle's mount

252
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,460
is a bird called Jingwei.

253
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
He often bullied me when I was a kid.

254
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,340
He once painted my fur black

255
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,380
when I fell asleep.

256
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,500
Really?

257
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,380
Were you often bullied when you were young?

258
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Not at all.

259
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,780
My classmates

260
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,740
couldn't wait to flatter me.

261
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,260
The only one who dared to bully me

262
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,860
was Jingwei.

263
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,140
But I took my revenge later.

264
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,220
How did you revenge?

265
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,820
I put a rabbit on his stomach

266
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,060
while he took a nap.

267
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,100
When he woke up,

268
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,060
I told him he gave birth to it.

269
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,100
He was scared into crying.

270
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,140
Well done.

271
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,580
But after he knew it was my trick,

272
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,740
he chased me for two months.

273
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,220
Why two months?

274
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,220
Because the final exam would be held two months later.

275
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,100
He wanted to copy ancient history off me.

276
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,540
Did you do well in that subject?

277
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,780
At that time,

278
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
I was into you.

279
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,260
You're an ancient hero,

280
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,420
so ancient history

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,100
is the history of your brilliant achievements in war.

282
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,580
I also tried to do well

283
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,740
in the subject you like,

284
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,500
but you like Buddhist theories best.

285
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,460
I was really unable to do that.

286
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,420
Actually, I didn't understand

287
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,740
why you could grasp Buddhist theories so well

288
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,340
although you kept fighting.

289
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,580
Later,

290
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,100
I suddenly realized

291
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,580
it's not impossible for those who wield a sword

292
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,300
to thoroughly understand the Buddhist theories.

293
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,860
Perhaps,

294
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,660
only those who are still concerned about all people

295
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,940
after having seen the world through

296
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,100
can understand the Buddhist theories

297
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,620
so thoroughly.

298
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,100
I also knew you like fishing,

299
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
but they didn't teach us.

300
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,100
Xiaobai.

301
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,860
Your Majesty,

302
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,660
you took me here to celebrate Girls' Festival

303
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
because you knew I was in bad mood, right?

304
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,140
Why?

305
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,380
Since Shen Ye came to my mansion,

306
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,140
I've been writing to him

307
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,620
as Aranya did.

308
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,380
From these letters,

309
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,020
I could feel

310
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,140
how Aranya cared about Shen Ye and how she loved him.

311
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm moved by her.

312
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
I also feel sorry for her.

313
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,540
Don't get trapped in it, Xiaobai.

314
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,260
You're not Aranya.

315
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,260
You don't need to experience her sorrow.

316
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,220
I'll figure out a way to get out of here.

317
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,140
Just focus on getting your primordial spirit recovered.

318
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
After we get out,

319
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,620
I'll marry you and let you be my empress.

320
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,020
Your empress?

321
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,300
Am I dreaming?

322
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,300
No.

323
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,140
Will you forget everything you said

324
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,620
after you go out?

325
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,700
No.

326
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,940
Then...

327
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,740
You don't need to think or do anything.

328
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,380
Just spend your life as Aranya.

329
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,580
I'll take care of everything

330
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,100
after we go out.

331
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,900
You just need to wait to be my bride.

332
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,940
The Wunu Building.

333
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,820
Girls are throwing sachets on the Wunu Building.

334
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Let's go have a look.

335
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,100
It's bustling.

336
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,500
Why are they walking faster and faster?

337
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,300
Your Majesty.

338
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
Hurry up, Your Majesty.

339
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,060
There are too many people.

340
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,340
Be careful not to get hurt.

341
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,220
Do you know that?

342
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,260
The Wunu Building only shows up

343
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,740
in the evening at the Girls' Festival.

344
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,580
Legend has it that

345
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,620
it's a token of affection

346
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,660
Lord Wunu in charge of the Wunu Star

347
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,940
sent to a prince of the inseparable king bird clan.

348
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,260
Really?

349
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Pitifully, members of the inseparable king bird clan

350
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,220
cannot marry any outsider.

351
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,820
So the two of them couldn't stay together.

352
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,180
Only this building shows up

353
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,100
in the evening of every Girls' Festival.

354
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,220
What's up, Your Majesty?

355
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,420
Nothing.

356
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,460
What happened later?

357
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,460
Later,

358
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,260
girls come to the building

359
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,100
and throw their sachets

360
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,780
to men they love.

361
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,460
A girl throws her sachet towards the person she likes

362
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,140
when he passes by.

363
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,060
If he accepts it,

364
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
he'll have a night tour with her.

365
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,700
Remember.

366
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,060
If anyone

367
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,100
throws her sachet to you,

368
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,340
don't accept it.

369
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,860
Because you've already had me.

370
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,020
Why are you smiling?

371
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,260
Did you hear what I said?

372
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,140
Yes.

373
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,060
Don't accept sachets. I've already had you.

374
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,420
Put it on,

375
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
just in case.

376
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,300
You're blushing.

377
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,340
You need this more than I do.

378
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,340
Let's go.

379
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,740
Put it on.

380
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,500
Throw.

381
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,380
Hurry!

382
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,580
Throw.

383
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Come over.

384
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,900
Why did they all throw at him?

385
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,460
I did it!

386
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,620
He's mine.

387
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,020
Don't try to take him away.

388
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,940
I don't think so.

389
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,620
I did it before you did.

390
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,620
You're forcing him to accept it.

391
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,700
You must come from somewhere else.

392
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,460
How did you know that?

393
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,660
Generally, only outsiders

394
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,300
would take their lovers here.

395
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,500
How should I take it off?

396
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,300
You couldn't do it.

397
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,220
It's impossible.

398
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,100
Put it on.

399
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,620
What is it?

400
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,660
What are they doing?

401
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,340
Sir, you accepted my sachet.

402
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,700
You have to spend the night with me.

403
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,620
Xiaobai, wait for me here.

404
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,500
Sir, why are you leaving?

405
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,260
Wait for me.

406
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,980
Stay, sir. Wait for me.

407
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,100
Wait for me.

408
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,020
What's going on?

409
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,740
So,

410
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,940
do you really want to

411
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,460
spend the night with me?

412
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,260
You didn't expect I could come and go freely

413
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,700
in the Dream of Aranya, right?

414
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,860
He said he'd marry me,

415
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,420
but he left me there alone

416
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,980
when he met another girl.

417
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,100
Your Highness!

418
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,580
Your Highness.

419
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
What's wrong, Chacha? Why are you in a hurry?

420
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,500
Something's happening in the Mengchun Courtyard.

421
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,020
Lord Shen Ye

422
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,060
is roaring drunk in the yard.

423
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Isn't he always

424
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
calm and serious?

425
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,540
Why did he suddenly get drunk?

426
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,740
I don't know.

427
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,460
Don't worry. Let's go have a look.

428
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,100
Your Excellency.

429
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,260
- Your Excellency. - You can't drink anymore.

430
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
You can't drink anymore.

431
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,780
Your Excellency.

432
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,220
Leave me alone.

433
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,180
Your Excellency, you can't...

434
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,780
Let me drink.

435
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,420
Give me the wine.

436
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,620
Your Highness.

437
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,580
Your Highness, are you okay?

438
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,180
Your Excellency.

439
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,420
Your Highness.

440
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,620
- Let me be. - He smashed all this?

441
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,900
Your Excellency.

442
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,180
Yes, Your Highness.

443
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,660
Lord Shen Ye is drunk dead.

444
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,980
I couldn't leave him alone,

445
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,660
so I asked Chacha to tell you about it.

446
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,980
Your Excellency.

447
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,020
I want to drink.

448
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,700
Stop it. Your Excellency. Stop it.

449
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,100
Your Excellency, you can't drink anymore.

450
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,140
Lord Shen Ye is drunk.

451
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,180
He's emotionally unstable.

452
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,460
You may get hurt if you stay here.

453
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,180
Let me stay here and serve him.

454
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,980
Please go back and rest up.

455
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:53,940
Don't bother.

456
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,660
I'm here to see him.

457
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,100
Why is he drunk?

458
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,340
He was drinking in the yard

459
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,940
and everything was going well.

460
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,820
But when we tried to take him back to his room

461
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,220
and gave him hangover soup,

462
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,900
he began to resist.

463
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,580
Then he smashed all dishes and cups

464
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,660
and asked us to take him more wine.

465
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,380
Your Excellency.

466
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,180
We've got more wine for you.

467
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
It's not wine!

468
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Give me wine.

469
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,260
Stop drinking.

470
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,660
Stop it.

471
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,700
Stop drinking. There is no more.

472
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,180
Don't give him hangover soup.

473
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,420
Let him smash everything.

474
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,020
There is something you don't know.

475
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,300
These chinaware articles

476
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,660
are top-grade treasures given by His Majesty.

477
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,740
That bowl

478
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,900
is worth 100 gold leaves.

479
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,140
100 gold leaves?

480
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,980
Exactly.

481
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
No wonder the sound was so pleasing to the ear

482
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,620
when it was broken.

483
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,500
Steward, all of you can leave.

484
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,340
Got it.

485
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,860
Go away.

486
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,020
Your Excellency.

487
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,420
- Please stop it. - Go away.

488
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,420
We're leaving.

489
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,580
Your Excellency, we're leaving.

490
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,780
Let's go.

491
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,500
Go.

492
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,460
Chacha, you can leave too.

493
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,980
Got it.

494
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,740
Why did you drink so much?

495
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,180
Leave me alone.

496
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,620
Go away.

497
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,060
Why should I leave?

498
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,900
I'm Aranya. I'm here for you.

499
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,100
Don't mention her name.

500
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,460
You're not her.

501
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,340
You're not her.

502
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,380
I found it out when we were at the Lingshu Stage.

503
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,260
The way you looked at me.

504
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,100
The words you said to me.

505
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,380
Aranya wouldn't be like that.

506
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,620
Even on the day when we fell out,

507
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,020
your response was different from hers.

508
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,780
You wrote 20 letters

509
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,900
exactly the same as she did

510
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,020
and you got Wen Tian to help you,

511
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,140
but you're not her.

512
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,260
You've drunk too much.

513
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,100
You...

514
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,900
You're not Aranya.

515
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,900
She could be anybody to me.

516
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,860
A stranger,

517
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,620
a foe,

518
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,060
an enemy or something else.

519
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,340
But it's just impossible for her to be like this.

520
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,260
It's impossible.

521
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,420
Definitely.

522
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,540
It's impossible.

523
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,020
What do you mean?

524
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
You said...

525
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,820
You once said,

526
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,740
"maybe I really liked you",

527
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,100
"maybe I really fooled you."

528
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,180
You're drunk.

529
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

530
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,740
You're stupid and stubborn.

531
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,860
I'll never give up

532
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,140
until I get back Red Qi of my primordial spirit.

533
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,060
Remember.

534
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,980
I'll get back what belongs to me sooner or later!

535
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:14,860
Xiaobai.

536
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,780
Aranya.

537
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,500
I've been waiting for you.

538
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,260
Come back.

539
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,260
Aranya.

540
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,500
Aranya.

541
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,500
Aranya.

542
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,580
Are you into her?

543
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,340
Yes.

544
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,940
In this case,

545
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,540
why didn't you tell her?

546
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,740
Why did you treat her coldly?

547
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,740
I thought

548
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,020
I could protect you by doing that.

549
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,300
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,100
I pushed you away so many times.

551
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Your Excellency.

552
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,860
Is Aranya back?

553
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,020
Yes.

554
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,740
Her Highness has gone to visit Lord Shen Ye.

555
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,740
Shen Ye?

556
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,380
Shen Ye was drunk dead.

557
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,100
Her Highness asked us to come back

558
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,940
and she'd take care of him herself.

559
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,900
Fine. It's of no use.

560
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,020
Forget about it.

561
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,980
Maybe you love each other.
Maybe you aren't destined to stay together.

562
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,460
Now that you like her,

563
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,660
you should've told her about your feelings,

564
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,820
instead of keeping regretting when it was too late.

565
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,100
Anyway,

566
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,420
it's hard to have a crush on someone

567
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,340
and it's harder someone you love also loves you.

568
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,100
What are you doing?

569
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,900
Isn't he drunk?

570
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,980
We should let him have a good sleep.

571
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,580
Then he'll stop talking nonsense.

572
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,060
Why did you make him unconscious?

573
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,780
I can't let him talk nonsense to you.

574
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,860
But you even didn't know

575
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,220
why he got drunk

576
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,180
before you hit him.

577
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,700
No matter what reason it is for,

578
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,740
he shouldn't try to touch your face

579
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,140
after getting drunk.

580
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,540
Xiaobai,

581
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,300
remember

582
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,940
you're not Aranya.

583
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,580
But he got drunk not because of me.

584
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,700
Then for what?

585
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,220
Because he has known I'm not Aranya.

586
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
He remembers every word Aranya said

587
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,100
and everything

588
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,780
Aranya cared about.

589
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,220
He remembers her eyes

590
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,900
and her movements.

591
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,860
No matter how hard I acted,

592
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,020
I couldn't fool him.

593
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,580
Xiaobai,

594
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,620
don't you think

595
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
you care about Shen Ye too much?

596
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,220
Because I think

597
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,340
Aranya was like what I used to be.

598
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,180
Trust me, Xiaobai.

599
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,900
We'll stay together

600
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,180
after we get out of here.

601
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,020
You just left me alone

602
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,460
on the street.

603
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,020
I can't believe you said that.

604
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,500
You've misunderstood me so much.

605
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
I know you do things for a reason,

606
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,020
but actually, I don't want to

607
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,380
get out of the Dream of Aranya.

608
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,660
Why not?

609
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,820
Because...

610
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,380
Because once we get out of the dream world,

611
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,020
you'll become Emperor Dong Hua

612
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,900
who sits up high in a leading position

613
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,780
and I'll still be a fox

614
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,020
that you don't care about.

615
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,060
In this case,

616
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,460
I prefer I'm Aranya

617
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,500
and you're Xi Ze.

618
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,460
Then we can stay together

619
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,220
in the Dream of Aranya.

620
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,180
Xiaobai,

621
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,900
what happens here is not true.

622
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,460
Even if you keep helping Shen Ye

623
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,900
fulfill his wish as Aranya,

624
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,940
everything here won't

625
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,140
have anything to do with us

626
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,540
when we get out of here.

627
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,820
Shen Ye

628
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,900
will still go back to the world without Aranya.

629
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,500
Everything you did

630
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,620
wouldn't help him in the real world.

631
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,860
His Majesty was right.

632
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,380
Shen Ye and Aranya are a miserable couple.

633
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,100
I feel sorry for Aranya

634
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,340
and want to awaken Shen Ye as Aranya,

635
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,700
but I've never thought

636
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,580
it might do more harm to Shen Ye.

637
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,380
His Majesty must've gone

638
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,460
back to the Qi Nan Palace.

639
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,940
I didn't expect Miao Luo

640
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,180
has recovered her strength so rapidly

641
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,820
that she can enter the Dream of Aranya at will.

642
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,100
If she takes back the Red Qi of her primordial spirit

643
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,300
from Xiaobai,

644
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,300
I'm afraid she'll come out of the Miaoyi Chasm.

645
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,540
The task of top priority

646
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,500
is to keep Xiaobai safe

647
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,820
and make the mirror.

648
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,020
We have to get out of the dream world as soon as possible

649
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,620
If His Majesty can't get out...

650
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,540
Impossible.

651
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,100
Your Highness,

652
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,140
if they still don't come out

653
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,460
some days later,

654
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,700
let me go into the dream world.

655
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,220
It's unnecessary.

656
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,540
I said he could do it.

657
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,060
He's bound to do it.

658
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,020
You haven't got any news?

659
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,260
Go back.

660
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,460
It's not safe here. You shouldn't be here.

661
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,380
Servant!

662
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,220
Your Excellency, you woke up!

663
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,260
Are you feeling okay?

664
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,740
Yeah.

665
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,060
You got drunk last night. Her Highness was worried.

666
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,500
She asked me

667
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,420
to take you some hangover soup.

668
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,700
Did Aranya come here last night?

669
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,700
After hearing you got drunk,

670
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,900
Her Highness came here and took care of you herself.

671
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,940
Lord Xi Ze came here too,

672
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,740
but it seemed something unpleasant happened

673
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,260
between him and Her Highness.

674
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,180
I talked nonsense after getting drunk.

675
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,540
I must've bothered Her Highness.

676
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,900
You may leave now.

677
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,580
Yes, Your Excellency.

678
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,700
This is the last life

679
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,100
where I can collect Aranya's primordial spirit.

680
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,340
I can't make any careless mistakes,

681
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,100
or I'll never have a chance to make it.
