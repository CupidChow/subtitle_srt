00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,900
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 5

3
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
Min Su!

4
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,440
Min Su.

5
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,640
Min Su.

6
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,810
Min Su!

7
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,760
Your Highness!

8
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,560
It's dangerous. Don't come over.

9
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Leave here now!

10
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,040
Min Su!

11
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,760
Go!

12
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,080
Watch out!

13
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,280
Min Su!

14
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,680
Are you okay?

15
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,760
Why did you save me at the risk of your life?

16
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,000
You really

17
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,680
look like your mom.

18
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,520
My mom?

19
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,840
Do you know her?

20
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,600
Do you have a dragon scale on you?

21
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,800
How...

22
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
How did you know that?

23
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
That year,

24
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,280
you were just six.

25
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,720
You were almost burnt

26
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,560
by a fire monster.

27
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
It was me that saved you

28
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
and gave you the dragon scale.

29
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,680
Since then,

30
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,400
whenever I got into trouble,

31
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
I felt like someone was there helping me

32
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,240
and the scale would respond.

33
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
It's you.

34
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,800
It's you that have been protecting me in secret

35
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,880
and keeping me safe.

36
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,120
So...

37
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,760
So...

38
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,680
Who on earth are you?

39
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm your father.

40
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

41
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Fath...

42
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,520
No.

43
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,640
No.

44
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Impossible.

45
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,800
Nobody has ever told me about that.

46
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,160
You and my mom...

47
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,000
You've never...

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Heng,

49
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,240
in those years,

50
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
unable to bear Demon Lord Chi 's torture anymore,

51
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,240
your mom ran away from the demons and then met me.

52
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
We concealed our true names and came to the south desert.

53
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Then you were born.

54
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,360
Are...

55
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,920
Are you really...

56
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,400
...my father?

57
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,120
Your Majesty.

58
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm so glad to see you again before I die.

59
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,120
Don't do that.

60
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you so badly injured?

61
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,560
It's okay.

62
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,200
Your Majesty, don't worry.

63
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,040
Your Majesty,

64
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,960
she's my daughter

65
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Ji Heng.

66
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
You insisted on staying here

67
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
just because of her, right?

68
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
It's all my fault.

69
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
I wanted to save Min Su,

70
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,480
so he was severely injured.

71
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,640
He was injured to save me.

72
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,910
Your Majesty,

73
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
please save him.

74
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,480
You can save him, right?

75
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,150
It's too late.

76
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,600
No.

77
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,600
No.

78
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
It's not true.

79
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,920
Your Majesty,

80
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,400
can you do me a favor?

81
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,000
Go ahead.

82
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,080
Ji Heng

83
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,600
is poisoned with Qiushui Cold Toxin.

84
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
and I can't take care of her anymore.

85
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Can you take care of her

86
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,600
and keep her safe?

87
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Trust me. I will take care of her

88
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
and try to detoxify the poison.

89
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,880
No.

90
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,480
I'll hate you.

91
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,320
Stay.

92
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,680
I'll hate you if you leave.

93
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,760
I'll hate you all my life.

94
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,720
No.

95
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,720
No.

96
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,640
Dad.

97
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,920
Dad.

98
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,040
Dad.

99
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Dad.

100
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,960
Dad.

101
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,560
Where are you from, little fox?

102
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Where are you from?

103
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,200
Jiu.

104
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Your Highness?

105
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,600
Why did you become a common spiritual fox?

106
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,920
How about your magic arts?

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
Did you lose them?

108
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,280
I'm pregnant with His Majesty's baby.

109
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,400
What has happened?

110
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,960
You're fooled, Your Highness.

111
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,680
If you got pregnant

112
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,320
from just kissing him,

113
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,920
I'd give birth to two sons.

114
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,360
Come on.

115
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Now that you're here, just stay.

116
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
Write down

117
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
everything about how you become

118
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,680
what you are.

119
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,240
Write it down.

120
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,360
Dad.

121
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Your Majesty, thank you for saving me.

122
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,880
The poison hasn't been removed completely.

123
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
You still need a good rest.

124
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,640
Min Su.

125
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,840
Your Majesty, how is Min Su doing?

126
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
He'll survive.

127
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,760
Your Majesty,

128
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,600
can I beg you for something?

129
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,040
My elder brother

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880
Xu Yang

131
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
wouldn't spare Min Su.

132
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,200
Your Majesty,

133
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
can you help us?

134
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,680
The two of you...

135
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
We've known each other since childhood.

136
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,440
When I was young,

137
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,360
my brother wouldn't let me talk to anyone else.

138
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,120
Only Min Su stayed with me

139
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,800
and took care of me.

140
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't want to marry the guy chosen by my brother.

141
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
But he...

142
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,000
Your Majesty,

143
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,800
I'll marry nobody

144
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,920
but Min Su.

145
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,760
I hope you can help me.

146
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,120
Your Majesty, you've underestimated me.

147
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,280
How could you trap me in such a small ward?

148
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Demon Lord,

149
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,760
Her Highness is back.

150
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,240
Where is she?

151
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,240
Just outside the palace.

152
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,360
She's with Emperor Dong Hua.

153
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,200
Dong Hua?

154
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,800
Dong Hua,

155
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
why is my sister injured?

156
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
She's poisoned with Qiushui Cold Toxin.

157
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,840
Qiushui?

158
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,440
Dong Hua,

159
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,920
you saved her life.

160
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,440
We're deeply grateful.

161
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,200
The poison hasn't been removed completely.

162
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,080
She still needs a good rest.

163
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,960
Thank you for your advice.

164
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
Dong Hua,

165
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,000
can you tell me

166
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,080
what on earth has happened between
you and Heng on Baishui Mountain?

167
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,720
Nothing special.

168
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,920
I just met her by chance.

169
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,120
By chance?

170
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,080
Dong Hua, do you still remember

171
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,240
what you promised us at the Forbidden Land?

172
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,600
Go ahead.

173
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,040
I hope

174
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,440
you can marry Ji Heng.

175
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,640
I'm afraid I can't.

176
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,480
You made a promise.

177
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,840
Do you want to go back on it?

178
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,640
It has nothing to do with my promise.

179
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,720
It's just I've never planned

180
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
to get married.

181
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,000
You once promised

182
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,640
you'd say yes to my request

183
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,120
as long as it's not morally wrong

184
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,360
and it doesn't hurt anyone.

185
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
Why are you making excuses?

186
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,760
So what?

187
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,360
Dong Hua,

188
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
your marriage matters a lot.

189
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,320
It's not something just between you and me.

190
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,200
I actually put it forward for the sake of the gods, the demons

191
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
and even the whole world.

192
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,720
The gods and the demons will live together in peace

193
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,960
and there won't be wars anymore.

194
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
Isn't lasting peace

195
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,480
what you wish for?

196
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
So, you want your sister to marry me

197
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,720
for lasting peace of the six worlds.

198
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,240
Exactly.

199
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,560
What else do you think?

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In this case,

201
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
you can send Ji Heng

202
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,760
to Tai Chen Palace in three months.

203
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,520
You agreed?

204
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,560
You have lofty ideals,

205
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,000
but you should also remember

206
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Ji Heng will be one of the gods

207
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,480
after she marries into our clan

208
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,160
and then won't have to follow the rules of the demons.

209
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,120
Besides,

210
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,000
in case anything happens to your clan in the future,

211
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
I'm sure you'll keep sparing no effort

212
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,600
for the peace of the universe

213
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,840
and won't leave your clan members acting against the law.

214
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
For this purpose,

215
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,160
I have to fulfill your wish.

216
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,400
You have a great deal of foresight.

217
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,600
I admire you.

218
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,160
I've said yes to your request.

219
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,830
As for Ji Heng's guard,

220
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,110
how about forgiving him?

221
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,160
Now that she's going to marry you,

222
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,350
I'll spare him.

223
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
His Majesty often makes an inspection tour like this.

224
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
It's not been a long time since he left.

225
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,640
Why do you miss him so much?

226
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
I'm really worried about you.

227
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,600
His Majesty couldn't stay with you every day.

228
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
Well. Don't cry.

229
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,560
His Majesty asked me to take good care of you.

230
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,600
How about this?

231
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,320
I'll open the ward

232
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
so that you can play around in the palace.

233
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,720
Okay?

234
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,080
Little fox, how can you lie to me?

235
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,720
I want to stay with His Majesty every now and then.

236
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm going to meet him!

237
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,080
You little fox.

238
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,160
You deceived him into opening the ward.

239
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,380
Your Majesty.

240
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,920
Foster brother, you're back.

241
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,440
Your Majesty.

242
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,610
Your Majesty,

243
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,040
it turns out the little fox went to meet you.

244
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,840
Aren't they resin of cinnamomum camphora

245
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
and stamens of green lotuses from Baishui Mountain?

246
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,120
It turns out he went to collect medicine for me.

247
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,880
These are the two kinds of effective medicine

248
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,920
to cure wounds, right?

249
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,440
Get the gallipot here.

250
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,880
His hand is injured.

251
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,600
It must've happened

252
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
when he got medicine for me.

253
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,080
I'll also make

254
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,440
a great healing ointment for him.

255
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,000
Jiu from the Imperial Kitchen is good at cooking.

256
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,760
Ask her to prepare food for the fox.

257
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,040
There is one thing I have to report to you.

258
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,800
Jiu disappeared.

259
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,480
I think she has something to do with the demon

260
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,720
who came here disguised as you.

261
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,840
You liar.

262
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
I'm open and aboveboard.

263
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,520
How could I be a spy of the demons?

264
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,080
I'm from Qingqiu.

265
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,880
You framed me up

266
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,160
just to stop me from coming back again.

267
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,160
Now that you care about the fox,

268
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,680
how about letting my subordinate Yu Ru take care of it?

269
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
It's better to leave me alone.

270
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,600
I may live a longer life

271
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,520
without your subordinate.

272
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,680
Don't bother.

273
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,640
Now that there is no suitable person,

274
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,680
I'll take care of it myself.

275
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,840
Foster brother,

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,560
we know nothing about the little fox's background.

277
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm afraid it is transformed by some demon with magic arts.

278
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,560
You have to be careful.

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,800
You're thinking too much.

280
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,040
You can even cry.

281
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,760
Why can't you jump on me?

282
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
He sent me a piece of jade.

283
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,720
Is it the so-called token of affection?

284
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,520
You're so lively.

285
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm sorry that you got trapped in the soul-locking jade

286
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,640
and almost lost your life.

287
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
It's nothing.

288
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,280
I'm willing to do anything

289
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,920
as long as I can stay by your side.

290
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,320
He used to be one of my generals.

291
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,080
He was bold and powerful at that time

292
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,080
and got me out of trouble several times.

293
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,320
Today,

294
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
I could do nothing but watch him die.

295
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,920
OMG.

296
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,040
I thought

297
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,720
he's the most resolute and ruthless god
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts,

298
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,240
but he also feels sad sometimes.

299
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,920
What's so special

300
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,840
about love?

301
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,800
Why did a brave general like him choose to do that?

302
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,680
He could've survived.

303
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,240
Your Majesty,

304
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,320
I'm willing to do anything for you,

305
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,680
but,

306
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,120
I don't want to die for you.

307
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,880
It's not that I'm not sincere enough,

308
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,000
It's just

309
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,600
I prefer to live with you.

310
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,720
I have a great yearning to stay with you,

311
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,160
so I can't die.

312
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,960
I hate to part with you.

313
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,640
Your Highness,

314
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,480
you made trouble again.

315
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,560
Do you know your fur is...

316
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,600
Did you draw it?

317
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
Flowers bloom and fade and turn into mud.

318
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,520
Safe and peaceful, we stay with each other forever.

319
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,040
Si Ming, you're impolite.

320
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,880
How can read my poem without my permission?

321
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,520
Just so so. It's a tongue twister at most.

322
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,720
You bad guy.

323
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,400
But I think

324
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,480
this painting is not bad.

325
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,800
Speaking of Technique of the Buddha's Seal Wheel,

326
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,240
only three people have grasped it.

327
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,600
The first is Mo Yuan from the Kunlun Mountain.

328
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,640
The second is the Buddha from Sukhavati.

329
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,600
The third is His Majesty.

330
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,000
You're most fortunate

331
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,800
to have a chance to see it.

332
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,920
That's for sure.

333
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,840
His Majesty is so powerful.

334
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm bound to spread it

335
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,640
and let more people

336
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,200
know about the heroic epic.

337
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
Si Ming, where is that thing?

338
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
This is what you want.

339
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
Don't open it completely.

340
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,880
Take out as much as you need.

341
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,640
What is it?

342
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,120
Cotton rose ointment.

343
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,800
Did you make it?

344
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,520
Wait a second.

345
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,040

362
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,520

on the Winter Solstice.

369
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,080
By then,

370
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,840
I'll get your paws red

371
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,040
and paint with them.

372
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,520
What do you think?

373
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,920
His Majesty is also thinking about the future.

374
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,640
We'll spend a lot of time with each other in the future.

375
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,000
Alright.

376
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,400
From now on,

377
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,200
I'll stop eating my head off.

I'll be a useful fox

379
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,000
to bring glory to him.

380
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:02,840
♪ They remember each other no matter how the world is changing. ♪

381
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:10,320
♪ I'll never give up unless the earth and heaven get old. ♪

382
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,400
♪ I hope destiny will bring us together. ♪

383
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,280
♪ It's melancholy and sorrowful. ♪

384
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,600
♪ It's miserable to part with who you love. ♪

385
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,960
I'll be a useful fox.

386
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,800
Well. I'll try to do that when summer is over.

387
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,080
You really love the little fox.

388
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,280
To let it enjoy the shade,

389
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,600
you've got two sandalwood trees cut

390
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,120
and rock crystal has been used to avoid water.

391
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,240
In this way

392
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,360
can it relax in the cool pavilion in midsummer.

393
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm even inferior to a fox.

394
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,280
Your Highness, please don't say that.

395
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
It's just a pet.

396
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
I've done so many things

397
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
for the sake of him.

398
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,280
But in the end,

399
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
it's a pet that has benefited from this.

400
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,400
Your Majesty,

401
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,400
have you always been reading Buddhist scriptures alone

402
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,800
in the daytime

403
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,440
and at night?

404
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,800
As long as I'm here,

405
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,600
he won't feel lonely again.

406
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,560
I'll give all best things in the world

407
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
to him.

408
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,280
When I'm able to speak,

409
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,000
I'll deceive him into going to Qingqiu.

410
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,760
By then, I'll say this to him.

411
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,640
Look.

412
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
Stars here are so big.

413
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,420
They're not cute.

414
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,940
I can take you to Qingqiu

415
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,700
and watch stars there.

416
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,800
Okay.

417
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,880
Has His Majesty seen you

418
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,320
behave like this?

419
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,920
You won't listen to me unless I mention His Majesty.

420
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,360
Are you angry?

421
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,840
How about shaking hands?

422
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,640
Anger makes you age more quickly.

423
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,000
Look. I'm old enough.

424
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,840
I can't remember anything.

425
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,720
I can't remember who said

426
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,480
the root of Hanshi grass

427
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,160
is effective in helping people forget sorrow

428
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,880
and its flowers are top seasoning.

429
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
And I can't remember who wants the seed.

430
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,760
It's you.

431
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,200
I looked for it on purpose

432
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,200
when I went to Sukhavati for the Buddha's lectures.

433
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,420
It's said it's the last seed on Ling Mountain

434
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,160
in the Four Seas and Eight Deserts.

435
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,480
The last one.

436
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,680
You're happy now.

437
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
I'll give it to you

438
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,400
when you leave the Sky Kingdom.

439
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,840
Your scared me.

440
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,640
Don't eat it!

441
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,400
I'll bury it here.

442
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,560
The location won't matter

443
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,240
if I can stay with His Majesty in the future.

444
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,920
It's just cooked.

445
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,960
By me.

446
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,600
Your Majesty.

447
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,840
I've been thinking about it.

448
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,880
His Majesty and I don't share the same hobbies.

449
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,120
I'm not good at anything he can do.

450
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,080
But unexpectedly,

451
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,280
he's also good at cooking, the only thing I'm expert at.

452
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,600
I finally found something

453
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,670
we're both good at.

454
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,190
I'm much relieved.

455
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,760
Is it good?

456
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,440
For real,

457
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,280
it's so...

458
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,230
...so awful.

459
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,280
What should be the look on my face when I talk to him?

460
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,400
My auntie once told me

461
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,670
a story about a bride.

462
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,360
She was not good at cooking.

463
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,800
One day, she was seized by a whim

464
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,040
and decided to cook soup.

465
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,040
She won high praise from her husband.

466
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,800
Later, the bride tasted the soup

467
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,640
when she did the dishes,

468
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,320
only to find

469
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,800
her husband said those words

470
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,520
to make her happy.

471
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,040
So...

472
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,280
Then the couple loved each other more.

473
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,160
It became an interesting story

474
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,200
on everybody's lips.

475
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,320
I can't tell him it's awful.

476
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,600
Your Majesty,

477
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,920
please observe carefully

478
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,000
and realize I'm smiling with a little reluctance.

479
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,120
It'd be best

480
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,120
if you taste it yourself.

481
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Do you mean...

482
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,400
You want to have some more?

483
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
There is no more for today.

484
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,080
I'll cook for you tomorrow.

485
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,320
Don't bother.

486
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I've tasted it.

487
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,920
It's awful.

488
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,680
But I think

489
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,040
it may be to your taste now that you're a different species.

490
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,040
So I took it to you.

491
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,440
As expected,

492
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,040
you foxes really have a different taste.

493
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,280
I've eaten so much food prepared by His Majesty

494
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,040
that I've lost lots of fur.

495
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,720
If it goes on like this,

496
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,360
I'd become bald.

497
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,200
It seems I have no other choice

498
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,880
but to tell him the truth.

499
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,760
Alright.

500
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,040
I'll use body language to tell him

501
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,040
I don't like the carp.

502
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,840
Good tea.

503
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,000
There is a guest.

504
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,520
I can't eavesdrop on them.

505
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
It's impolite.

506
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,720
Your Majesty,

507
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
I haven't heard that

508
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,120
you're interested in pets.

509
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,880
Why did you suddenly raise a spiritual fox?

510
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It's special.

511
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,680
Maybe it's destiny.

512
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,280
Don't try to fool me.

513
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,760
I've seen spiritual foxes

514
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,800
better-looking than that.

515
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,960
The ladies in the Bai family of Qingqiu

516
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,760
are all gorgeous.

517
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,440
What's special

518
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
about your fox?

519
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
It likes the sweet and sour fish

520
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,240
made by me.

521
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,080
It's really special.

522
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,800
Such being the case,

523
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
if I tell him

524
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,440
I was lying,

525
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:05,960
then...

526
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,440
Anyway,

527
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,400
it's a white lie.

528
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,960
I'd better just let it continue.

529
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,320
If I keep eating the fish cooked by him,

530
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
all my fur would fall out,

531
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,160
but it doesn't matter.

532
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,240
I'll pretend

533
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,640
it's time to molt.

534
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,920
Did you just smile?

535
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,040
Do you like it?

536
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,320
Yes.

537
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,280
Have a look. Do you like it?

538
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,440
I like all your paintings.

539
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,760
Wait for me at the central yard if you wake up.

540
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,600
I'll feed you.

541
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
What's special about that little fox?

542
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
It's more important than me in your mind.

543
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,520
Why?

544
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,680
Anyway,

545
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,600
in this case, I can't go to the west desert

546
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,960
to do what you want me to.

547
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
I promised your father I'd look after you.

548
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,600
I mean what I say.

549
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,040
It's just a pet. Don't take it seriously.

550
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,360
See?

551
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,120
In his mind,

552
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,760
you're just a pet.

553
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,040
But you always dream of staying with him.

554
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,000
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

555
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,640
Now I can go to the west desert and give rain.

556
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
I wonder if he's still interested in you

557
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
when I come back.

558
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,680
I hope I can still see you in Tai Chen Palace.

559
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,600
His Majesty is so nice to me.

560
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,120
Am I really just a pet in his mind?

561
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,240
If he knows my true identity...

562
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,880
If I tell him

563
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm Princess of Qingqiu,

564
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,560
will he blame me?

565
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,760
He drew paintings with me

566
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,480
and sent me such nice white jade.

567
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,720
He said so much to me with me in his arms.

568
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,320
Little thing,

569
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
you're so naughty,

570
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,760
but His Majesty just won't get mad at you.

571
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,440
That's because I'm important in his mind.

572
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,200
Go with me.

573
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,600
His Majesty is looking for you.

574
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:54,800
Your Majesty.

575
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,640
Your Majesty.

576
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,280
Little fox.

577
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,360
Little fox. Wait.

578
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,480
Wait.

579
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,040
Our honored guests will be here soon.

580
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,320
Don't make trouble

581
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,720
to let us lose face.
