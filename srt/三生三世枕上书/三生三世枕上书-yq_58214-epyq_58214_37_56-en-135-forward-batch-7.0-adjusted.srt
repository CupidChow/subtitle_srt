00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Episode 56

3
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,220
You created the starlight ward

4
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,180
at the risk of losing your own life.

5
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,700
Dong Hua,

6
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,980
don't you have any compassion for me?

7
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,100
My compassion for you was the reason you escaped last time.

8
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,380
This time,

9
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,580
I will show you no mercy.

10
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,660
Today,

11
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,900
I will give you the satisfaction.

12
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,460
Great.

13
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,060
If you seal me in the starlight ward,

14
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,020
none of us is getting out.

15
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,780
You will go to hell with me.

16
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,940
Right.

17
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,700
Ice face can fight.

18
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,740
You took half of your heart out to make this ring for me.

19
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,780
His Majesty can't just die like that.

20
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,660
Chong Lin.

21
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,020
I want to see him.

22
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,620
Look. The stars are falling down.

23
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,980
I'm afraid it's too late.

24
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,860
No, it's not.

25
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,540
We're not destined to be together.

26
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,820
But that doesn't mean

27
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,300
we can't die together.

28
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,620
His Majesty's got to be fighting Miao Luo

29
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,340
somewhere.

30
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,700
Do you know

31
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,940
where they are now?

32
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,540
The stars are falling down to the Fanyin Valley.

33
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,900
So His Majesty's probably there.

34
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,780
You may get to see him alive

35
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,340
if you rush over now.

36
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,780
Your Majesty.

37
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,380
Your Majesty.

38
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,580
Dong Hua.

39
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,660
Are you really going to die with me here?

40
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,940
I've made myself clear about

41
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,500
why I'm here.

42
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,300
Don't ask me over and over again.

43
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,340
You are indeed fearless.

44
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,940
If my death is a price to pay

45
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,100
for the peace of the Eight Deserts and Six Directions,

46
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,340
it's worth it.

47
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,260
I didn't know you could be so ruthless with yourself.

48
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,740
I'm not ruthless.

49
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,900
It's you who has this overwhelming obsession.

50
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,980
Obsession?

51
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,140
I, the demon king, have no obsession.

52
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,740
Don't forget that

53
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,580
you were the one who made me a demon.

54
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,380
Chong Lin.

55
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,540
Are you alright?

56
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,700
The dark energy is too strong.

57
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,660
Even starlight ward

58
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,460
can't cleanse it.

59
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,420
Looks like His Majesty is determined to

60
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,820
fight Miao Luo on his own.

61
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,740
Lian Song.

62
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,660
Do something about it!

63
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,780
No one can enter the ward,

64
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,860
except His Majesty.

65
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Yan.

66
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,580
Yan Chiwu?

67
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,060
Why are you all wearing a sad expression?

68
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,660
It's true that we can't enter the starlight ward.

69
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,540
But ice face will come out eventually

70
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,940
when he defeats Miao Luo, right?

71
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,340
The stars are falling down already.

72
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,180
Don't you see it?

73
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,700
That means an immortal is dying.

74
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,620
You mean...

75
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,340
Ice face...

76
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,860
He's not getting out?

77
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,980
Your Majesty.

78
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,300
Your Majesty.

79
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,620
Your Majesty.

80
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,260
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

81
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,860
Fengjiu.

82
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,300
What are you doing, Ye Qingti?

83
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,140
I know you want to break in and help His Majesty.

84
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,980
But I can't just watch you die.

85
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,980
Let go of me.

86
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,260
Your Highness.

87
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,060
I'd rather be hated by you

88
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,020
than let you die for nothing.

89
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,780
Qingti.

90
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,700
Only the one who created the ward

91
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,460
is allowed to enter.

92
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,580
Others won't be able to get in.

93
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,700
Let go of me!

94
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,300
I don't know much about things in the immortal realm.

95
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,100
How could I know if you're lying or not?

96
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,140
Qingti.

97
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,300
His Majesty's life is at stake.

98
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
I won't do stupid things.

99
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,620
I just want to take a close look at him.

100
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,580
Let me go.

101
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,500
The stars are falling down nonstop.

102
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,540
Is any god dying?

103
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,740
Something's up.

104
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,460
What's going on?

105
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,620
Follow me.

106
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,100
Let me go!

107
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,340
Xiaojiu.

108
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
- Fengjiu. - Your Highness.

109
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,780
Fengjiu.

110
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,460
Your Highness.

111
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,180
Xiaojiu.

112
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,980
How did she get into the starlight ward?

113
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,340
It's because of the colored glaze ring.

114
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,220
That's half of His Majesty's heart.

115
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,940
With half of His Majesty's heart,

116
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,900
of course Fengjiu could get in easily.

117
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,260
I don't know if Her Highness is His Majesty's misfortune

118
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,860
or the other way around any more.

119
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,180
Xiaobai.

120
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,620
Xiaobai.

121
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,860
How could this happen?

122
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,580
How could this happen?

123
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,820
Xiaobai.

124
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,900
Blood from nine-tailed fox's heart can cleanse evil spirit.

125
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,100
Her cultivation has been weakened

126
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,060
after she was stained by my blood.

127
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,420
Dong Hua.

128
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,300
Even now,

129
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,340
you are still protecting the fox.

130
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,900
I want you to lose the love of your life forever

131
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,820
and experience the heartbreaking pain.

132
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,700
Xiaobai.

133
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,660
Stop the bleeding from your wound

134
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
and wait for me under the Lingshu Stage.

135
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,100
I will take you home soon.

136
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,740
You are lying again.

137
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,060
Look.

138
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,740
Blood from nine-tailed fox's heart can cleanse evil spirit.

139
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,300
But I couldn't have cleansed Miao Luo's evil spirit

140
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,460
so fast.

141
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,460
If you hadn't fed me with your golden blood

142
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,820
in the Dream of Aranya,

143
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,340
I couldn't have done that.

144
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,820
After you lied to me for so many times

145
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,180
and I got you wrong for so many times,

146
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,140
we are still together now.

147
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,180
Aren't we destined for each other?

148
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,620
Your Majesty.

149
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,260
Don't push me away every time.

150
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,340
You think you can kill me by doing that?

151
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,100
You still don't get it, do you?

152
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,700
You can't kill me by doing that!

153
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,260
What's wrong?

154
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,740
Do they win or lose?

155
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,500
There seems to be nothing going on.

156
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,020
Should we just wait it out?

157
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,860
Xiaojiu, wait for me.

158
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,140
I bet

159
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,420
I will break the ward

160
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,500
and get you out.

161
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,660
No.

162
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,580
The starlight ward is set for

163
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,820
eliminating all evil spirits.

164
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,780
If you break in while evil spirits are not eliminated,

165
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,060
everything in there will be destroyed.

166
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,700
Dark energy is so strong now.

167
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,220
Ice face has to fight against Miao Luo

168
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,540
while injured heavily.

169
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
He and Xiaojiu don't seem to have energy

170
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,220
for removing the dark energy.

171
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,540
What's wrong with me?

172
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,340
What's wrong with me?

173
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,540
What's wrong with me?

174
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,540
No.

175
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,140
Dong Hua, don't.

176
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,740
Don't make me disappear.

177
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,860
Dong Hua.

178
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,860
Seal me!

179
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,700
No, Dong Hua!

180
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,340
Dong Hua!

181
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,140
Dong Hua!

182
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,780
You are all immortals.

183
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,140
Can either one of you do something about it?

184
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,260
There's one way

185
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,020
that may work.

186
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,740
What is it?

187
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,860
When the ward is being broken,

188
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,460
if there's a strong force supporting from the outside,

189
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,940
the people inside may be saved.

190
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,140
You mean

191
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,700
we gather all our powers

192
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,460
to force the ward open

193
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,660
and then we let the ward destroy all dark energy

194
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,140
after we rescue them out?

195
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,340
No one has ever tried

196
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
this way before.

197
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,020
I don't know how it will turn out.

198
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,100
The condition is critical now.

199
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,940
As long as we can save ice face and Xiaojiu,

200
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,300
it's worth trying.

201
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,940
Third Prince, what do you think?

202
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,300
We don't seem

203
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,060
to have another choice.

204
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,220
Okay.

205
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,660
Everyone.

206
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,580
We will work together

207
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,260
to open the ward.

208
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,660
When the ward is open slightly,

209
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,500
God Zhe Yan,

210
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,860
you and I,

211
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
the longest living immortals here

212
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,340
should get in

213
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,020
and rescue them.

214
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,300
That's for the best.

215
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,580
Others will stay here

216
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,180
to keep the dark energy.

217
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,460
Let's get ready.

218
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,820
It must hurt a lot.

219
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
Xiaobai.

220
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,460
No.

221
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,180
I've worked so hard to finally see you.

222
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,900
It doesn't hurt at all.

223
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,180
You shouldn't be here.

224
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,220
You made starlight ward

225
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,220
to smash Miao Luo

226
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,020
and the Miaoyi Chasm, along with yourself.

227
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,900
Although I'm not so smart,

228
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,980
I've loved you for so long.

229
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,580
I know what you're thinking.

230
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,220
Tell me.

231
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,980
How can I get you out?

232
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,380
Why do you want to get me out?

233
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,380
Because I broke your heart?

234
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,580
But you broke my heart, too.

235
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Let's call it even,

236
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,060
okay?

237
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,140
I want to be by your side.

238
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,900
You want me to keep you company, right?

239
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,980
Yeah, you're right.

240
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,420
I did want you to come.

241
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,900
I've always wanted to take you along wherever I go.

242
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,860
Even when I'm going to die,

243
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,660
I don't want to part with you.

244
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,220
But I can't do that, Xiaobai.

245
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,260
You have a long way to go.

246
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,500
You don't want to take me along.

247
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,180
But I'm afraid I'll have to go before you.

248
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,780
Dong Hua.

249
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,740
It hurts.

250
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,900
Say something nice to me.

251
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,500
Cheer me up.

252
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,940
What do you want to hear?

253
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,100
Tell me that you like me.

254
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,700
I love you.

255
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,940
I love you, too.

256
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,580
Promise me that

257
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,860
you will hold my hands

258
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,620
when I'm about to die.

259
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,900
Wherever you go,

260
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,340
I want to be with you.

262

speak out these words.

349
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,300
I used to think that to love someone

350
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
is to give

351
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,580
and to become the person they like.

352
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,220

353
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,500
my love for him is all that matters.

354
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,060
Even if it's like a moth to a flame,

355
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,260
it's the best kind of love.

356
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,540
I didn't realize

357
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,020
until I lost you that

358
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,860
the best kind of love

359
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,820
is that I can remove all my camouflage

360
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,940
and be who I am.

361
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,340
I can be a kid if I want to.

362
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,740

363
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,380
without pretending.

364
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,700
I can act like a spoiled child if I want to.

365
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,100
I can get into a huff

366
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,100
if I want to.

367
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,780
Whenever I feel upset,

368
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,420
he will stretch out his arms for me

369
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,140
to lean on.

370
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,660
I didn't know that the best kind of love

371
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,260
has always been around me.

372
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,740
I didn't even know.

373
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,420
Yan, I'm sorry.

374
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,980
It took me so long to finally

375
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,140
realize how important you are to me.

376
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,220
The sweetest word in the world

377
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,900
is nothing poetic.

378
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,460
It's that I don't want to part with you

379
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,820
as long as you're by my side.

380
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,780
I want to be with you for the rest of my life, Yan.

381
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,260
Yan.

382
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,900
From now on,

383
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,340
I want to be the one who loves you.

384
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,500
What's wrong?

385
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,380
Why are you not talking?

386
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,620
Don't you like me now?

387
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,140
I...

388
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,700
No, no, no. I...

389
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,620
It's not like that. I...

390
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,260
Ji Heng.

391
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,220
Of course I like you.

392
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Loving you is the most important thing in my life.

393
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,460
I... I...

394
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,220
Jeez, you finally see me.

395
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,740
I'm... I'm more than happy.

396
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,500
I...

397
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,820
I finally did it!

398
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,100
You are finally in love with me!

399
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,180
Ji Heng.

400
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,700
Look at you.

401
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,300
Ji Heng.

402
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,180
You're not going to regret it, right?

403
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,020
I think... maybe...

404
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,940
maybe...

405
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,820
we should

406
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,020
go to the bedroom now.

407
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,100
Let go of me. Let go of me.

408
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,500
What are you talking about?

409
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm not going to the bedroom with you.

410
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,180
I'm kidding, girl.

411
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,380
Ji Heng.

412
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,460
I'm here with you.

413
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,020
From now on,

414
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,060
we will never part with each other.

415
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,300
You're working in Tai Chen Palace.

416
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,220
Have you noticed any beautiful new fairy maids

417
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,300
recently?

418
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,660
Good one.

419
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,540
You're getting to resemble Dong Hua.

420
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,340
Third Prince.

421
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,580
Demon Lord Yan, you're here again.

422
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,940
I'm passing by.

423
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,700
Third Prince, you're losing this one.

424
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,300
I was distracted.

425
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,580
So I made the wrong move.

426
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,340
Come on, Qingti.

427
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,300
Let's play one more round.

428
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
I have to go back to the Tai Chen Palace for my duty.

429
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,180
Sorry.

430
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,900
I'll get going.

431
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
I'll play it with you.

432
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,540
I thought you hate playing the game of go.

433
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
It's true.

434
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,380
But I haven't seen you for a while.

435
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,660
I miss you more than

436
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,140
I hate to play chess.

437
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,820
The starlight ward has already been broken.

438
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,980
And you've been stopping by Bihai Cangling

439
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,340
for the past three months.

440
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,340
You have nothing better to do in the demons, do you?

441
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,860
I lost my way, okay?

442
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,700
God Zhe Yan, you're right.

443
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,460
Fox clan of Qingqiu

444
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,500
is a treasure waiting to be dug up.

445
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,260
No one would have expected it, right?

446
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,940
As blood from nine-tailed fox's heart

447
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,300
and His Majesty's golden blood cleansed the dark energy,

448
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,380
the starlight ward was broken automatically.

449
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,860
With that,

450
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,540
Bihai Cangling was saved.

451
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,180
All have survived safe and sound.

452
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,980
Except Fengjiu.

453
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,460
I'm really worried about her.

454
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,780
She's still in a coma

455
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,300
with her spirit hurt.

456
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,900
Lord,

457
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,340
I'm not a quack.

458
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,060
Even if I was one,
Fengjiu would be blessed enough to be fine.

459
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,060
They all say she and His Majesty are not meant to be.

460
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
But what I think is that

461
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,180
Fengjiu and Dong Hua are a destined couple.

462
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,300
They're one in a million.

463
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,660
That's right.

464
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,500
They shouldn't have listened to the Fate Stone.

465
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
All they did was in vain.

466
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,700
They're supposed to be together.

467
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,660
The Fate Stone was so absurd.

468
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,020
If it were me,

469
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,060
I would be mad enough

470
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
to crack it open.

471
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,420
Third Prince, you've really got some balls.

472
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,860
Well, yeah.

473
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,540
Who was the one being so sacrificial

474
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,420
and dragging God Zhe Yan

475
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,500
into entering the ward

476
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,500
that day?

477
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,260
Fengjiu was obviously more useful.

478
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,820
The one and only nine-tailed red fox in the universe

479
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,660
should be so powerful!

480
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,380
She's indeed my friend.

481
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,780
Idiot.

482
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Hey, mind your tongue.

483
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,540
Who's the kid?

484
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,540
You can tell that.

485
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,260
from his hair color,

486
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,140
He's Dong Hua's child?

487
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,460
What is Dong Hua?

488
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,100
Is it a place?

489
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,900
I'm my mother's son.

490
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,220
Uncle Xie Guchou, where's my mother?

491
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
Your mother is hurt.

492
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
But she will wake up after a few months of rest.

493
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,700
She used to compliment you a lot.

494
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,100
That you are calm and responsible for your age.

495
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,980
Let me see

496
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,900
if you're really responsible.

497
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,060
Go in there.

498
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,340
The smell of medicine is so strong.

499
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,300
Mother.

500
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,300
Mother. Mother.

501
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,820
Who are you?

502
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,980
I'm Bai Gungun.

503
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,300
Who's

504
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,580
Bai Gungun?

505
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,900
My mother's son.

506
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,300
Is it so surprising

507
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,020
for you?

508
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,060
You even dropped the bowl.

509
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,580
Uncle, you're so good-looking.

510
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,100
Who are you?

511
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,340
Gungun.

512
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,540
I'm your father.

513
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,300
Mother, father, you are kissing again.

514
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,180
I want a kiss, too.

515
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,500
The journey of life is so long.

516
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,380
Fate can't decide my life.

517
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,620
I, Bai Fengjiu, will bring Emperor Dong Hua

518
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,580
into my life no matter what.

519
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,900
Because

520
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,180
I love you the most.

521
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,060
For the three eternities,

522
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,540
you little fox

523
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,380
are bound to be mine.

524
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,020
In every eternity,

525
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,380
Dong Hua belongs to Fengjiu.

526
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,740
Both of you are mine.
