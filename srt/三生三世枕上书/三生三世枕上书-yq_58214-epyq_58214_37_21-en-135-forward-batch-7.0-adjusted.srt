00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,340
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Episode 21

3
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,420
Song Xuanren,

4
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,860
the whole secret chamber hasn't another way out.

5
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,740
You can't escape from here.

6
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,540
Let's have a quick fight to decide the winner.

7
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,580
If I kill you in person,

8
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,820
we won't owe each other anything.

9
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,700
We don't have to fight

10
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,140
any more in the rest of life.

11
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,300
It's you again

12
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,420
who disturb my business over and over.

13
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Xiaojiu.

14
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,420
Your Majesty,

15
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,100
the knife he's holding is a demon knife.

16
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,500
Who on earth are you, a human being or a demon?

17
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,620
It'll be fine that

18
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,620
you protect him this hard.

19
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,060
I'll make you accompany him to death.

20
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,020
Kill them both.

21
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,860
Ye Qingti.

22
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,380
Your Majesty, you go first.

23
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,300
Go with me.

24
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,180
Quick.

25
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,140
Quick.

26
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,140
Run.

27
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,980
Quick.

28
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,980
Run.

29
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,180
Qingti.

30
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,220
Don't.

31
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,060
Let's go.

32
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,260
Don't.

33
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,100
Qingti.

34
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,780
Let's go.

35
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
Qingti.

36
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,700
Go.

37
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,340
Qingti.

38
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,740
Qingti.

39
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,340
Qingti.

40
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Qingti.

41
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,260
Don't.

42
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,460
Qingti.

43
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,860
Don't.

44
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,340
Don't.

45
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,660
Xiaojiu.

46
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,700
Xiaojiu.

47
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,140
Xiaojiu.

48
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,100
Don't scare me, Xiaojiu.

49
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,300
Xiaojiu.

50
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,740
Xiaojiu.

51
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,180
What's on earth is happening?

52
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,740
The emperor of the State of Chengyu appeared in a sudden.

53
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,060
But

54
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,700
he is Emperor Dong Hua.

55
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,260
Dong Hua?

56
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
Have you seen him clearly?

57
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,060
Absolutely clearly.

58
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,780
Dong Hua goes to the mortal realm?

59
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,620
For soul-locking jade?

60
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,660
Your Highness,

61
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,660
what should we do now?

62
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,060
Go back to the State of Chong'an first.

63
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,420
We'll talk about others later.

64
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,100
Yes.

65
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,700
How is she?

66
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,020
The pulse of Madam Jiu is gentle,

67
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
but her wound is strange.

68
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,860
Her wound is deep,

69
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,420
but she's not bleeding.

70
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,700
And the wound isn't healing.

71
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,780
When can she wake up?

72
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,740
Report to Your Majesty.

73
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,300
Madam Jiu might have a heart disease.

74
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,500
When she can wake up

75
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,620
may...

76
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,380
may depend on her fortune.

77
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm going to prescribe some medicines
for invigorating heart first.

78
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,340
All of you withdraw.

79
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,460
Yes.

80
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,140
Xiaojiu,

81
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,020
I always think you don't care about me,

82
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,940
but this time,

83
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,540
you've saved my life
without concerning about your own safety again.

84
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,620
I knew yesterday

85
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,820
that you're not a mortal.

86
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,740
Then where do you come from?

87
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,460
Are you an immortal in heaven?

88
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,700
Please answer me.

89
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,460
I want to accompany you

90
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,940
instead of going anywhere.

91
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,340
I want

92
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,140
us to forget everything that has happened.

93
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,820
I want a fresh start.

94
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,140
Withdraw.

95
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,180
- Yes. - Yes.

96
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,900
I'll hold an elaborate funeral for my elder brother.

97
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,060
Rest assured, mother.

98
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,780
Don't bury him.

99
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,220
Don't bury him.

100
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,420
Mother.

101
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,060
I'm so sad.

102
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,940
I even hate myself

103
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,180
for not disciplining your elder brother.

104
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,700
Mother.

105
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,940
I try that hard to raise you two up.

106
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,860
What worries me the most

107
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,700
is that you two may engage in a fratricidal struggle on some day.

108
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,460
The day has finally come,

109
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,820
and it has also led to a catastrophe.

110
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,700
So many innocent people were killed,

111
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,780
and our State of Chengyu has been harshly weakened.

112
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,540
Song Xuanying,

113
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,900
he's not my son,

114
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,740
but the sinner of the entire dynasty.

115
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,300
Mother.

116
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,300
He doesn't deserve a funeral.

117
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,100
Let him decay in the underground palace.

118
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Xuanren,

119
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:55,180
the whole State of Chengyu will count on you alone.

120
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,820
I know it'll be hard,

121
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,380
but you have to take the responsibility,
no matter how hard it will be.

122
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,580
We can't let the State of Chengyu fall down in our generation.

123
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,900
I get it.

124
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,100
Rest assured, mother.

125
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,820
Thanks to

126
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,940
Madam Jiu

127
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,380
and Ye Qingti this time.

128
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,860
Ye Qingti sacrificed himself for you.

129
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,660
It's enough.

130
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,180
Don't hate him anymore.

131
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,260
As for Bai Xiaojiu.

132
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,700
Let it go.

133
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,660
Your affection for her

134
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,220
and her worship for you

135
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,260
are what I haven't expected.

136
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,540
She has saved you again.

137
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,460
I've figured it out.

138
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,340
Later,

139
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,060
regardless of you allowing her to go back where she comes from,

140
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,660
or be a Madam continuously,

141
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,140
or even the empress,

142
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,060
I won't stop you.

143
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,100
Mother.

144
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,740
Ren'er,

145
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,700
what a man

146
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,740
should do in his entire life is learn to endure.

147
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
It's impossible

148
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,940
to let oneself enjoy the time

149
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
while make other people satisfied.

150
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,660
There're too many things.

151
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,140
There's too much sorrow.

152
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,700
What we can do is endure.

153
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:07,060
Maybe it's the grief of being an imperial member.

154
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
Mother,

155
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,420
lie down to have a rest.

156
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,100
Qingti.

157
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,580
Don't hide yourself, Qingti.

158
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,660
Ye Qingti,

159
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,580
is it you?

160
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,100
Qingti.

161
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Qingti.

162
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,820
Qingti,

163
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,940
you died because of me.

164
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,820
In the three realms,

165
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,180
where on earth are you?

166
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,260
Where on earth are you?

167
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,140
What's up?

168
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,620
What are you hiding?

169
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,740
Nothing.

170
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,660
Just a little something

171
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,140
I wanted to give you.

172
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,500
But I haven't got the chance.

173
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,220
You can't take back what you sent out.

174
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,380
Take it.

175
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,180
It's beautiful.

176
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,940
Really?

177
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,540
I thought you got tired of the delicate articles in the palace,

178
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,980
and don't fancy something like it.

179
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,100
No, it's not true.

180
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,020
Does it look nice?

181
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,900
You like it?

182
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm glad you like it.

183
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,340
Do you regret it?

184
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,300
No.

185
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,220
I just feel sorry

186
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,780
to drag you into this.

187
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,220
No need to be so polite to me.

188
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,820
Run.

189
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,380
Qingti.

190
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,300
Qingti,

191
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,100
you lost your life

192
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,620
because of my stubbornness.

193
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,140
Now that I can't make up for you now,

194
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,500
I can observe three years of mourning for you.

195
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,500
Your Highness, you wake up.

196
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,580
Call someone

197
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
to report to His Majesty that

198
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,300
Her Highness has woken up.

199
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,420
Yes.

200
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,620
Your Highness,

201
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,420
you've scared me so much.

202
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,900
You finally wake up.

203
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,260
Your Highness,

204
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,220
what do you wear on your head?

205
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,260
What time is it?

206
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,940
It's past 11 o'clock at night.

207
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,660
Your Highness, where are you going?

208
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,580
I want to take a walk.

209
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,180
Wait for me, Your Highness.

210
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,780
Allow me to accompany you.

211
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,860
Muyun,

212
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,460
leave me alone.

213
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
Cheng Yu,

214
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,940
Ye Qingti is dead.

215
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,580
I've never expected that there would be someone

216
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,700
who's willing to die for me.

217
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,820
I owe him a life.

218
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,460
Dying for you

219
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,180
perhaps is his destiny.

220
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,820
What else can I do?

221
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,500
How can I requite him?

222
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,140
Human being is originally different from the immortal.

223
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,540
There's nothing you can do

224
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,380
but wait for the next opportunity.

225
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,220
Perhaps

226
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,900
you'll meet each other again.

227
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,580
You have to take good care of yourself
no matter how deep sorrow you are in.

228
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,940
The powder can heal a wound cut by a demon knife.

229
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,740
Keep it well.

230
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,380
Apply it on time.

231
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,260
Don't follow me.

232
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,700
Yes.

233
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,580
Go back with me.

234
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,060
Why do I have to go back?

235
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm fine here.

236
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,340
I want to admire the moon here alone.

237
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,420
I don't want to go back.

238
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,100
Fine. I'll accompany you.

239
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,300
Are you willing to remain my empress?

240
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,900
Everything has come to an end.

241
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,660
Let's have a fresh start, shall we?

242
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,100
If you don't prefer the constrictions,

243
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,580
I'll do whatever you wish,

244
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,860
just the same as we used to do.

245
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,260
What do you think?

246
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,860
Quick. Report to His Majesty.

247
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,500
Her Highness has gone again.

248
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,260
What?

249
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,220
Hurry up.

250
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,220
Have you found her?

251
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,340
We have searched everywhere,

252
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,140
but there's no trace of her in the imperial palace.

253
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,340
Report.

254
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,820
Your Majesty, there comes the news.

255
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,180
The guard at the Jiangyu Gate reported that

256
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,500
Madam Jiu rode outside the palace
towards the west early in the morning.

257
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,380
Prepare a horse.

258
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,500
Hurry up. Prepare a horse.

259
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,140
Yes.

260
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,300
Qingti,

261
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,700
it's me who get you involved in trouble this life.

262
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,220
It's all my fault.

263
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,780
It's all because I cling to the happiness in the mortal realm.

264
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,980
I cling to the affection of His Majesty.

265
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,740
And I fail to end everything soon.

266
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,620
It's all my fault.

267
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
Xiaojiu.

268
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,660
Don't come here.

269
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,540
Sure.

270
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,140
As you wish.

271
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,460
Don't stand there.

272
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,940
It's too dangerous.

273
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,020
Come here.

274
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,780
Come.

275
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,460
Your Majesty,

276
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,460
you've been asking me for

277
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,140
who is the one in my heart, haven't you?

278
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,300
The one I put in my heart

279
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,060
is Ye Qingti.

280
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,980
I don't believe what you're saying.

281
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,260
You must be lying to me.

282
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,260
I have asked Ye Qingti.

283
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,820
You don't love him at all.

284
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,740
If you do love him,

285
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,940
why do you save me over and over?

286
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,220
Come here.

287
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,140
We can have a talk.

288
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,860
Since I came to the imperial palace,

289
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,900
being an Imperial Lady,

290
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,260
a Madam,

291
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,900
even an empress

292
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,180
hasn't made me happy.

293
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Because the one I love isn't you.

294
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,300
Fine. Fine. Fine.

295
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,500
It's fine.

296
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,980
Even though

297
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,300
the one you loved earlier is him,

298
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,500
he has already died now.

299
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,100
Let's start with a clean slate, shall we?

300
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,900
Why...

301
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,980
why don't you accept me, even though he has died?

302
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,860
Do I mean

303
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,140
nothing to you in your heart?

304
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,860
Fine.

305
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,580
I'll do what you wish.

306
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,180
I won't force you.

307
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,740
I'll let you go.

308
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,980
Let you leave the imperial palace.

309
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,380
Let you have the life you want, will you?

310
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,220
Xiaojiu,

311
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,020
come here.

312
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,980
Come here.

313
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,820
Your Majesty,

314
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,740
I once expected that

315
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,980
I would be in my deepest sorrow
when I loved you without your response.

316
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,700
But now I find that

317
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,740
the sorrow that you fall for me without my response

318
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,100
will overwhelm me.

319
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,420
Your Majesty,

320
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,060
I'm sorry for

321
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,700
not responding to your love.

322
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,180
It's not only your misfortune,

323
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,620
but also mine.

324
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,460
Xiaojiu.

325
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,620
Your Majesty,

326
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,580
goodbye.

327
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,740
Don't.

328
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,940
Your Majesty.

329
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,220
Xiaojiu.

330
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,860
Your Majesty.

331
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,580
Your Majesty.

332
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,420
Your Majesty.

333
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,420
Your Majesty.

334
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,580
No.

335
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,180
No.

336
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,900
Xiaojiu.

337
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,540
Xiaojiu.

338
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,820
Xiaojiu, wait for me.

339
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,020
Wait for me.

340
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,140
Isn't anything wrong with His Majesty, is it?

341
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,140
Your Excellency,

342
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,700
the disease His Majesty got doesn't matter.

343
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
But...

344
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,900
but His Majesty is heart-broken,

345
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,660
and has no will to live,

346
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,180
which matters the most.

347
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,060
It's...

348
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,460
You must have some methods to bring Ye Qingti back to life,

349
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,100
mustn't you?

350
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,860
Ye Qingti is killed by a demon knife,

351
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,180
and has been penetrated by the vicious demon spirit.

352
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,180
Even if he had an opportunity to resurrect,

353
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,660
he would only be a vicious demon,

354
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,460
experiencing generations of miserable cycle.

355
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,980
Isn't there any way to help him out?

356
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,620
The only way to make it up is

357
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,260
to create another immortal body

358
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,020
to neutralize the demon spirit.

359
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,540
And then clear up what he owns as a human being
in the Ninth Heaven Jade Pool

360
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,020
to make him an immortal.

361
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Being an immortal?

362
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,740
Wouldn't that be better than going back to the mortal realm?

363
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,220
Then I'll be able to see Qingti

364
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,620
in the Sky Kingdom.

365
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,620
But it'll be hard during the process.

366
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,660
Think about it.

367
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,340
How hard will it be
to make an ordinary person become an immortal?

368
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
How can it be possible

369
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,820
to create an immortal body so easily?

370
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,460
How can an immortal body be created?

371
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,260
There is a kind of tree named pimpon,

372
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,460
which blossoms once every ten years

373
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,700
and bears fruits once every ten years.

374
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,580
According to the age of the tree,

375
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,740
the fruits can have different uses.

376
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,540
Fruits of certain age

377
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,660
can not only make a mortal back to life,

378
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,580
but can also turn a mortal into an immortal.

379
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,020
What a magical fruit it is!

380
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,860
Then where can I find a pimpon tree?

381
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,940
In Sukhavati,

382
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,380
over the Sky Kingdom.

383
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,020
There are also several places where pimpon trees can be found,

384
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,500
but unluckily,

385
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,780
pimpon trees among the Heaven and the Earth

386
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,020
haven't borne any fruit

387
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,820
since the recent thousands of years.

388
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,380
However, these pimpon trees don't die away,

389
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,300
they have been growing.

390
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,500
Maybe they can bear some fruits

391
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,300
in a short while.

392
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,220
Wait for the opportunity.

393
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,020
You will have to wait for the opportunity

394
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,740
that can make a mortal become an immortal.

395
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,140
I can help you

396
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,700
to put Ye Qing in the Yuanqi Terrace first,

397
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,260
letting him absorb some energy.

398
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,380
I can keep him in safety temporarily,

399
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,300
which can buy you more time.

400
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,100
Your Majesty.

401
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,380
Ren'er,

402
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,740
why do you look so withered?

403
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,580
Mother.

404
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,340
Ren'er,

405
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,820
you are the emperor of the State of Chengyu.

406
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,100
You can't give up on yourself to this extent.

407
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,300
If you keep acting like this,

408
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,940
what should civil and military officials

409
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,100
and all citizens

410
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,860
of our state do?

411
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,740
Do you forget what late Emperor has taught you?

412
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,540
How can you abandon the responsibility for

413
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,180
inheriting the achievements and merits made by forebears

414
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,220
just because of a woman?

415
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,700
Ren'er,

416
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:20,220
I've already lost one child.

417
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,260
I can't endure to

418
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,460
lose you anymore.

419
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,540
Ren'er.

420
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,220
I'm not a filial son.

421
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,380
Mother, please choose another to be the emperor.

422
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,660
Make it brighter.

423
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,260
Your Majesty,

424
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,980
all the candles have been lit.

425
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,980
Make it brighter,

426
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,780
then I can see Xiaojiu's face clearly.

427
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,860
