00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,004
IN THE SOOP: FRIENDCATION

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,775
(theme music)

3
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,963
IN THE SOOP: FRIENDCATION

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,965
-(upbeat music)
-WOOSHIK: Oh.

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,967
(Hyungsik groans)

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,969
-(Wooshik groans)
-(Hyungsik laughs)

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,271
-(all greeting)
-SEOJUN: Wait, I'm the last one.

8
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,539
HYUNGSIK: Yo, yo.

9
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,440
PEAKBOY

10
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,509
SEOJUN: Why is this happening?
How did it come to this?

11
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,078
This is a class.
It's about to start right now, right?

12
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,080
"Yeah, let's do it somewhere."
That's one thing to do.

13
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,515
(laughter)

14
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,350
You'll look really pathetic. Is that okay?

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,684
Can we destroy him?

16
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,853
Destroy him?
(laughter)

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,189
-It's so crazy.
-(laughter)

18
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,357
(murmurs quietly)

19
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,458
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME!

20
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,226
-SEOJUN: <i>Okay, okay. Here we go!</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>Okay!</i>

21
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,428
V: <i>Okay!</i>

22
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,296
SEOJUN: <i>Let's just go!</i>

23
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,799
Good one.

24
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,934
-(laughing)
-PEAKBOY: I'm just working out.

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,135
(laughing continues)

26
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,303
V: <i>I think it's here.</i>

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,605
-PEAKBOY: <i>Whoa! Ooh!</i>
-(V laughing)

28
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,873
-Is this right?
-Whoa!

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,075
This place is so nice.

30
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,210
-This place is really nice.
-It's not bad.

31
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,812
PEAKBOY: Do you want to dream or sleep?

32
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,313
-(Seojun sighs)
-(V chuckles)

33
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,348
AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE
AT THEIR COZY ACCOMMODATION

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,787
THEY FALL INTO A NAP

35
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,622
SEOJUN: Let's write our names here.

36
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,891
V: Let's write nicknames.

37
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,626
-Okay.
-(chuckles)

38
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,295
-SEOJUN: "World", "World Star".
-PEAKBOY: "World Star".

39
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,262
PEAKBOY: Clown.

40
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,564
(chuckles)

41
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,366
(laughing)

42
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,736
AND EVEN EAT DINNER COOKED BY SEOJUN

43
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,406
A guy that cooks steak...

44
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,274
I like it.

45
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,144
PEAKBOY: Thanks for the meal.

46
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,879
-V: Thanks for the meal.
-SEOJUN: Thanks for the meal.

47
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,181
-V: It's so delicious.
-PEAKBOY: Yes, it's so delicious.

48
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,117
AFTER THE SATISFYING DINNER

49
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,818
(rattling)

50
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:03,156
THEY PLAY GAMES
EVEN BEFORE THEY DIGEST THE FOOD

51
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,558
-(slaps)
-(laughter)

52
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,095
WHILE THEY COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING,

53
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,998
PEAKBOY: <i>How could you slap me?</i>

54
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,167
<i>V, I can't see anything now.</i>

55
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,103
(distant whistling)

56
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,506
-I think someone is here.
-Someone's here?

57
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,345
-WOOSHIK: Hello.
-PEAKBOY: Wooshik's here.

58
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,913
Go and change, Wooshik.

59
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,950
Why did you bring two suitcases?

60
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,185
WOOSHIK: I brought three.

61
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,087
-V: Are you emigrating?
-(Peakboy chuckles)

62
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,455
WOOSHIK: You never know.

63
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,091
-It's because he's the rom-com king.
-That's the rom-com king.

64
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,559
Since he's a world star.

65
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,628
V: Come with me.

66
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,130
WOOSHIK (chuckles):
Where are you going?

67
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,232
Let me show you our room.

68
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,300
V SHOWS HIM AROUND

69
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,434
Right here.

70
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,706
This is our luggage room.

71
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,874
(Wooshik groans)

72
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,709
V: You can leave your suitcases here.

73
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,845
Do you need to bring anything? Tell me.

74
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,616
I'm kind of lost right now.
What do I have to bring?

75
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,817
Come over here.

76
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,987
BEFORE WOOSHIK CATCHES A BREATH,
V TAKES HIM TO THE NEXT ROOM

77
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,058
-PEAKBOY: Did he change?
-V: No, he's going to change now.

78
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,360
-You want me to change?
-This is our team uniform.

79
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,162
What's up with "Giant?"

80
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,731
Seojun's shirt says "Clown."

81
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,933
(chuckles)

82
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,167
This is yours.

83
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,169
-You'll be comfortable in it.
-How cute.

84
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,372
-Okay. Change into this right now.
-It's yours.

85
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,840
CHANGE INTO THE UNIFORM NOW

86
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:28,975
-Now.
-Hurry and change.

87
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,411
(laughter)

88
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,813
Hey.

89
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,849
Hurry up and change.

90
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,553
Oh, yeah, we forgot this. V!

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,455
-V: Yes? What?
-Give Wooshik this.

92
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,592
-Put this on too.
-We have to wear matching socks too?

93
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,194
What if people get the wrong idea?

94
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,496
THEY ARE CLAD IN FRIENDSHIP ITEMS
FROM HEAD TO TOE

95
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,298
-SEOJUN: Hurry up and change.
-PEAKBOY: Yeah.

96
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,133
-SEOJUN: The food is getting cold.
-PEAKBOY: It's getting cold.

97
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,270
-Do we have to wear matching socks too?
-Hurry up.

98
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,138
You have to take this off.

99
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,840
HE'S WEARING A SHIRT UNDER HIS SWEATSHIRT

100
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,308
Hey.
(laughs)

101
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,010
Are you the rom-com king or what?

102
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,813
What? Call me "Dandy Boy."

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,215
You really do look dandy today.

104
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,118
PEAKBOY: We should write this first.

105
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,519
We have to write it now.

106
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,088
Write it now. Hey, Wooshik.

107
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,222
-Sit.
-Sit here.

108
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,357
Sit here.

109
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,758
Stop pushing me!

110
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,460
-Sit down already.
-Just sit.

111
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,996
-Nice.
-Were you born in 1990?

112
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,498
I just got here
and you're writing on my back...

113
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,066
WHAT IS THIS AS SOON AS I GOT HERE...

114
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,470
Hey, your nickname is really nice.

115
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,871
Yours is really nice.

116
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,273
Mine is "Clown".

117
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,907
-Mine is "Giant".
-Turn around.

118
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,509
What are you doing?

119
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,546
-It's a ritual.
-Hang on. A ritual?

120
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,848
(chuckles)

121
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:42,982
"Choi."

122
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,518
-"Woo."
-You know my name, right?

123
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,487
-"Shik."
-What does yours say? "Park Seojun."

124
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,988
Done.

125
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,425
-Am I "Rom-com King?"
-Yes, you are. Eat.

126
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,660
Can I eat now?

127
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,194
PEAKBOY: Eat up, Wooshik.

128
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,195
THE ROWDY RITUAL IS OVER

129
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,430
PEAKBOY: Thanks for the food.

130
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,801
A MIDNIGHT SNACK FOR THE THREE
AND A LATE DINNER FOR WOOSHIK

131
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,869
Oh!

132
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,072
-Who made this?
-Seojun did.

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,774
-For real?
-Yeah.

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,741
Wow.

135
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,909
It's instant food.

136
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,011
THE FAMILIAR TASTE OF INSTANT FOOD

137
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,013
I knew it tasted familiar.

138
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,185
WOOSHIK: You know,
this is what I was thinking.

139
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,355
For a nighttime snack,
let's take a whole chicken...

140
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,059
-And grill it? The whole thing?
-Yeah.

141
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,661
WOOSHIK: After we finish the barbecue,
let's have that as a snack.

142
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,631
You can't have that
unless you're out somewhere like this.

143
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,467
Is it the kind of barbecue grill
with a lid?

144
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,336
-Well. I'm not sure.
-I don't know.

145
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,403
The smoking one?

146
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,014
-You're eating as if it's your first time.
-I know.

147
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,283
-It's so good.
-Didn't you make this for me?

148
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,519
-This is so good.
-There's more.

149
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,925
You know, while Seojun and I were
shooting <i>Summer Vacation</i>,

150
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,095
-we video called V.
-Yeah.

151
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:06,265
That's when we said we should go
to Goseong together and eat raw fish.

152
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,868
When we talked about that back then,

153
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,538
-I didn't think it would become a reality.
-Right.

154
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,407
You too. You know we talked together.

155
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,175
-We wanted to go with you too.
-It'd be fun.

156
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,345
This place is awesome.

157
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,314
-Aren't the trees gorgeous?
-Yeah.

158
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,983
WOOSHIK: <i>It must be amazing here
in the morning.</i>

159
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,284
SETTLING INTO THEIR FIRST NIGHT

<i>♪ Our emotions ♪</i>

<i>♪ Can't never redefine me ♪</i>

162

EPISODE 2. LETTING LOOSE

164
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,701
THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR TRIP

165
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,570
WHILE EVERYONE IS ASLEEP,

166
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,976
SOMEONE ARRIVES

167
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,445
WOOSHIK: <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

168
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,181
-<i>Is it you, Hyungsik?</i>
-HYUNGSIK: <i>You're a light sleeper.</i>

169
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,251
WOOSHIK: <i>I missed you.</i>

170
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,819
(Wooshik yawns)

171
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,155
-<i>Aren't you hungry?</i>
-HYUNGSIK: <i>I am.</i>

172
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,590
WOOSHIK: <i>Are you?
Do you want to get something to eat?</i>

173
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,925
-HYUNGSIK: <i>Just the two of us?</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>Yeah.</i>

174
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,326
<i>Let's get something to eat.</i>

175
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,798
-Let's get steamed buns.
-Steamed buns?

176
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,669
(Wooshik groans)

177
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,772
I want that one.

178
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,242
It's hot.

179
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,044
THEY BOTH GET A STEAMED BUN

180
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,112
Let's go.

181
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,715
Let's sit here and eat.

182
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,752
Okay. Let's eat here.

183
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,820
(laughter)

184
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,189
-HYUNGSIK: It's good.
-Yeah.

185
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,398
-You know...
-Yeah.

186
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,133
Last night,

187
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:52,138
we talked about something
while having a drink.

188
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,342
That it's hard to believe
that we're actually here, including you.

189
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,044
HE CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER

190
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,517
It's so nice here.
We're completely within nature.

191
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,818
(sniffs)

192
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,521
It looked so amazing here in the evening.

193
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,958
HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SEE THIS SCENERY LAST NIGHT

194
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,793
HYUNGSIK: <i>It really did snow here.</i>

195
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,232
(smacks lips)
We get to eat warm steamed buns outside.

196
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,600
(clicks tongue)

197
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,435
It's hard to come by.

198
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,870
(chuckles)

199
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,979
HE LEAVES OUT THE RED BEANS

200
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,984
Gosh. You're so odd.

201
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,252
Usually, it's the opposite.

202
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,653
Really? I mean--

203
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,623
Usually, people eat the red beans
and then throw away the bread.

204
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,491
There was too much red bean
compared to bread.

205
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,094
-(laughing)
-It broke the balance in my mouth.

206
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,529
HE'S PARTICULAR ABOUT STEAMED BUNS

207
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,064
Hm.

208
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,734
Then let's chill out here
for a little longer.

209
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,035
AS THEY FINISH THEIR BREAKFAST,

210
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,870
(rooster crowing)

211
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,338
A ROOSTER CROWS IN THE DISTANCE

212
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,973
-It's time to wake up.
-It is.

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,509
It's crowing pretty late, isn't it?

214
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,378
-It slept in.
-It slept in.

215
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,613
It crowed at ten o'clock.

216
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,116
-It slept in. Is it ten o'clock?
-Yeah.

217
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,051
-We should wake them up.
-I know.

218
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,122
-We can all wash up and get ready.
-Yeah.

219
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,424
-If they're hungry, we'll eat some more.
-Okay.

220
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,427
(rooster crowing)

221
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,129
(Wooshik sucks teeth)

222
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,331
HYUNGSIK:
The rooster is crowing after all.

223
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,501
It's so nice here!

224
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,403
(laughter)

225
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,638
-Hyungsik, you're here.
-HYUNGSIK: Seojun!

226
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,740
(Hyungsik laughs)

227
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,108
Let me hug you.

228
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,377
(Hyungsik laughing)

229
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,913
(laughter)

230
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,516
V WAKES UP BECAUSE OF THE RUCKUS

231
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,785
(groans, clears throat)

232
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,556
-Ah...
-(V groans)

233
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,124
-Did you sleep well?
-Yeah.

234
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,993
HE GREETS HYUNGSIK WHILE HALF ASLEEP

235
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,730
Actually, I want to sleep
about five to ten more minutes.

236
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,864
-Sleep.
-Sleep.

237
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,300
You can sleep another hour.

238
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,604
V JOINS SEOJUN AND WOOSHIK'S BED

239
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,772
-Then, I'll sleep in that room.
-No, come over here.

240
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,407
I haven't seen you in ages.

241
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,842
How can the four of us lie here?

242
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,644
We can do it.

243
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,778
We can?

244
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,247
(all grunting)

245
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,849
Jeez.

246
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,251
-All right.
-What in the world are you doing?

247
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,286
(laughter)

248
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,255
-This is nice.
-Yeah, this is how it should be.

249
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,024
(all mumble, laugh)

250
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,826
Stop doing that.

251
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,928
(laughter)

252
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,529
(indistinct chatter)

253
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,466
-Where is Pinkboy?
-Pinkboy?

254
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,936
-WOOSHIK: Pinkboy?
-(laughter)

255
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,537
PINKBOY IS IN DEEP SLEEP

256
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,643
-What the heck?
-Come on. This isn't right.

257
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,077
THE TWO END UP GETTING UP

258
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,212
Guys.

259
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,748
Are you leaving in the end?

260
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,518
This is how you conquer lands.

261
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,156
WOOSHIK: <i>Let's sleep just one more hour.</i>

262
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,494
(soothing instrumental music)

263
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,510
THEY ALL GO BACK TO BED TO SLEEP IN

264
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,249
SEOJUN WAKES UP FIRST

265
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,352
HE HEADS TO THE KITCHEN TO MAKE BREAKFAST

266
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,520
(yawns)

267
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,424
BREAKFAST IS DUMPLING TTEOKGUK

268
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,193
HE TRIES MAKING EGG GARNISH

269
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,262
SEOJUN: No need to be perfect.

270
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,198
It's too much though.

271
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,934
(scraping)

272
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,136
HE IS STARTLED BY
HOW THICK THE EGG WHITE GARNISH IS

273
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,404
It's ruined.

274
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,509
THE EGG WHITE GARNISH TORE A LITTLE

275
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,213
HE TRIES TO MAKE THE EGG YOLK GARNISH

276
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,483
HE SUCCEEDS WITHOUT A HITCH

277
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,155
WHILE SEOJUN IS COOKING

278
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,927
THE FRIENDS ARE STILL SLEEPING

279
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,563
HE QUICKLY COOKS IN THE MEANTIME

280
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:19,638
AFTER IT BOILS,
THE DUMPLING TTEOKGUK WILL BE DONE

281
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:26,145
PEAKBOY WAKES UP

282
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,113
(exhales)

283
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,949
PEAKBOY: V.

284
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,252
V, something's wrong.

285
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,123
-What is it?
-Hurry. Something's wrong.

286
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,425
-Come on out.
-It's a big mess.

287
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,026
-I don't know.
-Come out.

288
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,628
-Something's wrong.
-What?

289
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,929
Hurry.

290
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:44,964
Come out already.

291
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,534
-He'll go back to sleep.
-No, I won't.

292
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,836
-Wake up right now.
-Let's go together right now.

293
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,771
Get up.

294
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,405
What's up with your hair?

295
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,108
Get up.

296
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,543
Hurry.

297
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,446
THEY SUCCEED IN WAKING V UP

298
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,249
THEY HEAD OVER TO WAKE UP
WOOSHIK AND HYUNGSIK

299
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,020
Come out.

300
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,724
-Come out.
-Hi, there.

301
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,926
-Hurry.
-(laughs)

302
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:14,994
Hurry.

303
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,662
Hurry up.

304
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,365
MEANWHILE, THE DUMPLING TTEOKGUK
IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE

305
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,699
Whoa.

306
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,301
No!

307
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,272
THEY GATHER AT SEOJUN RESTAURANT

308
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,973
-Hey.
-Jeez.

309
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,542
(laughs)

310
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,244
WOOSHIK: Hey.

311
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,980
When did you make all of this?

312
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,382
My goodness.

313
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,450
My goodness.

314
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,291
HYUNGSIK: Gosh, did you make
the egg garnish?

315
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,027
-You're awesome.
-I picked it up from somewhere.

316
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,497
THE DUMPLING TTEOKGUK
THAT SEOJUN MADE FOR HIS FRIENDS

317
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,267
-Let's eat.
-Gosh, this is amazing, Seojun.

318
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
When did you get up and make this?

319
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,737
Gosh.

320
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,506
HYUNGSIK: Thank you for the food.

321
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,408
PEAKBOY (sucks teeth): Gosh.

322
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,212
SEOJUN AND HIS FRIENDS ALL ENJOY THE FOOD

323
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,646
(slurps)

324
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,615
HYUNGSIK: Of course, it's good.

325
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,718
We haven't had <i>tteokguk</i> yet

326
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,954
-since New Year.
-We didn't.

327
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,723
-I had it twice.
-You aged two more years.

328
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,525
-You're 37.
-You're 37, then.

329
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,927
I didn't eat it
because I didn't want to age.

330
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,462
It's my first time this year.

331
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,264
-You didn't eat it so you won't age?
-No.

332
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,599
You always end up eating it.

333
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,100
Mmm.

334
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,036
(slurping)

335
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,206
THEY ALL GET A YEAR OLDER TOGETHER
WITH TODAY'S MEAL

336
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,309
-Can I ask for some coffee?
-Nice.

337
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,777
I'll make some coffee.

338
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,681
THE MAN THAT BREWS COFFEE

339
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,717
PEAKBOY

340
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,588
HYUNGSIK: Man, that smells nice!

341
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,056
PEAKBOY: Everyone take a mug.

342
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,325
(slurps)

343
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,833
Do you have to put your hand
on your waist?

344
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,070
SEOJUN: He's going for the vibe
that he likes.

345
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,206
I like this kind of vibe.

346
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:12,344
THEY LEISURELY ENJOY THEIR OWN UNIQUE VIBE

347
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,714
SEOJUN: I can feel my eyes swollen.

348
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,817
None of us have double eyelids.

349
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,319
None of us have it?

350
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,954
HYUNGSIK: He doesn't have it either.

351
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,756
-I don't have any.
-HYUNGSIK: You're right.

352
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,257
-None of us have double eyelids.
-For real?

353
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,192
How interesting.

354
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,796
You have monolids,
but your eyes are so big.

355
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,799
Your eyes look like they're saying "Ah."

356
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,800
(Hyungsik laughs)

357
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,170
All of us are monolids.

358
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,872
HYUNGSIK:
Why did I think you had double eyelids?

359
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,273
Is it because his eyes are so big?

360
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,108
WOOSHIK RETURNS

361
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,510
Have some coffee.

362
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,413
Can you show me the playroom?

363
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,581
We're going to go there later.

364
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,817
-We're going to watch <i>Our Beloved Summer</i>.
-To monitor your show.

365
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,321
THE MAIN CAST, CHOI WOOSHIK,
IS ALREADY EMBARRASSED

366
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,057
(stifled laugh)

367
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,597
How is it that you look pretty
even after just waking up, V?

368
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,166
You just woke up, but you're so pretty.

369
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,334
Ah...

370
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,303
Did you know that
none of us have double eyelids?

371
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,938
-You don't have any?
-No.

372
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,740
-Yes, you do.
-Don't your eyes have them?

373
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,575
He doesn't have any.

374
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,377
-Yes, you do.
-PEAKBOY: Let me see.

375
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,845
-I don't have any.
-PEAKBOY: Hold still.

376
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,146
Hold still.

377
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,481
-Yes, he does.
-Yes, he does.

378
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,515
(laughter)

379
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,784
-He does have them.
-He does.

380
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,586
I don't have any.

381
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,154
-WOOSHIK: None of us have any?
-No.

382
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,222
THEY FIND A NEW THING IN COMMON

383
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,459
Shouldn't we slowly get ready
to go fishing?

384
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,160
-It's only 1:00 p.m.
-We leave at 2:00 p.m.

385
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,929
It's going to be fun.

386
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,266
Then, I'm going to start getting ready.

387
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,701
-Let's get ready.
-Let's do that.

388
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,670
THEY SLOWLY START TO GET READY

389
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,838
PEAKBOY:
Let's take the seasickness medicine.

390
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:46,739
SEOJUN: Take it now?

391
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,807
PEAKBOY:
We have to take it an hour in advance.

392
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,943
-I've never gotten seasick.
-(sneezes)

393
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,478
I also don't get seasick that much.

394
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,179
I'm taking it.

395
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,648
-Bye.
-Bye?

396
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,051
(laughter)

397
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,354
-Don't you put it behind your ears?
-Yeah, you put it here.

398
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,056
I'll do it for you.

399
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,225
Right here.

400
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,360
Do you put it on now?

401
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,995
HYUNGSIK APPLIES IT
WITH HIS SWEET TOUCH

402
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,867
-(chuckles)
-(sniffs)

403
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,802
Nice reaction.

404
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,836
(Hyungsik laughs)

405
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,305
THEY'RE DONE PREPARING
FOR THE SEASICKNESS

406
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,242
PEAKBOY:
Then, I'm going to brush my teeth first.

407
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,511
What kind of toothpaste is this?

408
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,913
THEY OFFICIALLY GET READY TO LEAVE

409
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,452
(in English)
Hey, Jackie Chan.

410
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,553
(in Korean)
Come on.

411
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,621
(laughs)

412
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,298
-Will I be cold if I wear this?
-I don't think so.

413
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:53,839
THEY LAYER UP IN PREPARATION
FOR THE WINTER SEA BREEZE

414
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,709
-I think our ears will freeze.
-It'll be cold.

415
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,646
Let us go.

416
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,748
It's going to be fun.

417
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,851
-I'll drive.
-That's a relief.

418
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,952
(laughter)

419
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,488
-(groans)
-(clears throat)

420
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,062
-Did you all buckle up?
-Yes.

421
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,530
-Yes.
-Let's go!

422
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,765
Okay.

423
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,833
Nice!

424
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,669
-Let's go.
-Okay.

425
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,840
THE FIVE FRIENDS GO OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME

426
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,241
I like this vibe, V.

427
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,843
Okay.

428
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,279
HYUNGSIK IS REALLY EXCITED

429
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,814
(humming)

430
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,417
-Oh, yeah.
-Nice.

431
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,519
(laughing)

432
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,654
Aren't you tired, Hyungsik?

433
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,556
-I'm feeling really good right now.
-Really?

434
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,426
-He didn't even want to take a nap.
-Yeah.

435
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,028
He must've gotten used to filming.

436
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,600
Since I took that short nap,
I'm feeling really good right now.

437
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,336
SEOJUN: How long has it been
since I went fishing on a boat?

438
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,038
-HYUNGSIK: It has been so long for me.
-SEOJUN: I don't even remember.

439
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,641
Hey, Wooshik. Are you lucky
when it comes to fishing?

440
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,976
-WOOSHIK: What?
-Luck in fishing.

441
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,944
If I go, I do catch something.

442
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,147
You know, I'm so unlucky with fishing.

443
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,016
Didn't you say that you went fishing often
when you were in Canada?

444
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,018
-He caught salmon like a bear.
-Right.

445
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:13,986
(laughs)

446
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,787
I haven't fished on a boat much.

447
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,956
I heard that halibut is in season now.

448
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,358
-Halibut?
-Yeah.

449
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,260
HYUNGSIK: <i>I'm excited.</i>

450
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,228
WOOSHIK:
<i>Yeah, it seems like a true trip now.</i>

451
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,997
HYUNGSIK:
<i>Yeah, this is what you call a trip!</i>

452
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,898
(laughter)

453
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't people ask about the ring?

454
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,736
When the director saw this,

455
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,605
he asked me what this ring meant.

456
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,408
I just told him it was a friendship ring.

457
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,244
I just got comments
that the ring was pretty.

458
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,981
-"Your ring is pretty."
-For those of us who wear a lot of rings,

459
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,216
-it's okay.
-Right?

460
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,552
-Actors--
-I don't wear rings.

461
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,722
-But I think just one ring is nice.
-Me too. I like it.

462
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,159
-Oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee, wee.
-<i>♪ Oh, wa, wa ♪</i>

463
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,828
<i>♪ Wa, wa, we-wee, wa, wa ♪</i>

464
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,897
AS THEY ENJOY THE MUSIC DURING THE DRIVE,

465
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,768
THEY ARRIVE AT THE PORT IN NO TIME

466
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,436
SEOJUN: <i>Can we get this close?</i>

467
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,205
Wow!

468
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,440
-This is awesome.
-Whoa!

469
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,176
SEOJUN: <i>Gonghyeonjin.</i>

470
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,046
HYUNGSIK: <i>Gosh, this ocean smell.
It has been so long.</i>

471
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,915
-SEOJUN: <i>Is it this boat?</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>I think it's this one.</i>

472
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,220
-SEOJUN: How long has it been?
-HYUNGSIK: Seriously. It has been so long.

473
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,088
"Experience fishing!"

474
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,424
PEAKBOY: Wooshik,
are you finally successful enough

475
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,926
-to buy a boat?
-Come and have some coffee.

476
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,494
COME AND HAVE SOME COFFEE

477
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,363
HYUNGSIK:
I heard that you became a captain.

478
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,265
-WOOSHIK: Yes, are you still acting?
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah.

479
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,800
SEOJUN: Have you been doing well?

480
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,168
HYUNGSIK: Watch out.

481
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,436
V: You're making me blush.

482
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,272
HYUNGSIK: It just seems like
you'd fall in the water.

483
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,176
CAPTAIN: I'm your captain for today.

484
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
-Hello.
-Hello.

485
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,380
You're wearing your life jackets, right?

486
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,650
-Yes.
-You can't take it off until we return.

487
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,353
Once we go out,
there will be a lot of halibut.

488
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,688
We can detect it on our fish finder.

489
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,091
But I'm not lucky
when it comes to fishing.

490
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,225
Don't worry.

491
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,527
CAPTAIN: It would be weird
if you can't catch any.

492
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,364
-I might be weird.
-It'd be funny if none of us catch any.

493
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,599
I think we can head out now.

494
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,968
CAPTAIN: Please let us know
if you need anything.

495
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,370
-Yes.
-All right, then.

496
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,405
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

497
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,908
THEY GO OUT TO THE SEA
HOPING FOR A BOAT FULL OF FISH

498
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,176
(all exclaim)

499
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,079
What?

500
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,314
That scared me.

501
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,417
-Don't be nervous.
-(Hyungsik exclaims)

502
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,952
What is it?

503
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,121
-Does it feel stuffy in here?
-I'm nervous.

504
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,188
(nervous laugh)

505
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,924
-He looks anxious right now.
-(laughing)

506
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,960
He's the biggest guy among us.

507
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,094
This is going to be fun.

508
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,896
Of course.

509
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,365
HYUNGSIK: <i>Sea fishing in the winter
has its own charm.</i>

510
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,566
WOOSHIK: <i>It's my first time.</i>

511
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,435
-PEAKBOY: <i>It's my first time too.</i>
-V: <i>Me too.</i>

512
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,044
V: <i>This is why people go out to sea.</i>

513
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,545
(engine rumbling)

514
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,680
(V groans)

515
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,582
V: Whoa!

516
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,219
I can see why Jin likes to do this.

517
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,655
It's like being on a roller coaster.

518
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,059
MEANWHILE, WHAT ABOUT THOSE INSIDE?

519
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,094
The waves are choppy today.

520
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:12,964
Isn't this...

521
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,032
(chuckles)

522
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,902
Isn't this just like riding a tagada?

523
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,504
Whoa!

524
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,476
-Let's go inside.
-It's so beautiful.

525
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:25,977
There are waves.

526
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,613
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm fine.

527
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,750
-Is it rocking a lot out there?
-What?

528
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,218
It's rocking a lot, isn't it?

529
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,820
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

530
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,788
It's like being on a roller coaster.

531
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,659
-We just briefly stepped out but--
-(water splashes)

532
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,827
WHILE SHARING HOW HE FELT

533
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,128
You were slapped by water.

534
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,230
-(water splashes)
-(Hyungsik and Peakboy groan)

535
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,999
(Peakboy and Seojun grunt, groan)

536
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,901
-Who did it?
-(Hyungsik chuckles)

537
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,169
Get off.

538
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,838
That's rough.

539
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,207
HYUNGSIK: <i>The waves are choppy today.</i>

540
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,443
(all cheer, exclaim)

541
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,245
PEAKBOY: <i>The waves are super high.</i>

542
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,714
DESPITE THE CHOPPY WAVES,
THE BOAT KEEPS GOING FARTHER

543
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,853
Are you okay?

544
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,055
-V: I'm okay.
-You're not seasick?

545
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,723
I don't get seasick.

546
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,659
-Are you okay?
-I never get seasick.

547
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,027
-Never?
-No.

548
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,432
Even when I briefly stepped out,
the ocean looked really deep.

549
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,769
I said, even when I briefly stepped out,
the ocean looked really deep.

550
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,175
BEFORE HE COULD FINISH, THEY EXPERIENCE
THE EAST SEA WITH THEIR WHOLE BODY

551
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,147
A dream? I too had a dream once.

552
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,248
(all laugh)

553
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,884
Let's raise our glass to romance.

554
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,485
Let's raise our glass for the world.

555
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,053
LET'S RAISE OUR GLASS FOR THE WORLD

556
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,991
WITH ROMANCE OUT AT SEA...

557
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,359
PEAKBOY: <i>We must have arrived.</i>

558
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,994
...THEY APPROACH THE FISHING SPOT

559
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,463
(engine rumbling)

560
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,602
AS THEY GET CLOSER TO THEIR DESTINATION

561
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,970
(nervous groan)

562
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,007
(all exclaiming)

563
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:04,109
THE WAVES GET STRONGER

564
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,446
(all exclaiming)

565
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,717
THEY'RE ALL SURPRISED
AT HOW ROUGH THE EAST SEA IS

566
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,953
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

567
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,189
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

568
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,623
We're sorry!

569
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,025
I want to go home.

570
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,995
I'm so glad we took
the seasickness medicine.

571
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,631
(laughter)

572
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,533
THEIR FIRST FISHING BOAT TRIP
STARTS OFF ROUGH

573
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,068
V: You look like a penguin now.

574
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,937
(laughing)

575
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,640
PEAKBOY: <i>We'll be fishing here.</i>

576
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,209
-SEOJUN: <i>We're here.</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>We're here.</i>

577
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,513
-<i>He said it wouldn't be rough.</i>
-<i>Gosh, the waves are so choppy.</i>

578
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,149
-SEOJUN: Let's go.
-PEAKBOY: Ah...

579
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,284
You're all dead!

580
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,987
-Yes.
-Okay, let's go.

581
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,623
-All right.
-One, two, three, we got this!

582
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,691
Oh.

583
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,459
All right, let's put our hands together.

584
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,728
ALL: One, two, three, we got this!

585
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,698
THEY SHOUT TOGETHER
FOR A SUCCESSFUL DAY OF FISHING

586
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,765
Come out.

587
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,934
This way.

588
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,303
THEY FINALLY COME OUT

589
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,806
-Please come this way.
-We're in trouble.

590
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,141
If you look here, we can check
with the fish finder.

591
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,843
Oh, you can check the depth.

592
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,079
BOTH: Whoa! Ooh!

593
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,614
Captain, will we be okay?

594
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,948
CAPTAIN: This is great.

595
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,617
This is great for the East Sea.

596
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,086
-That's right.
-Okay, if you see here,

597
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,524
there are a lot of fish
at the depth of about 55 to 60m.

598
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,759
-Do you see the sinker here?
-Yes.

599
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,930
Lower the clutch.
Press the down button and just cast it.

600
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:36,067
Then you can check
how deep the water is with that.

601
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,471
Likewise, press it and cast it.

602
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,840
MAN 1: You can check
how deep the water is.

603
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,677
THEY OFFICIALLY START
THEIR FIRST BOAT FISHING

604
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,847
(cheerful music)

605
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,727
It rocks back and forth.

606
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,963
Yeah, I can feel it vibrate.

607
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,699
-Gosh, it's really strong.
-That's so cool.

608
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,601
HYUNGSIK: Mine is just bent.

609
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,136
SEOJUN: What the heck?

610
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,971
It's so powerful!

611
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,207
-I think he caught something.
-Okay.

612
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,577
HYUNGSIK: I think I caught a lot.

613
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,312
It's staying bent.

614
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,479
You caught a lot.

615
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,381
-You caught a lot.
-I think so.

616
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,116
What kind of fish did you get?

617
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,886
-Are you reeling it in?
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah.

618
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,221
-Does it stop automatically?
-Yes.

619
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,424
Oh, my gosh. Look at the fish!

620
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,193
-What in the world is that?
-What the heck?

621
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,696
-Whoa!
-(laughter)

622
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,998
Oh, my gosh. Look at the fish!

623
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,834
-What in the world is that?
-What the heck?

624
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,235
(laughter)

625
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,171
A PARADE OF HALIBUT APPEAR

626
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,706
-HYUNGSIK: Whoa!
-SEOJUN: That's unbelievable!

627
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,175
HYUNGSIK: What the heck?

628
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,177
HYUNGSIK STARTS OFF THE CATCH

629
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,712
-This is awesome!
-Whoa!

630
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,649
THEY'RE AMAZED BY THE SITUATION

631
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,584
You can catch that much.

632
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,886
You have to hold it with your hand now.

633
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,455
MAN 2: Take it out.

634
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,692
What?

635
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,694
(rattling)

636
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,529
WOOSHIK: I caught something.

637
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,264
I caught something.

638
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,101
V: Gosh, look at Wooshik's.

639
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,469
Look at Wooshik's.

640
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,871
What's wrong with his?

641
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,040
I think Wooshik caught something else.

642
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,175
(whirs)

643
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,078
I caught a lot.

644
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,082
ALONG WITH HYUNGSIK,
WOOSHIK REELS IN A BUNCH OF HALIBUT

645
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,717
WOOSHIK: Come over here.

646
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,188
My gosh. There's a big one.

647
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,723
-A big one.
-It's big.

648
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:40,892
Isn't this big?

649
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,194
Yes, I think it's bigger
than the previous catch.

650
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,229
-Right?
-MAN 3: Yes.

651
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,397
(in English)
Okay.

652
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:52,337
THEY FISH HALIBUT FOR A LONG WHILE

653
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,609
HYUNGSIK AND SEOJUN HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH DEEP SEA FISHING

654
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,244
(in Korean)
I have a headache.

655
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,246
-V: Are you okay?
-Yeah.

656
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,714
WOOSHIK: Jeez.

657
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,349
Gosh.

658
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,051
THEY START TO GET SEASICK

659
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,419
Look far out.

660
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,888
Far away.

661
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,790
Can you eat halibut raw?

662
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,725
Yes, we serve it as
unboned sliced raw fish.

663
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,560
Unboned sliced raw fish, I see.

664
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,130
-Do you catch octopus too?
-MAN 4: That's right.

665
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,399
(reel whirring)

666
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,636
SEOJUN: <i>♪ I'm going to run ♪</i>

667
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,372
(whirring)

668
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,641
Let me see.

669
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,378
-What is this?
-Gosh, what is this?

670
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,780
-What is this?
-Gosh, what is this?

671
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,249
What is happening? Why are there so many?

672
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,085
Why are there so many?

673
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,586
LOTS OF HALIBUTS
ON SEOJUN'S FISHING ROD TOO

674
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,222
-Oh, my gosh. We caught all of them!
-I don't believe this.

675
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,560
It keeps coming up.

676
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,528
How many are there?

677
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,932
-There are so many.
-(Seojun chuckles)

678
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:54,933
COUNTLESS HALIBUT

679
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,302
-The baits got tangled together.
-Did they?

680
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,571
Is there a fish farm down below?

681
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:00,972
(chuckles)

682
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,741
I don't believe this.

683
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,277
AFTER SEOJUN AND V'S
COLLABORATIVE(?) CATCH

684
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,180
What is that?

685
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,116
(laughing)

686
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,385
(rattling)

687
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,422
-What is that?
-What the heck?

688
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,924
-What do I do with this?
-What is that?

689
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,226
DESPITE HIS SEASICKNESS,
PEAKBOY SUCCEEDS TOO

690
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,561
THE LAST PERSON LEFT

691
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,363
Lift it slightly.

692
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,531
(groans)

693
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,299
Lift it slightly.

694
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,367
(groans)

695
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,102
Ooh!

696
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,237
HYUNGSIK: You did it.

697
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,838
THE FIVE FRIENDS ALL CAUGHT FISH

698
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,740
Gosh, look how big they are.

699
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,276
You caught a big one!

700
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,213
-You know, this makes no sense.
-This is like a scam.

701
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,816
If you just cast the line,
you'll catch something.

702
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,519
I have never seen so many fish
being caught like this.

703
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,288
SEOJUN: Isn't this enough?

704
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,791
-HYUNGSIK: We can't eat all of this.
-SEOJUN: No, we can't.

705
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,058
Let's head back.

706
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,928
CAPTAIN: <i>We will now be returning to port.</i>

707
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,129
SEOJUN: I'm getting seasick.

708
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,130
THEY PROUDLY HEAD BACK

709
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,367
SEOJUN: <i>Why are we so tired
as if we were fishing for six hours?</i>

710
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,437
SEOJUN: <i>Oh, everyone did a good job today.</i>

711
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,139
-HYUNGSIK: <i>We've been through a lot.</i>
-(car door closes)

712
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,244
Let's head straight to the kitchen.

713
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,213
THEY PUT DOWN THE GROCERIES FIRST

714
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,182
SEOJUN: There's a purple steamed bun.

715
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,551
PEAKBOY: What? A purple steamed bun?

716
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:20,852
-SEOJUN: Sweet potato.
-HYUNGSIK: Let's try it.

717
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,854
-PEAKBOY: Let's taste it.
-HYUNGSIK: Let's do it.

718
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,329
-(utensil clatters)
-SEOJUN: I'm hungry.

719
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:35,433
THEY REFILL THEIR HUNGRY STOMACHS
WITH A STEAMED BUN FIRST

720
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,701
It's sweet potato.

721
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,105
Do you want to try it too, V?

722
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,308
No, thanks.

723
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,876
-Is it sweet potato flavored?
-Yes.

724
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,645
Are you eating all of it?

725
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,647
THEY SHARE ONE STEAMED BUN TOGETHER

726
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,416
Is this okay for the spoons?

727
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,585
-Yes. That's good.
-This is delicious.

728
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,891
It's hot, right? You should be careful.

729
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,363
I was hungry.

730
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,066
It was tough to even stand on the boat.

731
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,968
Shouldn't we eat this now?

732
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,103
-We have to eat this now.
-We have to eat it now.

733
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,038
WOOSHIK: Did we catch all of this?

734
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,474
SEOJUN: We have to eat some raw fish.

735
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,209
HYUNGSIK: Yeah, that sounds good.

736
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,045
-I've never had raw halibut.
-PEAKBOY: Me neither.

737
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,015
-You just dip it in <i>chojang</i> and eat it.
-That's right.

738
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,651
Let's give it a taste.

739
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,919
THEY FINALLY TASTE RAW HALIBUT

740
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,122
AFTER ONE BITE,

741
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,590
HE IS ALL SMILES

742
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,626
Is it good?

743
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,761
Yes.

744
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,464
Gosh, this is just...

745
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,634
-Mmm.
-SEOJUN: How is it? Is it good?

746
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,636
-Yes.
-It's so good.

747
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,904
It's good.

748
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,306
-It just melts in your mouth.
-Yeah.

749
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,608
-It tastes sweet.
-Yeah.

750
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,510
-It tastes sweet.
-Yes, it's sweet.

751
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,479
HYUNGSIK:
The bone isn't that hard to chew.

752
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,148
-SEOJUN: It's really fresh.
-WOOSHIK: It's really delicious.

753
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,920
Mmm. It's sweet.

754
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,389
-It really does melt in your mouth.
-Yeah.

755
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,258
-Raw halibut isn't bad.
-How interesting.

756
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,594
You know, I usually don't like
unboned raw fish.

757
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,763
-Me neither. I don't like it either.
-But this is good.

758
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,165
I tried just a little bit of it,
but it's good.

759
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,566
How interesting.

760
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,269
It's good.

761
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:22,640
BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE FLAVOR,
THEY CAN'T PUT DOWN THEIR CHOPSTICKS

762
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,676
Gosh. It's so good.

763
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,512
SEOJUN:
I think it's also because it's fresh.

764
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,180
-It's so fresh.
-Because it's fresh,

765
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,848
there isn't any fishy smell.

766
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,718
It was so interesting.
Wherever we cast it, we caught some.

767
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,921
-As soon as I cast it, I felt a nibble.
-I felt a nibble.

768
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,024
We caught a lot of baby fish too.

769
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,327
Do they not feed them well at home?

770
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,568
-They weren't fed well at home--
-Did you like that joke just now?

771
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,136
What? No.

772
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,139
-Don't laugh at jokes like that.
-Your reactions were funny.

773
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,374
Don't laugh at that.

774
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,210
They must not have been loved at home

775
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,045
-or--
-Do you have to go that far?

776
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,014
Maybe they wanted to eat out today?

777
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,550
(exhales, mumbles)

778
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,785
I'm getting tired.

779
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,723
(sighs)
Seriously?

780
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,958
THEY END UP LAUGHING
AT HIS RIDICULOUS JOKES

781
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,893
I think I need to go to bed.

782
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,830
PEAKBOY: I think we need to recharge.

783
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,233
-HYUNGSIK: Come on, my sweeties.
-WOOSHIK: Where?

784
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,502
HYUNGSIK: Come to the room over there.

785
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,938
SEOJUN: The floor is nice and warm.

786
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,439
HYUNGSIK: Isn't it perfect?

787
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,209
We didn't do much, but why am I so tired?

788
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,944
THE AFTERMATH OF GOING FISHING

789
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,646
(Peakboy sings)

790
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,881
(laughter)

00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,651
(laughter)

793
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,255
THEY LAUGH AS SOON AS PEAKBOY APPEARS

794
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,491
(laughter)

795
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,860
Keep going with it.

796
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,895
-You found it.
-This is it.

797
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,065
-This is it.
-You can do that on other shows.

798
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,467
PEAKBOY: Interesting.

799
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,802
WOOSHIK: This is it.

800
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,040
(Wooshik hums)

801
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,043
WOOSHIK INSTINCTIVELY GOES TO THE BED

802
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,745
I need some rest.

803
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,213
(inhales deeply)

804
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,118
(both exclaim)

805
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,686
V RUSHES IN BETWEEN THE TWO

806
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,157
(V chuckles)

807
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,559
V, aren't you going to take a nap?

808
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,595
We have to rest to do things later.

809

00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,375
THEY ENJOY THEIR REST IN THEIR OWN WAY

813
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,346
EVENING COMES AROUND SHORTLY

814
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,148
WOOSHIK: <i>Aren't we going to swim?</i>

815
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,317
-PEAKBOY: <i>Let's swim.</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>Shall we swim?</i>

816
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,652
-Let's go to the pool.
-Really?

817
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,820
Let's go to the pool.

818
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,288
HYUNGSIK: Wow...

819
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,891
What? Is it right around the time
to get sleepy?

820
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,359
Oh, no.

821
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,695

-We slept well.

824
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,902
PEAKBOY:
Is it finally time to take this out?

825
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,573
SEOJUN: <i>What the heck?
Look at how he's dressed!</i>

826
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,607
(laughs heartily)

827
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,009
SEOJUN: He looks like he's going
for a proper swim!

828
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,445
WOOSHIK: A seal trainer came.

829
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,715
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming.

830
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,717
(laughing)

831
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,952
Hey, there's a dolphin there!

832
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,253
Here's our dolphin.

833
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,387
Mmm.

834
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,990

V: <i>Let's go together.</i>

836
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,194
Gosh, this is nice.

837
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,562
It's nice.

838
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,065
The first time we met
was at a swimming pool.

839
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,000
-You're right.
-That's right.

840
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,401
You're right.

841
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,172
-We took an underwater photo together.
-Yeah, that's right.

842
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,307
It has been so long.

843
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,544
-Let's compete.
-Compete in what?

844
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,347
-Holding our breath underwater.
-Holding our breath?

845
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,382
If we can see your nose, you're out.

846
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,484
-My whole head will go in.
-Okay.

847
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,120
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

848
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,956
THEY HOLD THEIR BREATHS UNDERWATER

849
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,562
WHILE THEY ALL HOLD THEIR NOSES

850
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,132
PEAKBOY FLOATS LEISURELY

851
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,435
THEY FAIL IN HOLDING THEIR LAUGHS

852

853
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,539
-What?
-That sound.

854
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,073
You were just floating.

855
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,176
(all laughing)

856
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:21,712
What? My body was just floating.

857
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,681
THEY PLAY IN THE WATER

858
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,416
If you do this, it isn't cold.

859

I'll go bring the food.

-Yeah, it is.

885
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,231
Then...

00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,769
PUT A LID ON IT SO IT WON'T GO OUT

-I want to buy some chicken.

-be removed in these?
-You want a whole chicken.

903

00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,753
Grab that side.

950
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,088
HYUNGSIK: Careful.

951
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,756
-PEAKBOY: Let go?
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah.

952
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:26,724
SEOJUN: You got it.

953
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,793
Put everything on it.

954
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,595
SEOJUN: If this falls, it'll be fate.

955
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,964
PEAKBOY: Oh, oh.

956
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,634
SEOJUN: It's standing well.
It must have good spine muscles.

957
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,902
Let's close it.

958
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,040
This is going to take about two hours.

959
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,810
-The smell of burning wood.
-Yeah.

960
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,345
This looks good, Seojun.

961
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,315
(Peakboy gurgles)

962
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,118
HYUNGSIK:
I can inhale it all up right now.

963
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,921
SEOJUN: Just a little more.

964
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,989
(frizzling)

965
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:05,329
AROUND THE TIME THE BEER CAN CHICKEN
AND THE MEAT ARE ALMOST DONE

966
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,634
V: I'm going to start cooking the noodles.
They'll be done in about five minutes.

967
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,474
I'll show you that
I'm the master of spicy noodles.

968
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:20,945
That's it.

969
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,847
V MAKES SPICY NOODLES
TO ACCOMPANY THE MEAT

970
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,355
THE FIVE-MINUTE RECIPE
OF THE MASTER OF SPICY NOODLES

971
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,190
WOOSHIK: Let's eat.

972
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,758
SEOJUN: Shall we sit down?

973
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,462
Everyone, I'm going to hand
all of you some rice.

974
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,098
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

975
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,234
Yes, I love this kind of rice!

976
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,134
So good!

977
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,608
HE PLATES THE MEAT
THAT'S COOKED JUST RIGHT

978
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,143
CHEF'S PRIVILEGE: TASTING IT

979
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,512
(chomping)
Mmm.

980
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,046
You worked hard.

981
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,449
V: Is everyone ready to get stuffed?

982
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,583
Of course.

983
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,985
We have to stuff our faces.

984
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,486
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

985
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,888
-Enjoy.
-Eat up.

986
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,960
THE FIVE FRIENDS HAVE
THEIR FIRST DINNER TOGETHER

987
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,896
Gosh, it looks good.

988
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,534
Mmm...

989
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,769
(slurps)

990
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,043
(slurping)

991
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:28,979
Shall we have a drink?

992
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,314
-Gosh.
-Yes.

993
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,017
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

994
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,119
-Good job, guys.
-Cheers.

995
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,487
-Good job.
-Cheers.

996
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,022
Good job.
(chuckles)

997
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,963
It's been so long
since I've eaten outside like this.

998
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,032
-It has been so long.
-Me too.

999
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,901
You have to eat meat with rice.

1000
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,537
Hyungsik and I love noodles.

1001
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,005
I like noodles too.

1002
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,108
I think the noodles like you too. Mm.

1003
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,180
WOOSHIK: Ah...

1004
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,715
-It's so nice.
-Yeah.

1005
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,818
I'm cold, but it's still nice.

1006
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,123
WOOSHIK: You know, I think today
was better than yesterday.

1007
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,825
I'm happier today than I was yesterday.

1008
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,295
Then, you'll be happier tomorrow
than you are today.

1009
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,131
(all laughing)

1010
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,333
Really.

1011
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,901
I think I'm like that too.

1012
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,571
-I can let loose while I'm here.
-Mm.

1013
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,106
-Right.
-You know what I mean?

1014
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,307
-We're all like that.
-Me too.

1015
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,675
Me too.

1016
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,844
-Because we aren't worrying over anything.
-Yeah.

1017
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,579
There's nothing to worry about.

1018
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,282
-And we know each other.
-Yeah.

1019
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,719
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY OVER,
JUST BE COMFORTABLE AROUND EACH OTHER

1020
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,656
MEANWHILE, THE BEER CAN CHICKEN
THAT THEY BRIEFLY FORGOT ABOUT

1021
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,626
What time did that cutie go on the grill?

1022
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,861
It hasn't been two hours yet.

1023
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,798
I think it has been about 30 minutes.
Maybe 40 or 50 minutes?

1024
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,201
Should we check if it's leaning
this way or that way?

1025
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,402
Yeah, open it just a bit.

1026
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,803
-SEOJUN: Open it?
-Yeah.

1027
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,872
SEOJUN: Which way is it leaning?

1028
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,941
It's doing this.

1029
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,242
(laughter)

1030
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,213
It has become bashful.
It became very bashful.

1031
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,815
If you look carefully,
it looks like the legs are doing this too.

1032
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,217
(all laugh)

1033
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,551
It's a cutie.

1034
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,254
WOOSHIK: We won't ever be able
to travel like this again, will we?

1035
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,123
-Maybe not.
-Maybe once more.

1036
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,325
-Do you think we can?
-Yeah.

1037
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,460
But even this has been a few years.

1038
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,696
-It's been three years.
-Yeah.

1039
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,098
Was it before
Hyungsik joined the military?

1040
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,299
Right.

1041
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,569
Now, he's already discharged.

1042
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,338
(chuckles)
And we're all on a trip now.

1043
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,806
-We've known--
-Since 2018.

1044
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,307
Year 2018.

1045
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,943
-We became fast friends as well.
-Yeah.

1046
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,682
It's because V and Hyungsik
are so friendly.

1047
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,418
-You know that I'm shy around strangers.
-SEOJUN: You are.

1048
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,886
But we became close very fast.

1049
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,888
-Yeah.
-Isn't that so interesting?

1050
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,957
We first got close because of this.

1051
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,226
-While we were playing games.
-Oh, yeah.

1052
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,696
Was it when we played that online game?

1053
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,230
When we played that game together.

1054
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:03,367
-We had talked a lot.
-We were already introduced.

1055
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,501
That's right.

1056
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,704
Then we met up much later, right?

1057
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,140
Seojun, you introduced those two to us.
Why did you do it?

1058
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,610
-I never asked you that.
-V and Hyungsik wanted to meet you guys.

1059
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,012
-Us?
-That's right.

1060
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,547
-Why?
-Why?

1061
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,349
While playing games together--

1062
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,985
-We want to hear it from them.
-I want them to tell us.

1063
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,054
I was talking to someone up there.

1064
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,357
Right, don't you remember?

1065
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,927
Why? Why did you want to see us?

1066
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,495
-Maybe they didn't want to.
-Right?

1067
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,864
-He didn't force you, did he?
-It wasn't like that.

1068
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,401
-It was so much fun playing that game.
-Yeah.

1069
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,036
It was so much fun

1070
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,706
and Seojun said
that you were his only close friends,

1071
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,843
so we said that we would like to
meet you guys one day.

1072
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:50,147
You can see someone's personality
when you play games with them.

1073
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,148
Yeah.

1074
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,784
-That's why.
-When you hear them speak...

1075
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:57,221
You know, your gaming personality
and your usual personality are different.

1076
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,388
(all laugh)

1077
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,957
SEOJUN: He plays to win.

1078
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,559
Didn't you get cursed at
when we first joined?

1079
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,795
-I wasn't cursed at.
-I was, a little.

1080
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,197
I was in a really good team,

1081
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,367
but Hyungsik asked me to add that
when we haven't even met.

1082
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,169
-He didn't curse at us.
-No.

1083
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,871
-His tone was--
-He said this often,

1084
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,573
-"No! No!"
-Like this,

1085
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,643
"No, change it." It was like that.

1086
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,779
HE'S COLD-HEARTED
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPETITION

1087
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,547
I'm not like that these days.

1088
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,383
-That was back then.
-Yeah, how long ago was that?

1089
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,418
Seriously. It was years ago.

1090
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,555
You know, if we hadn't played that game,
we wouldn't have met.

1091
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,625
No, we would've met some other way.

1092
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:35,893
Do you think so?

1093
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,030
-I watched the show you were in.
-What?

1094
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,532
I enjoyed that episode.

1095
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,433
-I watched it too.
-Me too.

1096
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,669
-PEAKBOY: Hasn't it been a while?
-It has.

1097
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,539
Wooshik, you acted cute
on that show as well.

1098
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,707
Does it look like I'm acting cute?

1099
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:51,875
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1100
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,177
-WOOSHIK: No.
-(Hyungsik laughs)

1101
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,078
No, it really isn't like that.

1102
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,714
-I think I'm just cute.
-PEAKBOY: You're just cute?

1103
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,951
LOTS TO SAY BUT THEY DON'T

1104
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:01,919
Okay.

1105
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,855
For real. No, that was a joke.

1106
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,591
To be honest,
I wish people wouldn't see me as cute.

1107
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,626
How do you want them to view you?

1108
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,862
WOOSHIK: I wish they'd think
I was cool like Seojun.

1109
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,430
-Me too.
-Yeah.

1110
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,599
-That's why I reduce my height.
-Well.

1111
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,533
(laughs)

1112
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,168
-For real.
-WOOSHIK: If I'm being really honest,

1113
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,671
I don't like it when people say I'm cute.

1114
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,640
Then, what kind of image
would you like to have in 2022?

1115
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,509
-The rom-com king.
-Be honest.

1116
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,611
I'd like to bulk up a lot.

1117
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,246
-Like this?
-WOOSHIK: Yeah.

1118
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,448
Then, I'm going to steal
about five of Seojun's ads.

1119
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,383
(laughter)

1120
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,286
Then, you're going to walk around
like this later on.

1121
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,389
Yeah, I'm really going to walk like that.

1122
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,527
I want to have cool roles.

1123
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,462
-I don't want to be cute.
-V: Hyungsik

1124
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,098
became really cool
after his military service.

1125
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,833
-Hyungsik was always cool.
-Right.

1126
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,501
What Wooshik and I still remember is that

1127
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,871
when we first saw Hyungsik,
we thought he was very handsome.

1128
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,672
Yeah, we couldn't even talk to him.

1129
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,242
-I couldn't even talk to him.
-Come on.

1130
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,509
-Really.
-I mean it.

1131
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,612
It took a lot out of us to talk to you.

1132
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,513
-What about me?
-You're handsome too.

1133
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,048
-(laughing)
-Hey.

1134
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,785
To be honest, we were
kind of awkward at the pool.

1135
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,654
-We were awkward.
-It was because of Hyungsik.

1136
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,022
-He's right.
-(laughing)

1137
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,791
And we thought, "Who's that guy?"

1138
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,960
-Did he have dyed hair?
-Was it red?

1139
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,263
-It was pink.
-The color had faded.

1140
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,831
"What's up with that guy?"

1141
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,367
Yeah, Hyungsik was handsome.

1142
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,569
-You're handsome, V.
-You're handsome too.

1143
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,737
You don't mean that.

1144
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,739
I was surprised at your concert.

1145
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,507
-No, you weren't.
-Yeah, we were.

1146
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,410
You know, I told you this before.

1147
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,945
We were good friends

1148
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,980
but not close enough
to send text to you one-on-one.

1149
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,216
But after seeing you perform
at your concert,

1150
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,984
-I was really surprised.
-Yeah.

1151
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,452
I was so shocked at your concert.

1152
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,488
You did this to the camera.

1153
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,089
FLICKING THE CAMERA

1154
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,858
My heart stopped too.

1155
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,693
-(gasps)
-(Hyungsik chuckles)

1156
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,727
Anything else?

1157
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,963
-I think that was it.
-(laughter)

1158
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,699
-That was the end of our memory.
-Yeah.

1159
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,301
-Really?
-Okay.

1160
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,436
Gosh, I thought there would be
something else.

1161
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,540
If we praise you too much,
we can't hang out with you.

1162
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,875
(laughter)

1163
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,376
-Got that?
-That's right.

1164
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,945
-He's right.
-I like it the way we are.

1165
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,048
Of course, you are an amazing guy,
but if I think you're even greater

1166
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,617
-and think you're so awesome...
-PEAKBOY: It'll be uncomfortable.

1167
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,218
...I can't hang out with you.

1168
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,121
SEOJUN: Here, you're just our friend.

1169
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,557
PEAKBOY: When did V look cool?

1170
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,458
(sucks teeth)

1171
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,360
-When did V look cool?
-PEAKBOY: When V looked cool...

1172
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,661
I remember this one time.

1173
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,596
When we made music together.

1174
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,398
-When you worked together.
-That's right.

1175
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,267
-Right.
-I was really surprised then.

1176
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,736
He was really an artist.

1177
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,638
-An artist?
-An artist.

1178
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,941
He kept mumbling
while writing the lyrics at our studio.

1179
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,176
He looked cool.

1180
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:43,046
About Hyungsik, do you remember
when we saw his musical together?

1181
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,548
That's right.

1182
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,049
-He was good.
-What was it?

1183
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,784
-He was amazing.
-He played "Death."

1184
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,252
He was so good.

1185
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,754
He was really cool.

1186
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,657
He joined us after that back then.

1187
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:54,791
-Afterwards.
-Yeah.

1188
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,327
-He showed up with his makeup still on.
-Still in my makeup.

1189
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,597
-Hyungsik's song seemed really hard too.
-Right.

1190
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,965
Honestly, it was challenging.

1191
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,334
-I don't know...
-You were so good, though.

1192
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,570
Hyungsik looks so cool when he's singing.

1193
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,740
The thing is, those two won't give up
the microphone when they're singing.

1194
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:13,477
Usually, people would just take over,
but they'd sing the harmony.

1195
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,145
They keep doing that.

1196
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,413
I'm not singing alone.

1197
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,782
-They'd sing in harmony.
-They'd sing in harmony.

1198
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,084
But since they're both good singers,

1199
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,686
-it's fun to watch them.
-Well.

1200
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,088
-It's fun to watch them sing in harmony.
-What's funny is

1201
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,024
that the songs we sing are
always the same,

1202
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,925
so we know that

1203
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,562
at this moment either me or Hyungsik
would sing in harmony.

1204
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,565
When we sing, it's time for them
to get some rest.

1205
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,535
-That's when we have a drink.
-Take a break.

1206
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,538
We have to watch V's concert
in person one day.

1207
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:42,739
-Yeah.
-I know.

1208
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,642
-What a shame.
-I wanted to invite you to the States.

1209
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,846
At some point, what we took for granted
was no longer for granted,

1210
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,449
-so we're starting to miss them.
-Yeah.

1211
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,217
-It's precious.
-You see,

1212
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:58,622
you gave us the tickets
to your first online concert,

1213
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,323
-so we saw it online.
-Yeah.

1214
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,526
Honestly, we really enjoyed the concert.

1215
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,961
Do you know how much we shook
the light stick?

1216
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,063
At first,

1217
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,798
-we didn't even know how to turn it on.
-I didn't know.

1218
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,100
-I kept doing something with my phone.
-Connecting it using bluetooth.

1219
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,369
The three of us were dancing in the back.

1220
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,270
Hyah!

1221
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,973
Online and offline concerts
are so different, you know.

1222
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,875
It's different for those performing too.

1223
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,844
-The energy is different.
-Isn't it different for the audience too?

1224
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,180
-It's totally different.
-It's different for us too.

1225
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,083
That's one thing I'm really jealous of V.

1226
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:29,619
-Being on stage.
-Because I'll never experience that.

1227
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,687
Right.

1228
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,890
-Right.
-Well, I can't even imagine

1229
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:36,593
-what that would feel like.
-The thrill on the stage.

1230
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,894
I can't even imagine it.

1231
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:41,098
I know we can't even compare to that,

1232
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:44,301
but when I attend a stage greeting
and the audience applauds us,

1233
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,537
-even that applause is touching.
-Of course.

1234
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,773
When you see
all those people at the stadium...

1235
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,042
-There are so many people.
-Yeah.

1236
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:57,414
You must not realize how tired you are
because of the adrenaline rush.

1237
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,015
That's right.

1238
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,253
-But we've never asked you this before.
-We never asked him that.

1239
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,955
-We never asked him.
-Right.

1240
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:08,825
There are only five of us,
but we do many different things.

1241
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,862
-We do a variety of things.
-WOOSHIK: Writing music,

1242
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,799
performing in musicals, acting,
and what he does.

1243
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,635
-PEAKBOY: <i>Do you know what this is?</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>Aurora flames!</i>

1244
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,371
PEAKBOY: <i>You know that this fire has
multiple colors, don't you?</i>

1245
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,106
It's called an aurora fire

1246
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,808
-where the color changes.
-While rising up?

1247
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,676
-Can I put it in?
-Do it.

1248
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:27,744
-I'm doing it.
-Do it.

1249
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,845
Put it in the middle.

1250
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,481
Do we have to film this?

1251
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,351
Let's see.

1252
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,686
ALL: Oh, oh, oh!

1253
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,954
ALL: Whoa!

1254
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,226
-HYUNGSIK: It's so pretty!
-PEAKBOY: Whoa! Whoa!

1255
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,362
I have to get a photo!

1256
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,532
-Do you have a camera?
-It's really pretty.

1257
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,667
-Ooh!
-But I only see blue flames.

1258
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,502
-No, look here.
-There's green as well.

1259
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,837
-Can you see it?
-Yeah.

1260
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,172
You can.

1261
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,374
-ALL: Wow.
-HYUNGSIK: It looks like CG.

1262
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,476
WOOSHIK:
It looks like a galaxy you see at night.

1263
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:00,944
-PEAKBOY: Yeah.
-SEOJUN: Fascinating.

1264
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,345
PEAKBOY: This is so fascinating.

1265
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,381
-Where did you get this?
-At first,

1266
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,284
we were so disinterested in it.

1267
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,755
-Let's try that.
-Fireworks?

1268
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,456
Let's go back to our childhood.

1269
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,591
Okay.

1270
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,126
Okay, I'll ration them out.

1271
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,197
-Pass it.
-"There will be a passing ceremony."

1272
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,299
-Pass it.
-It's turning purple this time.

1273
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,967
V, go purple.

1274
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,769
The color is really pretty.

1275
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,939
-Can't we do it like this?
-That's right.

1276
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,308
PEAKBOY: This is purple too.

1277
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,377
Oh, my gosh!

1278
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:35,679
-Oh, my gosh.
-Jeez.

1279
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,581
Oh, my gosh?

1280
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,684
-Why isn't mine working?
-Shouldn't we put this out?

1281
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,619
-PEAKBOY: Oh!
-(Seojun exclaims)

1282
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,255
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

1283
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,091
S.O.S.

1284
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,193
S.O.S.

1285
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,563
-Help us.
-The house is on fire.

1286
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,999
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED

1287
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,968
-I smell something burning.
-Is it yours?

1288
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,703
-(laughs)
-PEAKBOY: Yours?

1289
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,639
It's okay.

1290
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,843
-We should stand apart.
-Let's stand apart.

1291
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,812
WOOSHIK: Let's do that with this.

1292
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,914
-Let's write letters.
-Oh, this?

1293
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:15,685
L, O, V, E. Like that?

1294
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,722
I'm just going to draw circles.

1295
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,323
I'm going to draw a heart.

1296
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,361
THEY'RE BUSY WRITING WITH THE FLAME

1297
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,996
Don't you have to write fast?

1298
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,300
-It's done burning.
-PEAKBOY: Good job, guys.

1299
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,669
-Did this fall from yours?
-I don't know.

1300
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,304
Wooshik's jacket got burnt.

1301
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,472
-Really?
-Let me see.

1302
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,906
-You're right.
-Where?

1303
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,109
-Where did it burn?
-PEAKBOY: His inner pocket.

1304
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,510
Here.

1305
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,445
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1306
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,114
You must be so sad, Wooshik.

1307
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,116
Just put some tape on it.

1308
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,250
Yeah.

1309
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,452
You wore it for five years.
That's long enough.

1310
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,255
When it was burning,

1311
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,292
I felt that it really was goose down.

1312
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,459
(laughter)

1313
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,462
(laughing)

1314
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,066
-It's nice to stare at the fire.
-Yeah.

1315
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,602
It's so nice.

1316
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,538
-WOOSHIK: Really nice.
-PEAKBOY: It's burning all of my worries.

1317
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,340
You know...
(sighs)

1318
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,776
-I'll remember this for a long time.
-Right?

1319
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,512
I'm not joking.
I'll remember this for a long time too.

1320
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,580
This is really fascinating.

1321
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,948
-We're talking right now.
-I mean.

1322
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,350
Not this moment, but this fire.

1323
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,686
We're talking about staring at the fire.

1324
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,588
We can come here anytime we want.

1325
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,224
-I'm going to remember this aurora fire.
-It's great. I love it.

1326
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,926
I find this the most fascinating too.

1327
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,562
It's interesting that it lasts so long.

1328
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,663
PEAKBOY: I know.

1329
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:38,635
But I really do think
it'll be a good memory.

1330
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,570
PEAKBOY: We have to go in five minutes.

1331
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,839
SEOJUN: <i>No, it'll start around 10:10 p.m.</i>

1332
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,208
WOOSHIK: <i>You don't have to watch my show.</i>

1333
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,443
THE NIGHT SETTLES IN

1334
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,845
There's Choi Wooshik.

1335
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,547
You can't fall asleep.

1336
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,383
HYUNGSIK: I'm concentrating.
Can you stop disturbing me?

1337
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,685
(all exclaiming)

1338
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,154
HIS FRIENDS ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED

1339
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,756
SEOJUN: <i>Well done, Wooshik, well done.</i>

1340
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,158
AFTER THEIR VIEWING PARTY IS OVER

1341
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,727
V: <i>Bro, bro, let's go.</i>

1342
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,863
SEOJUN (singing): <i>♪ She ♪</i>

1343
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,899
<i>♪ Above that smile ♪</i>

1344
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,136
<i>♪ I take a break from my day ♪</i>

1345
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:15,739
AND

1346
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,641
PEAKBOY: <i>Well, this is the first time
I'm saying this...</i>

1347
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,978
I never talked about this.
There's just only one time.

1348
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,481
To be honest,
I was really envious back then.

1349
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,683
Honestly, I can't express myself well.

1350
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,485
But it's not just jealousy.

1351
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,253
SEOJUN: I'm not just jealous, it's just...

1352
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,322
-He has something that I don't have.
-Yeah.

1353
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,591
HYUNGSIK: That's why I like it so much.

1354
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,092
It's nice to talk about such things.

1355
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,694
V: <i>That's so nice.</i>

1356
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,529
PEAKBOY: <i>It feels quite different.</i>

1357
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,267
(Wooshik exclaims surprisedly)

1358
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,969
V, ARE YOU CRYING?

1359
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,637
EVERYONE IS SURPRISED BY V'S TEARS

1360
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:51,841
(all exclaiming)

1361
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,477
SEOJUN: What's making you so sad, V?

1362
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:58,615
THE TRIP OF THESE FIVE FRIENDS CONTINUES
