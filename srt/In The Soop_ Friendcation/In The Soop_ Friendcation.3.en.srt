1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,004
IN THE SOOP: FRIENDCATION

2
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,963
IN THE SOOP: FRIENDCATION

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,098
-WOOSHIK: Hello.
-PEAKBOY: Wooshik's here.

4
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,200
WOOSHIK AND HYUNGSIK JOINED A LITTLE LATER

5
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,668
-Did you sleep well?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,472
THEY SLEEP TOGETHER,

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,975
EAT TOGETHER,

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,743
AND LAUGH TOGETHER

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,644
PEAKBOY, WOOSHIK: Hold still.

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,716
AS THEIR TRIP TOGETHER BEGINS,
EVEN SOMETHING NORMAL IS SPECIAL

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,921
THEY GO ON THEIR FIRST BOAT FISHING

12
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,556
HYUNGSIK: Oh, my gosh! What's happening?

13
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,857
Whoa!
(laughs)

14
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,793
EITHER IT'S BEGINNER'S LUCK
OR THEY'RE LUCKY IN FISHING

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,327
SEOJUN: <i>What is this?</i>

16
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,431
What is happening? Why are there so many?

17
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,331
HYUNGSIK: You did it.

18
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,201
BECAUSE OF THE ENDLESS PARADE OF HALIBUT,
THEY EXPERIENCE REAL FISHING

19
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,637
SEOJUN: <i>Is there a fish farm down below?</i>

20
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,805
(laughter)

21
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,307
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

22
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,508
THEY GO TO THE POOL AFTERWARD

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:21,081
TIME FLIES AS THEY ENJOY
THEIR TIME TOGETHER AFTER SO LONG

24
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,650
WOOSHIK:
<i>Yeah, it seems like a true trip now.</i>

25
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,085
HYUNGSIK:
<i>Yeah, this is what you call a trip!</i>

26
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,486
THE TRIP GETS MORE AMUSING

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,057
ALONG WITH THE BARBECUE PARTY,
THEY OPEN UP TO ONE ANOTHER

28
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,395
I CAN LET LOOSE WHILE I'M HERE

29
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,965
THE FRIENDS BECOME WHOLE
WHEN THEY ARE TOGETHER

30
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,303
THEY LET LOOSE AND SHOW THEIR REAL SELVES

31
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,139
-SEOJUN: <i>And we know each other.</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>Yeah.</i>

32
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,675
WITHIN THE FENCE CALLED "US"

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,379
THE SECOND NIGHT OF THEIR TRIP
IS FILLED WITH CANDID CONVERSATIONS

34
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,815
V: <i>We have to go in five minutes.</i>

35
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,250
EPISODE 3. WE'RE HAPPIER
BECAUSE WE'RE TOGETHER

36
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,185
We have to go in five minutes.

37
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,387
No, it'll start around 10:10 p.m.

38
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,823
-V: It's 10 already.
-SEOJUN: I know.

39
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,926
WOOSHIK: I think it's a bit much
to leave that out for an hour.

40
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,262
SEOJUN: Then we can pull it off
and take it in.

41
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,497
WOOSHIK: Wow.

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,500
HYUNGSIK: Wow. That looks amazing.

43
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,302
This can't not taste good.

44
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,971
-HYUNGSIK: It just comes off.
-SEOJUN: It does.

45
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,639
I think it's because it's done.

46
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,908
HYUNGSIK: Yeah.
Put it on the tray like that.

47
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,443
Uh.

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,646
-I'll carry it since I'm wearing gloves.
-It's okay.

49
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,781
-HYUNGSIK: Is it done? Let me see.
-PEAKBOY: It's done.

50
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,850
-HYUNGSIK: Smoke is coming out of it.
-SEOJUN: Honey, is it done?

51
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:31,818
-WOOSHIK: It's done.
-SEOJUN: Yeah.

52
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,553
It smells awesome!

53
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,322
(gasps)
Smell it.

54
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,959
-Whoa.
-(laughter)

55
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,494
-Success!
-WOOSHIK: Success!

56
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,962
THE BEER CAN CHICKEN PASSES UNANIMOUSLY

57
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,032
-Then go inside and watch the drama.
-Is it not hot?

58
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,434
SEOJUN: I'll bring this and some fruit.

59
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,503
-PEAKBOY: Okay.
-HYUNGSIK: I'm looking forward to it.

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,039
WOOSHIK: <i>You don't have to watch my drama.</i>

61
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,674
(fire crackling)

62
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,678
THE FRIENDS GATHER IN THE PLAYROOM

63
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,080
-PEAKBOY: <i>Did it start?</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>I think it started a while ago.</i>

64
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,615
PEAKBOY: <i>There's Wooshik.</i>

65
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,317
You can't fall asleep, okay?

66
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,752
THEY WATCH WOOSHIK'S DRAMA

67
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,354
I have to focus,
so can you please stop bothering me?

68
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,724
WOOSHIK: I wonder what it'll taste like.

69
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,130
-How is it?
-Be honest.

70
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,166
(laughs)
Is it amazing?

71
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,834
-WOOSHIK: It's amazing.
-PEAKBOY: Can I try it?

72
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,437
But you have to serve it with the skin.

73
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,407
Oh, my gosh.

74
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,644
TIME FOR PEAKBOY TO TRY IT(?)

75
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,613
(laughter)

76
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,649
Oh.

77
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,384
HYUNGSIK: How does it smell like this?

78
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,953
I can smell the smokiness.

79
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,187
PEAKBOY: It's good.

80
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,690
THE BEER CAN CHICKEN WAS A PERFECT SUCCESS

81
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,725
-That's good.
-SEOJUN: It's good.

82
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,393
PEAKBOY: Wooshik is on TV.

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,629
THEY ALL FOCUS
WHEN WOOSHIK IS IN THE SCENE

84
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,398
-You didn't get much sleep.
-How did you know that?

85
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,634
I can tell by your eyes.

86
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,135
HE KNOWS JUST BY LOOKING AT HIS EYES

87
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,339
THE STUDENTS SAY THAT WOOSHIK IS CUTE
FOR BEING IN A SCANDAL WITH A CELEBRITY

88
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,441
They say you're cute on this too.

89
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,543
I want to look cool though.

90
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,081
-Come on, Rom-com King.
-PEAKBOY: I know, right?

91
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,148
(laughs)

92
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,717
THE FEMALE LEAD IS STARTLED

93
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,918
-HYUNGSIK: She showed up at his house.
-PEAKBOY: Goodness.

94
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,087
AFTER SHE SHOWS UP AT WOOSHIK'S HOUSE

95
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,755
-She came to his house.
-PEAKBOY: She came.

96
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,490
She's like, "Why am I here?"

97
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,193
Why is she there?

98
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,562
Open the door and come out, Wooshik.

99
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,832
-He'll come out with a spray can.
-Come on. What are you talking about?

100
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:32,572
THE TWO FEMALE LEADS WHO LIKE WOOSHIK
ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,041
-He's being loved by two women.
-PEAKBOY: I know.

102
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,543
-HYUNGSIK: That's annoying.
-SEOJUN: It's seriously annoying.

103
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,480
You were loved by two women
in <i>Itaewon Class</i> too.

104
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,748
I don't remember that.

105
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,249
(laughter)

106
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,320
THE FEMALE LEAD'S GRANDMOTHER
IS GETTING GROCERIES

107
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,821
HYUNGSIK: She's on this show too.

108
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,924
-I worked with her on <i>Juror 8</i>.
-Yes. When she was filming <i>Itaewon Class</i>,

109
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,626
she kept saying how nice Hyungsik was.

110
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,894
-(laughs)
-WOOSHIK: That's right.

111
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,163
-HYUNGSIK: She likes me.
-"Hyungsik is so kind."

112
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,101
THE FEMALE LEAD FINALLY FINDS
WOOSHIK WHO WAS RUNNING FROM HER

113
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,870
-SEOJUN: What?
-She asked why he isn't avoiding her.

114
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,673
ALL: Oh.

115
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,441
-SEOJUN: Hurry up and tell her.
-Yeah, tell her.

116
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,876
-PEAKBOY: Have a drink.
-Tell her.

117
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:11,944
-So...
-So...

118
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,880
THE FEMALE LEAD TELLS
WOOSHIK HOW SHE FEELS

119
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,947
You are...

120
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,717
-Okay.
-WOOSHIK: I ask her to be my friend.

121
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,052
HYUNGSIK: You asked her to be your friend?

122
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,054
-I see.
-Yeah, I ask her to be my friend.

123
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,188
So?

124
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,757
-She has to think.
-HYUNGSIK: She has to think about it.

125
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,830
LOVE STORY OF WOONG AND YEONSOO
GET INTERESTING

126
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,864
-V: Why not?
-HYUNGSIK: Why?

127
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,567
-SEOJUN: Then?
-Okay.

128
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,635
HYUNGSIK: Then?

129
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,004
WOOSHIK ANSWERS HER

130
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,205
Oh.

131
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,341
Yeah!
(laughing)

132
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,509
HYUNGSIK: You are the Rom-com King!

133
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,744
The Rom-com King!

134
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,113
You just took the initiative!

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,314
THEY LOVE HIS SWEET LINES

136
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,917
(indistinct groaning)

137
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,786
ON THE OTHER HAND, WOOSHIK FEELS SKITTISH

138
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,322
WOOSHIK'S FINAL CONFESSION OF HIS FEELINGS

139
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,257
PEAKBOY: Oh, my gosh.

140
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,461
(gentle music)

141
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,162
Tell her.

142
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,401
(all groaning)

143
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:15,641
THEY'RE ALL FOCUSED ON
WOOSHIK'S SERIOUS ACTING

144
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,979
Good job, Wooshik.

145
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,351
WHEN THEY THOUGHT IT WAS OVER...

146
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,721
WOOSHIK AND THE FEMALE LEAD KISS

147
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,092
THEIR REACTION IS EXPLOSIVE
MORE THAN EVER

148
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,061
(groaning)

149
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,829
(laughing)

150
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,266
PEAKBOY: Rom-com King!

THE NIGHT BECAME MUCH SWEETER

155
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,844
-SEOJUN: It was the best ending.
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah, it was so nice.

156
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,780
SEOJUN: Yeah, it was such a nice ending.

157
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,681
"Can you please love me?"

158
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,417
WOOSHIK: You know,

159
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,885
I'm usually

160
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,922
not that good
at emotional scenes requiring tears,

161
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:07,326
but I realized
I've never said my lines while crying.

162
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,796
It's hard to say your lines while crying.

163
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,598
I haven't monitored that episode yet,

164
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,901
but there's this one scene at the very end

165
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,136
where I have to act like
I'm holding back my tears,

166
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,939
but I can't, so I'm doing my lines
while I'm crying.

167
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,008
WOOSHIK: So I tried to do that,

168
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,377
and it was the first time
I had a face spasm.

169
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
THE SCENE WAS THAT TOUGH

170
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:29,048
But it wasn't like
the tears came falling down, but...

171
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,184
You know,
tears falling down isn't important.

172
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,153
-I really can't cry.
-This isn't important.

173
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,857
What I liked about the final scene
was that it didn't go overboard.

174
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,960
If you said, "Yeonsoo, I missed you."

175
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,729
-If you did it like that...
-That wouldn't have been as good.

176
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,333
-WOOSHIK: You're right.
-But I think you should act

177
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,735
so that the viewers can cry, not yourself.

178
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,205
-That's it. You're right.
-SEOJUN: It's different if you cry.

179
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,607
The viewer is getting emotional
and is about to cry,

180
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,476
-but the character starts crying.
-WOOSHIK: If they cry.

181
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,111
-Then there's no room for me to cry.
-WOOSHIK: That's right.

182
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,813
SEOJUN: But it would be impossible

183
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,915
-to think of all that while you're acting.
-Exactly.

184
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,619
-You acted like you were messing around...
-I thought that too.

185
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,120
...but it was totally emotional.

186
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,257
I cried a lot while filming
<i>Our Beloved Summer</i>,

187
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,860
even though it was hard for me to cry.

188
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,096
SEOJUN: The fact that you felt
that kind of emotion

189
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,232
helped this drama out a lot.

190
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,400
And, it may sound funny, but it also means

191
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,835
you're getting old.

192
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,504
(laughter)

193
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,839
-I know what you mean.
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah.

194
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,775
You've become old enough
to relate to that.

195
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,978
HYUNGSIK: Oddly, for me,

196
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,947
I have a harder time

197
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,150
expressing how I feel inside

198
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,253
during my daily life.

199
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,454
Mm.

200
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,057
But I feel like
I can relieve those feelings

201
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,227
-while I'm acting.
-WOOSHIK: I see.

202
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,997
Me too. When would I ever cry

203
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:55,801
and get angry like I do in dramas?

204
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,638
-SEOJUN: It wouldn't.
-It wouldn't happen.

205
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,474
-Doing a scene like that is cathartic.
-Yeah, it is.

206
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,444
SEOJUN: The only person who inspires me
when it comes to acting is Wooshik.

207
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,547
-Please.
-SEOJUN: For real.

208
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,449
So I monitor his acting a lot.

209
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,184
But it isn't jealousy.

210
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,953
-HYUNGSIK: Right.
-SEOJUN: That's not what it is.

211
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,222
It's just that he has something
that I don't have.

212
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,258
There was a scene
where I couldn't get it right.

213
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,094
Then I started to wonder
what he would think about it.

214
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,629
(sighs)
So it's real for you.

215
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,897
SEOJUN: So I ask him.

216
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,700
Then Wooshik would give me

217
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,436
a rough guide version of the scene.

218
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,606
It made me think,
"That's another way to do it."

219
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
You know,

220
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,314
it somehow turned out that we ended up

221
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,215
being friends for so long, right?

222
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,450
And I think

223
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,787
-we synergize each other so well.
-HYUNGSIK: You're right.

224
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,522
-Yeah.
-HYUNGSIK: That's true.

225
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,925
-We have a positive effect.
-WOOSHIK: I think the positive effect

226
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,627
of that synergy is massive.

227
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,395
When Peakboy and I didn't know

228
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,731
-V and Hyungsik yet...
-Right.

229
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,634
...we became friends
when you were going through

230
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,170
the most turbulent period
of Seojun's life.

231
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,237
-I was maturing.
-PEAKBOY: Yeah.

232
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,275
When I watched you then,
I was honestly so envious of you.

233
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,210
-It motivated us too.
-WOOSHIK: It did.

234
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,313
On top of that, these two joined us.

235
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,816
And the synergy that came
with these two was massive.

236
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:17,917
Yeah.

237
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:22,521
Even after all of us became friends,

238
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,624
-we kept maturing.
-ALL: That's right.

239
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,860
-SEOJUN: We matured together.
-Yeah, and I love that so much.

240
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,597
The person that I worried
about the most was Peakboy.

241
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,933
We've known each other
since middle school.

242
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,738
As you know, there are so many people
who can sing well,

243
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,041
and there are so many people
who write songs and lyrics.

244
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,176
So I wondered
if Peakboy would ever succeed,

245
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,612
but he always worked hard.

246
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,348
SEOJUN: He'd work part-time
to buy his equipment,

247
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,651
and he never asked for financial support
from his parents.

248
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,319
I knew how it was for him.

249
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,188
So what made me the happiest

250
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,759
was when he could do what he wanted
and I was so proud of him for that.

251
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,595
This is the first time I'm saying this.

252
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,530
There was only one time

253
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,733
that I called Seojun
and asked him to just hear me out.

254
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,036
-WOOSHIK: When?
-So

255
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,671
there was this time

256
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,207
when I wondered if I could ever succeed.

257
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,443
I was already close friends with you,

258
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,046
but I started to get depressed.
I couldn't get on stage.

259
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,014
People said, "Hey, you seem
to be doing okay."

260
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,051
But I wasn't doing okay. Nothing changed.

261
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,887
I felt anxious,
so I called Seojun and asked him.

262
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,856
And he told me something
and kept me going.

263
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,460
PEAKBOY: <i>He said, "There's a time
for a flower to bloom."</i>

264
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,664
<i>"You're doing well. There will come
a time for you to bloom too."</i>

265
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,633
That helped me out so much.

266
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,402
Those words helped me endure back then.

267
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,738
There's something that I always say.

268
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,407
In a 100m sprint,
everyone has a different starting point

269
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,544
and if you're on the outer lane,
you get to start further in.

270
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,313
But you don't know
who will finish first in the end.

271
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,615
-It isn't "I want to finish first"...
-PEAKBOY: Right.

272
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,917
...but it's just "I want to finish it."

273
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,219
-There's no reason to get there fast.
-Right.

274
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,121
As long as you don't fall
and get knocked out--

275
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,956
-It's just a slight difference.
-WOOSHIK: Exactly.

276
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,057
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

277
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,593
-SEOJUN: You just have to finish it.
-As long we finish it, it's fine.

278
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,863
We're all working hard to reach that goal,

279
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,165
so why are we in such a rush to get there?

280
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,633
What's the point in becoming first?

281
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,470
What matters is that you can do it
for the rest of your life.

282
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,972
(sighs)

283
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,474
V: <i>It's so nice to talk.</i>

284
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:22,975
SEOJUN: <i>It's nice
to talk about these things.</i>

285
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,276
HYUNGSIK: <i>I love it.</i>

286
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,178
PEAKBOY: <i>It's different.</i>

287
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,115
V: <i>Hey, why did he do that?</i>

288
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,316
V CALLS SOMEONE

289
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,283
(phone chimes)

290
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,685
MAN: <i>Where are you, bro?</i>

291
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,053
V (in English): <i>Hey, guys.</i>

292
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,855
HYUNGSIK: <i>Who is it?</i>

293
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,223
MAN: <i>Hello, Hyungsik.</i>

294
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,924
Oh, hello.

295
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:39,892
SEOJUN: Is that J-Hope?

296
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,460
-Yeah, it is.
-J-HOPE: <i>Hello.</i>

297
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,462
-Nice to meet you.
-J-HOPE: <i>You guys are together.</i>

298
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,731
<i>I can see him.</i>

299
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,066
Hello.

300
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,734
J-HOPE: <i>Have fun.</i>

301
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,836
-Yes, we'll have fun.
-(laughter)

302
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,606
-Yes, we'll have fun.
-<i>No, no.</i>

303
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,910
-SEOJUN: It keeps cutting off.
-Yeah, the connection isn't great here.

304
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,545
J-HOPE: <i>Okay, have fun, V.</i>

305
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,613
V: <i>Okay.</i>

00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,326
WOOSHIK: Yeah.

462
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,961
PEAKBOY: Time flies.

463
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,931
V: Let's chat like this.

464
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,165
BUT THEY DON'T WANT
TO FALL ASLEEP JUST YET

465
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,433
-WOOSHIK: Yeah, let's chat.
-PEAKBOY: Let's chat.

466
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,334
WOOSHIK: Yeah.

467
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,870
When would we ever get to do this?

468
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,372
("Unforgettable" playing)

469
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,909
WOOSHIK:
<i>Let's talk about our goals for 2022.</i>

470
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,915
I'll be in search
of true happiness this year.

471
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,450
You see,

472
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,688
I started acting
because I liked it and was having fun,

473
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,557
but at some point, it stopped being fun.

474
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,893
PEAKBOY:
It must have been too much for you.

475
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,697
WOOSHIK: <i>Regardless of the result,</i>

476
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,601
<i>I'd like to be really happy
with what I do.</i>

477
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,304
HYUNGSIK: <i>I'd like to do something,</i>

478
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,674
<i>whether it's on OTT or something else,</i>

479
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,445
that would make me proud of myself.

480
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,081
-PEAKBOY: We're proud of you now.
-WOOSHIK: Hey.

481
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,818
HYUNGSIK: But that becomes
a positive stimulant for me.

482
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:00,719
SEOJUN: That's good.

483
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,287
HYUNGSIK: I think
it makes me want to continue

484
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,224
to try things and challenge myself.

485
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,997
<i>So I'd like to
do my best this year as well.</i>

486
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,401
WOOSHIK: <i>We should work hard</i>

487
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,638
<i>so that we can become
a driving force for you.</i>

488
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,240
V: I hope that...

489
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,744
I won't be sad.

490
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,383
PEAKBOY: What you just said
really makes me think.

491
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,018
HYUNGSIK: It implies a lot of things.

492
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,023
WOOSHIK: <i>Even if that's how you think,</i>

493
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,392
<i>we'll be there for you

-PEAKBOY: <i>Okay, V?</i>

495
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,863

503
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,388
HYUNGSIK: Why are you crying?

504
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,789
SEOJUN: His lips are pointing down.

505
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,857
HYUNGSIK: What's going on?

506
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,792
SEOJUN: We have to record this.

507
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,864
-Why are you crying?
-WOOSHIK: What's wrong, V?

508
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,732
PEAKBOY: Don't cry, V.

509
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,068
WOOSHIK: Why are you crying
all of a sudden?

510
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,070
-SEOJUN: Why are you crying?
-V: Turn it off.

511
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,275
-Come on.
-Gosh.

512
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,212
HYUNGSIK: What's making you so sad, V?

513
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,781
(Seojun sighs)

514
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,650
V: <i>It was a little disappointing
this last year.</i>

515
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,752
-WOOSHIK: <i>You were disappointed?</i>
-V: <i>Yeah.</i>

516
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,922
WOOSHIK: <i>But that year has gone by now.</i>

517
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,223
PEAKBOY: <i>Something good will come now.</i>

518
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,560
WOOSHIK: <i>Everyone has a bad year
and a bad time.</i>

519
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,395
SEOJUN: <i>Of course. We all do.</i>

520
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,465
WOOSHIK: <i>Hey!</i>

521
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,835
<i>The year of the black tiger is good
for those born in the year of the horse.</i>

522
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,071
<i>V, take all of my good energy.</i>

523
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:05,210
HYUNGSIK: <i>How nice.
I'm totally awake now.</i>

524
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,845
PEAKBOY: <i>I know.
V's crying woke me right up.</i>

525
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,713
WOOSHIK: Honestly,

526
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:13,718
this is because we're really good friends.

527
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:19,391
V is still at the age
where he has to overcome

528
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,294
difficult moments and experiences,

529
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:26,565
but I think we viewed them
from our perspectives.

530
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,099
MAYBE HE COULDN'T SHOW HIS FEELINGS

531
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,971
I think it's so nice
that you think that way.

532
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,675
WOOSHIK: <i>Hey, V.</i>

THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY
OF THEIR TRIP IS ALREADY HERE

THEY'RE ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER

V REWATCHES WOOSHIK'S DRAMA

558
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,590
How many times are you watching that?

559
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,659
I think you just wanted to
see me being in love.

560
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:38,196
I guess I just wanted to see you
make toast for me.

561
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,699
Okay, I will. Scrambled eggs?

562
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,737
SEOJUN: I guess I just wanted to say
that I'd like anything you make.

You're here.

00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,879
Good morning.

-Do you want some coffee?
-Sure.

must be run by a married couple.

593
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,571
Yes, that's my wife.

It looks good.

601
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,488
WOOSHIK: Do you want me
to butter your bread?

602
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,123
-Okay.
-No, thanks.

603

V: No need for butter.

604

00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,563
HYUNGSIK: Thank you for the food.

617
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,476
It's good.

618
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:46,251
HE PUTS A SPOONFUL OF
STRAWBERRY JAM ON HIS BREAD

619
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,753
-Goodness.
-HYUNGSIK: Why so much jam?

620
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,522
Are you eating bread or jam?

621
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,689
V: I love jam.

622
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,558
Gosh, you really are

623
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,995
-a jam-lover, aren't you?
-Yeah.

624
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,298
Jam-lover, pass the jam.

625
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,706
SEOJUN: Wooshik,
can I have some rice soup now?

626
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,241
(Hyungsik laughs)

627
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
HYUNGSIK: Koreans need it.

628
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,878
Do we have the ingredients to make <i>jjigae?</i>

629
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:14,946
No.

630
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,081
SEOJUN: We don't have anything
to make lunch.

631
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,149
WOOSHIK: Should we order something?

632
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,150
-Hey.
-Not bad.

633
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,819
-That's not a bad idea.
-<i>Jjajangmyeon</i>?

634
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,954
-<i>Jjajangmyeon</i>.
-I haven't had <i>jjajangmyeon</i> in ages.

635
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,124
-WOOSHIK: Let's order <i>jjajangmyeon</i> then.
-V: Okay.

636
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,293
SEOJUN: We should clean up.

637
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,727
THEY'RE FINISHED WITH BREAKFAST

638
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,331
PEAKBOY: <i>The weather is nice today.</i>

639
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,999
V: <i>Yeah, it's nice today.</i>

640
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,371
HYUNGSIK: The pine trees look great.

641
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,775
THEY ENJOY THE VIEW WHILE LYING AROUND

642
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:49,547
THEY SPEND THEIR FREE TIME
WATCHING A DRAMA

643
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,187
SEOJUN JOINS THEM AFTER WASHING UP

644
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,488
(sighs)

645
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,857
(exhales)

646
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,292
HE SHOWS THEM SOMETHING

647
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,628
SEOJUN: <i>The sound of Choi Wooshik snoring.</i>

648
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,662
(soft chuckle)

649
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,236
-SEOJUN: This is you.
-No, it isn't. That's Hyungsik.

650
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,571
-It's Hyungsik.
-I recorded it like this.

651
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,308
-If he was by the wall, it was Peakboy.
-Hey, you slept at the end.

652
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,878
WOOSHIK: No, we switched places
before we fell asleep.

653
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,948
WOOSHIK'S EVIDENCE TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE

654
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,650
A PHOTO THAT SHOWS THE CULPRIT

655
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,951
-Who is that?
-Who is that?

656
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,286
Who do you think?

657
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,355
(all laughing)

658
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,357
The only person by the wall was you.

659
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,391
Wow, that's bad.

660
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,227
If you're looking for the guy
that slept by the wall, it's him.

661
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,795
PEAKBOY: That's bad.

662
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,530
It's this guy who slept by the wall.

663
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,799
(all laughing)

664
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,469
I told you. I don't snore.

665
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,637
PEAKBOY: I guess it was me.

666
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,571
What is that?

667
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,473
ANOTHER ORDINARY BUT SPECIAL MEMORY

668
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,309
-I'm going to keep this.
-This is going to be my wallpaper.

669
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,844
I'll make it my wallpaper too.

670
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,712
(both chuckle)

671
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,116
Let's work out.
I'm ready to take my shirt off.

672
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,550
I don't want to see it.

673
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,585
(chuckles)

674
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,088
-SEOJUN: Should we work out?
-WOOSHIK: Where?

675
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,058
-V: Who wants to go to the sauna with me?
-Me.

676
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,793
Let's go.

677
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,096
THEY SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS
FOR THEIR FREE TIME

678
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,898
-PEAKBOY: <i>Wait.</i>
-SEOJUN: <i>Stand taller.</i>

679
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,400
<i>Good.</i>

680
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,636
THE TWO START WORKING OUT

681
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,273
If it's hard on your knees, spread them
instead of putting them together.

682
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,542
(Peakboy exhales)

683
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,145
(grunts)

684
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,949
HIS FORM IS PERFECT WITHOUT ANY WAVERING

685
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,522
(panting)

686
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,091
(laughs)

687
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,093
Just do six.

688
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,495
But in proper posture.

689
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,199
Jeez, it's hard to work out after so long.

690
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,770
TAKES A MOMENT TO SHOW OFF HIS MUSCLES

691
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,838
Try this.

692
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,341
THE END

693
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,976
Three.

694
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,044
Four.

695
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,647
Six.

696
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,215
Seven.

697
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:05,750
Eight.

698
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,353
SEOJUN: <i>Pull, then let it down.</i>

699
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,923
THEIR RIGOROUS TRAINING CONTINUES
WITHOUT A BREAK

700
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,325
(grunts)

701
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,727
SEOJUN: Last one.

702
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,565
(grunting)

703
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,734
Are we done working out now?

704
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,901
-No.
-Why?

705
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,802
There's more.

706
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,805
SEOJUN: We have to do arms and abs.

707
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,274
IT ISN'T OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER

708
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,677
MEANWHILE, THESE THREE ENJOY THE SAUNA

709
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,012
V: <i>This is nice.</i>

710
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,913
<i>The sauna is so nice.</i>

711
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,049
-WOOSHIK: It's so nice.
-Yeah.

712
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,285
-It would be so nice to have this at home.
-Yeah.

713
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,354
WOOSHIK: I'm really going
to work out a lot.

714
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,792
I'm going to start working out
as soon as I return from Goseong.

715
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,861
-V: Let's do it together.
-WOOSHIK: Shall we?

716
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,796
SEOJUN: Just keep going.

717
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,798
AND IT'S STILL GOING ON FOR ONE PERSON

718
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,500
NO, TWO PEOPLE

719
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,101
This is how you do it.

720
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,404
You have to squeeze the triceps.

721
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,010
-(grunts)
-No, like this.

722
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,446
THE STRICT INSTRUCTOR CORRECTS HIS FORM

723
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,614
Keep this still.

724
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,848
Slightly.

725
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,885
Do I look funny to you?

726
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,221
Hey, I'm Peakboy.

727
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,393
-That's so hard.
-I have no words.

728
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,394
(groans)

729
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,597
SEOJUN: Let's do these last two sets
and we're done.

730
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,498
PEAKBOY: Okay.

731
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,499
LASTLY, THE AB WORKOUT

732
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,735
One, two.

733
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,538
Four, five, six.

734
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,573
Nine, ten.

735
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,176
And the last set.

736
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,077
SEOJUN IS FINISHED

737
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,913
NEXT, PEAKBOY'S LAST SET

738
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,454
-(laughs)
-Let's go.

739
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,888
Let's go.

740
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,224
One, two.

741
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,661
Four, five.

742
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,297
Eight, nine.

743
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,932
(exhales)

744
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,901
I DID MY BEST...

745
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:04,936
Well done.

746
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,371
-That was tiring.
-I'm going to take a shower.

747
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,606
THE SPARTAN WORKOUT IS OVER

748
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,708
V: That's so refreshing.

749
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,809
(water running)

750
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,155
(sighs)

751
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,299
(whirring)

752
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,340
THE THREE LOOK EXTRA NEAT

753
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:47,178
THEY GO STRAIGHT BACK TO BED

754
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:53,484
THEIR LEISURELY TIME CONTINUES

755
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,753
WOOSHIK: <i>I wore this.</i>

756
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,422
-<i>You want to wear it like this?</i>
-V: <i>Yeah, I'll wear it like this.</i>

757
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,824
Aren't you wearing those pants...

758
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,926
(clears throat)
...way too high?

759
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,494
V IS BORROWING WOOSHIK'S CLOTHES

760
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,795
No. This is right.

761
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,797
-What is?
-Try this on.

762
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,074
WOOSHIK: Looks cute. It looks good on you.

763
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:17,975
(clicks tongue)

764
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,545
Of course, you'd look good in anything.

765
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,445
(sighs)

766
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,551
SEOJUN: <i>Whoever wants some, come here.</i>

767
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,451
(indistinct chatter)

768
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,486
(objects clatter)

769
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,123
-SEOJUN: I'm only saying this once.
-V: Okay.

770
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,459
PEAKBOY: Wooshik, we're getting
a makeup lesson right now.

771
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,694
SEOJUN'S BEAUTY CLASS IS OPEN

772
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,628
SEOJUN: All right.

773
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:42,266
<i>Dab it on your nose, cheekbones,
chin, and forehead.</i>

774
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,634
WOOSHIK: <i>I see.</i>

775
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,670
SEOJUN: <i>And then you just rub it in well.
That's it.</i>

(V chuckles)

778
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,075
EVERYONE DABS IT ON

779

V: <i>If I wear makeup, won't I appear in 3D?</i>

-V: You look good.
-I put a little on.

784
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,689
-V: How do I look?
-HYUNGSIK: Good.

785
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,724
-V: Really?
-HYUNGSIK: It looks really natural.

786
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,761
ONE PERSON ISN'T SATISFIED

787
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,730
WOOSHIK: Mine looks unnatural.

788
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,267
-SEOJUN: What?
-Mine looks very unnatural.

789
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,269
What do I do?

790
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,537
SEOJUN: You're unnaturally popular.

791
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,372
PEAKBOY: You're unnaturally popular now.

(hair dryer whirs)

793
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,377
ANYWAY, THEY ARE READY TO GO OUT

794
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,247
-WOOSHIK: Aren't you hungry?
-PEAKBOY: Let's get something to eat.

795
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,716
-SEOJUN: Then, I want <i>gan-jjajang</i>, V.
-HYUNGSIK: I want <i>gan-jjajang</i> too.

796
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,551
WOOSHIK: <i>Gan-jjajang</i>! Sweet and sour pork!

797
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,653
-PEAKBOY: <i>Gan</i> and pork?
-WOOSHIK: <i>Gan</i> and pork.

798
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,955
SEOJUN: The <i>jjajangmyeon</i> is here.

799
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,427
WOOSHIK: Do you like to pour the sauce
or dip it in the sauce?

800
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,664
PEAKBOY: Personally,
I pour the sauce on top.

801
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,934
-SEOJUN: Let's split it into two then.
-Yeah.

802
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,168
(Peakboy and Wooshik gasp)

803
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,139
-SEOJUN: We won't be eating all of it.
-I'm curious.

804
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,608
I really don't care.

805
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,244
-I like them both.
-I don't care either.

806
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,180
WOOSHIK: To be honest,
I don't understand things like that.

807
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,982
-PEAKBOY: Me neither.
-I don't get it when people argue over it.

808
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,717
"We have to pour it! What are you doing?"

809
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,020
Honestly, I really don't care
about things like that.

810
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:09,954
HYUNGSIK: I don't care either.

811
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,856
I don't talk to people who pour the sauce.

812
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,458
-WOOSHIK: Even though you pour it too?
-Right.

813
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,495
WOOSHIK: Even though you pour the sauce
you don't talk to others who do it?

814
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,164
PEAKBOY: It gets uncomfortable for
those of us who like to pour the sauce.

815
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,633
There aren't that many who pour the sauce.

816
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,836
-You're supposed to pour the sauce on top.
-WOOSHIK: That's right.

817
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,605
But why is your face so swollen?

818
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,741
-Why is my face so swollen?
-Your face was always swollen.

819
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,543
(laughing)

820
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,211
Who wants to add some <i>jjamppong</i> broth?

821
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,047
-Into your <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?
-Yeah.

822
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,148
Ooh.

823
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,817
-HYUNGSIK: Really? I'll give it a try.
-V: Yeah.

824
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,086
It makes it a little spicy

825
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,921
-Yeah.
-The noodles aren't soggy.

826
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:49,493
V: Mr. Paik Jongwon said it tastes better
if you add <i>jjamppong</i> broth to it.

827
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,895
(slurps)

828
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,798
-Mmm.
-PEAKBOY: How is it?

829
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,333
It's good.

830
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,734
PEAKBOY: Okay.

831
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,870
We used to eat this
only at middle school graduations.

832
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,079
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

833
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,447
(slurping)

834
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,386
V... eats a lot of <i>jjajangmyeon</i>,
doesn't he?

835
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,388
Yeah, he loves it.

836
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,423
You used to eat it
every other day, didn't you?

837
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,559
-V: I used to eat it that often.
-(slurping)

838
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,128
But I don't eat it that often these days.

839
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,463
-Really?
-Yeah.

840
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,667
(slurps)

841
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,042
(chomping)

842
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,078
I'm on a diet these days,

843
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,580
so I can't eat that much.

844
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,647
(slurps)

845
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,660
-(crunching)
-(sniffs)

846
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,195
What was that sound?

847
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,431
(chomping)

848
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,999
(indistinct chatter)

849
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,801
Hyungsik doesn't drink soda.

850
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,603
Really?

851
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,105
-You don't drink soda when you eat.
-Who?

852
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,173
Who doesn't drink it?

853
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,741
WHO DOESN'T DRINK IT??

854
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,709

855

(all laugh)

00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,679
He acted like he knew him.

859
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,120
SEOJUN: So what are we going to do today?

860
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,091
-WOOSHIK: So today, our goal...
-SEOJUN: All we did is eat.

861
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:32,329
...is to go skating, and then come back
and make spicy chicken stew.

862
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,799
SEOJUN: We'll be back by nine
at the earliest.

863
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,701
Do you all know how to skate?

864
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,570
I can skate well.

865
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,539
Today will be my second time.

866
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,908
-Really?
-Yeah.

867
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,010
-You're a beginner.
-It'll be my third time.

868
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,379
SEOJUN: I haven't gone that often either.

869
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,449
-Haven't you been to an ice rink?
-No, I haven't.

870
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,617
The only thing I know how to ride...

871
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,052
-A sled?
-...are shoes with wheels.

872
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,855
-BOTH: What?
-Shoes with wheels.

873
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,257
I'm really good at riding those.

874
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,726
Did you wear those
when you were in school?

875
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,028
V: Yeah.

876
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,529
-PEAKBOY: With your uniform?
-V: Yeah.

877
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,033
I wore my backpack,
put my hands in my pocket

878
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,568
-So, that was you.
-(whistles)

879
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,770
I was like a pro when I was young.

880
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,405
-Really?
-In my neighborhood.

881
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,173
-Shoes with wheels?
-No, inline skating.

882
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,510
I was pretty famous
in my neighborhood too.

883
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,245
-(laughing)
-For being a delinquent?

884
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,379
(laughing continues)

885
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,014
WOOSHIK: I was quite famous.

886
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,119
Come to think of it,
I don't think any of us

887
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,355
are that hyper, are we?

888
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,957
-No.
-No.

889
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:37,194
I wonder what the viewers would think
when they see us hanging out like this.

890
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,230
They'll think that
we don't know how to have fun.

891
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,766
Honestly, even our jokes

892
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,235
-are only funny to us.
-Yeah.

893
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,703
If I do that elsewhere...

894
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,572
You have to have the same sense of humor.

895
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,974
I like our sense of humor.

896
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,810
No one here dislikes it.

897
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,146
Wipe the sauce off your face.

898
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,615
(laughter)

899
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,950
PEAKBOY: Is that sauce or a mole?

900
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,322
-SEOJUN: Let's clean up and go.
-WOOSHIK: Okay.

901
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,791
-V: Let's put the plastics here.
-PEAKBOY: Let's take this.

902
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,692
SEOJUN: Here's the lid.

903
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:15,466
CLEANING UP AFTER THEIR MEAL

904
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,170
V: Guess what song that is?

905
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,473
-WOOSHIK: Hey, it's "Snow Flower".
-PEAKBOY: "Snow Flower."

906
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,275
-SEOJUN: "Snow Flower."
-PEAKBOY: It's "Snow Flower," right?

907
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,476
V: It is.

908
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,911
(V laughing)

909
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,046
HYUNGSIK: <i>That was delicious.</i>

910
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,149
WOOSHIK: Shall we go?

911
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,684
(Wooshik laughing)

912
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,152
PEAKBOY: Where are we going?

913
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,688
-SEOJUN: The coast.
-WOOSHIK: The coast first?

914
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,026
Today is going to be more...

915
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,361
fun than yesterday.

916
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,500
(sniffs)

917
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,703
Look at that beautiful view
of the mountain in the back.

918
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:56,173
-The mountains on the right are so pretty.
-PEAKBOY: Right? They're gorgeous.

919
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,108
-V: They're so pretty.
-ALL: They are.

920
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,777
V: Wow.

921
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:00,744
(Hyungsik humming)

922
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,879
V: I love this vibe.

923
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,549
THE WORLD IS THE SAME AS YESTERDAY

924
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,421
THE TIME CONTINUES TO GO BY

925
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,992
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TIME

926
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,530
BUT IT'S MORE SPECIAL
BECAUSE THEY'RE TOGETHER

927

00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,440
I'm feeling sad all of a sudden.

932
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:30,975
V: Why?

933
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,212
Because today is the last day of our trip.

934
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,146
HYUNGSIK: Aww.

935
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,016
PEAKBOY: The time went by
much faster than I expected.

936
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,518
-I know. It flew by.
-HYUNGSIK: It flew by.

937
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,387
Times like these fly by.

938
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,423
WOOSHIK: Even when we're hanging out,
we have to use it effectively.

939
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,926
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah, because it isn't endless.
-WOOSHIK: Yeah.

940
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,531
-We were so envious of things like this.
-We were.

941
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,436
WOOSHIK: When we used to see friends
go on trips together on other shows.

942
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,805
Yeah, we were envious.

943
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,575
But in the end, we got to do it too.

944
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,377
SEOJUN: But honestly,

945
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,545
going penniless is the best.

946
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,214
-Yeah.
-Right.

947
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,082
-Backpacking.
-SEOJUN: Right.

948
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,317
-Backpacking sounds great.
-It does.

949
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,685
-I want to go too.
-Me too.

950
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,955
Should we go backpacking next time?

951
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,257
-Yeah.
-I'd love that.

952
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,459
Going on a backpacking trip sounds great.

953
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,130
-We can cook rice in a pot.
-Yeah.

954
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,364
Have you tried it before?

955
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,732
Wooshik must be good at it.

956
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,001
-I'm not. It's hard.
-It's hard to make rice in a pot.

957
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,069
Rice in a pot is hard.

958
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:32,970
REAL-LIFE WORRIES

959
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,572
We'll keep eating hamburgers then.

960
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:36,807
(chuckles)

961
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,743
SEOJUN: But I think anything would taste
good under those circumstances.

962
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,944
-Yeah.
-You're right.

963
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,314
Do you guys have a bucket list?

964
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,917
-I'm sure we all do.
-Doesn't everybody have one?

965
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,754
Don't you all have something
you want to do before you die?

966
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,756
-Like what?
-I want to try skydiving.

967
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,525
-Skydiving.
-Skydiving?

968
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,628
-I highly recommend skydiving.
-I was so jealous when you did it.

969
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:02,399
And I'd like to take a helicopter
to the top of a mountain and ski down.

970
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,501
-That's very...
-Isn't that too extreme?

971
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,538
I want to try those things before I die.

972
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,640
-Do them before you turn 40.
-(laughing)

973
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,742
Yeah, my knees will be trembling by then.

974
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,178
I want to live abroad.

975
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,514
I have that desire too.
I want to live abroad.

976
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,084
I want to go somewhere
where there's a lot of nature.

977
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,686
I'm going to take
a family portrait this year.

978
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,021
-Nice.
-That's nice.

979
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:28,058
I don't know
if I could ever try directing,

980
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,296
but I'd at least like
to try producing something.

981
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,798
-I think you can do it.
-I think you'll be good at it.

982
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:38,669
You know what?
If you get to produce something later on,

983
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,705
-SEOJUN: I can work with you on it.
-You will?

984
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,173
-Yeah.
-PEAKBOY: Right.

985
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,476
On our backpacking trip,
you can film a road movie.

986
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,844
-That's nice.
-V: Exactly.

987
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,680
-Exactly. Everyone can pack their gear.
-PEAKBOY: That's a great idea.

988
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,116
-After we set up everything to make music,
-HYUNGSIK: Right.

989
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,784
-we can start recording there too.
-HYUNGSIK: Right.

990
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,886
-We can make our own background music too.
-Yeah.

991
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,187
-Let's really do that.
-ALL: Yeah.

992
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,289
SEOJUN: I think a road movie will be nice.

993
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,591
JUST LIKE THAT, THEY PLAN THEIR NEXT TRIP

994
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,260
WOOSHIK:
Seojun, what's on your bucket list?

995
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,995
My bucket list?

996
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,064
-Something simple.
-PEAKBOY: Simple.

997
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,066
You can just say one thing you want to do.

998
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,402
-That's what worries me these days.
-What?

999
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,071
There's nothing I want to do.

1000
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,572
Ah...

1001
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,075
-That's not good.
-SEOJUN: It all becomes work.

1002
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,644
That happens.

1003
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,846
WOOSHIK: I don't think
that's a bad thing though.

1004
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,716
But if you feel that way about it...

1005
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,318
I think that a certain level
of emptiness is good.

1006
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,219
-HYUNGSIK: Right.
-Me too.

1007
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,354
THEY ALL EMPATHIZE WITH SEOJUN

1008
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,655
Oh.

1009
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,124
I realized that even if I'm not that busy,

1010
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,627
there are plenty of ways to be happy,

1011
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:40,831
so why did I work so hard?
I kept thinking like that.

1012
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,566
THEY START HAVING THESE LITTLE QUESTIONS

1013
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,001
Hmm...
(clicks tongue)

1014
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,537
I still enjoy acting and all,

1015
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:51,141
but there isn't that excitement I had
when I first started.

1016
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:56,313
SEOJUN: I think I'm in a period where
I'm conflicted with thoughts like that.

1017
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,482
-(smacks lips)
-HYUNGSIK: Hmm...

1018
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,217
I feel like,

1019
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:05,222
including my acting career,
I'm entering a different phase in life.

1020
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,723
-Ah...
-Hmm.

1021
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,192
You have to rest well.

1022
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,094
-Yeah, you do have to rest well.
-PEAKBOY: You have to rest well.

1023
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,531
What do you think resting well is?

1024
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,600
That's hard to answer.

1025
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,236
Right? I don't know
what it means to rest well.

1026
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,140
WOOSHIK: The thing is,
that's a tough question

1027
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,076
because being an actor means

1028
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,878
that you have to constantly

1029
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,746
-inquire about scripts.
-Right.

1030
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,249
And once you look at the script,

1031
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,318
even if you haven't started filming,

1032
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,054
-and it won't start until a few months...
-Yeah.

1033
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,756
-...your mind is already tired...
-From that point.

1034
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:44,728
-...because it's already there.
-It's there, so you aren't resting.

1035
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,364
That's why I think

1036
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,334
resting means not having your cell phone.

1037
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,702
Yeah, I heard that's important.

1038
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:55,105
I think going to nature
is the best way to really rest.

1039
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,042
WOOSHIK: When we're gathered together,
we don't look at our cell phones either.

1040
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,943
-HYUNGSIK: Yeah.
-SEOJUN: We don't.

1041
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,845
-WOOSHIK: I think that's good.
-SEOJUN: Yeah.

1042
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,981
We do look at our phones,
but it hardly even counts.

1043
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,349
-Right.
-HYUNGSIK: Right.

1044
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:09,052
Talking about things like this
is what resting is.

1045
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,254
THIS MOMENT IS REALLY RESTING

1046
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,689

I think we're resting well right now.

-It's ice.

00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:52,663
FINALLY AT THE BEACH

00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,398

-The waves are so high.
-WOOSHIK: For real.

1065

WOOSHIK: Is this why people want to
go see the ocean in the winter?

1066
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,774
-Because of the high waves?
