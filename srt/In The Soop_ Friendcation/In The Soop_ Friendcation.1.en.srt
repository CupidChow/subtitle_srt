00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,374
(theme music)

3
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,963
IN THE SOOP: FRIENDCATION

00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,142
HYBE HEADQUARTERS

5
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,013
V: This is nice.

6
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,448
Hey, you're here.

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,382
CHOI WOOSHIK

00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,384
PARK HYUNGSIK

9
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,485
(V exclaims)

10
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,386
V

11
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,588
-(V exclaims)
-(laughing)

12
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,623
HYUNGSIK: Yo, yo.

13
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,392
PEAKBOY

14
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,361
-PRODUCER: Hello.
-SEOJUN: I arrived the latest.

15
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,495
(plastic rustles)

16
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,330
-SEOJUN: What's all this?
-PEAKBOY: There's so much.

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,331
-HYUNGSIK: I know.
-(Wooshik laughs)

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,468
THEIR FRIENDSHIP STARTED
THROUGH SEOJUN IN 2018

19
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,004
(all singing)

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,906
(upbeat music playing)

21
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,807
ARE FUN WHEN THEY'RE TOGETHER

22
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:19,479
THESE FIVE FRIENDS
ARE MORE THAN JUST FAMILY

23
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,482
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS,
THEY GO ON A WINTER TRIP

24
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,551
SEOJUN: How did it end up like this?

25
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,886
-I haven't even shaved.
-(laughter)

26
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,488
This is insane.

27
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,590
To put it into more detail,

28
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,859
-it might have seemed a little annoying...
-STAFF: Yes.

29
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,328
...but I think it has been
delivered very clearly.

30
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,896
Back then, the car was--

31
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,532
You told us clearly
that we can just do it.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,335
So I asked him what we're actually doing.

33
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,040
I already told you everything, but...

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,375
-We went over this last time.
-Yes.

35
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,111
Yes, but it wasn't like this.

36
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,613
Yes, but I didn't know much about it,

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,915
so I just said we should give it a try.

38
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,117
"LET'S GIVE IT A TRY"

39
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,551
That's how it ended up like this.

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,956
Anyway, I do strongly feel
like I have been tricked into this.

41
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,158
How can you eat right now?

42
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,860
I'm so hungry though.

43
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,229
-This is good.
-Eat first, then.

44
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,897
I hope it'll go well.

45
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,734
This has been organized
off the cuff, hasn't it?

46
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,469
THE STAFF RECEIVED A CALL FROM V ON MONDAY

47
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,671
AFTER AN EMERGENCY MEETING
THEY GOT A FILM CREW READY,

48
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,341
WENT SCOUTING ON TUESDAY,
AND ORGANIZED THIS MEETING FOR WEDNESDAY

49
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,412
-So this is going to be a proper thing.
-STAFF: Yes.

50
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,449
On this show, this guy is going to...

51
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,284
You'll look really pitiful. Is that okay?

52
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,218
Can we destroy him?

53
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,787
-Destroy him?
-You'll have to retire, then.

54
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,456
I'm okay with showing myself.

55
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,724
SEOJUN: You'll really regret it.

56
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,126
-He does seem rather startled.
-Even on typical days...

57
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,529
We're still shooting a show, aren't we?

58
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,630
(laughter)

59
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,766
I thought we were only
filming a montage up until today.

60
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,137
Let's only show people
how well we get along on this show.

61
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,672
(laughter)

62
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,607
Let's just be mindful of that
for the camera.

63
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,043
Let's get along.

64
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,012
You can count on me.

65
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,481
So this is for three nights and four days?

66
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,750
And first of all,
Hyungsik is only available for two days.

67
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,618
I arrive on the morning of the 10th.

68
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,920
After arriving on the 10th?

69
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,888
And I'll stay until the night of the 11th.

70
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,056
HE'LL JOIN ON THE SECOND DAY

71
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,627
Ah... Timeout. I can only go
after my plans on the ninth.

72
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,329
-You'll arrive at night too?
-Yeah.

73
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,397
-At night?
-Yeah.

74
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,998
Then, shall we leave first?

75
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,334
-Let's get there first, then.
-Sure.

76
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,102
The three of us will go first.

77
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,837
Okay, I'll be there soon on the ninth.

78
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,173
-I'll head over as soon as I'm done too.
-Mm.

79
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,475
I didn't know it would go this far.

80
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,077
I know.

81
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,679
But...

82
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,647
I do think it'll be fun.

83
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,883
-SEOJUN: Of course.
-Yes, I think it'll be fun.

84
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,651
I just

85
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,221
really wanted to make memories.

86
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,856
Sure. Since it's already come to this,

87
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,192
let's do it.

88
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,094
So do we just act like we're hanging out?

89
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,662
Not acting. We are hanging out.

90
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,698
-Okay, then.
-(claps)

91
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,765
You know,

92
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,770
this is the first time we got together
after Wooshik's fanmeet.

93
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,539
How long has it been

94
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,875
-since I've seen you, Peakboy?
-SEOJUN: He has been so busy.

95
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,544
No, I'm not busy.

96
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,645
Oh.

97
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,113
Then that doesn't make sense.

98
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,948
You haven't been seeing us on purpose?

99
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,617
No, I was busy.

100
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,851
You're an opportunist.

101
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,986
(laughs)

102
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,322
Anyway, let's give it our best.
Let's do this.

103
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,992
We need to think about what we'll do.

104
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,495
Then, let's spend time staring at the fire

105
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,663
-every day.
-I can do that.

106
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,566
-I can do that every day too. I love that.
-I want to stare at the fire.

107
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,302
It'll be nice to keep it going
since it's cold.

108
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,870
-Staring at the fire.
-That's the best.

109
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,939
Fishing. Let's go fishing.

110
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,507
-Barbecue.
-Barbecue.

111
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,176
-What about ice skating?
-That sounds great.

112
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:41,281
I don't know how to inline skate,
but I can ice skate a bit.

113
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,883
Really? Is that why you recommended it?

114
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,285
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

115
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,988
-Since he wants to go ice skating...
-Yes. Show us how you ice skate.

116
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,125
-Do whatever you want, V.
-Yes. Let's try it there.

117
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,793
It's not that I want to show you.

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,829
It isn't that I'm greedy
for more screen time,

119
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,532
-but it'd be fun to go together.
-It would.

120
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,800
-Of course.
-Sure.

121
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,369
(sucks teeth)
Mmm...

122
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,371
-Do we have to cook all our meals?
-Let's do it.

123
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,707
-We can do it.
-Sure, we can make our own meals.

124
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,743
-That would be nice.
-Yes, let's give that a try then.

125
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,545
-We should prepare.
-Isn't it good?

126
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,114
-This one is really good.
-When is it again?

127
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,215
The day after tomorrow?

128
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,483
-The day after tomorrow?
-No.

129
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,152
-No?
-It's in three days.

130
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,454
If I had known it would be like this,

131
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,391
I would've had my hair and makeup done.

132
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,160
-Hey.
-Jeez.

133
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,895
(abrupt laughter)

134
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,431
Won't everyone be
wearing their own clothes?

135
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,399
Your stylists won't be
packing for you, right?

136
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,801
Of course not. That's too much.

137
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,736
Let's not go that far.

138
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,538
But I'll be the most dressed up.

139
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,373
Everyone will be...

140
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,545
-Gosh. What am I going to wear?
-You have a lot of clothes.

141
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,846
Dress like this.

142
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,249
-All I need is some sweatpants.
-Wooshik, want me to buy you a mannequin?

143
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,484
-A mannequin?
-Yes.

144
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,020
-You can style it up.
-And dress it up?

145
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,722
I have to dress up based on a lookbook.

146
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,558
-The top and bottom have to be one look?
-Right.

147
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,593
Should we all get matching pajamas?

148
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,895
-Let's do that.
-Let's get a uniform.

149
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,631
-For indoors?
-Yes.

150
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,333
We don't have enough time though.

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,069
-Let's order online.
-Yeah, order it,

152
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,337
and we'll get it by tomorrow.

153
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,639
-(laughter)
-Get one that has express delivery.

154
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,110
All right. Then I'm going to quickly plan

155
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,645
on how I'm going to act.

156
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,414
I'm going to write it down on paper today.

157
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,383
"What I should be careful of
and what I can do."

158
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,518
I should write stuff down too.
"What I need to stop."

159
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,652
-Protect...
-(laughs)

160
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,888
-"What has to be protected."
-"What has to be protected."

161
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,690
(laughter)

162
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,525
-This is going to be fun.
-I know.

163
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,294
-HYUNGSIK: It's okay.
-V: Okay, let's do this.

164
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,230
-Put them in.
-PEAKBOY: Want us to put them in? Sure.

165
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,031
-We'll grant your wish.
-(laughter)

166
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,034
SEOJUN:
You can't do things like this, okay?

167
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,636
Let's be cool about it.

168
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,804
(clears throat)

169
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,274
-PEAKBOY: Let's see the plans later.
-You did it for him in the end.

170
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,342
THE EMERGENCY MEETING ENDS

171
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,911
PEAKBOY: Good job.

172
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,147
V: We got this, guys.

173
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,915
-Okay.
-Okay.

174
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,750
-ALL: Okay.
-HYUNGSIK: Okay, bye.

175
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,487
WINTER OF 2022

176
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,490
GANGWON-DO, GOSEONG

177
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,826
FOR 3 NIGHTS AND 4 DAYS

178
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,328
IT'S A REAL FRIENDCATION

179
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,631
SEOJUN, THE EMOTIONAL ANCHOR "DAD"

180
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,833
WOOSHIK: <i>He's the one
we depend on mentally.</i>

181
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,003
PEAKBOY, THE WILD "YOUNGEST DAUGHTER"

182
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,337
<i>He's always pumped up.</i>

183
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,973
WOOSHIK, THE TRUSTWORTHY "ELDEST SON"

184
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,842
HYUNGSIK: <i>He's a leader
to the younger guys.</i>

185
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,777
HYUNGSIK, THE KIND "MOM"

186
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,346
WOOSHIK: <i>He's a bit gentler than the dad.</i>

187
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,715
V, THE CUTE "YOUNGEST SIBLING"

188
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,384
<i>V's our mischievous youngest son.</i>

189
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,853
THEY EAT TOGETHER

190
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,855
WASH TOGETHER

191
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,857
SLEEP TOGETHER

192
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,860
THEY RECORD EVERY MOMENT
THEY SPEND TOGETHER ON THE TRIP

193
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,229
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK
TO OUR CHILDHOOD

194
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,566
V: <i>I didn't imagine I would be the worst,
but I guess I am.</i>

195
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,968
ALL: Whoa!

196
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,736
EVEN DURING UNEXPECTED MOMENTS

197
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,606
-PEAKBOY: Can we go home?
-WOOSHIK: I'm sorry!

198
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:59,011
THEY'RE HAPPY BECAUSE THEY'RE TOGETHER

199
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:04,684
THEIR EVENTFUL 3 NIGHTS AND 4 DAYS

200
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,153
NEVER BEEN REVEALED BEFORE

201
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,356
Anyway, you introduced those two.
Why did you do that?

202
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,060
THE TRUE STORY OF OUR FRIENDSHIP

203
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:19,298
WE ARE HAPPIER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY
AND TOMORROW MORE THAN TODAY

204
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,900
(all laughing)

205
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,904
-WOOSHIK: <i>V, are you crying?</i>
-V: <i>No.</i>

206
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,105
WOOSHIK: <i>Are you crying, V?</i>

207
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,577
V SUDDENLY CRIES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

208
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,882
IT STARTS NOW

209
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,552
EPISODE 1. A SUDDEN TRIP

210
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,089
FRIENDCATION
D-DAY

211
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,626
(soft upbeat music)

212
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,098
(grunts)

213
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,201
V: I told you not to wear shoe lifts.

214
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,836
-PEAKBOY: This?
-V: I told you not to wear those.

215
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,271
PEAKBOY: It came with it.

216
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,673
Everyone is dressed up.

217
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,108
I thought you'd wear sweatpants.

218
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,676
-SEOJUN: I did.
-V: I did.

219
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,977
SEOJUN: What is this then?

220
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,013
PEAKBOY:
I should've worn cool sweatpants too.

221
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:09,916
(grunts)

222
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,150
PEAKBOY: It's heavy.

223
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,853
(sighs)

224
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,092
V: You should pull out the car a little.

225
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,696
-V: I'll be the DJ for today.
-SEOJUN: Okay.

226
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,598
-SEOJUN: Here we go!
-PEAKBOY: Okay!

227
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,666
V: Okay!

228
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,136
-PEAKBOY: Okay.
-Okay.

229
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,837
SEOJUN: It isn't my car, guys.

230
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,739
V: Okay. Let's drive safely.

231
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,242
SEOJUN: Let's just go!

232
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,710
SEOJUN, PEAKBOY AND V
OFF TO GOSEONG

233
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,847
SEOJUN: Gosh, I can't believe we're going
to Gangwon-do together.

234
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,951
-It's our New Year's party.
-New Year's party?

235
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,986
A New Year's trip.

236
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,889
When did you guys pack?

237
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,425
-Early in the morning.
-This morning.

238
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,493
I packed this morning too.

239
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,130
But I forgot my Bluetooth speaker.

240
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,133
-Wouldn't they have a stereo there?
-I think so.

241
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,636
-We need to have music.
-V: Exactly.

242
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,440
-You wore shoes today, V.
-V: Yeah.

243
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,476
-What has gotten into you?
-You told me to wear shoes.

244
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,679
-I heard it's very cold.
-It'll be cold.

245
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,748
SEOJUN: Did you guys get some sleep?

246
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,451
-I think I slept about three hours.
-Me too.

247
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,721
I think I slept
about three, four hours too.

248
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,957
The micro-dust level is really bad today.

249
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,893
I bet the air in Gangwon-do will be nice.

250
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,429
I'm sure they'll use CG
to make the weather look nice.

251
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,330
(chuckles)

252
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,169
-<i>Makguksu</i> sounds great.
-V: <i>Makguksu.</i>

253
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,205
I want some with <i>suyuk.</i>

254
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:47,647
Seojun and I talked about
<i>makguksu</i> a lot yesterday.

255
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,650
-I'm only going to eat a little.
-V: What?

256
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,586
-PEAKBOY: I'm going to eat a little.
-Since you're working out?

257
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,389
Good one.

258
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,525
-(V laughing)
-I'm working out,

259
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,427
and I should take care of myself too.

260
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,728
(laughs)

261
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,664
-You should.
-Yes, you should.

262
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,702
V: It really does feel different.

263
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,772
I've always traveled with my members.

264
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,509
I was so worried about
whether we could really go or not.

265
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,278
When you went with your members,
did you go by car like this?

266
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,914
Yes, us too. We drove as well.

267
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,718
V: It has been so long
since we've been on a trip.

268
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,421
-SEOJUN: Right.
-V: Has it been three years or two?

269
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,158
-Has it been that long?
-V: As a group,

270
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,295
we went before Hyungsik went
to serve in the military.

271
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,231
-PEAKBOY: That's right.
-It was that one time.

272
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,633
It was only that one time.

273
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,002
Even at Wooshik's fanmeet,

274
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,837
Hyungsik couldn't join
due to his schedule.

275
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:50,276
Actually, the reason why we mentioned
going on a trip together

276
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,678
-was all because of Hyungsik.
-That's right.

277
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,881
Since he has been discharged
from the army, he should be having fun.

278
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,952
V, can we have some music
that's more upbeat?

279
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,789
Okay. Then should I play
some Korean pop ballads?

280
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,124
DJ V PICKS SOME NEW SONGS

281
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,227
(soft guitar music)

282
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,832
-PEAKBOY: Is it playing?
-No.

283
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm picking some out.

284
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,104
(both exclaim)

285
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,038
"LIE" BY ENAN

286
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,239
"Don't go."

287
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,578
This song was so popular
when I was in high school.

288
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,380
Ah...

289
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,983
-I sang this a lot at karaoke.
-I'm reminiscing now.

290
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,051
"Baby."

291
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,653
-"Baby, let's go."
-Yes, we sang this song a lot.

292
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,323
-Did you watch this drama?
-V: <i>Lovers of Paris?</i>

293
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,024
-Yes.
-I did.

294
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,195
-Weren't you in elementary school?
-V: Maybe middle school?

295
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,463
Really?

296
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,467
-Our first year of high school?
-V: Didn't this come out around 2004?

297
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,402
-It was when I was in high school.
-V: Really?

298
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,404
Then I was in elementary school.

299
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,874
You know what's funny?

300
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,611
It would be weird for a grade schooler
to hang out with a high schooler.

301
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,679
-Right.
-PEAKBOY: Yes.

302
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,615
How dare you try to join us?

303
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,849
(chuckles)

304
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,420
Then do you know the drama
<i>Sangdoo, Let's Go to School?</i>

305
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,523
-SEOJUN: I do.
-Of course, I know that drama.

306
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,125
I personally loved <i>I'm Sorry, I Love You</i>.

307
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,126
(groans)

308
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,632
<i>♪ I loved you ♪</i>

309
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,300
<i>Iris</i>.

310
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,803
V: No!

311
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:24,804
(chuckles)

312
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,938
No!

313
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,106

PEAKBOY: Guys, Peakboy

317
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,683
I'm sorry. I'm hungry.

00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,152
SEOJUN: First of all,

319
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,324
-I do think we have to get some groceries.
-V: We should.

320
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,426
SEOJUN: What do you want for dinner?

321
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,363
-Dinner?
-Shall we buy some steak and grill them?

322
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,932
-V: Yes.
-PEAKBOY: Okay.

STEAK FOR DINNER

324
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,070
V: This is the best last song.

346
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,356

-Should we order one <i>makguksu</i>?
-V: What?

350
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,129
SEOJUN: One <i>makguksu</i>.

00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,964
One <i>suyuk,</i> one potato pancake.

352
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,833
V: The noodle portions
are smaller than you think.

353
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,001
SEOJUN: Let's get double portions.

354
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,369
We can just order more later.

355

Oh.

369
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,936
I was so hungry.

370
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,070
(gasps)

371
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,472
-Thank you.
-WOMAN: We just boiled these.

372
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,640
It's good.

373
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,709
SEOJUN: Is this the spicy raw pollack?

374
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,179
-Let me try.
-(slurps)

375

00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,680
SEOJUN: It has been so long
since I last ate out.

382
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,681
Mm.

383

-Can I have this dumpling?

384
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,620
-WOMAN: It's the potato pancake.
-SEOJUN: Have it.

385
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,400
The potato pancake is good.

386
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,103
Mm.

387
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,704
Mmm.

388
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,773
SEOJUN: We're eating all of it.

389
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,276
I told you we would.
We're absolutely no joke.

390
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,112
WOMAN: Who ordered
the raw fish <i>makguksu</i>?

391
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,813
PEAKBOY:
Just put it in the middle, please.

392
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,516
This is <i>makguksu</i>
and that's raw fish <i>makguksu</i>, right?

393
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,586
"Put one ladle of <i>dongchimi</i> in it."

394
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,054
-One ladle?
-Yes.

395
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,088
Okay.

396
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,157
PEAKBOY: "Add one or two spoons of sugar."

397
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,892
V: One ladle.

398
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,696
-Here too?
-"One swirl of vinegar and perilla oil."

399
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,499
PEAKBOY: One spoonful of sugar.

400
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,535
-Is it the same for raw fish <i>makguksu</i>?
-I guess so.

401
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,237
PEAKBOY: One spoonful of sugar.

402
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,909
"Put as much mustard
and sauce as you'd like."

403
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,512
We can do that after we try it.

404
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,213
V: I'll mix it up.

405
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,120
Put a little bit of mustard in it.

406
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,257
-The mustard?
-I mean, the sauce.

407
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,192
V: Oh.

408
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,995
-PEAKBOY: This much?
-V: I think that's enough.

409
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,130
SEOJUN: Help yourselves.

410
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,131
-Okay.
-V: Okay.

411
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,499
SEOJUN: We'll put it in the middle.

412
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,668
(sucks teeth)
What should I eat first?

413
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,903
SEOJUN: I'll try this first.

414
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,907

00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,810

(slurps)

417
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,550
SEOJUN: It's really delicious.

418
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,617
V: Mm.

419
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,688
(slurping)

420
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,441
-Did you always like <i>makguksu</i>?
-Yes.

421
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,845
(slurps)

422
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,347
(Seojun sighs)

423
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,016
-Aren't you full?
-I'm full. Why am I full?

424
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,919
Me? I can eat a little more.

425
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,888
I did eat more than usual.

426
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,823
My stomach has shrunk.

427
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,692
Why?

428
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,295
I've been working out less, so it shrunk.

429
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,700
Lately, I'm trying to get into the habit

430
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,735
of chewing 100 times when I eat.

431
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,437
You only chewed three times right now.

432
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,606
I did, but I'm trying
to increase it to ten times.

433
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,774
I heard that it's important.

434
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,477
It isn't easy to be mindful of that.

435
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,312
But it helps with your digestion.

436
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,982
-You don't exercise these days, do you?
-No.

437
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,918
-I don't exercise these days.
-You did for a while.

438
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,952
(distant phone chimes)

439
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,020
You see...

440
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,188
A PHONE IS RINGING SOMEWHERE

441
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,589
You have a call.

442
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,625
(distant phone chiming)

443
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,060
I got it.

444
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,762
SEOJUN: I got it.

445
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,898
(humming)

446
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,133
(humming continues)

447
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,434
"Für Elise."

448
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:30,769
(chuckles)

449
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,770
PEAKBOY: Für V.

450
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,239
(humming)

451
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:38,010
I was told that I had to perform this
when I took violin lessons.

452
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,679
That's it!

453
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,215
(humming)

454
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,284
This is important, right?

455
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,820
If I don't get this, I can't do anything.
I need to find out.

456
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,857
-It's your ringtone, isn't it?
-What is your phone number?

457
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,659
-Is this your phone's ringtone?
-(laughter)

458
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,261
-V: Is it?
-WOMAN: Give it a call.

459
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,896
-Eh?
-You have to tell us your number.

460
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,965
-WOMAN: It's 010.
-Okay, one moment.

461
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,700
(laughter)

462
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:05,270
If you call her, I'll use
my voice recognition to find out.

463
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,539
We have to find out what it is, V.

464
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,274
-I'll call you.
-WOMAN: Okay.

465
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,778
(phone chiming)

466
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,845
Here it comes.

467
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,016
That's it.

468
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,919
What is it?

469
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,120
SEOJUN: Is that right?

470
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,055
(upbeat music playing)

471
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,323
That's not right.
(chuckles)

472
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,324

00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,656
PEAKBOY: I almost cursed just now.

633
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,291
(rattles)

634
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,094
SEOJUN: <i>I'm going to unpack.</i>

635
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,895
PEAKBOY: <i>Me too.</i>

636
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,066
(sighs)

637
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,802
THEIR BAGS GO TO THE SECOND ROOM

638
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,870
SEOJUN: Okay.

639
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,239
We can unpack here.

640
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,744
-You can unpack here too.
-PEAKBOY: Okay, I'll unpack here.

641
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,181
I don't have anything to unpack.
I just need to keep it open.

642
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,451
TOUGH

643
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:34,953
SEOJUN: Oh, yes. Where is it?

644
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,124
-SEOJUN: You didn't pack much, V.
-V: No.

645
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,227
SEOJUN: I packed quite a bit.

646
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,099
(laughter)

647
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,000
PACKED

648
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,169
V: So it's like that?

649
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,604
PEAKBOY: You packed so much.

650
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,505
V, SEOJUN

651
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,775
-SEOJUN: What?
-PEAKBOY: What did you pack?

652
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,344
-What's this?
-SEOJUN: Why did you pack a shopping bag?

653
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,612
V: My slippers.

654
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,180
You should have told me.

655
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,448
(Seojun chuckles)

656
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,851
I have to take my supplements.

657
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,186
SEOJUN CHECKS HIS SUPPLEMENTS

658
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,487
V: You brought a lot.

659
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,523
I'm sure someone would try
to take some of mine.

660
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,359
-PEAKBOY: This is so good.
-SEOJUN: I packed workout equipment too.

661
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
(clanks)

662
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,929
He brought a rod.

663
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,098
You can do everything with this.

664
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,833
(chuckles)

665
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,301
I know what it is.

666
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,237
-SEOJUN: <i>I can do everything with this.</i>
-V: <i>We have to listen to him.</i>

667
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,040
PEAKBOY: <i>If we don't listen to him,
he'll beat us up.</i>

668
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,909
(sighs)

669
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,945
-I'm tired just doing this.
-V: I'm really tired too.

670
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,847
Are you very tired?

671
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,717
V: Shall we go to the room?

672
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,819
PEAKBOY: Let's go, Seojun.

673
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,690
-Let's get some sleep.
-V: What?

674
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,792
-PEAKBOY: We should get some sleep.
-V: We should.

675
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,563
-PEAKBOY: We have to sleep to move.
-V: Yes, we have to sleep to move.

676
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,232
SEOJUN: You can sleep when you're dead.

677
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,034
PEAKBOY: Do you want to dream or sleep?

678
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,335
-(Seojun sighs)
-(V chuckles)

679
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,305
V: Here, I'll give you a pillow.

680
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,940
Thank you.
(Seojun grunts)

681
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:20,325
EVEN AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE LEAVING

682
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,862
WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME

683
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,533
V: <i>It's so warm here.</i>

684
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,640
SEOJUN: Now that I'm lying down,
I'm getting sleepy.

685
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,608
(sighs)

686
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,945
(Peakboy groans)

687
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,755
(V sighs)

688
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,197
(soft guitar music)

689
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,209
ONE BY ONE,

690
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:16,681
THEY FALL INTO A SWEET SLUMBER

691
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,083
(soft guitar music)

692
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:29,928
V WAKES UP FIRST FROM DEEP SLEEP

693
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:38,303
SEOJUN WAKES UP AFTER HIM

694
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,238
V: Are you up?

695
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,408
PEAKBOY: Gosh, I slept so well.

696
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,412
SEOJUN: Will steak be enough? Or...

697
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,013
V: Are you going to have a drink?

698
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,449
Yes. I think we should have a little.

699
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,819
A little until six in the morning?

700
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,487
Yes, let's drink until six.

701
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,923
-And go watch the sunrise?
-Yes. Then lunch...

702
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,491
For lunch, back to the <i>makguksu</i> place.

703
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,062
We'll get some <i>makguksu</i> again
and act like it was our first time there.

704
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,198
-PEAKBOY: Shall we go?
-SEOJUN: Let's hurry up and go.

705
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,001
V: I'll drive.

706
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,804
SEOJUN: Okay. Input the supermarket
into the GPS.

707
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:18,209
SEOJUN WORKED HARD
SO V SITS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT THIS TIME

708
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,886
PEAKBOY: <i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪</i>

710
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,996

00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,864
PEAKBOY: Be careful, V.

-PEAKBOY: Good job.
-SEOJUN: Let's go, V.

Shut off the car, V.

00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,606
Yes.

729
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,642

SEOJUN AND PEAKBOY: Here's one.

731
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,313

(laughing)

733
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,285
SEOJUN: Let's take a look around first.

734
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,990
-Strawberries?
-PEAKBOY: I like strawberries.

735
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,059
SEOJUN: It's from Geochang.

-V: Shine Muscat.
-PEAKBOY: Good.

738
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,333
Are you going to cook mushrooms too?

739
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,902
There's a mushroom set here.

740
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,770
V: Let's have king oyster mushrooms.

741
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:58,109
But we haven't decided what we'll eat,
so I don't know what we should buy.

742
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,412
SEOJUN: I can buy the ingredients
for the steak.

743
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,482
-PEAKBOY: What about breakfast?
-SEOJUN: Shall we just toast some bread?

744
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,684
V: With some cereal?

745
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,852
-With cereal?
-PEAKBOY: Okay.

746

-SEOJUN: Beef tenderloin?

758
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,514
-Beef tenderloin?
-PEAKBOY: Yes.

759
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,221
SEOJUN: <i>Tteokguk</i> is so easy too.

760
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,991
V: Shall we buy some chips?

-Let's get this much.
-PEAKBOY: Okay.

762

-PEAKBOY: This one?
-SEOJUN: The small one.

766
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,608
-Shouldn't you eat this, V?
-PEAKBOY: What? Why?

767
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,178
-SEOJUN: Peakboy should eat this.
-PEAKBOY: I want barley hardtack.

768
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,515
I don't eat cereal with milk.
I eat barley hardtack with milk.

769
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,618
-Thank you.
-V: Okay.

-SEOJUN: Did you get everything?
-V: Yes.

773
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,326
WITH BOTH HANDS FULL, THEY HEAD BACK

774
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,461
V: Let's go.

775
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,332
SEOJUN: If we don't have enough,
we can come again tomorrow.

776
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,570
Let's put away the groceries first.

777
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,908
SEOJUN: <i>After we put the groceries away,
let's change.</i>

778
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:37,809
-V: <i>Okay.</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>Okay.</i>

779
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,743

V: Let's change.

782
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,622
There aren't any bugs here.

783
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,558
-You're right.
-SEOJUN: That's because it's cold.

784
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,994
THE THREE GET CHANGED BEFORE THEY EAT

785
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,262
This is mine, isn't it?

786
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,365
SEOJUN: <i>I'm going with this color.</i>

787
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,568
-PEAKBOY: <i>Okay.</i>
-V: <i>Okay.</i>

788
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,137
PEAKBOY: What?

789
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,873
-Hang on.
-V: What is it?

790
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,575
PEAKBOY: Why are my pants so short?

791
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,310
(laughing)

792
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,978
THE PANTS AREN'T LONG ENOUGH FOR HIS LEGS

793
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,214
This isn't the fit I was going for.

794
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,281
(laughter)

795
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,784
That's because you're 193 cm.

796
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,719
(Seojun chuckles)

797
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,289
V: Peakboy, he says
it's because you're 193 cm.

798
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,592
-SEOJUN: All right.
-PEAKBOY: All right.

799
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,860
SEOJUN: All right.

800
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,461
THEY CHANGE INTO THEIR UNIFORM

801
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:35,500
SEOJUN: <i>♪ I'll give you my everything ♪</i>

802
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:44,041
HE GOES TO THE KITCHEN FIRST
TO PREPARE DINNER

803
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:53,684
THE MAIN CHEF FOR TODAY'S DINNER, SEOJUN

804
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,893
Can I help you out with anything?

805
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,795
Are there knives here?

806
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,500
SEOJUN: Can you go to our room
and get the forks and knives?

807
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,936
That's it.

808
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,006
V: What about the forks?

809
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,008
-Are there five?
-PEAKBOY: Yes.

810
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,075
V: Let's go.

811
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,310
THE TWO FOUND FORKS AND KNIVES

812
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,651
(dishes clanking)

813
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,686
-V: Seojun.
-SEOJUN: Yes?

814
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,255
Do you want a taste of my daggers?

815
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,456
SEOJUN: You're Wolverine.

816
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,258
(utensils clatter)

817
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,563
It isn't close to done.

818
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,333
WHILE HE COOKS THE POTATOES
FOR THE MASHED POTATOES

819
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,402
SEOJUN: Let's write our names here.

820
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,304
Write "Clown" for me.

821
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,706
(V laughs)
Okay, let's write our nicknames.

822
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,242
THEY WRITE THEIR NICKNAMES ON THE UNIFORMS

823
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,177
SEOJUN: Write it properly, will you?

824
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,249
(laughter)

825
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,151
-PEAKBOY: What should I write?
-V: You?

826
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,788
Giant.

827
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,324
(laughter)

828
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,128
(chuckles)

829
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,130
Good.

830
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,732
-What about you?
-V: What about me?

831
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,901
-V?
-SEOJUN: No, you should be...

832
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,636
THE NICKNAME THEY HAVE FOR V

833
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,338
-World Star.
-World Star.

834
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,339
Okay.

835
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,373
Okay.

836
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,374
(chuckles)

837
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,276
SEOJUN: Clown is funny.

838
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,744
PEAKBOY: But Giant...

839
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,313
(all laughing)

840
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,481
CLOWN, GIANT, AND WORLD STAR

841
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,217
Let me go check.

842
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,454
This is really funny, though.

843
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,891
-Should we get these custom-made?
-Let's write it bigger on the back.

844
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,026
Okay.

845
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,298
Write his birth year on the back too.

846
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,136
HE CAREFULLY WRITES ONE LETTER AT A TIME

847
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,138
Okay.

848
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,173
Hang on. Okay, good.

849
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,742
PEAKBOY: Making it bigger?

850
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,510
What did you write?

851
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,711
PEAKBOY: Clown.

852
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,812
(chuckles)

853
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,914
Write mine too.

854
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,885
PEAKBOY'S TURN IS NEXT

855
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,888
-Write it properly.
-SEOJUN: It's already ruined.

856
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,164
(laughs)

857
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,732
HE WRITES IT BIG AND CLEAR

858
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,567
-This is your slogan, isn't it?
-V: Yes.

859
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,806
SEOJUN WRITES ON V'S SHIRT HIMSELF

860
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,075
-It looks like beansprouts.
-The nine looks so small.

861
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,078
Okay.

862
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,146
Okay.

863
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,280
Okay.

864
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,183
THEIR ONE-OF-A-KIND UNIFORM IS COMPLETE

865
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,287
(burbling)

866
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,588
MEANTIME, THE POTATOES ARE DONE

867
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,124
SEOJUN: It looks done.
I have something for you to do.

868
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,260
Are we finally doing something?

869
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,429
-V: What is it?
-SEOJUN: I'll put the butter and milk in.

870
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,698
-V: Okay.
-PEAKBOY: It's no big deal.

871
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,806
After that...

872
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,111
-I see.
-You can go like that.

873
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,347
-I'll do it.
-SEOJUN: But this is hot.

874
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,048
It isn't that hot.

875
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,650
Really? Then take it and do it.

876
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,520
V: Let's do it.

877
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,658
SEOJUN: Let's put some parsley in it.

878
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,563
Done.

879
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,331
Put a little more in it.

880
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,366
-SEOJUN: Parsley?
-V: Yes.

881
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,667
-SEOJUN: You like parsley?
-V: Yes.

882
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,436
-I think parsley likes you too.
-V: Parsley loves me.

883
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,109
HE PUTS A LOT IN FOR V

884
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,777
-SEOJUN: More?
-V: That's enough.

885
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,418
SEOJUN: You have to mash all of that.

886
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,320
-PEAKBOY: We mashed all of it.
-SEOJUN: Okay.

887
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,956
TIME TO COOK THE STEAK

888
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,359
(frizzling)

889
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,532
(V clears throat)

890
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,770
A guy that cooks steak...

891
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,972
V: I like it.

892
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,383
THE DISH IS SLOWLY COMING TOGETHER

893
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,689
Wow.

894
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,396
(V sighs)

895
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,697
V: You're a good cook.

896
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,134
EVEN THE PLATING IS PERFECT

897
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,905
THE FIRST DINNER OF THEIR TRIP

898
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,208
PEAKBOY: Thanks.

899
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,910
-V: Thank you.
-SEOJUN: Enjoy.

900
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:46,977
Here's the sauce.

901
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:52,316
HOW DOES CHEF SEOJUN'S STEAK TASTE?

902
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,352
It's awesome.

903
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,723
I thought it would be chewy, but it isn't.

904
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,733
Mmm.

905
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,770
-It's so good.
-So good.

906
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:13,771
Mmm.

907
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,608
SEOJUN: Shall we have a glass?

908
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:26,951
Mmm.

909
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,422
It tastes good.

910
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,657
Which part is this?

911
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,894
SEOJUN: They're all beef tenderloins,
but they cut it up like that.

912
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:37,962
Mmm.

913
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,965
Did you soak the whole potato?

914
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,068
SEOJUN: You boil them.

915
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,069
V: Mm.

916
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,972
And then, you just add butter

917
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,341
and mix them up.

918
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,511
Do you want to try cooking?

919
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,479
Well, yes.

920
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,481
I heard that if you cook,

921
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,583
you become very confident.

922
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,486
It is one of the ways to become happy.

923
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,422
I'm not good at cooking either,

924
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:11,228
but I feel happier
when I see people enjoy my food.

925
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,696
-V: Oh, really?
-Yes.

926
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,171
V, have this.

927
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,907
-Me? I'll eat it.
-SEOJUN: You're killing it.

928
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,010
-I think you're about to grow taller.
-V: What?

929
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,145
-You're going to grow 2 cm.
-Maybe you're growing.

930
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,949
That was good.

931
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,885
AFTER THE HEARTY DINNER

932
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:35,986
SEOJUN: Do the dishes, please.

933
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,888
PEAKBOY: Okay, let's do the dishes.
I'll do it.

934
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:39,690
WORLD STAR

935
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,992
V: It feels like
we're closing the restaurant

936
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,229
and cleaning up now.

937
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,766
SEOJUN: Wear rubber gloves.

938
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,367
PEAKBOY: I don't wear rubber gloves
at home.

939
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,870
SEOJUN:
It means you don't do dishes often.

940
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,772
PEAKBOY: Hey, I'm very good
around the house.

941
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,074
SEOJUN: I'm not interested.

942
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,948
V: Move aside now. I'll do it.

943
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,484
-PEAKBOY: Can I ask you to do this, then?
-V: Okay, I'll do it.

944
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,053
PEAKBOY AND V SWAP OUT

945
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,155
(water trickling)

946
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,562
V: Peakboy, which one is the dish soap?

947
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,098
You didn't wash them with dish soap?

948
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,434
-V: Which one is it?
-This is dish soap. That's hand soap.

949
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,002
-V: This is the dish soap?
-Yes, it is.

950
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,570
V: Okay.

951
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,074
SEOJUN: <i>It's only eight o'clock.
What do we do now?</i>

952
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,943
V: <i>Let's go over there and play games.
There's a game console there.</i>

953
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,346
THEY HEAD TO THE PLAYROOM

954
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,281
V: <i>♪ Ice tea and a game of ping pong ♪</i>

955
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,950
<i>♪ This is getting heavy ♪</i>

956
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,188
<i>♪ 'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight ♪</i>

957
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,990
THE FIRST THING THEY GRAB
IS THE INSTANT CAMERA

958
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,559
-What?
-How do I use this?

959
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,729
V.

960
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,765
PEAKBOY: One, two, three.

961
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,034
-SEOJUN: That's it.
-PEAKBOY: Yes.

962
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,004
SEOJUN: Are we all in it?

963
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,144
THE FIRST RECORD OF THEIR TRIP

964
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,646
V: Come over here.

965
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:15,185
V BRINGS THE GO BOARD

966
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,154
(V clears throat)
All right.

967
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,656
Hello, hello.

968
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,690
Hello.

969
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,360
Park Seojun, eighth dan
and V, seventh dan.

970
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,196
-They play each other today.
-Let's flick the stones.

971
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,731
Flicking stones? Okay.

972
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,033
GAME: FLICKING STONES

973
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,069
V USES THE BLACK STONES
SEOJUN USES THE WHITE STONES

974
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,672
PEAKBOY: He is very strategic.

975
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,374
SEOJUN: You're going to place them
like that? Come on.

976
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,679
V: Decide who will go first.

977
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,080
SEOJUN: Rock, paper, scissors.

978
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,549
PEAKBOY: Park Seojun will go first.

979
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,484
SEOJUN FLICKS THE STONE FIRST

980
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,887
(playful music)

981
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:54,758
V: You can turn it like this.

982
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,727
-No.
-No, you can't do that.

983
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,129
-You can turn your body.
-Yes. Turn your body, not this.

984
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,197
Jeez.

985
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,634
(sighs)

986
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,138
PEAKBOY: Usually, you can't do that.

987
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,108
-He sacrificed his stone.
-SEOJUN: Who will win?

988
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,409
PEAKBOY: He sacrificed his own.

989
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,246
SEOJUN: This is tough. Should I do this?

990
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,316
Why do you keep coming this way?

991
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,384
(clears throat)

992
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,853
(rattles)

993
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,056
V'S BLACK STONE ATTACKS SUCCESSFULLY

994
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,057
(V groans)

995
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,794
-PEAKBOY: He's desperate.
-V: He's desperate.

996
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,963
LEFTOVER STONES
BLACK: 4, WHITE: 3

997
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,631
SEOJUN: Actually, I can't play that well.

998
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:35,599
(rattles)

999
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,169
BACK TO SQUARE ONE

1000
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,140
This is tough. Where do I go from here?

1001
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,109
Should I go this way or that way?

1002
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,079
(rattles)

1003
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,182
V FLICKS OFF A WHITE STONE
ALONG WITH HIS BLACK STONE

1004
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,550
Let's go. One stone, two birds.

1005
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:57,988
PEAKBOY, V: Oh!

1006
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:00,624
(both exclaim)

1007
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,827
(imitates buzzer buzzes)

1008
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,728
PARK SEOJUN WINS

1009
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,064
SEOJUN: Come here.

1010
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,232
-Come here.
-Isn't it this?

1011
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:11,235
-No, it isn't. No.
-PEAKBOY: Yes, it is.

1012
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,402
Bring your head there.

1013
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,505
No, let's start now.

1014
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,939
-Starting now.
-No way.

1015
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,142
-V: From now.
-I played so hard, though.

1016
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,545
Let's start from now. I went easy on you.

1017
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,047
-You went easy on what?
-I went easy on you in the game.

1018
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,283
-What are you talking about?
-You self-destructed.

1019
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,353
-No, I did.
-Okay, if you want to hit me, go ahead.

1020
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,389
I can't believe
he's playing dirty like that.

1021
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,191
All right. Let's play one more game.

1022
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,325
One more game.

1023
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,295
-SEOJUN: You play.
-V: Okay.

1024
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,698
Peakboy, are you going to do this or this?

1025
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,234
You can do this, this, or this.

1026
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,202
(laughter)

1027
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,437
-This, this, this.
-And this.

1028
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,006
IT'S UP TO THE WINNER

1029
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,842
BLACK STONE, V
WHITE STONE, PEAKBOY

1030
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:52,910
SEOJUN: What?

1031
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,612
Rock, paper, scissors.

1032
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,248
Should I go first?

1033
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,185
(Seojun sucks teeth)
Isn't it better to go first?

1034
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,121
BLACK STONE GOES FIRST

1035
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:05,823
SEOJUN: Oh.

1036
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,993
WHITE STONE TAKES IT SLOW

1037
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,329
(rattles)

1038
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,364
V'S BLACK STONE ATTACKS SUCCESSFULLY

1039
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,266
(sniffs)

1040
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,405
SEOJUN: He's acting serious.

1041
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,339
(soft chuckle)

1042
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,175
WHITE STONE TIES IT UP

1043
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,945
I can't commentate.

1044
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:30,948
-V: Ah...
-(chuckles)

1045
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,550
V MISSES
THE BLACK STONE FALLS OVER THE EDGE

1046
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,485
I'll wipe it all out
with just three stones.

1047
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,522
WHITE STONE'S CAUTIOUS ATTACK

1048
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,258
MEANWHILE, BLACK STONE ATTACKS HARD

1049
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,528
-SEOJUN: Three to three.
-I told you I went easy on him.

1050
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,432
SEOJUN: He's a timid player.

1051
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,466
(rattles)

1052
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,369
Which punishment will he get?

1053
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,173
PEAKBOY'S FATAL MISTAKE

1054
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,609
LEFTOVER STONES
BLACK: 3, WHITE: 1

1055
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,277
-(Peakboy groans)
-V: I'm going to finish it.

1056
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,114
-SEOJUN: How far are you going?
-Wait.

1057
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,683
BLACK STONE PLAYER, V WINS

1058
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,951
PEAKBOY: Good job.

1059
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:08,886
(clatters)

1060
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,221
HE HUMBLY GETS READY TO BE FLICKED

1061
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,924
No, I'm going to hit you with this.

1062
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,026
While wearing a ring?

1063
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,663
-Wait.
-Okay. I'll do this.

1064
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,498
-Do what you want.
-No.

1065
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,233
I don't like it when people go easy on me.

1066
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,468
V: No, I'll go with this.

1067
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,403
That way, I can hit you properly too.

1068
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,804
No, I'll go with this.

1069
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,641
What if you hit me with this
when I close my eyes?

1070
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,742
(laughs)

1071
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,681
(Peakboy groans painfully)

1072
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:41,618
(stifled laugh)

1073
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,588
(pained groan)

1074
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,090
(tapping)

1075
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,126
(laughter)

1076
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,795
I can't use profanity, can I?

1077
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,196
(V laughs)

1078
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,998
(laughter)

1079
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,033
(Peakboy groans)

1080
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,769
Would you like to play another match?

1081
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,704
Let's play with three stones.

1082
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,340
-V: Three?
-Oh, boy. Here we go.

1083
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,809
V VS PEAKBOY, REMATCH

1084
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,010
SEOJUN: What is this?

1085
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,748
You look like you have a strategy,
but you don't, do you?

1086
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:13,283
May I go first this time?

1087
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,587
PEAKBOY'S WHITE STONE
STARTS OFF WITH A POWERFUL MOVE

1088
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:19,923
(exhales deeply)

1089
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,092
SEOJUN: How far are you going?

1090
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,428
PEAKBOY: Come on. This is a bit much.

1091
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:25,595
Why?
(V chuckles)

1092
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:28,732
-(rattles)
-Oh.

1093
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,801
HIS ATTACK SUCCEEDS
WHILE AVOIDING THE BLACK STONES

1094
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,975
HIS FINGERS SLIGHTLY LACKED STRENGTH

1095
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,310
(rattles)

1096
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,146
(chuckling)

1097
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,248
V'S CONSECUTIVE SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS

1098
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,783
-(rattles)
-(laughs)

1099
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,018
Ah...

1100
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,319
GAME OVER

1101
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,755
(V laughing)

1102
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,693
(laughing continues)

1103
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,829
THE UNAVOIDABLE TIME FOR PUNISHMENT

1104
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:01,565
It really did hurt. I got teary-eyed.

1105
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,966
(laughs)

1106
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,201
It's red, isn't it?

1107
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,770
-My mom is going to watch this.
-(chuckles)

1108
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,073
PEAKBOY: But don't go easy on me.
That isn't fun.

1109
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,843
-Do you want me to go easy on you?
-No.

1110
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,645
-Don't go easy on me.
-Okay.

1111
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,782
HE GIVES HIM A SIGNAL

1112
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,484
SIGNAL REGISTERED

1113
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,854
-(slaps)
-(laughter)

1114
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,691
-(slaps)
-(laughter)

1115
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,127
(V and Seojun laughing)

1116
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,329
(laughing continues)

1117
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,598
(laughing heartily)

1118
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,668
PEAKBOY: Hey, jeez. Wait.

1119
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,471
How could you slap me?

1120
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,476
Jeez. V, I can't see well.

1121
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,178
V, I CAN'T SEE (IN FRONT OF ME) WELL...

1122
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:50,514
FLICKING STONES ENDS
LEAVING BEHIND PEAKBOY'S SCARS

1123
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,116
-SEOJUN: <i>That was fun.</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>That was fun.</i>

1124
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,353
SEOJUN: Aren't you hungry?

1125
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,156
-V: A little?
-SEOJUN: I think it's time to get hungry.

1126
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,390
THEY START TO GET HUNGRY AGAIN

1127
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,925
SEOJUN: Let's eat whatever we have.

1128
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,165
CHEF SEOJUN PREPARES A NIGHTTIME SNACK

1129
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,267
(frizzling)

1130
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,374
PEAKBOY: You can really smell the bacon.

1131
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,377
-I'm going to stop frying.
-V: Okay.

1132
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,647
MEANWHILE

1133
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,083
A CAR APPROACHES THEIR LODGE

1134
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,453
(Seojun whistling)

1135
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,021
I think someone is here.

1136
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:38,328
WHO IS THE FOURTH FRIEND TO
COME LATE AT NIGHT TO GOSEONG?

1137
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,466
PEAKBOY: Wooshik's here.

1138
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:51,007
HE JOINS THE TRIP
LATE AT NIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY

1139
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,212
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY
CHOI WOOSHIK

1140
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,915
HE NEVER LOSES HIS ROMANTIC SIDE AND HUMOR

1141
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,651
"I THINK… I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CUTE!"

1142
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,255
THE SELF-PROCLAIMED(?) CUTIE APPEARS

1143
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,590
Seojun.

1144
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:10,961
THE LAST FRIEND IS CUTE AND LOVING

1145
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,999
THE LOVELIEST GUY IN THE AREA

1146
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,637
SWEET GUY
PARK HYUNGSIK

1147
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:26,309
ALL FIVE FRIENDS COME TOGETHER
ON THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR TRIP

1148
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,013
AND THE FRIENDCATION TRULY BEGINS

1149
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:34,885
I CAN JUST BE MYSELF AND LET MY GUARD DOWN

1150
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,788
IT'S A TIME HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING

1151
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,925
IF WE HADN'T MET BACK THEN…

1152
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,929
I'M SURE WE WOULD'VE MET SOME OTHER WAY

1153
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,998
WOOSHIK: <i>I'm happier today than yesterday.</i>

1154
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,468
SEOJUN: <i>Then tomorrow,
you'll be even happier than today.</i>

1155
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,437
THE TRIP OF THESE FIVE FRIENDS CONTINUE

1156
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,506
(soft music)
