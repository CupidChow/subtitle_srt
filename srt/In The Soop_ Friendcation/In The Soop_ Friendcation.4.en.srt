-"Friend?"

158
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,505
-Seojun.
-V!

159
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,639
-PEAKBOY: "Friend?"
-SEOJUN: Seojun.

160

161
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,676
-Seojun.
-"Dear Friend" by Cho PD?

162
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,643
Correct!

163
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,013
-Let's listen to it!
-Why do you keep giving the answer away?

164
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,750
Let's listen to it.

165
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,488
("Dear Friend" by Cho PD playing)

166
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,555
Is it "Dear Friend"?

167
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,890
PEAKBOY: Yeah, "Dear Friend".

168
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,058
HE WAS SO CLOSE

169
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,126
Cho PD!

170
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,028

171
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,333

174
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,476
HYUNGSIK:
<i>♪ Did we make a lot of promises... ♪</i>

175
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,379
That was Cho PD's song
called "Dear Friend".

176
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,348
-Okay.
-PEAKBOY: Let's move on to the next one.

177
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,351
This song used to be very popular.

00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,553
(rhythmic music plays)

179

-WOOSHIK: Wooshik.

181
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,357
SEOJUN AND PEAKBOY: Go ahead, Wooshik.

-PEAKBOY: That's right.

183
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,427

-Wooshik!
-Wooshik.

191
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,707
-Baek Z Young.
-Baek Z Young?

192
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,676
I can't remember the title.

193
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,645
-"Rush."
-Wrong.

194
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,979
-Seojun.
-Seojun.

195
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,381
"Dash."

196
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,682
-Seojun is correct.
-Okay.

197
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,718
Let's go before that period.
Go to before the 2000s.

198
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,086
-PEAKBOY: Before the 2000s?
-Yeah.

199
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,655
(Peakboy and Seojun laugh)

200
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,856
No.

201
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,191
We're almost there.

202
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,159
PEAKBOY: Let's do one more.

203

210
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,677
PEAKBOY: Wrong.

PEAKBOY (in hoarse voice):
Nice. Very nice.

224
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,071
WOOSHIK: I really don't know
that many songs from the 2000s.

225
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,005
THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR DESTINATION
WHILE LAUGHING

226
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,406
(laughter)

227
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,475
PEAKBOY: Thanks for driving, Seojun.

228
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,244

229
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,445
SEOJUN: It was fun.

230
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,147
PEAKBOY: This place is huge.

231
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,384
HYUNGSIK:
Let's go. Let's have fun skating.

232
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm so excited.

233
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,822
THEY EXCITEDLY ENTER THE ICE RINK

234
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,956
PEAKBOY: Whoa.

235
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,224
WOOSHIK: What... Whoa...

236
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,660
THEY EXCLAIM AT THE HUGE SIZE

237
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,828
-What the heck?
-Whoa.

238
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,096
(amazed groan)

239
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,297
We're supposed to skate here?

240
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,298
PERMISSION HAS BEEN GRANTED AHEAD

241
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,166
HYUNGSIK: Can we even skate here?

242
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,568
PEAKBOY: Our voices echo.

243
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,536
Let's take off our masks.

244
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,337
ALL: Oh! Oh, oh!

245
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,239
THE RINK IS SO BIG THAT THEIR VOICES ECHO

246
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,173
PEAKBOY: Hey!

247
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,241
(laughter)

248
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,910
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

249
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,345
PEAKBOY: We weren't just skating
on a patch of ice.

250
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,346
HYUNGSIK: You're right.

251
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,783
Everybody should put on
the knee pads first.

252
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,822
THEY PUT ON EQUIPMENT FOR THEIR SAFETY

253
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,658
SEOJUN: It has been so long
since I last skated.

254
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,860
I wonder if my body will remember.

255
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,262
HYUNGSIK:
I don't remember how I skated before.

256
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,697
Gosh, I don't think I can skate at all.

257
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,099
Is it time for me to show off my skills?

258
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,167
SEOJUN: No way, man.

259
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,936
(V sighs)

260
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,337
Can I go ahead?

261
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,272
HYUNGSIK: Yes, if you're ready, go ahead.

262
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,674
-SEOJUN: Go ahead.
-HYUNGSIK: Yes.

263
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,246
What the heck? What?

264
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,748
-(Hyungsik mumbles)
-(abrupt laugh)

265
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,585
AS SOON AS THEY COMPLIMENT HIM, HE SLIPS

266
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,454
Welcome, everyone.

267
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,058
You know, I'm starting to remember
what it's like.

268
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,527
PEAKBOY: There were gloves?

269
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,162
Gosh.

270
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,730
PEAKBOY: You should be careful.

271
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,865
(creaking)

272
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,304
CHOI WOOSHIK MIGHT BE A ROBOT

273
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,672
(laughing)

274
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,141
This is so much fun!

275
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,310
(in English)
Okay!

276
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,244
HYUNGSIK AND SEOJUN QUICKLY GET USED TO IT

277
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,714
Push him. Push Wooshik's butt.

278
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,948
(Seojun panting)

279
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,783
(panting continues)

280
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,186
(Seojun laughing)

281
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,055
(laughing continues)

282
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,924
HYUNGSIK: This is fun.

283
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,392
It has been so long.

284
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,195
(Seojun laughing)

285
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,263
V, THE ONE WHO FIRST SUGGESTED ICE SKATING

286
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,569
(V laughing)

287
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,939
V: Everyone skates well.

288
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,576
HYUNGSIK: Oh, okay. Okay, okay.

289
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,912
HE NEEDS A LOT OF TIME TO GET ADJUSTED

290
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,047
(laughs)

291
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,684
I didn't imagine I would be the worst,
but I guess I am.

292
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,985
(laughing)

293
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,120
Shape up.

294
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,657
V, your center of gravity should be lower.

295
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,658
-Or you're in trouble.
-Like this?

296
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,559
-No, like this. Shift your weight.
-Like this?

297
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,128
-Bend forward.
-And?

298
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,930
You have to push it like inline skating.

299
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,866
-I've never tried inline.
-You have to push outwards.

300
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,234
You push with your back leg.

301
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,636
SEOJUN: Yeah.

302
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,171
You're doing well.

303
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,607
HE'S STILL WOBBLY

304
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,175
(laughter)

305
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,911
Stand straight.

306
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,112
WOOSHIK'S ONE ON ONE TUTORING

307
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,014
(Wooshik mumbles, laughs)

308
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,215
Hey, what the heck?

309
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,350
(laughter)

310
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,755
THEY GIVE ATTENTION TO THE STUDENT
WHOSE BODY WON'T LISTEN

311
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,058
They're such an eyesore.

312
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,660
IT'S JUST THE TWO OF THEM
IN THEIR OWN LITTLE WORLD

313
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,032
What's wrong with them?

314
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,434
SEOJUN: Are they in love?

315
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,105
A FANTASTIC DUO

316
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,040
ENDING IN A FLOP

317
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,208
(both laugh)

318
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,245
WHILE THEY PEACEFULLY SKATE

319
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,083
ANGRY PEAKBOY SPEEDS UP TO THEM

320
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,350
-HYUNGSIK: Oh, my gosh.
-(laughter)

321
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,518
-Oh, my gosh.

322
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,253
-What is he doing?
-HYUNGSIK: Oh, oh, oh...

323
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,756
(laughter)

324
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,326
HE SOARS LIKE A BEE(?)

325
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,462
(soft music)

326
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:16,535
AND LANDS LIKE A BUTTERFLY(?)

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,809
THE AUDIENCE ARE TOUCHED
BY HIS WORK OF ART

328
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,111
Oh.

329
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,979
That was the perfect finale.

330
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,149
-(laughter)
-Oh.

331
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,685
The rink isn't smooth today.

332
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,987
-SEOJUN: What a shame.
-Listen,

333
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,156
let's play a song

00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,392
-and have a performance.
-(laughter)

335
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,827
Let's do it.

336
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,730
(gentle music plays)

337
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,299
A FAMILIAR SONG PLAYS IN THE ARENA

338
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,669
WOOSHIK CASUALLY STANDS
AS SOON AS HE HEARS IT

339
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,638
This is "Swan Lake."

340
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,508
He was last year's champion.

341
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,876
LAST YEAR'S CHAMPION(?) TAKES THE ICE

342
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,111
(laughter)

343
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,349
-Where's he going?
-Where's he going?

344
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,089
PEAKBOY: Oh, he's a swan.
He's supposed to be a swan.

345
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,791
(laughter)

346
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,826
THE NEXT TECHNIQUE

347
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,596
THAT TECHNIQUE...?!

348
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,731
That technique is...

349
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,834
USING HIS ACTING SKILLS,
HE GOES FROM SWAN TO ROBOT

350
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,235
(laughter)

351
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,470
THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HIS ACTING

352
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,604
Oh, my gosh.

353
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,341
THE PERFORMANCE REACHES THE CLIMAX

354
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,579
A LONELY SWAN ALL ALONE

355
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,915
-HYUNGSIK: Whoa.
-Look at him acting lonely.

356
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,020
HE PERFORMED A WANDERING SWAN

357
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,155
THE END

358
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,891
THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDS

359
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,894
SEOJUN: He's so funny.

360
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:49,829
(sniffs)

361
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,131
V, there's the music. Go.

362
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,799
("Humoresque" playing)

363
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,868
V'S FAVORITE SONG THIS TRIP, "HUMORESQUE"

364
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,403
V enters!

365
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,604
HE SLIPS FROM THE START

366
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,673
(laughter)

367
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,544
HE AVOIDS DISASTER
WITH HIS BUMBLING JUMP STEPS

368
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,181
HE LANDS AT THE CENTER

369
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,517
(cheers, applause)

370
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,554
(Hyungsik and Peakboy exclaiming)

371
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,122
-A triple axel!
-(hearty laugh)

372
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,693
HE'S COMFORTABLE ENOUGH
TO PLAY WITH THE TUNE

373
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,328
Oh. Oh, oh.

374
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,030
(music ends)

375
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,966
HE ENDS WITH A PERFECT POSE

376
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,234
THEY ARE ALL MOVED Whoa!

377
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,368
(all shout)

378
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,772
HIS RHYTHMIC STEPS

379
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,277
HE USES DIFFICULT SKILLS WITH EASE

380
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,382
AN IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE
THAT ENDED WITH AN IDOL-ESQUE POSE

381
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,617
Well done.

382
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,486
Well done. Have some water.

383
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,687
(breathes heavily)

384
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,056
What do you think my score is, coach?

385
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,559
I think you'll definitely be
in last place.

386
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,827
(laughter)

387
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,162
PEAKBOY (sighs): Shall I have some fun?

388
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,366
Play the music, please.

389
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,267
PEAKBOY IS UP NEXT

390
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,636
Why is he so tall?

391
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,406
WHAT WILL THE TALLEST PEAKBOY PERFORM?

392
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,843
(intense music playing)

393
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,379
HE USES HIS LONG ARMS
TO EXPRESS WILD EMOTIONS

394
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,848
(laughing)

395

(laughter)

397
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,622
HIS DELICATE EXPRESSION
OF BUSILY MOVING FEET

398
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,724
THE OTHERS ARE EMBARRASSED OF HIM

399
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,028
HE ASKS FOR THE MUSIC TO STOP

400
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,601
-I quit.
-(laughter)

401
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,102
PEAKBOY: I can't express myself

402
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,005
the way I did when I practiced.

403
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,509
PEAKBOY: This isn't what my coach told me.

404
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,679
-SEOJUN: Let's play tag and go.
-WOOSHIK: Okay, let's play.

405
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,816
-Let's only use half of this.
-Yeah, only half.

406
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,118
You can't leave the blue line.

407
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,186
PEAKBOY: Five minutes.

408
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,021
Okay, V is it.

409
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,089
-You're it, V.
-You're it.

410
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,490
-You're it, V.
-(in English) Okay.

411
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,693
V: Here I go.

412
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,229

(light music)

414
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,466
WOOSHIK WHO LOOKS RELAXED

415
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,735
WOOSHIK (laughs):
Why are you coming after me?

416
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,804
Why are you coming after me?

417
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,940
HE CORNERS WOOSHIK

418
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,308
-(friends groan)

00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,049
(Peakboy chuckles)

424
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,217
PEAKBOY: Run away.

425
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,420
(Hyungsik chuckles)

426
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,822
(Hyungsik groans)

427
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,892
HIS SECOND TARGET IS SEOJUN

(laughter)

429
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,797
TAG

430
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,065
V: I tagged him.

431
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,167
-Did you?
-I did it.

432
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,269

(Peakboy groans)

438
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,916
HE TRICKS HIM AND RUNS AWAY

439
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,053

Gosh, that was fun.

448

Can we eat some rice cakes first?

467
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,098
Sure. Let's eat some rice cakes

468
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,299

00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,493
-king oyster mushrooms.
-HYUNGSIK: Let's take them all out.

482
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,429
-Please wash all of those with water.
-Okay.

483
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,730
HYUNGSIK: Yes, sir.

484
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,167
-Should I take it all out?
-Yeah.

485
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,702
(sighs)

486
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,237
-Very good.
-PEAKBOY: First...

487
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,571
Spring onion and...

488
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,107
THEY NATURALLY SPLIT THE WORK

489
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,041
(hums)

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,149
SCANNING THE REFRIGERATOR

491
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,851
SEOJUN: Shall we make kimchi fried rice
with the leftover pork belly?

492
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,852
PEAKBOY: Yes, good.

493
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,420
And it's ripe kimchi.

494
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,289
-Yeah.
-Nice.

495
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,692
WOOSHIK MEMORIZES PAIK JONGWON'S RECIPE

496
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,196
-Slightly blanch the washed chicken.
-PEAKBOY: What?

497
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,797
-Blanch it.
-PEAKBOY: Okay.

498
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,666
WOOSHIK: Put it in.

499
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,768
It gets rid of the bad smells.

500
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,904
Let's put in as much as we can.

501
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,041
-Our V likes chicken drumsticks.
-Our V likes drumsticks.

502
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,709
We'll put in all the drumsticks.

503
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,579
Next, we like wings too, don't we?

504
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,748
-Wings are good.
-We like wings.

505
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,950
Don't a lot of people like thigh meat?

506
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,952
-I'll put it all in.
-ALL: Okay.

507
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,421
-WOOSHIK: Put in as much as you can.
-Okay.

508
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,989
SEOJUN: I love it.

509
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,925
Done. Good.

510
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,626
Do we only need one onion?

511
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,196
-Yeah.
-And one mushroom?

512
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,263
Yeah.

513
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,032
I want to chop something.

514
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,669
V HELPS THE OTHERS OUT
BY CHOPPING VEGETABLES

515
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,975
Hand it to me. When you chop onions...

516
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,513
HE TEACHES V AT HIS LEVEL

517
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,881
-You're good.
-Yes.

518
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,282
V: What about the carrots?

519
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,984
SEOJUN: Go like this.

520
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,886
-Watch your hand.
-Watch it.

521
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,688
-Go like this.
-Okay, V.

522
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,189
That's it.

523
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,458
Watch your hand.

524
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,961
HOLDING A TIGHT FIST

525
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,929
SEOJUN: No, not like that.

526
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,198
-Like this.
-Like this.

527
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,200
-Yeah.
-That's it.

528
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,669
-(thuds)
-PEAKBOY: Oh.

529
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,240
-That's dangerous.
-Hey, that's dangerous.

530
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,641
-Don't do it.
-No.

531
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,809
Stop messing around.

532
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,177
-V: Like this?
-PEAKBOY: Yes.

533
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
That's it.

534
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,513
You need potatoes for spicy chicken stew.

535
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,349
WOOSHIKS CHOPS THE REST

536
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,818
Why are you good at chopping?

537
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,119
(groans)

538
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,088
-I'm rather good at it.
-HYUNGSIK: Mm.

539
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,790
WOOSHIK: Okay, we can throw out the water.

540
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,492
-HYUNGSIK: Oh, do we throw out the water?
-WOOSHIK: Yes.

541
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,393
SEOJUN: Is it done?

542
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
(in English)
Okay.

543
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,998
Oh!

544
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,065
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

545
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,601
Chicken cooks fast.

546
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,571
THEY ADD THE CHOPPED VEGGIES

547
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,773
The onion goes in now.
Please add the onion.

548
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,108
Okay.

549
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,276
WOOSHIK: A bigger scoop.

550
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,810
Very good.

551
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,482
We can add a bit more.

552
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,818
THEY ADD A VARIETY OF SPICES
TO INCREASE THE FLAVOR

553
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,120
PEAKBOY: You kind of look like

554
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,789
a Korean food expert today,
even with your clothes.

555
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,692
"How good do you think this will taste?"

556
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,793
(laughs)

557
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,729
(V groans)

558
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,897
Nice.

559
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,166
SEOJUN: It really feels like
we're cooking together.

560
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,067
(Hyungsik laughs)

561
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,635
WOOSHIK: Bubble, bubble.

562
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,307
SEOJUN FOCUSES ON MAKING KIMCHI FRIED RICE

563
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,808
(frizzling)

564
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,444
HE ADDS FINELY CHOPPED KIMCHI
TO THE PORK BELLY FAT

565
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,046
HYUNGSIK: Wow.

566
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,281
-The smell is no joke.
-I know.

567
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,749
Oh, my gosh.

568
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,418
That smells amazing too.

569
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,420
LOOKING FORWARD TO
CHEF SEOJUN'S DISH TODAY AS WELL

570
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,022
THEN WHAT ABOUT
THE SPICY CHICKEN STEW?

571
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,326
-It kind of smells like chicken soup.
-HYUNGSIK: Doesn't it smell great?

572
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,294
Let's taste it.

573
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,242
BECAUSE OF WOOSHIK'S PERPLEXED FACE,
HYUNGSIK TASTES IT TOO

574
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,414
-I understand why you made that face.
-Right?

575
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,117
-It doesn't taste bad.
-Right?

576
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,052
But it isn't perfect for some reason.

577
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,089
I think it'll taste good
once it boils down.

578
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,825
-It doesn't taste bad now either.
-It's not bad.

579
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,527
HYUNGSIK:
It tastes plenty good. Interesting.

580
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,730
Do you want to taste it?

581
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,105
-The spring onion will enhance the flavor.
-It'll have a richer flavor.

582
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,139
WHAT DOES V THINK?

583
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,807
Not bad, right?

584
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,944
-Isn't it good?
-Not bad, right?

585
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,581
Whatever that seems to be lacking
is because this is a trial run.

586
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,217
-I'm glad you added the sugar.
-It's nice and sweet.

587
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,719
-It kind of tastes like <i>tteokbokki</i> sauce.
-Yes, it does a bit.

588
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,356
-HYUNGSIK: You chop well.
-WOOSHIK: No.

589
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,792
HE ADDS SOME SPICINESS TO THE BROTH

590
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,193
HYUNGSIK: You can't even tell.

591
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,197
Is it almost done?

592
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,033
-WOOSHIK: It has to boil down.
-HYUNGSIK: Whenever you're ready.

593
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,668
Yeah, we can eat it as is.

594
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,004
-Let's keep boiling it while we eat.
-Yeah.

595
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,539
Let's use the portable burner.

596
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,740
-Good idea.
-Yeah.

597
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,776
SEOJUN: I'm all done.

598
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,844
(soft music)

599
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,046
(indistinct chatter)

600
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,615
That smells awesome.

601
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:37,682
Isn't it amazing?

602
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,020
Can someone bring the portable burner?

603
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,356
Hyungsik, I got it.

604
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,024
HYUNGSIK: Watch your hands.

605
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,526
I'll take the burner.

606
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,627
WOOSHIK: What smells so good?

607
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,796
-Put it here.
-Let's put it here.

608
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,230
THEIR LAST DINNER TOGETHER

609
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,232
-We can keep boiling it down.
-Yeah.

610
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,601
HYUNGSIK: The fried rice looks awesome.

611
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,136
WOOSHIK: The smell of the fried rice...

612
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,638
SEOJUN'S PORK BELLY KIMCHI FRIED RICE

613
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,873
-V: We do all right for ourselves.
-SEOJUN: We cook well.

614
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,874
WOOSHIK: Of course.

615
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,110
Chicken broth is the best.

616
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,945
-Shall we eat?
-Let's eat.

617
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

618
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,915
Give me the kid's plate.

619
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,250
PEAKBOY:
The color doesn't look bad either.

620
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,352
-SEOJUN: I think it'll be good.
-PEAKBOY: I think so too.

621
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,122
-SEOJUN: Are the potatoes done?
-WOOSHIK: They're cooked.

622
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,857
V: Wow, wow.

623
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,394
THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE FEAST

624
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,362
Let me give it a try

625
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,331
just in case.

626
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,503
Mm.

627
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,704
I'll try it.

628
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:36,975
Mm.

629
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,710
(slurps)

630
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,213
Mm.

631
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,280
It's good.

632
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,016
Mm.

633
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,218
-WOOSHIK: It's good, isn't it?
-Yes.

634
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,053
-It's good, isn't it?
-(laughs)

635
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,654
It tastes different from before.

636
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,190
-It tastes better.
-I don't know what changed.

637
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,092
Why does it taste better? Thanks.

638
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,861
(sucks teeth)
Is it because we're hungry?

639
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,263
-Thanks.
-SEOJUN: It's not bad.

640
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,164
Its soup base is good.

641
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,601
HYUNGSIK: Gosh, this tastes amazing.

642
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,776
Nice.

643
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,580
-It's good.
-Yeah.

644
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,416
EVERYONE LOVES
WOOSHIK'S SPICY CHICKEN STEW

645
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,618
(chomping)

646
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,853
-It isn't too spicy, V?
-No.

647
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,021
It's so good.

648
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,291
-The broth is good.
-Yeah.

649
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,127
It's better because it boiled down.

650
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,962
We can brag about this elsewhere.

651
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,063
HYUNGSIK: That we're good at this?

652
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,732
We can make spicy chicken stew.

653
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,236
AFTER THE CHICKEN, THEY TRY SEOJUN'S DISH

654
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,539
Oh, you put pork belly in this.

655
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,341
-Yeah, pork belly and canned meat.
-V: So did you

656
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,777
-fry the pork belly first?
-Yeah, I used the fat.

657
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,179
-I want to try.
-This can't taste bad.

658
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:49,881
(slurps)

659
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,316
Mmm.

660
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,118
Rice...

661
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,753
THE COMBINATION OF
TASTY PORK BELLY + TASTY KIMCHI

662
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,187
The fried rice is so good.

663
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,457
And it's slightly burnt.

664
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,627
It tastes like the fried rice
you make on the pan

665
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,462
after you finish eating the meat.

666
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,567
Okay.

667
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,702
-You're eating well.
-Yeah.

668
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,604
Does anyone else want more?

669
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,573
Give me one more spoon.

670
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,477
HYUNGSIK: Gosh. This is proper fried rice.

671
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,546
THE KIMCHI FRIED RICE
IS FINISHED IN NO TIME

672
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,083
WOOSHIK: We really finished this.

673
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,553
These foods are perfect
for getting a swollen face in the morning.

674
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,655
Yeah, we're in trouble tomorrow.

675
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,224
What time do you leave, Hyungsik?

676
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,061
HYUNGSIK: I have to leave around 4:20.

677
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:36,962
SEOJUN: Oh...

678
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,730
SEOJUN: You'll be so swollen tomorrow.

679
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,731
Just eat.

680
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,999
-Just eat?
-Yeah.

681
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,502
Your swollen face will go down
around the third scene.

682
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,938
My face is swollen every day.

683
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,139
Mine too.

684
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,341
(laughs)

685
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,910
-Shall we toast?
-WOOSHIK: Yes.

686
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,078
HYUNGSIK: Yeah.

687
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,079
PEAKBOY: Good job, everyone.

688
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,680
-Good job.
-SEOJUN: Say something, V.

689
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:56,581
Let's be happy.

690
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,216
ALL: Let's be happy!

691
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,751
And don't get sick.

692
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,187
(Seojun exhales)

693
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,758
You know, I think we can

694
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,727
really go camping now.

695
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,895
-This would be so tasty on a camping trip.
-Yeah.

696
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,132
-These would be so good on a camping trip.
-They'd be so good.

697
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:18,269
Yesterday's food was good too,
but today is filling in a different way.

698
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,138
-Yeah.
-Since we're eating here.

699
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,641
I was really happy today.

700
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,442
(laughter)

701
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,744
"I was happy."

702
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,811
"Happy."

703
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,613
"I was happy."

704
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,349
-We did a bunch of things.
-Yeah.

705
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,452
-We used the sauna.
-We went swimming.

706
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,321
-We went swimming.
-Exercise.

707
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,290
-We caught halibut.
-V: We worked out.

708
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,925
We made a campfire.

709
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,827
We burnt a jacket.

710
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,763
-It was really fun.
-It was fun.

711
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,365
To be honest,

712
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,969
I don't remember why I cried.

713
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,839
-We don't know either.
-You cried all of a sudden.

714
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,275
I know, I don't know why I did that.

715
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,910
Let me tell you. You went like this.

716
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,146
-(laughter)
-(mimics crying)

717
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,715
I don't remember why I cried.

718
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,383
WOOSHIK: Shall I tell you what you said?

719
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,952
You were like, "I don't want to be sad."

720
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,055
We asked you why you were sad,
and all of a sudden...

721
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,057
THE OTHERS REMEMBER LAST NIGHT CLEARLY

722
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,460
And when we turned on the flashlight,
your lips were like this.

723
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,795
(Hyungsik laughs)

724
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,797
-Like Woong from the drama?
-Yeah.

725
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,565
"What's wrong?"

726
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,966
"Turn that off."

727
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,435
(laughter)

728
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,136
(laughter continues)

729
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,539
You're supposed to show us.
Not turn the light off.

730
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,440
(thuds)

731
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,709
Gosh, I...

732
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,410
(breathes deeply)

733
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,714
-I'm going to keep teasing you.
-You were just drunk.

734
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,583
You know what's interesting?

735
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,586
It was always
just the two of us that drank.

736
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,587
You're right.

737
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,091
But at some point,
our drinking sessions have gotten longer.

738
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:46,991
That's right.

739
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,027
-We hardly drank.
-We hardly drank.

740
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,328
We just talk.

741
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,698
It has been so long
since we all got together to drink.

742
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,366
We only started recently.

743
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,569
It was so interesting.

744
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,437
But you weren't a bad drunk.

745
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,505
-Of course not.
-No.

746
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,140
-(exhales)
-Oh.

747
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,041
(Wooshik sniffs)

748
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,642
Let's write on Hyungsik's shirt
before he goes.

749
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,411
-That's right.
-SEOJUN: Mm-hm.

750
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,580
-HYUNGSIK: I'm going to take mine.
-SEOJUN: What should we write?

751
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,985
WOOSHIK: Whenever I think of Hyungsik,
I'm reminded of Baekgu, like a white dog.

752
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,253
-He's white.
-PEAKBOY: He's white

753
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,622
-and likes people who like him.
-(Hyungsik laughing)

754
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,057
-HYUNGSIK: Like I run up to people?
-How cute.

755
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,426
-PEAKBOY: <i>Go with 109?</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>Should we go with 109?</i>

756
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,694
SEOJUN: <i>I like 109.</i>

757
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,895
PEAKBOY: <i>Let's go with 109.</i>

758
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,866
-We shall give you a name.
-Yes.

759
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,335
-I bequeath you a name.
-I bequeath you a name.

760
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,604
I am ever so grateful.

761
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,874
Write it in the middle.

762
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,844
FRIENDS: Oh!

763
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,079
V: What?

764
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,515
FRIENDS: Oh!

765
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,749
What?

766
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,384
-No...
-(laughter)

767
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:47,819
No!

768
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,755
-Wasn't it Baekgu?
-It should've been 109.

769
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,558
No, it would be weird in numbers,
so let's go with Baekgu.

770
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,596
We all thought up the name
using our brains.

771
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,498
-Write 109 in the front.
-Yeah, write 109.

772
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,333
PEAKBOY:
You'd better write 109 in the front.

773
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,838
One, zero, nine.

774
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,140
-WOOSHIK: Inmate number 109.
-PEAKBOY: Inmate number 109.

775
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,576
AFTER SOME CONFUSION, HE WAS GIVEN "109"

776
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,879
WOOSHIK: Baekgu. You're here, Sir Baekgu.

777
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,414
(laughter)

778
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,751
Gosh, you managed to make time

779
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,821
during your busy schedule
to go on a trip with us.

780
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,190
It wasn't that hard to make time.
(laughs)

781
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,091
WOOSHIK: But you did make time.

782
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,395
-Were you in Mungyeong?
-Yeah, I was there.

783
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:35,366
We kept talking about going
on a trip together,

784
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,669
-so I wondered when we'd be able to go.
-I didn't think I would,

785
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,304
but I was excited the day before coming.

786
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,506
Honestly, I didn't sleep well
the night before.

787
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,174
-Me neither.
-I only slept three hours.

788
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,275
THEY WERE TOO EXCITED TO SLEEP

789
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,910
I'm glad we didn't go to Jeju.

790
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,213
-If we went there, he couldn't come.
-I couldn't have come.

791
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,681
We have to get on a plane.

792
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,317
Because we came here,
I could stay here for this long.

793
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,218
WOOSHIK: Exactly.

794
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,220
I really love the memory

795
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,689
of our time on Jeju Island.

796
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:58,790
PEAKBOY: Back then...

797
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,658
-Come on.
-...you were serving in the military.

798
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,394
-We even went on a yacht.
-We rode a yacht.

799
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,899
V said he prepared something for us.

800
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,000
I said, "What is it?"

801
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,502
-He said we should just go.
-Yeah.

802
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,937
There was a yacht.

803
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,240
-He said he borrowed it.
-He loves surprises.

804
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,808
But he didn't bring his wallet...

805
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,009
(laughs loudly)

806
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,444
-He made the reservation.
-Yeah, he did.

807
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,778
He only made the reservation.

808
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm the one who paid for it.

809
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,016
-He forgot his wallet.
-He did it for us.

810
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,218
-He took all the credit.
-He took all the credit.

811
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,354
-(Seojun exhales)
-It was truly a surprise.

812
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,455
A real surprise.

813
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,423
It was two surprises.

814
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,025
-We were surprised twice.
-So surprised.

815
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,327
(in English) Surprise and surprise.

816
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,930
I was so surprised.

817
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,531
PEAKBOY: That's how we took the photo.

818
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,134
That's why he edited it and sent it.

819
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,069
-No, wasn't it you who...
-I did.

820
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,338
-Did you edit it?
-I did it.

821
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,806
What do you call that?

822
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,276
-Photoshop.
-I cut your face out.

823
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,210
Yeah.

824
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,278
PEAKBOY: <i>With Photoshop.</i>

825
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,380
-HYUNGSIK: <i>Oh, you did it.</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>I edited his face in.</i>

826
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,981
WOOSHIK: <i>He's good at things like that.</i>

827
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,150
-<i>I was so surprised and laughed a lot.</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>It's because...</i>

828
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,285
we wished you were with us.

829
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,153
THAT WAY YOU COULD BE WITH US

830
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,655
(Wooshik exhales)

831
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,458
PEAKBOY: After tonight,
we'll be back at home.

832
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,896
After we part ways,
when will we see each other again?

833
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,798
All five of us?

834
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,669
Can you write a song using

835
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,471
our memories and feelings?

836
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,775
-If we wanted to do that, we can.
-Give each of us a part.

837
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,511
There is something I want to
have as a memory.

838
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:27,912
Polaroids.

839
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,648
-Polaroids?
-SEOJUN: Make that the title.

840
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,549
Oh.

841
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,184
This is what's fun about writing a song.

842
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,085
Mm.

843
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,154
-Make "Polaroid" the title of the song.
-Yeah.

844
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,156
-That can stay in our memory?
-Yeah.

845
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,757
And they'll continue to grow.

846
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,559
Should we make that

847
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,562
-and put it in the BGM for this?
-Let's set it as the BGM.

848
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,031
I can sing ballads really well.
I'll do it.

849
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:47,999
Let's give it a try.

850
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,667
This is getting out of hand.

851
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,035
(laughing)

852
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,637
I really like that idea.

853
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,273
WOOSHIK:
We have to make the most of tonight.

854
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,908
PEAKBOY:
Yeah, because tonight is our last night.

855
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,609
-SEOJUN: <i>That way we won't regret it.</i>
-ALL: <i>Yeah.</i>

856
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,845
<i>We have to feel like,
"That's it. Let's go," by tomorrow.</i>

857
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:01,746
(friends agree)

858
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,747
WOOSHIK: <i>Let's go inside.</i>

859
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,987
THEY GATHER IN THE ROOM ONE BY ONE
TO CONTINUE WHERE THEY LEFT OFF

860
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,455
(Seojun clears throat)

861
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,290
WOOSHIK: Hey, we're just beginning.

862
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,792
-You'd better stay sharp.
-PEAKBOY: Stay sharp!

863
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,961
Nice ambiance.

864
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,931
SEOJUN (yawns):
Hyungsik, you have to go soon.

865
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,633
HYUNGSIK:
I wish I could stay with you, guys.

866
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,936
He definitely is the leading character.

867
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:25,970
Come on, Rom-com King.

868
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,105
(Hyungsik laughs)

869
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,973
You're the one who paved the way.

870
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,441
I did pave the way.

871
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,976
(laughter)

872
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,145
SEOJUN: I used to be called

873
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,747
Rom-com Bulldozer.

874
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,181
(laughter)

875
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,250
I won't pave the road
unless I have heavy equipment.

876
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,519
(all laughing)

877
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,421
What are you? An excavator?

878
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,759
I worked each scene delicately,
so I was called the master craftsman.

879
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,061
Really? Gosh.

880
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,863
I'm still just a rom-com baby.

881
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,965
(clears throat)

882
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,572
HYUNGSIK:
Just as you make original soundtracks,

883
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,742
you guys appear as cameos for each other.

884
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,077
You did that in <i>Parasite</i>.

885
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,679
-And we did dramas together.
-You were in dramas together.

886
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,149
-In <i>Fight for My Way</i> too.
-To be honest,

887
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,285
-I'd like to act together too.
-Yeah, seriously.

888
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,255
I'd really like to be an extra just once.

889
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,457
My face doesn't have to show.
It can be just my butt.

890
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,926
-Why would they use your butt?
-If it's just your butt,

891
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,161
they wouldn't cast you.

892
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,563
-They'd use a butt model.
-PEAKBOY: Because I'm not an actor.

893
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,631
I'll be a passerby.

894
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,434
-We don't have to see your butt.
-You see,

895
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,836
I've never been
to any of Seojun's movie shoots.

896
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,805
I've only been to his drama shoots.

897
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,506
I went to <i>The Policeman's Lineage</i>.

898
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,109
-We went to that set.
-I was honestly surprised.

899
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,511
There was so many staff.

900
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,246
It's the same
when you shoot a music video.

901
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,848
PEAKBOY: It's different from a music video

902
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,983
because they film for a very long time.

903
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,819
I kind of wanted to be in it.

904
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,621
Come to think of it,
we went to the set for <i>Hwarang</i>.

905
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,857
We did go to the set for <i>Hwarang.</i>

906
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,093
I still remember the scene.

907
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,929
Seojun was carrying the female lead

908
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,065
-and crossing the stone bridge.
-Yes, he was crossing that.

909
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,067
We went to go see that.

910
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,536
Later, Hyungsik and V became--

911
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,871
That's the one.

912
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,506
-That's right.
-Yeah.

913
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,975
I really want to visit.

914
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,910
V: When I was in <i>Hwarang</i>,

915
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,980
Seojun really helped me out a lot.

916
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,117
Because even though
it was my first time acting,

917
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,853
I was doing concerts at the same time.
Since I was on tour.

918
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,924
I couldn't grasp what emotion
I needed for my lines.

919
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,628
Because it was my first time,
I felt totally lost.

920
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:36,200
I went up to Seojun and honestly told him
that I didn't know how to do this.

921
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,803
"I want to do well,
but I don't quite get it."

922
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,771
When I told him that,

923
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:44,041
he helped me find the right emotion
for each scene

924
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,444
and recorded all of that in a voice memo.

925
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,879
(all exhale)

926
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,581
PEAKBOY:
Gosh, Park Seojun, you're something else.

927
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,917
-So I was--
-Wait,

928
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,252
the Seojun we knew

929
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,487
-was very unstable back then.
-Yeah.

930
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,389
He was having a hard time himself.

931
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,524
He felt very burdened.

932
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,193
Because it was the drama
after <i>She was Pretty</i>.

933
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,096
-He was doing really well with that.
-That's right.

934
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,498
-Of course, he felt burdened.
-He did feel burdened,

935
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,067
but as a fellow actor,

936
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,970
I thought he was amazing to have done that

937
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,539
-despite his situation.
-It's amazing.

938
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,574
-For real.
-It's hard to do that.

939
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,810
What I was thankful for V was,

940
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,480
he knew that he was lacking,

941
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,684
-so he kept asking me.
-How can you not like that?

942
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,654
I have never met someone like that

943
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,090
and I could really feel that
he wanted to do a good job,

944
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,092
so I just wanted to help him.

945
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,828
But because of that,

946
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:42,800
I noticed how nice it was
to film with such good people

947
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,137
and I wondered if it was always like this
since my first one was like this.

948
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,105
You can't become close to everyone
on every set.

949
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,907
-Of course not.
-No way.

950
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,177
-Anyway, this trip was a success.
-WOOSHIK: Of course.

951
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,745
PEAKBOY: This trip was a success.

952
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,215
-Despite its length, it was a success.
-Such a success.

953
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,318
And I really think it'll become
a good memory.

954
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,286
-It'll become a good memory.
-Yes.

955
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,554
Will we have a season two?

956
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,791
-Yeah, I think we'll have a second season.
-Yeah?

957
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,061
Are we going to meet in LA then?

958
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,630
(all laughing)

959
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,132
What if this doesn't do well?

960
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,435
Even so, it's a good memory,
so I don't care.

961
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,770
What if people turn it off
because it isn't fun?

962
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,939
-Then, let's do our own season two.
-Let's do that.

963
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,508
-Yeah.
-All we need is our cell phones.

964
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:30,281
PEAKBOY: You know, if there's a good one
from our still shots,

965
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,550
I'm going to print it and frame it.

966
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,118
-WOOSHIK: Nice.
-PEAKBOY: Because

967
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,622
we don't have a decent photo
of the five of us together.

968
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,690
-WOOSHIK: That's right.
-Shall we take a photo?

969
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,359
We can take something very classic.

970
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,795
We can go to a photo studio
and take a family portrait-style photo.

971
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:45,997
Then, we need to decide

972
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,033
who will be mom and dad
and who'll stand in the back.

973
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,534
-There's a place for everyone.
-(Hyungsik laughing)

974
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,003
POSITIONS MATTER IN FAMILY PORTRAITS

975
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,838
Who'll sit where the mom and dad sit?

976
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,406
That should be Seojun and Hyungsik.

977
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,309
-Are you going to wear suits?
-Dad and Mom?

978
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,644
Let's all wear suits.

979
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,479
We should all wear suits.

980
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,581
And we should get our hair
and makeup done.

981
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,216
Then, is the mom going to...

982
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,252
It's only the spot of the mom.

983
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,721
-They'll be Mom and Dad.
-Trying to dress me up as a woman?

984
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,823
-Let's go!
-PEAKBOY: Let's do this.

985
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,726
Gosh, this is so nice.

986
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,831
PEAKBOY:
<i>I am sad that tonight is our last night.</i>

987
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,034
-HYUNGSIK: <i>Let's go to bed now.</i>
-PEAKBOY: <i>Okay.</i>

988
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,669
HYUNGSIK STARTS TO PACK

989
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,171
Hyungsik, you're already packing.

990
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,473
I don't want to make noise later
when I leave.

991
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,642
-WOOSHIK: No.
-SEOJUN: Come on.

992
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,444
Rustle some noise to wake us up.

993
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,578
So what if you make noise?

994
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,113
We'll see you off.

995
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,685
V TURNS OFF THE LIGHT OF THEIR LAST NIGHT

996
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,852
V: Good night, everybody.

997
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,387
WOOSHIK: Good night.

998
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,223
PEAKBOY: That's right. The alarm.

999
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,527
-WOOSHIK: Are we waking up at ten o'clock?
-PEAKBOY: Yes.

1000
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,796
THEY SET THE ALARM AND TRY TO GO TO SLEEP

1001
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,898
SEOJUN: Gosh, you'll be tired, Hyungsik.

1002
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,033
-Hyungsik.
-HYUNGSIK: Yes.

1003
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,035
-Have a safe trip.
-HYUNGSIK: Okay.

1004
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,805
-We can't have fun without Hyungsik.
-I know.

1005
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,006
HYUNGSIK (in English): Okay.

1006
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,210
I have to fall asleep
before Seojun falls asleep.

1007
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,145
You snore loudly too.

1008
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,314
(laughter)

1009
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,350
Let's rank our snoring tonight.

1010
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,952
(calm music)

1011
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:19,523
AS EVERYONE WAS TIRED,
THE SNORING STARTED PRETTY SOON

1012
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,026
(snoring)

1013
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,160
V: The rice is ready.

1014
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,098
Go and check on it.

1015
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,969
WOOSHIK: Hyungsik, you aren't asleep.

1016
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,638
Oh, man.

1017
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,208
HYUNGSIK: I'm going to wash up
and leave in a bit.

1018
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,244
Hyungsik.

1019
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,079
See you.

1020
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,147
HYUNGSIK: Okay.

1021
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,284
WOOSHIK:
Hang in there in the cold weather.

1022
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,687
I'm going to sleep in our luggage room.

1023
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:04,435
WOOSHIK TRIES TO SLEEP IN ANOTHER ROOM

1024
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:15,946
HYUNGSIK GETS READY TO LEAVE

1025
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,254
THESE FRIENDS ARE FAST ASLEEP

1026
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:28,659
HE'S CAREFUL NOT TO WAKE ANYONE

1027
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,998
-PEAKBOY: Hey.
-Hush.

1028
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:36,901
See you.

1029
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,569
See you.

1030
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,638
-Take care.
-Bye.

1031
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,539
PEAKBOY SEES HIM OFF

1032
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,040
(sighs)

1033
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,420
HE CAREFULLY FINISHES PACKING

1034
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:02,126
HE KILLS TIME BY CHECKING HIS SCRIPT

1035
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,064
HYUNGSIK: Hello?

1036
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,299
Okay.

1037
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:21,178
HYUNGSIK WHO ENDS HIS TRIP
SOONER THAN HIS FRIENDS

1038
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,018
AND THE FOUR FRIENDS
WHO ARE STILL FAST ASLEEP

1039
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:33,424
THE LAST NIGHT OF
THEIR FRIENDCATION GROWS LATE

1040
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,161
(chirping)

1041
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:42,533
THE MORNING OF THE FINAL DAY
OF THEIR FRIENDCATION HAS COME

1042
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,804
(gentle music)

1043
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,006
(alarm clock ringing)

1044
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,776
THE LOUD ALARM GOES OFF

1045
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,881
(alarm clock ringing)

1046
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,484
HE TURNS IT OFF AND CLOSES HIS EYES AGAIN

1047
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,990
V WAKES UP TO THE ALARM

1048
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,894
BUT FALLS BACK ASLEEP

1049
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,463
Wake me up in five minutes.

1050
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,800
WHAT HAPPENED TO WOOSHIK
WHO WENT TO ANOTHER ROOM?

1051
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,408
HE IS AWAKE

1052
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,210
PEAKBOY: Get up, Seojun.

1053
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,111
SEOJUN: Yeah.

1054
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,445
PEAKBOY: Get up.

1055
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,314
-Hey, V.
-V: Yeah.

1056
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,083
Do you want some water?

1057
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,985
Why are you so suave this morning?

1058
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,957
WOOSHIK: Wake up, guys.

1059
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,358
Oh, you are awake.

1060
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,493
You're all--

1061
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,694
(groans)

1062
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,932
SINCE IT'S THEIR LAST MORNING,
THEIR GREETINGS ARE SOMEWHAT ASSERTIVE

1063
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,139
-V: Did you sleep well?
-WOOSHIK: Yeah.

1064
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:59,710
Let me see your face.

1065
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,279
Your face isn't that swollen.

1066
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,581
-Really?
-No.

1067
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:04,915
Is mine very swollen?

1068
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,085
No, the back of your head is swollen.

1069
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,486
(laughing)

1070
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,488
You said the back of your head
gets swollen.

1071
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,591
-It does get swollen.
-Yeah.

1072
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,461
V is going to make breakfast today.

1073
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,362
Really?

1074
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,831
We'll wash up and pack.

1075
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,801
Hurry. Let's hurry up and get ready.

1076
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,703
-PEAKBOY: Okay.
-WOOSHIK: Okay.

1077
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,839
First of all, let's move the bed back.

1078
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,409
-Are you still sleepy?
-That's hot.

1079
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,478
Hey, why is it so hot here?

1080
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,215
-That's hot.
-PEAKBOY: Why is it so hot?

1081
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,718
Did it burn? Did the furnace burn?

1082
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,419
Let him feel the heat.

1083
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,487
Here you go.

1084
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,488
THEY WANT V TO FEEL IT

1085
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,389
Oh!

1086
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,558
THE HOT FLOOR WAKES V RIGHT UP

1087
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,465
THEY WORK TOGETHER TO PUT THE BED BACK

1088
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,801
WOOSHIK: <i>Then I'm going to shower.</i>

1089
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,436
PEAKBOY: <i>Me too. I'm going to shower.</i>

1090
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,875
(hums)

1091
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:10,214
WHILE THE GUYS SHOWER,

1092
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,953
TODAY'S BREAKFAST COOK
HEADS TO THE KITCHEN

1093
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,989
(cheerful music)

1094
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,901
HE READS THE RECIPE CAREFULLY

1095
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,703
(sucks teeth)
It looks very easy.

1096
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,540
So 500g and 500mL?

1097
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,909
Five hundred milliliters?

1098
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,480
(plastic rustling)

1099
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,816
AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT,
HE PICKS UP THE PAPER CUP

1100
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,787
One hundred eighty.

1101
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,162
AFTER POURING IN THE CORRECT AMOUNT
OF WATER, HE STARTS BOILING IT

1102
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,233
HE CAN'T LEAVE OUT MUSIC
WHILE PREPARING BREAKFAST

1103
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,436
Hello.

1104
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,671
This is V's cooking class.

1105
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:11,341
Today is the last day of our trip.

1106
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:15,646
<i>Sujebi</i> would be better
for the last breakfast of our winter trip.

1107
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:22,152
IT'S DANCE TIME
WHILE WAITING FOR THE WATER TO BOIL

1108
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,295
-SEOJUN: <i>Are you cooking?</i>
-V: <i>Yeah.</i>

1109
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,665
SEOJUN PREPARES THE MORNING COFFEE

1110
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,567
Tea?

1111
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,202
-V: No.
-(in English) No?

1112
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,505
-Wait, I'd like tea.
-Okay.

1113
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,440
-What will you have?
-I'll have coffee.

1114
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,976
-I'll have rosemary this time.
-Rosemary?

1115
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,444
-Okay.
-Okay.

1116
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,546
(Seojun sniffs)

1117
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,418
JUN'S CAFE IS OPEN

1118
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,886
-Welcome.
-PEAKBOY: Hi.

1119
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,855
I'll have my usual, please.

1120
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,391
ORDER RECEIVED

1121
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,427
(Peakboy clears throat)

1122
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,795
SEOJUN: V, I think you can put it in.

1123
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,733
V ADDS THE SUJEBI INGREDIENTS
TO THE BOILING WATER

1124
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,236
Will Wooshik want coffee too?

1125
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,471
I think he'll say, "Sounds good."

1126
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:15,973
"Sounds good."

1127
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,674
"Sounds good to me."

1128
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,510
And...

1129
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,180
we have to clean
these things up immediately.

1130
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,048
What is the basic step of cooking?

1131
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,384
-Cleaning up.
-Cleaning while you cook.

1132
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,287
-That's right. Very good.
-Yes, sir.

1133
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,221
(grunts)

1134
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,459
-Can you pour the water?
-Okay.

1135
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,930
THEY PREPARE COFFEE FOR WOOSHIK

1136
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,000
"SNOW" BY ZION. T (FT. LEE MOON SAE)

1137
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,401
Hello.

1138
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,736
Yes, hello.

1139
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,673
-Are you going to sing along?
-PEAKBOY: Yeah.

1140
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,278
<i>♪ I hope there will be snow
on the ground tomorrow morning ♪</i>

1141
00:46:55,846 --> 00:47:00,184
<i>♪ Then I'll make

1142
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,688
WOOSHIK SHOWS UP AFTER TAKING A SHOWER

1143
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,956
SEOJUN: Wooshik, want coffee?

1144
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,158
Hello.

1145
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,696
Gosh, it smells so good.

1146
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,365
-Here you go.
-Thanks for the coffee.

1147
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,401
-Here's your rosemary tea.
-Thank you.

1148
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,635
-Cheers.
-Cheers to wrap it up.

1149
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,636
Cheers.

1150
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,342
-(V sighs)
-Oh.

1151
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,511
Now's the time.

1152
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,216
HE ADDS THE FINALE TO THE SUJEBI,
PERILLA POWDER

1153
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,417
V: That's good enough.

1154
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,186
The smell of perilla seeds.

1155
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,657
Am I doing it right?

1156
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,160
-Shall we eat now?
-Yeah, shall we try it?

1157
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,062
Do you want to try it?

1158
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,266
(slurping)

1159
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:52,903
Mmm.

1160
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,072
-It's good.
-V: Is it?

1161
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,406
WOOSHIK: It's really good,

1162
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,342
but shall we add water?

1163
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,576
It might be salty.

1164
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,578
Give it a try.

1165
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,947
-Maybe it's because I'm tired.
-Let me dip it in there.

1166
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,953
I think I'm very tired too.
(chuckles)

1167
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,790
What's interesting is that
the more you chew it the saltier it gets.

1168
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,025
SEOJUN: It is a little salty.

1169
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:20,097
(all laughing)

1170
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,666
-SEOJUN: Let's eat.
-PEAKBOY: I'm sure it'll be good.

1171
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,702
There isn't enough broth.
Should we add some water?

1172
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,805
Hang on. In the recipe,

1173
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,807
it told me to put 550ml in it.

1174
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:31,909
Of water?

1175
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,045
But since I'm making it for four people,
I put 900ml in it.

1176
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,648
-I added a liter to it.
-What is 550 times two?

1177
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,416
It's 1,100.

1178
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,718
-So why did you put 900 in it?
-I know.

1179
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:45,355
-He's like me.
-I didn't add a lot more <i>sujebi</i> to it.

1180
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:50,894
It's good, but if I eat something salty
like this, I get sleepy.

1181
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,829
-(laughter)
-I go straight to sleep.

1182
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,932
Hang on.

1183
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,400
That's it for me.

1184
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,769
No, you have to eat more, Wooshik.

1185
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,304
No, that's it for me.

1186
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,339
-That's good.
-PEAKBOY: Whoever loses

1187
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,441
in rock-paper-scissors can eat more.

1188
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,343
V, pass the water.

1189
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:07,511
(chuckles)

1190
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,712
You see,

1191
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,347
I like it watery.

1192
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,815
He's thinking about his health.

1193
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,585
WOOSHIK: Is it better with water?

1194
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,721
Oh.

1195
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,157
Give me some water.

1196
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,392
It's hot, isn't it?

1197
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,294
-Yeah, it's so hot.
-It's so hot.

1198
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,063
I need some cold water.

1199
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,764
I don't eat like this.

1200
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,333
-Me neither.
-This is too hot.

1201
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,801
This makes no sense.

1202
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,904
I think mine is still hot.

1203
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,772
(laughter)

1204
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,908
If you add more water to yours,

1205
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,744
it'll become like baby food.

1206
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,945
It's too hot.

1207
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,018
SEOJUN: He's eating his <i>sujebi</i>
like <i>nurungji</i>.

1208
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,787
PEAKBOY: Why are you hiding the <i>sujebi</i>?
Are you hogging all of it?

1209
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,055
(laughter)

1210
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,257
I like it salty though.

1211
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,625
-It's good.
-Yeah.

1212
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,394
-It isn't bad.
-It's good.

1213
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,329
It's good, but it's just too hot.

1214
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,098
There are steamed buns.

1215
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,734
-No, there aren't.
-Steamed buns.

1216
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,102
-There aren't any.
-Oh, corndogs.

1217
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,504
-Yeah, corndogs!
-Corndogs.

1218
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,739
Stop.

1219
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,906
Corndogs.

1220
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,810
-I like eating corndogs for breakfast.
-Me too.

1221
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,246
There's also <i>hotteok</i>. Make that too.

1222
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:17,214
ADD <i>HOTTEOK</i> TO THAT

1223
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,783
-Corndogs.
-PEAKBOY: Hurray! My favorite.

1224
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,951
(laughs)

1225
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,786
We can eat two each

1226
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,154
-since it's for breakfast.
-This is it.

1227
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,389
(laughing)

1228
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,693
-Wooshik.
-WOOSHIK: Yeah.

1229
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,864
So this is how you feel
when you cook for someone.

1230
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,166
When someone enjoys your food,
it makes you happy.

1231
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,334
I really enjoyed it.

1232
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,002
-It was so good.
-But it's disappointing

1233
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,904
that you didn't like it.

1234
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,373
-No, it was very good.
-Look at my bowl.

1235
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,542
-Look at mine.
-I ate the most.

1236
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,013
PEAKBOY: Butter? Gosh.

1237
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,715
The smell of butter.

1238
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,684
-Nice.
-Hang on.

1239
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,754
Seojun, is it this hard to make
kimchi fried rice too?

1240
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,624
If you think it's hard, it's hard,
and if you think it's easy, it's easy.

1241
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,658
(Peakboy groans)

1242
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,828
-Gosh, I'm going to... practice cooking.
-It burned.

1243
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,363
-SEOJUN: Oh!
-PEAKBOY: Gosh, it's okay.

1244
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,397
V: It's like a donut.

1245
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,499
PEAKBOY: I ate these all the time
when I was in middle school.

1246
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,937
<i>♪ On a rainy day ♪</i>

1247
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,639
-SEOJUN: One each.
-PEAKBOY: Okay.

1248
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,040
There are too many corndogs.

1249
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,708
SEOJUN: So Is this our first meal?

1250
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:19,643
TODAY'S BREAKFAST(?) IS READY

1251
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,712
THEY CAN ADD KETCHUP IF THEY WANT

1252
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,118
-PEAKBOY: You wrote it neat.
-(V chuckles softly)

1253
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,824
It's good.

1254
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,668
It's been ages. They're good.

1255
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,003
Yeah, I haven't had these in so long.

1256
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,940
Because the edges are burnt,
it kind of tastes like <i>dalgona</i> too.

1257
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,141
Yeah, you're right.

1258
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,677
That was good.

1259
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,379
The <i>sujebi</i> was so good.

1260
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,280
THEY FINISH THEIR LAST MEAL

1261
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:00,684
All right, then.

1262
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,552
Let's quickly wash up.

1263
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,855
-Wooshik and I already washed up.
-You did?

1264
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:05,956
You already washed up?

1265
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,925
-You'd better wash up too.
-Yeah.

1266
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,594
SEOJUN: Let's hurry up.

1267
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,696
V: I'm going to wash up, then.

1268
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,166
(bright music)

1269
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,808
THEY PACK THOROUGHLY

1270
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:29,412
SO THEY DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND

1271
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:35,418
(humming)

1272
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:45,295
AFTER V WASHES UP,

1273
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,697
HE GETS READY TO GO HOME

1274
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,239
-WOOSHIK: <i>V.</i>
-V: <i>Yes?</i>

1275
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,274
WOOSHIK: <i>You know,</i>

1276
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,076
I think you made a really good mistake.

1277
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,578
Good mistake.

1278
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,180
-You mean our trip?
-Yeah.

1279
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,482
It wasn't even planned.

1280
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,117
But it was so fun despite that.

1281
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,386
-A good mistake.
-Good mistake.

1282
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,354
It doesn't make sense.

1283
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,325
But we've made a good memory here.

1284
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,361
WOOSHIK: <i>I thought about it,</i>

1285
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,431
<i>and we won't have many chances
to do something like this.</i>

1286
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:25,302
<i>So I'm so glad we were able
to come here and do this.</i>

1287
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,204
I'm done packing.

1288
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:39,783
ONE BY ONE THEY START LEAVING

1289
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:47,057
(V singing)

1290
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,628
V: <i>Will we probably be able to go
on a trip like this in about five years?</i>

1291
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,298
IT'S REALLY TIME TO GO HOME NOW

1292
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,805
Watch out.

1293
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,379
Here we go.

1294
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:11,948
SEOJUN: Goodbye.

1295
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,216
-V: Goodbye.
-PEAKBOY: Goodbye.

1296
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,856
(Seojun humming)

1297
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,524
-V: Let's go.
-SEOJUN: Let's go.

1298
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,427
-<i>Goodbye.</i>
-WOOSHIK: <i>Goodbye, Lake Songji.</i>

1299
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:25,495
GOODBYE

1300
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,335
WOOSHIK: In a short time, we really
ate well and had a lot of fun.

1301
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,238
If we went on a trip again,
where would we go next?

1302
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,107
You know, I want to try this.

1303
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:38,775
SEOJUN: A coast-to-coast trip of the US.

1304
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,709
PEAKBOY AND V: Gosh.

1305
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,710
(in English)
Road trip.

1306
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,280
-We can camp in between.
-Sounds great.

1307
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,714
-We can take turns driving.
-Yeah.

1308
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,882
Yeah.

1309
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,451
SEOJUN: I heard that the campgrounds
are really nice there.

1310
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,387
-It's so nice.
-V: The US ones are nice.

1311
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,722
I want to try that.

1312
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:57,127
I do think it'll be fun to go on a trip
without any money.

1313
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,596
The more tired and harder it is

1314
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:03,033
-the more fun it will be.
-SEOJUN: That's true.

1315
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,535
And we need a goal.

1316
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,871
Even thinking about it is fun.

1317
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,306
AS THEIR TRIP ENDS,
THE FRIENDS DREAM OF THEIR NEXT TRIP

1318
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,374
(gentle music)

1319
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,911
THE 3-NIGHT, 4-DAY FRIENDCATION
COMES TO A CLOSE

1320
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,816
WOOSHIK: <i>I was so happy
because even though it started hastily,</i>

1321
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,019
<i>it gave me a good memory
that I would never forget.</i>

1322
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:27,023
People say that you've succeeded
if you have a couple of good friends,

1323
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,125
but I have four friends.

1324
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:32,529
<i>I have friends that can last a lifetime.</i>

1325
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:36,466
They're friends that I look forward
to spending more time with in the future.

1326
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,168
I'll remember this for a very long time.

1327
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,869
HYUNGSIK: Wait!

1328
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,472
<i>It felt like I went back to my childhood.</i>

1329
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,474
<i>Every day was so precious.</i>

1330
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:48,244
<i>Every second, every minute
seemed so precious to me.</i>

1331
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:52,315
What mattered was that
all of us came here together.

1332
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,517
Whether we ate <i>ramyeon
</i>at a convenience store

1333
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:57,087
or we went to a famous restaurant,
it doesn't matter to me.

1334
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:01,091
I don't think I'll ever make
friendships like this again.

1335
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,425
(all groan loudly)

1336
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,296
PEAKBOY: <i>While we stared at the fire,</i>

1337
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,031
<i>we talked and grilled meat.</i>

1338
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,766
Honestly, being together is just fun.

1339
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,103
When we're together,
we let loose and become honest.

1340
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,939
SEOJUN: <i>I thought we knew each other well,</i>

1341
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,074
<i>but we got to know
some things we didn't know before.</i>

1342
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:22,345
Thanks to this, I feel like I wrote
a good page in my journal.

1343
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,315
I was already thinking about
our next trip.

1344
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,385
"If we're going on a trip again,

1345
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,020
what kind of trip would be good?"
I found myself thinking that,

1346
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,156
so I must be sad that it's over.

1347
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,127
V: <i>I think a group of people
of the same feather got together.</i>

1348
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,729
When we first met,

1349
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,298
we slept on the same bed
in the same room as well.

1350
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:46,436
V: <i>This trip was so special to us.</i>

1351
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,171
We all could let loose,

1352
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,907
and the trip provided us with more energy

1353
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,309
for our personal lives.

1354
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:59,416
EVERY MOMENT TOGETHER ON THEIR TRIP

1355
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,553
THEY ARE HAPPIEST WHEN THEY'RE TOGETHER

1356
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,789
-Whoa.
-(laughter)

1357
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,525
THEY WERE THE MOST HONEST
WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER

1358
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,126
(all laughing)

1359
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,363
(soft music)

1360
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,332
FRIENDCATION IS OVER

1361
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,635
(rhythmic music)

1362
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,537
PEAKBOY: I see the tower.
We're almost in Seoul.

1363
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,640
Gosh, four days have
already come and gone.

1364
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,209
We got to eat V's favorite
<i>jjajangmyeon</i> together.

1365
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,011
That <i>jjajangmyeon</i> was good.

1366
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,147
We learned about putting <i>jjamppong</i> broth
in it because of V.

1367
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,950
We enjoyed the <i>sujebi</i> this morning too.

1368
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,252
Gosh. For real.

1369
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:38,855
V, what's wrong?

1370
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:39,789
(chuckles)

1371
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,225
-For real, what?
-Was it good?

1372
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,863
I'm sure a lot of people wondered
how Wooga hangs out.

1373
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,199
They'll think
there isn't anything special.

1374
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,267
They'll say, "Nothing special."

1375
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,003
We had plenty of fun though.

1376
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,540
-We were the only ones who had fun.
-PEAKBOY: That's good enough.

1377
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,909
IF WE HAD FUN, IT'S A SUCCESS

1378
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,413
What if I say that I have to use
the bathroom when I go home?

1379
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,414
After removing the mic.

1380
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,983
-What are we eating for dinner?
-PEAKBOY: Yeah, that too.

1381
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,185
-Oh, that's right. I'm alone.
-Oh, right.

1382
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,621
(laughter)

1383
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,823
Or since we're kind of sad it ended,

1384
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,225
-let's go there.
-Where?

1385
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,392
Incheon.

1386
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,528
Since we went to the east coast,
go to the west coast?

1387
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,563
Let's go to Eurwangni
for some grilled clams.

1388
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,966
-Let's just go.
-Are we going?

1389
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,268
-Yes, let's get excited.
-Yeah.

1390
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,804
-(in English) Let's go!
-Go!

1391
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:28,872
(laughter)

1392
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,508
My goodness.
We get to see this side of you here.

1393
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,409
(Peakboy laughing)

1394
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,582
D-DAY OF RECORDING "POLAROID"

1395
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,584
Hello, this is Peakboy.

1396
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,920
The reason why we wrote this song is

1397
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,491
because we talked a lot about time,

1398
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:53,129
so I wanted to write a pretty song,
a beautiful song.

1399
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,331
I wanted to write a lyrical song.

1400
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:56,299
(clears throat)

1401
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,367
Let me play it.

1402
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,602
HERE'S HOW THEY MADE THE TITLE TRACK

1403
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,471
<i>♪ The moments we're busy ♪</i>

1404
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,706
-Yeah, let me do this one verse.
-Okay.

1405
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:08,444
<i>♪ Time flies by so quickly ♪</i>

1406
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:12,215
<i>♪ I call a friend ♪</i>

1407
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,516
<i>♪ Reminiscing... ♪</i>

1408
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:18,288
BOTH: <i>♪ Reminiscing about you
becomes a warm memory for me ♪</i>

1409
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,423
-PEAKBOY: You can do it.
-It isn't too high for you, is it?

1410
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,058
-It's high.
-No, it isn't.

1411
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:23,893
PEAKBOY (in English): One, two, three.

1412
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,198
<i>♪ Reminiscing about you
becomes a warm memory for me ♪</i>

1413
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:35,305
(in English) <i>♪ Always be with you
Always soaring in the sky, you and I ♪</i>

1414
