1
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,879
Hello.

2
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,159
Qin Shao.

3
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,359
The thing you arranged

4
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
is already prepared over there.

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,959
But this is illegal.

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,079
Maybe we should forget it.

7
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,000
Congratulations.

8
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,479
What are you doing?

9
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,599
Xiao Xue said there's a banquet tonight.

10
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,439
I'm looking for clothes.

11
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,759
Congratulations.

12
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,159
Auntie.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,879
I have a few words to say to you.

14
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,319
Why haven't we seen Gongxi these days?

15
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,520
Our Gongxi,

16
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,879
is about to become a live-in son-in-law.

17
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,759
Boss.

18
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,599
Where's the boss?

19
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,319
The boss isn't home.

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
You are...

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,039
Uncle Zhang.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,919
Don't you recognize me?

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,960
Uh...

24
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,039
Isn't this Jiawang?

25
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,199
It really is.

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,319
Jiawang has changed a lot.

27
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,080
Looks like you've made a fortune.

28
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,080
It's just a bit of money.

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,120
Xiao Li,

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
hand out what I brought to everyone.

31
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,159
This must have cost a lot.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
Any chance to make money?

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,199
Don't keep it to yourself.

34
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,159
Come, sit down and tell us.

35
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,199
Actually,

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,639
I don't usually tell people.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,240
But since we're old neighbors,

38
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,199
Here, give me your phone.

39
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,280
Here you go.

40
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,560
Jiawang, I want one too.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,120
No rush, one at a time.

42
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,560
Jiawang, give me one.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,120
Try it yourself.

44
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,599
Is this online gambling?

45
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,360
Is it?

46
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,240
But it looks pretty legit.

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,520
I'm not playing.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,800
Me neither. Be careful not to get scammed.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,719
Exactly.

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,120
Gongxi,

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,800
I mean,

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,719
congratulations to you.

53
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,560
And congratulations to you too.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,000
By the way,

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
wait for me a moment.

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,599
Where did this country bumpkin come from?

57
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,639
Isn't this the guy chasing after Xiao Xue?

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
His family runs a tea house, right?

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Yeah, that's right.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,039
That's the guy.

61
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,039
Waiter.

62
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,560
Pack a few more portions for him.

63
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,439
Let him take them home.

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,120
Save his family some money on tea snacks.

65
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,400
And you two are?

66
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,919
Han Group.

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,400
You've heard of us, right?

68
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,400
I sure have.

69
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,000
I've heard about you, yes.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
The Han Group that's been in the news lately for a broken capital chain.

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,800
The one featured on financial news because of cash flow issues.

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,759
What nonsense are you talking about?

73
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,319
This is a banquet hosted by the Bai family to secure development rights for Beimen Street.

74
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,719
It's a reception for the development rights.

75
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,400
You came here

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
probably to seek a partnership with the Bai family.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,839
If you can't get it,

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
and can't help your company with cash flow,

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,959
What is he saying?

80
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:23,839
He said

81
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,480
He said your family's business is about to go under.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,399
What?

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,160
How dare you curse my family!

84
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,000
Someone!

85
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,319
Throw this guy out!

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Who are you calling?

87
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,439
Xiao Xue.

88
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,279
You came at just the right time.

89
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,120
Xiao Xue, this guy started trouble first.

90
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,720
That's why I wanted to kick him out.

91
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,600
He really should leave.

92
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,120
See? He's finished.

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,839
But

94
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,959
it's you who should leave.

95
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,839
Looks like Uncle Han

97
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,040
hasn't been strict enough with you lately.

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,759
Maybe I should call him right now

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,439
and tell him about your recent behavior.

100
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,600
Xiao Xue.

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Tonight,

102
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,240
it really was my fault.

103
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,360
I apologize to you.

104
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,720
Apologize to him.

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,439
Mr. Chen.

106
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,439
Please don't hold it against me.

107
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't stoop to my level.

108
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
Enjoy your meal and drinks.

109
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,279
We'll be leaving now.

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
Let's go, hurry.

111
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,399
Sorry about that.

112
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,839
It's fine.

113
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,480
Well then,

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
let's go get some fresh air.

115
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,439
What's wrong?

116
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
You're being so secretive.

117
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,839
This is for you.

118
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,360
This is too valuable.

119
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,120
I can't accept it.

120
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,920
I noticed the one on your wrist.

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,279
You've worn it since elementary school, right?

122
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,079
Qiao'er gave it to me before she went abroad.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
So at home,

124
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,720
everyone relies on you now.

125
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,920
That's what being an older brother is about.

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,839
That means you should accept it even more.

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,000
As a brother,

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,279
you can't lose face in front of your sister.

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,879
Congratulations.

130
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,720
Congratulations.

131
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,959
Auntie wants to ask you,

132
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,040
about you and Xiao Xue.

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,160
How far have you two gotten?

134
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,199
Congratulations.

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,480
Your Uncle Bai and I

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
only have one daughter.

137
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,439
Of course we want her to have a good life.

138
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm sure you understand.

139
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,480
Right?

140
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,680
Of course.

141
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,279
You're outstanding.

142
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,360
If you're gold,

143
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,600
you'll shine for sure.

144
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,360
But in Jiangcheng,

145
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,839
there's gold everywhere.

146
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:15,800
Auntie.

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,480
I understand.

148
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm glad you understand.

149
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,560
The Bai family

150
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,319
will still welcome you.

151
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,000
As long as you wear this watch sometimes,

152
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,000
just think of me.

153
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,759
Sister Zhao Zhao.

154
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,199
Congratulations.

155
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,879
Watch your step.

156
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,959
Zhao Zhao,

157
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,279
I'll get you some water.

158
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,839
Congratulations to us.

159
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,240
When did you grow up so much?

160
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,439
You look pretty handsome.

161
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Zhao Zhao,

162
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,600
Why did you drink so much?

163
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,879
I'm not happy.

164
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,079
Not happy.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,839
That's why I drink.

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,159
What happened?

167
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,159
Look at you.

168
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,919
Still a little tagalong.

169
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,440
When did you get so grown up?

170
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,679
Zhao Zhao,

171
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,559
This isn't appropriate.

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Zhao Zhao,

173
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,080
This...

174
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,679
You really drank too much.

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,080
Xiao Xue,
