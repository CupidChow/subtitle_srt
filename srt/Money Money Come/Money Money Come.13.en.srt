1
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,920
That day, Sister Zhaozhao came to me drunk.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
I made sure she was settled.

3
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,840
Nothing happened between us.

4
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,239
Who cares about that?

5
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,000
Chen Shao.

6
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,599
Uncle Dong is looking for you.

7
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:50,959
Xiaoxue.

8
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,760
Did I offend you just now?

9
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,959
You’re going against my family.

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
Isn’t that offending me?

11
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,920
Business is business.

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,439
There’s nothing I can do about it.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,319
How about this?

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,640
Let me treat you to dinner as an apology.

15
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,079
Let’s take it as a chance

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,879
to build some rapport. How about it?

17
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,560
Qin Wuyao.

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,719
Do you really think Chen Gongxi will lose to you?

19
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,360
What else?

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,120
How could he learn to play dice

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
in just one week?

22
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,000
Xiaoxue, listen to me.

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,719
Qin Wuyao.

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,719
Why are you still here?

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,599
On a date?

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,719
Is that illegal?

27
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,639
Let’s go.

28
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,319
Mr. Chen.

29
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,199
We’re just friends.

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,000
Who’s pursuing me

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,039
is none of your business.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,319
Please.

33
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,439
Xiaoxue.

34
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:48,879
I...

35
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,360
Stop the car.

36
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,759
Wait until you keep your word.

37
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,360
Talk to me after you return the house deed.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,319
Stop the car.

39
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,319
Xiaoxue.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,960
Xiaoxue.

41
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,240
I’m serious about you.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,360
Didn’t you say you’d give me a chance?

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Qin Wuyao.

44
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,680
If you’re serious,

45
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,159
don’t rush things.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,520
Xiaoxue.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,240
Don’t put yourself in danger.

49
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,599
Leave what comes next

50
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,240
to me, don’t worry.

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,120
Uncle Dong.

52
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,800
Can’t we cancel the match?

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,199
Zhaozhao.

54
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,840
Business is like a battlefield.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,319
Adapt to challenges as they come.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,680
Running away is the worst option.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Qin Wuyao is known as the Dice Cup Prince.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,080
Of course you’re worried Gongxi will lose.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,319
But think about it—

60
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,599
why would I

61
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,080
trust all my assets to Gongxi?

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
In venture capital,

63
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,080
talent is the key to success.

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,599
How clever.

65
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,319
I know someone

66
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,240
who’s an even better Dice King than Qin Wuyao.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,400
Now it’s up to how fast Gongxi can improve.

68
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,039
Gongxi.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,759
Uncle Dong knows about it.

70
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,520
He wants me to take you to meet an expert.

71
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,040
Sister Zhaozhao.

72
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,319
Zhao...

73
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,600
You really drank too much.

74
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,199
That day...

75
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,800
That day...

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,839
I forgot everything.

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,839
Sorry for causing you trouble.

78
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,079
Everyone has bad days.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,480
By the way, Sister Zhaozhao,

80
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,240
who’s the expert you invited?

81
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,240
You’ll know when we get there.

82
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,759
Miss Qin.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Chen Shao.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,519
Please come in.

85
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,480
Thank you.

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,560
I’ve brought him.

87
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,000
I’ll leave the rest to you.

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,759
Congratulations, we meet again.

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,800
I didn't expect it to be you.

90
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,560
Third Uncle was a famous Dice King in his youth.

91
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,439
His dice skills were truly extraordinary.

92
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,399
That's all ancient history now.

93
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,439
But if you want to defeat Qin Wuyao,

94
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,639
you'll need Third Uncle's guidance.

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,839
Dice isn't like mahjong.

96
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,720
It's not about brainpower.

97
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,240
It's about the unity of ear, eye, hand, body, and mind.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,879
It's not easy to master in a short time.

99
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Come here, Xiao Liu.

100
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,079
My last disciple.

101
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,319
Hello, Brother Liu.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,079
Young Master Chen.

103
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Shaking dice

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,639
is a real craft.

105
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,319
You don't have enough time.

106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,399
Start by practicing your hands.

107
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,079
If you can't pass this stage,

108
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,720
I can't help you either.

109
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,199
Understood.

110
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,279
Xiao Liu, you teach him first.

111
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,439
Zhaozhao.

112
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Play a game of chess with me.

113
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,920
Okay.

114
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,240
Young Master Chen.

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll show you how it's done.

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,199
Zhaozhao,

117
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,160
you really know how to challenge me.

118
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,079
Third Uncle.

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,639
When it comes to dice, if you're second,

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,879
no one dares claim to be first.

121
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,120
You came with him

122
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,399
because Uncle Dong wanted you to.

123
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,639
That's not it.

124
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,920
You've never been in a relationship, have you?

125
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Third Uncle,

126
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
it's not what you think.

127
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,839
I just don't want Beimen Street

128
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
to fall into the Qin family's hands.

129
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,360
That's all.

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,519
Let's drop it.

131
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,680
Come play chess with me.

132
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,120
Too bad, you were so close.

133
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's stop practicing here.

134
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,959
I can keep going.

135
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,800
Calm your mind before you move.

136
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,079
You won't succeed like this.

137
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,600
Take a break.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,560
Obsessing over winning ensures you'll lose.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,360
Sister Zhaozhao, what did you say?

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Uncle Chen said it.

141
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,879
Obsessing over winning ensures you'll lose.

142
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,279
I understand.

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
The Tai Chi

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,199
embraces the primal chaos.

145
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,639
Two forms emerge.

146
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,519
Four images revolve.

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
Eight trigrams divide.

148
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,079
Limitlessness gives birth.

149
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,879
Begin like a deep abyss.

150
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,639
Energy sinks to the dantian.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,319
Focus your intent on the origin.

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,519
Yin and yang harmonize.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
Softness contains strength.

154
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,120
Emptiness holds the mountain.

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,800
Waist is the axis, feet are the root.

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
Abdomen is the sea, spine is the river.

157
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,879
Clinging to victory or defeat

158
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,759
stifles your energy.

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,600
Let go to gain.

160
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,040
Emptiness brings achievement.

161
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,639
That night, Sister Zhaozhao came to me drunk.

162
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,759
I just made sure she was settled.

163
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,879
Nothing happened between us.

164
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,159
Xiaoxue,

165
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Sorry for making you misunderstand.

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,879
Please don’t put yourself in danger.

167
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,519
From now on,

168
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,080
leave everything to me.

169
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,519
Don’t worry.

170
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,360
I just need a small favor from you.

171
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,519
I promised my mom

172
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,399
never to gamble.

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440
The prize money from the tournament paid for Qiao’er to study abroad.

174
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,519
The rest of the money

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,480
was used to open a small teahouse at our ancestral home.

176
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,519
So the neighbors have a place to gather and chat.

177
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,519
I thought it was just a competition.

178
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn’t expect it would cause you so much trouble.

179
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,519
We still don’t know

180
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,720
what Qin Wuyao will do next.

181
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,000
So,

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
I have to take part.

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,480
All this time,

184
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,600
it’s been Gongxi bearing all the pressure.

185
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,240
This time, I can’t just stand by.

186
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,200
Whenever you wear this watch,

187
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,840
just think of me.

188
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
As a friend,

189
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,759
this gift is too valuable.

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,039
Mr. Chen, we’re just friends.

191
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
Xiaoxue,

192
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,759
I’m sorry.

193
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,399
Gongxi,

194
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,639
this time,

195
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,639
I’ll find another way to help you.

196
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,440
Miss, your drink is ready.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why are you drinking alone?
