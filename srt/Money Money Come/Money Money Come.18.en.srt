1
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,519
Let me introduce you.

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,599
He is the famous Chen Zhengli's

3
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,159
Uncle Dong.

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,719
If you insist on hurting him today,

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,239
then you'll have to go through me first.

6
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,560
You're fighting alone,

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,439
while the whole Yaode Group

8
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,519
has hundreds of people working in secret.

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
How can you possibly fight them?

10
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,680
Let me help you figure things out.

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,719
I'll tell you everything, no secrets.

12
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,159
Gongxi.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,520
My condolences.

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Where is Qin Defeng?

15
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,639
When Uncle Dong had his accident,

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,400
my father was with me the whole time.

17
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,800
I understand.

18
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,479
This

19
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,680
is your choice.

20
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,960
Gongxi.

21
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,159
Calm down.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
We don't have any evidence yet.

23
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm calmer now than ever

24
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,520
before.

25
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,199
Gongxi.

26
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,639
What are you going to do?

27
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,520
Let's talk.

28
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,439
What do you want to talk about?

29
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
Uncle Dong is dead.

30
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,159
I heard.

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,439
He was a good friend of mine for years.

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,879
It's a shame.

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,439
But A Cai is still alive.

34
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,080
You know him well.

35
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,840
He used to be your driver, after all.

36
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,520
You mean him?

37
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
How did my father really die?

38
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,879
Your father?

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,360
What do you mean, how did he die?

40
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Back then, everyone said he was gambling overseas

41
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
and jumped into the sea to his death.

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,319
But the only one with him at the time

43
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,920
was you.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,240
I think

45
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,600
maybe you've misunderstood something.

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Whether it's a misunderstanding

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
we'll know when A Cai wakes up.

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,399
Hello?

49
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,839
This is Qin Defeng.

50
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,160
You haven't eaten all day.

51
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,680
Have something to eat.

52
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,959
I can't eat.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,879
I spent a long time making this.

54
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,639
It's fine.

55
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,319
Young Master Chen.

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,839
Miss Bai.

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,240
Something happened.

58
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,240
What exactly happened?

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,639
Gongxi.

60
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,399
You're here.

61
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,639
Why are you here?

62
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,079
Zhaozhao.

63
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,399
According to Wenhua International's board,

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Mr. Dong Zhongping's transfer of shares to Chen Gongxi

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,319
has not yet taken effect.

66
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,399
Mr. Dong has no legal heir.

67
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,959
According to company regulations,

68
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,920
his shares are repurchased by other shareholders.

69
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,720
Yaode Group has completed legal procedures

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,079
to purchase Wenhua International's shares.

71
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,480
They are now the largest shareholder.

72
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
Gongxi.

73
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
As your elder,

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
let me give you one more piece of advice.

75
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,839
Leave here immediately.

76
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:10,879
Otherwise,

77
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,720
security will escort you out.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,879
I'd like to see who dares.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,639
Sister Xiaoyun.

80
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,720
Let's go.

81
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,360
Sister Xiaoyun.

82
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
You heard it just now.

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,800
I have nothing left.

84
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,399
You don't have to follow me.

85
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,720
Young Master Chen.

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,399
I've followed Uncle Dong for sixteen years.

87
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,319
You're not the only one who wants to take on Qin Defeng.

88
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,160
There are others too.

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,879
Alright.

90
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,519
What about you all?

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Young Master Chen, we're with you.

92
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,120
Alright.

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,560
Thank you.

94
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,639
Young Master Chen.

95
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,199
What do we do next?

96
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,839
He's fallen into the trap now.

97
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,160
We wait.

98
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,079
Wait for what?

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,360
A Cai.

100
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,959
How is he?

101
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,240
Young Master Chen.

102
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,519
Just as you said,

103
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,920
he really showed up.

104
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,279
We've already called the police.

105
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,120
He's been taken to the station to assist with the investigation.

106
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,839
Got it.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Hello.

108
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,399
Hello, we're investigating Qin Defeng.

109
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,839
Please cooperate with us.

110
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,360
Alright, understood.

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,439
We already have some evidence.

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,399
Chen Zhengli.

113
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm his son.

114
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,080
You look

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,919
so much like him.

116
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,600
He

117
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,960
He was

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,600
What?

119
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,159
murdered.

120
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,759
What did you say?

121
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,840
Excuse me, please.

122
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,360
Please make way.

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,399
Notify the emergency room quickly.

124
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,200
Okay.

125
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,200
Dad.

126
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,879
The truth is about to come out.
