1
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,560
Wait a second.

2
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,799
What now?

3
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
I want a new set of tiles for every round.

4
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,319
I've never heard of that rule.

5
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,280
Rules?

6
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,840
The competition rules don't say we can't change tiles.

7
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,560
What does that mean? Why change tiles?

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,640
Uncle Bo is really cunning.

9
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,120
Don't worry.

10
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
You could call them the dark horse.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
They'll never expect

12
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,799
that our attacker is Xiaoxue.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,599
Round three, Bai Ruoxue wins by self-draw.

14
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,000
The other three haven't reached tenpai.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,039
Round four, Bai Ruoxue wins with pure one suit, self-draw from three players.

16
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,599
Uncle Bo wins by self-draw from two players.

17
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,199
Qin Wuyao and Chen Gongxi haven't reached tenpai.

18
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,680
That's strange.

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,159
Even though Gongxi is helping Xiaoxue,

20
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,639
he still has to defend against opponents like Uncle Bo.

21
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,000
It's surprising Xiaoxue can score so easily.

22
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,599
It's as if Gongxi is controlling the flow of tiles,

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,919
making it possible for Xiaoxue to self-draw.

24
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,319
Self-draw.

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,759
Round five, Bai Ruoxue and Qin Wuyao score with self-draw.

26
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,919
Round six, no winner.

27
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,039
Bai Ruoxue and Uncle Bo score with kong.

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,319
They change tiles every round.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
But how does this kid still seem to remember the tiles?

30
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,360
Round seven.

31
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,479
You help me.

32
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,159
Win.

33
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,719
Round seven, Qin Wuyao discards the winning tile to Bai Ruoxue.

34
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,360
Bai Ruoxue discards the winning tile to two players, all chows.

35
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,919
It's the last round. He barely won last time.

36
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,120
There's no way to catch up in points.

37
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,120
Looking at the current rankings,

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,159
it should be "sit and win."

39
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,919
No matter how you look at it, it's impossible.

40
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,719
But what if he actually pulls it off?

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,479
Kid,

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,000
can you guess what tiles I have?

43
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,560
Uncle Bo, how could I guess?

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,159
Let me try guessing.

45
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,319
I haven't even reached tenpai twice.

46
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,280
And I won with a lousy hand.

47
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm so proud I could fly.

48
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,879
Still want to guess?

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,919
Got x-ray vision?

50
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,400
Six circles.

51
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,240
How is that possible?

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Young Master Qin,

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,120
relax.

54
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,079
Don't think guessing a tile means you'll win.

55
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,560
It's just luck.

56
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,120
Luck?

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Then Young Master Qin, guess

58
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,360
if my tile is lucky or not.

59
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,800
What's going on?

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,399
Pure one suit, double kong, self-draw.

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,519
Seventeen points for each player.

62
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,560
If none of you can make

63
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,079
the highest fan pattern and self-draw from two players,

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,279
you lose.

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
Still want to play, Young Master Qin?

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
Can you do it, Uncle Bo?

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
I declare

68
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,399
this match

69
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,240
represented by Chen Gongxi and Bai Ruoxue

70
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,000
is won by Cangwu Group.

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,560
We won! We won!

72
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,879
We won! Yes!

73
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,519
Stay away from me.

74
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,360
We won!

75
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,399
Qin Wuyao.

76
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,639
The result is decided.

77
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,319
The right to negotiate first

78
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,399
belongs to our Cangwu Group.

79
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,720
Chen Gongxi

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,439
That's a good name.

81
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,879
Congratulations.

82
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,560
Thank you, Uncle Bo.

83
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,480
I noticed it.

84
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,959
In the last few rounds,

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,959
you clearly knew the position of the tiles.

86
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,759
Can you tell me

87
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,519
how you did it?

88
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,199
Someone once told me

89
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,120
to always keep an extra trick.

90
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,199
Since then, I realized

91
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,560
you're just like me,

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
you can also track the tiles.

93
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,800
So you must know

94
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,639
how to deal with someone who tracks tiles.

95
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,920
That's why I practiced an extra skill.

96
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,079
Each tile has a different texture.

97
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,360
The friction is different too.

98
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,480
Someone sensitive

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,759
can feel the differences.

100
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,519
Eight Bamboo.

101
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,519
Why did you lose at the beginning?

102
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,879
First, because I'm not always

103
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,439
right every time.

104
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,279
Second,

105
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,160
I wanted you to think

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
I had no backup plan.

107
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,839
The younger generation will surpass the older.

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,879
I lost.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,279
There were some tiles I wasn't sure about.

110
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,439
Especially the Characters.

111
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,519
But

112
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,959
it seems I was a bit luckier this time.

113
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,240
Good luck

114
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,199
is also part of skill.

115
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,800
Uncle Bo.

116
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:12,800
Young Qin.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,560
Anything else?

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
Anything else?

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,240
Let me ask you,

120
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
how did Chen Gongxi win?

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,480
Young Qin.

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
There's always someone better.

123
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,600
By the way,

124
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,519
thanks for finding me

125
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,560
such a strong opponent.

126
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,839
But remember,

127
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
you can't win.

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,519
I won't give you a single cent of the money after this.

129
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,480
The old man loves money,

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,639
but some things

131
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,800
are more important than money.

132
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,800
So you're Chen Gongxi.

133
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,079
Cangwu really owes you this time.

134
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,720
My daughter has been talking to me these past days,

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,800
and she keeps mentioning you.

136
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,439
Dad, what are you talking about?

137
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:06,920
Gongxi.

138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
If there's anything you want,

139
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,480
just tell Uncle Bai.

140
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
I don't want anything.

141
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,319
I just hope Uncle Bai keeps his promise.

142
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,040
When developing Beimen Street Alley,

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,600
don't harm the neighbors' interests.

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,680
Of course.

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
My word is good as gold.

146
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,040
Thank you, Uncle Bai.

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,399
The match is over now.

148
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll head out first.

149
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,720
What's the rush?

150
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,680
Is someone chasing you away?

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,959
Stay a few more days.

152
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,600
No, I need to get back to the teahouse.

153
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,279
Uncle Zhang and the others are at the teahouse.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
I don't want to keep troubling you.

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
It's no trouble at all.

156
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,600
You worked so hard preparing for the match.

157
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,639
Xiaoxue is right.

158
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,440
Stay a few more days, don't rush.

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
If we ask you to stay, just stay.

160
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,360
Listen to your elders.

161
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:42,840
By the way,

162
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,120
we're having a celebration dinner tonight.

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,799
You, our hero, must come.

164
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,559
You're the real hero.

165
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,320
I am pretty impressive, aren't I?

166
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,039
A great teacher makes great students, that's true.

167
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,279
Many years ago,

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,960
I beat Chen Zhengli.

169
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,039
Today,

170
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,159
my son actually lost to his son.

171
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,080
That Chen Gongxi isn't anything special.

172
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,799
The reason I lost is

173
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,039
because someone helped him.

174
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,080
Who?

175
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,279
Qin Zhaozhao.

176
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,320
She helped Chen Gongxi several times.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
And every time she...

178
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,919
Qin Wuyao.

179
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
Spreading rumors comes at a cost.

180
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
What he said is true.

181
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,639
I did go to see Chen Gongxi.

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,639
But it was just to get news about the Bai family.

183
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,600
Do you even believe that yourself?

184
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,440
Look at yourself.

185
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,360
You're practically clinging to him.

186
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,960
Shut up.

187
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I only care about the result.

188
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,080
Beimen Street Alley.

189
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,679
It must belong to the Qin family.

190
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,600
But...

191
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,960
Cangwu has already won.

192
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,120
Zhaozhao.

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm telling you for the last time.

194
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,240
You

195
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,720
are a Qin.

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,440
You're the one who hates Uncle Chen.

197
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,679
But why should your feud affect us?

198
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,399
Chen Gongxi.
