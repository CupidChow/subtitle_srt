1
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,000
Four foie gras nigiri

2
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
And sashimi

3
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,599
Sukiyaki

4
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,879
And some premium tempura

5
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,879
Ziwei

6
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm not very hungry

7
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,079
Do you not like what I ordered?

8
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,280
Then I'll order something else

9
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,280
Japanese-style raw beef

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,040
Salmon nigiri

11
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
And two orders of sea urchin

12
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,439
One order

13
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,439
One is enough

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Alright

15
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,719
And two bottles of sake

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,599
Ziwei

17
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,799
Let's skip the sake

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,680
It's fine, sake is low in alcohol

19
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,200
Just have a little with me to cheer me up

20
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,079
Just one bottle

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,319
Okay, whatever you say

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
That's all, thank you

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Ziwei

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,359
I'm going to the restroom, you wait here

25
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:17,960
Gongxi

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,680
Don't get involved with people from Yaode Group anymore

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,439
Do you understand?

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,479
Those people should be gone now

29
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,840
They'd better not bother me again

30
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,840
Come on, cheers

31
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,240
Brother Gongxi

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,840
How long have we known each other?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,719
About eight years

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,919
Eight years

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,759
So what do you think of me?

36
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,280
You're great

37
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,159
You took good care of me when I stayed at your place

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
I'm not talking about before, I mean now

39
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,919
You're like a sister to me

40
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
Always have been, always will be

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,520
But you helped me so much at the club

42
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,680
It's natural to help my sister, we've known each other since we were kids

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,159
No

44
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,680
You don't like me

45
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,360
I do

46
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,560
But it's the kind of affection a brother has for his sister

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Chen Gongxi

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,599
You mean

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,319
You don't like me

50
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,159
If you mean that kind of love

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,599
No

52
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,439
Ziwei, stop drinking

53
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,639
If you don't like me, why do you care?

54
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,159
I'll take you home

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
What's in the drink?

56
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,639
Brother Gongxi

57
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,960
I've already given you a chance

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,199
If you really liked me

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,960
I wouldn't turn you in

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,319
Turn me in for what?

61
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,199
They said if they catch you

62
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,159
They have countless ways to make you play Mahjong for them

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,599
And my father's debt will be cleared

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,599
But don't worry

65
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,319
I won't let you help me for nothing

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,560
Brother Gongxi

67
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,719
You said

68
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,919
If you pay off my debt

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
I'll spend one night with you

70
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,199
Then we'll be even

71
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
We meet again.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,959
Are you feeling dizzy?

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Don't get too worked up.

74
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,160
Otherwise, the medicine will hit you harder, you know?

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,439
You just lack experience.

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,759
Chen Gongxi.

77
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Back at the club,

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,680
I tried to talk sense into you, but you wouldn't listen.

79
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,879
You insisted on ending up like this.

80
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,199
This outcome.

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Despicable.

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,319
Enough talking. You guys come in.

83
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,399
Where are they?

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,199
I told you to come in.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,639
I'm the one who stopped them from coming in.

86
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,240
Long time no see.

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,160
Wu Yao.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
That's Chen Gongxi.

89
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,600
So you're just going to

90
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
try to take him away like this?

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,279
Sister.

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,439
I don't understand at all.

94
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,199
Stop pretending.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
Take your accomplice and leave now.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,560
You're with Yaode too. If Dad—

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,399
Should I call the police?

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,319
Wait for the police to come.

99
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,439
Let them see what's going on.

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,360
My brother is so smart.

101
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,920
He'll know what to do.

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,319
Take that woman and get out.

103
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you deaf?

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,639
Who is she?

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,000
Did you forget how your dad died?

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,759
It's been three years. You haven't played Mahjong since.

107
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,439
Why did you play again?

108
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,000
Mom.

109
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,439
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,519
I did it for—

111
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,319
What are you trying to say?

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,399
You mean you—

113
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
Did it to save me?

114
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,959
That's just an excuse.

115
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,079
Do you know your expression when you play?

116
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,680
That focus and calculation.

117
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,439
You know it in your heart.

118
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,160
This is where your talent shines.

119
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,399
There are so many Mahjong players in the world.

120
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,040
Why is it impossible for you?

121
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,279
No.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
I promised my mom.

123
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,759
I can't.

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,920
Gongxi.

125
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
What do you think—

126
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,639
was the reason I died?

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
You're awake.

128
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,279
Is it that serious? I'm not going to eat you.

129
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,399
Why are you here?

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
I—

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,680
Hello, Chen Gongxi.

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,759
Chen Gongxi.

133
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,720
Hello.

134
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm representing Cangwu Group.

135
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:06,920
That's too formal.

136
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,759
Chen Gongxi, name your price.

137
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,519
Name your price.

138
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,199
He doesn't look like he wants money.

139
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,240
Just passing by.

140
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,959
How did I get back?

141
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,519
You have the nerve to ask?

142
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,560
Someone on a motorcycle brought you.

143
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,240
What's up with him?

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,439
How could he do that?

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
The one on the motorcycle?

146
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,159
Was it a man or a woman?

147
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,120
You don't know, and you're asking me?

148
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,440
Weren't you awake?

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,639
I—

150
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,799
A woman.

151
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,360
A woman.

152
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,799
Not bad, Chen Gongxi.

153
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,120
Girls seem to like you.

154
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,039
Isn't one Ziwei enough?

155
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,120
You have to bring another one too. By the way—

156
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,679
Why did Qin Wuyao ask me to play Mahjong?

157
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Because you're skilled.

158
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,039
Yeah.

159
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,320
I saw you at a tournament three years ago.

160
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,919
You were wearing a mask back then.

161
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,799
I couldn't see your face clearly.

162
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,240
But your Mahjong skills made a strong impression.

163
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
So why is the Qin family looking for me?

164
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,799
I have some disputes with the Qin family.

165
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,879
What kind of dispute?

166
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,799
Well,

167
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,799
It's about an equity transfer in a company.

168
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Beimen Street and Alley.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,039
After Lü's company won the bid, they delayed development.

170
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,879
Now the business is struggling.

171
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,200
They need to transfer equity.

172
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,120
And bring in new investment.

173
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,519
Now Yaode and your Cangwu group

174
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,759
both want to acquire the equity.

175
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,679
Then let’s compete at the negotiation table.

176
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,080
Cangwu isn’t afraid.

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,639
Your two groups are evenly matched.

178
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,159
Lü’s company doesn’t want to offend either side.

179
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,360
That’s why they asked me to step in.

180
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,720
It’s a business association tradition.

181
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
The older generation wants to keep the peace.

182
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,519
So they play a round of Mahjong.

183
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,960
My suggestion is,

184
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,240
you two should have a Sichuan Mahjong professional match.

185
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,879
Lü’s company will negotiate first with the winner.

186
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,679
As for the outcome,

187
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,279
it depends on your negotiation skills.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,679
Beimen Street and Alley.

189
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,600
Yeah.

190
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Both groups want to get involved.

191
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,720
Yes.

192
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,000
If Qin Wuyao gets it,

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,039
he’ll tear this place down.

194
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,399
Wouldn’t your family do the same?

195
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,200
I think

196
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,679
I actually like this place.

197
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
We could persuade Lü’s company

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,080
to submit a new development plan.

199
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,000
Like turning it into a cultural district.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,559
Miss Bai.

201
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,000
I promised my mom

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,240
I wouldn’t play Mahjong anymore.

203
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,879
It’s okay.

204
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,440
I won’t force you.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,360
But you don’t mind being friends, right?

206
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,639
Chen Gongxi.

207
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,399
Call me Xiaoxue.

208
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,120
Miss Qin.

209
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,559
Uncle Dong.

210
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Did you see him?

211
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:09,679
Yes, I did.

212
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
And I even fell for a childish trick.

213
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,320
That’s all thanks to your brother.

214
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,559
Uncle Dong.

215
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,120
He’s not my brother.

216
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,759
He’s still your half-brother.

217
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,840
Blame your father for being biased.

218
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,519
You promised me.

219
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,720
If I help you,

220
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,840
you’ll help me in return.

221
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,879
Of course.

222
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,000
Right now,

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
you haven’t really helped yet.

224
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,559
I don’t understand.

225
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,559
Why do I have to help him?

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
You should know

227
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
whose son he is.

228
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,919
Of course.

229
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,840
My father’s old rival.

230
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,080
Chen Zhengli’s son.

231
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,600
The enemy of my enemy

232
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,799
is a friend.

233
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,679
But Uncle Chen

234
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,960
is already dead.

235
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,159
Because Chen Zhengli is gone,

236
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,279
your Qin family and the Bai family

237
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,639
are fighting over that land.

238
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,679
If he were still here,

239
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:11,519
who would dare?

240
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,120
Uncle Chen was a good man.

241
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,039
So

242
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,639
you should help him even more.

243
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,639
But why does it have to be me?

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,679
You know,

245
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,320
in this game right now,

246
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
only Chen Gongxi can make the move.

247
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Besides, you have some history with him.

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,559
If you don’t help him, who will?

249
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,919
So what,

250
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,200
do you actually dislike him?

251
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,279
He's a bit silly.

252
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,240
But I don't dislike him.

253
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,000
Then that's settled.

254
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,120
I'll leave this to you.

255
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,639
Gongxi.

256
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm back.

257
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,840
Do you really not remember me?

258
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,159
Who is she?
