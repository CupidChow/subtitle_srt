1
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,959
When did you grow up so much?

2
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,200
Sister Zhaozhao,

3
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,079
This isn't appropriate.

4
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,200
Sister Zhaozhao,

5
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,519
This...

6
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,120
You really drank too much.

7
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,439
Xiaoxue,

8
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Your watch—

9
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,840
You forgot to take it.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,239
I thought about it.

11
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,599
I still can't accept it.

12
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,439
Why?

13
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,000
Is it just because of what my mom said?

14
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,960
It has nothing to do with her.

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Then what does it have to do with?

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,879
As friends,

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
this gift is too valuable.

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,319
What?

19
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,960
As—

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,479
friends.

21
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,080
Gongxi,

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,639
Gongxi.

23
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,199
Inside is—

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,120
Sister Zhaozhao is drunk.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

26
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,680
I got it.

27
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,080
Wait, what do you mean you got it?

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,960
She showed up unexpectedly.

29
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,519
Gongxi

30
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,759
Gongxi, something terrible happened!

31
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,279
This is bad.

32
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:21,759
What happened?

33
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,439
Wu Wen

34
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,639
He wants to jump off the building.

35
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,279
Uncle Zhang

36
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,920
Where is he?

37
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,160
He's still up there.

38
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,199
Awen

39
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,680
Don't come over.

40
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,079
Okay.

41
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,759
I won't come over.

42
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,519
Just tell me what happened.

43
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,600
Brother Gongxi

44
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,319
I'm just a loser.

45
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,959
Who said you're a loser? I'll beat them up!

46
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,759
I lost all the money for my wedding with Jingjing.

47
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,680
And my mom's house too.

48
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,240
Alright.

49
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,279
Calm down first.

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
I'll help you figure out the money.

51
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:56,879
Just come over here.

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,480
Stop!

53
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,360
You told me long ago not to gamble.

54
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,160
But I...

55
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,800
I've let my parents down.

56
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
I've let Jingjing down.

57
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,759
I'm sorry, Brother Gongxi.

58
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,800
Awen

59
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,319
How is he now?

60
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,480
Gongxi is back.

61
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,720
Gongxi, Awen...

62
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,079
Luckily, the awning broke his fall.

63
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,040
The doctor said he's out of danger.

64
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,000
Uncle Zhang

65
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,680
What exactly happened these past few days?

66
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
You weren't here before.

67
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,759
Jiawang came back.

68
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,879
He recommended this to everyone.

69
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Isn't this online gambling?

70
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Yeah.

71
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,120
Everyone believed Jiawang's words.

72
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,680
Two or three people fell for it.

73
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,199
They invested a little at first.

74
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,240
When they saw big returns, they got bolder.

75
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,199
They borrowed money to keep playing.

76
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,639
Online gambling uses fixed algorithms.

77
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,439
They let users win at first.

78
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,959
It's just to lure people in.

79
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,680
You only care about the interest.

80
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,360
But they want your principal.

81
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,160
It's more than just the principal.

82
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,560
Now look what happened.

83
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,800
Two or three families sold their houses to pay off debts.

84
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,920
Selling their houses?

85
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,160
Who did they sell to?

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,319
Yao De Group, of course.

87
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,480
Who else could it be?

88
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
Uncle Zhang

89
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,040
Where does Jiawang live?

90
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,319
What are you doing?

91
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,439
What do you want?

92
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,560
Online gambling is illegal.

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,680
What nonsense is this?

94
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,279
Did he tell you to scam the neighbors?

95
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,600
Who do you think you are?

96
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Do I know you?

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,759
I'm Chen Gongxi.

98
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,360
If it doesn't concern me,

99
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,720
stop blaming me for everything.

100
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,000
Then why did those families

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,559
sell their houses to Yao De Group?

102
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,559
It's because of online gambling.

103
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,600
They owed money and sold their houses to me to pay off debts.

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,240
Their places are all old and shabby small apartments.

105
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,600
I offered a fair price.

106
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,039
Why wouldn't they sell?

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
Don't forget,

108
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,240
they're the ones begging me now.

109
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,600
Go ahead.

110
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
You're the one running online gambling.

111
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,039
President Qin, didn't you tell me to do it?

112
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,639
What did I tell you to do?

113
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,440
You can eat whatever you want,

114
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,919
but words

115
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
can't be spoken carelessly.

116
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
How are you, Gongxi?

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,960
Where is Jiawang?

118
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,159
Gongxi.

119
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,240
Can you find Jiawang?

120
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,639
My house...

121
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,440
Can I get my money back?

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,240
My house...

123
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,679
Enough.

124
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,080
Stop bothering Gongxi.

125
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Didn't you all call the police?

126
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,080
The investigation takes time.

127
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,000
You brought this upon yourselves.

128
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,360
Don't forget.

129
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,039
Now they're the ones begging me.

130
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,799
Sorry, Brother Gongxi.

131
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,039
Awen.

132
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,360
Mom said to remember everyone's kindness.
