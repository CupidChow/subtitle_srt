1
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,079
Kept claiming

2
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,920
Chen Gongxi listens to you

3
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,920
Mr. Qin

4
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,719
I really didn't expect it

5
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,599
Didn't expect it

6
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,799
He's not interested in you

7
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,239
Xu Ziwei

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,920
Your dad owes me money

9
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,799
How will he pay it back?

10
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,920
Mr. Qin, didn't you say last time

11
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,359
The person

12
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,280
I didn't catch him

13
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,120
Mr. Qin

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
Please give us a little more time

15
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,400
You think this is a game?

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,319
No, Mr. Qin

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,920
We can definitely convince that guy

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,760
No need for that

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,239
But

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,439
If you can stop him from teaming up with the Bai family

21
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,239
I might reconsider

22
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,560
No problem, Mr. Qin. Don't worry

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,879
See them out

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,479
Xu Ziwei

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,439
If

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
If you can find your dad

27
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,400
Remember to remind him

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
Stop gambling

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,719
Contact Uncle Bo

30
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,879
Tell him there's a tournament

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,000
He'll be interested

32
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,680
Uncle Bo, call from the Qin family

33
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,639
You can't bet more than two here

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
Got it, Gongxi

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Thanks, come again next time

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Alright, Gongxi, goodbye

37
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,719
Hurry up, it's inside

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,319
Gongxi Teahouse, right?

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,840
Bro, hurry up

40
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,560
Chen Gongxi

41
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,000
What's with the setup?

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,800
Morning

43
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,719
Go, hand out the stuff to everyone

44
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,639
Okay

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Why are you standing there?

46
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,599
Pour me a cup of tea

47
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm Gongxi

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Teahouse

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Am I crazy or did Gongxi strike it rich?

50
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,199
Can't you tell?

51
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,360
Congrats

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
He married into her family

53
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,479
What's this?

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,840
Tea

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,479
Go

56
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,360
Bring the pre-Qingming tea from the car

57
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
What exactly do you want?

59
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,960
For your teahouse

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,360
Raise the dining standards

61
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,639
Improve the customer experience

62
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,680
Then I should thank you

63
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,120
You're welcome

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,199
But

65
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,560
If you want to repay me

66
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,720
That's possible

67
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,160
I said before

68
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,040
That tournament between you and the Qin family

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm not going

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,839
If the Qin family invests in the Lü family

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,879
They'll definitely suggest tearing this down for business

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,839
Are you just going to watch

73
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,399
everyone move out of Beimen Alley?

74
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm still here

75
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,959
Would he dare kick me out?

76
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,920
Come on

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,839
They got the land with real strength

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,800
Or do you

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,959
still want to be a holdout resident?

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,079
Brother, there are so many big trees in this yard

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,519
Qiao'er, Gongxi

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,120
Beimen Alley will be our home from now on

83
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,040
Is that okay?

84
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,839
But

85
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,759
I do have a way

86
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,439
You don't have to play mahjong

87
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,360
Just come in

88
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,079
Young Qin

89
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,439
Miss Bai went to Beimen Alley again today

90
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,240
What did Uncle Bo say about that place?

91
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,759
Uncle Bo agreed

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
He'll be in the mainland in a few days

93
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,199
Okay

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
Are they still handling things over there?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,199
Of course

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Xiaoxue is still there

97
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,279
Tell the Xu family

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,199
It's time

99
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,319
Okay

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,600
No.

101
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,040
Why?

102
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,639
You don't even have to play yourself.

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Can't you just teach me?

104
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,639
I'm not as good as you think.

105
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,680
Come on, you're the Mahjong Champion.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,879
I just got lucky.

107
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
You two are pretty sweet together.

108
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,519
Enough talk, let's play.

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,519
Miss Bai.

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,199
Stop.

111
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,160
Call me Xiaoxue.

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,519
Xiaoxue.

113
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Anything else is fine.

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,839
But this—

115
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,079
Really can't.

116
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,040
Chen Gongxi.

117
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,560
If you don't teach me today,

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,959
I'm not leaving.

119
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,000
My dad died because of gambling.

120
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
Wait for me.

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,759
You're not him.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
You won't end up like him.

123
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,639
So I don't want you to be like that either.

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,120
Come with me.

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,439
Eight years ago, my dad lost everything to gambling.

126
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,439
He jumped into the sea and killed himself.

127
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,920
My mom brought us back to Beimen Alley.

128
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,120
We only settled down thanks to the neighbors' help.

129
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,800
She raised me and my sister all by herself.

130
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,600
Three years ago, my mom got sick.

131
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,680
I joined the tournament just to pay for her treatment.

132
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,639
But—

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
Brother—

134
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,920
Qiao'er, before Mom passed away,

135
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,720
did she say anything?

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,439
Mom said

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,160
to always remember everyone's kindness.

138
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,160
And also,

139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,639
she told you never to gamble.

140
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,399
I promised my mom

141
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,639
I would never gamble.

142
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,439
The tournament prize paid for Qiao'er to study abroad.

143
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,000
The rest was used to open a small teahouse here at our family home.

144
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,160
So the neighbors have a place to gather and chat.

145
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,919
Miss Bai,

146
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,879
I really can't help you.

147
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,799
Chen Gongxi, come out here!

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,000
Chen Gongxi!

149
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
Zisheng, what's going on?

150
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,080
What do you mean, what's going on?

151
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,440
Ask Chen Gongxi what he did to my sister!

152
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:47,240
Did something happen to Ziwei?

153
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,039
I...

154
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,720
Ziwei...

155
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,480
What did I do?

156
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,159
Chen Gongxi!

157
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,799
You did it but won't admit it, huh?

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,639
Ziwei...

159
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,399
I want to hear it from you.

160
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,279
Brother Gongxi...

161
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,120
I...

162
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,519
I can't say it.

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,000
Look, everyone!

164
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,039
Chen Gongxi!

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,080
He kept claiming he'd repay everyone.

166
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,840
Now he's just a jerk.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,279
He couldn't win my sister over,

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,879
so he actually drugged her!

169
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm warning you,

170
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,399
you'd better have proof for what you say.

171
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,279
Or I'll sue you for slander.

172
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,559
Don't be fooled by his honest appearance.

173
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,840
He hurt my sister yesterday.

174
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,559
You'll be his next victim.

175
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,039
You'd better stay away from him.

176
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,919
Why isn't Gongxi saying anything? Was it really him?

177
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
Chen Gongxi isn't that kind of person.

178
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,039
I trust him.

179
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,320
If your sister was really drugged, get her checked.

180
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,480
Don't just stand here talking nonsense.

181
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,519
What did you say?

182
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,480
It means you're spewing garbage.

183
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,159
You...

184
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
What about you? Aren't you leaving?

185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,240
I can't leave.

186
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,279
Who is this?

187
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,639
Wow, she's beautiful.

188
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,440
She has such great presence.

189
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,960
And who do you think you are?

190
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,320
Xu Zisheng, right?

191
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,519
How do you know my name?

192
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,759
Of course I know.

193
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Your family owes Yaode Group a lot of money.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,240
Yao...

195
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,840
Yaode Group.

196
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
My name is Qin Zhaozhao.

197
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,519
Heard of me?

198
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,200
Sis...

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,000
She has the same surname as Qin.

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,519
Big Boss Qin.

201
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,320
Sorry.

202
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,639
We didn't recognize someone so important.

203
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,639
Please be generous and forgive us.

204
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,480
Xu Zisheng, apologize to Mr. Qin now!

205
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,519
Mr. Qin, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

206
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,240
Sorry.

207
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,399
I, Qin Zhaozhao,

208
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,360
have always had one principle.

209
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,840
If others don't offend me,

210
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
I don't offend them.

211
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,279
If others offend me,

212
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,639
I repay them double.

213
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,519
Zisheng didn't mean to offend you.

214
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Please, let my brother go, okay?

215
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,000
Then tell me,

216
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,639
what exactly happened?

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,679
It was Qin Wuyao.

218
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,559
He forced me to frame Brother Gongxi.

219
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,279
So that Miss Bai would misunderstand him and refuse to work with him.

220
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,759
I was going to let you go yesterday.

221
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,200
But you showed no remorse.

222
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
You only got worse.

223
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,240
Brother Gongxi, I know I was wrong.

224
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,919
Really.

225
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,919
Could you please ask Mr. Qin to forgive me?

226
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,159
Miss Qin.

227
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,240
Forget it.

228
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,120
No way.

229
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,679
We can let the slander go.

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,879
But you drugged someone.

231
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,039
Now you have a chance to turn yourself in.

232
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,120
I never thought Ziwei would do something like this.

233
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
Yeah, she was such a good girl when she was little.

234
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,080
How did she end up like this?

235
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,000
She did it to pay off her gambling addict father’s debts.

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,039
Mr. Qin did the right thing.

237
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,600
Only after punishment will she learn to change.

238
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
Ziwei, go and make a fresh start.

239
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,559
Yeah, go on.

240
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,960
Chen Gongxi.

241
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,360
Can I have a word with you?

242
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,480
No.

243
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,679
Miss Qin.

244
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:41,799
This way, please.

245
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,240
Chen Gongxi, you—

246
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,039
Chen Gongxi.
