Only one round left

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,519
If I remember correctly

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,920

Fa Cai (Green Dragon)

11
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
Xiao San Yuan (Little Three Dragons), self-draw with no melds

12
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,560
The winner is decided. Loser steps down.

13
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,759
Congratulations to the new Mahjong God for winning our grand prize!

14
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,520
Congrats on becoming today’s Mahjong God.

15
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,120
Anything you’d like to say to everyone?

16
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,639
Can I collect my prize now?

17
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,039
I’ve got something urgent.

18
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,919
Single wait, Qing Yi Se (all one suit)

19
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,560
That’s a great hand.

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,680
Come on

21
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,000
Listen

22
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,479
Uncle Zhang, you’re so lucky today.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,800
Yeah, your place really brings me luck.

24
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,039
Alright, take your time.

25
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay

26
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,039
Another Qing Yi Se (all one suit)

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,159
How did you win again?

28
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,599
So fast!

29
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,919
Can’t stop winning when luck’s on your side!

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,000
Came to this little teahouse

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,719
Just wanted to ask about the Mahjong God

32
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,159
Didn’t expect to get paid too

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,800
You mean

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,439
The Mahjong God who disappeared three years ago?

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,159
Yeah

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,400
He’s the only one who can help you now

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,000
But your rival is looking for him too

38
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,719
Alright, I get it

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,039
Hey bro, heard you’re looking for the Mahjong God

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,439
Let’s talk over there

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,680
Xiao Xue

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,800
They only know he’s somewhere on North Gate Street

43
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,680
But I just got word

44
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,960
He opened a teahouse called Gong Xi there

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,639
If you move fast

46
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,840
You should find him before they do

47
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,879
Why break down now?

48
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,919
Hey, you know the Mahjong God?

49
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,719
Hey

50
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,080
Where are you going?

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,879
Where is he?

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,800
Who?

53
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,719
You’re messing with me, aren’t you?

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,560
No, I’m not

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,759
Then you…

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Bro, I run an honest business here

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,879
Cheating at mahjong is not allowed

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,199
Here, keep this safe

59
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,000
Hey, you looking for trouble?

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:17,600
Bro

61
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,240
Harmony brings wealth

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,040
Harmony brings wealth

63
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,439
Still thinking about making money?

64
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,439
Calm down

65
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,920
Screw you

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,399
Cheating at mahjong in my teahouse

67
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,240
And you want to start a fight?

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,959
I won’t dare, bro

69
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,480
Boss Qin

70
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,399
How’s it going?

71
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,519
I’m fine

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,920
Who asked you?

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
I asked if you found the Mahjong God

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Not yet

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,519
Useless

76
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Forget it, I didn’t expect much from you anyway

77
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,040
Hey, Ziwei

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
It’s fine, no trouble

79
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,199
I’ll be right there

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,160
Uncle Zhang, Aunt Liu

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,399
Watch the shop for me

82
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,560
Got it

83
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,040
Hey, where’s the tow truck I called?

84
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,319
Wish you could give me a ride.

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,680
Miss.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,279
Do you need a lift?

87
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,600
Thank you.

88
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:26,680
No problem.

89
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,720
Miss Bai.

90
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,439
Are you here at North Gate Alley to meet a friend?

91
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,680
Are you familiar with this area?

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,839
I grew up here.

93
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,240
Then do you know

94
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,959
there’s a teahouse owner who’s the Mahjong God?

95
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,480
I’m not sure about that.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,519
Miss Bai.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,399
We’re here.

98
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,839
This is North Gate Alley.

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,439
South Gate Alley.

100
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,519
Wait—

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,680
Where’s the person?

102
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,600
Who are you looking for?

103
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,040
Thanks for your help.

104
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,959
Brother Gongxi.

105
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,800
It’s fine.

106
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,120
All done.

107
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,240
Have some water.

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,879
Thanks.

109
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,959
Chen Gongxi.

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,120
My computer’s broken.

111
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,199
Can you fix it?

112
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,680
Hey, watch how you talk to Brother Gongxi.

113
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,560
Show some respect. It’s fine.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,160
I’ll go take a look.

115
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,519
Xu Zisheng, what are you doing?

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,639
Sis.

117
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,240
What are you up to?

118
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
That guy’s just a broke nobody.

119
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,680
You treat him like he’s something special.

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,360
Did you forget

121
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,399
Dad’s debt won’t last much longer.

122
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,040
They want me to find the Mahjong God.

123
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,560
Then the debt will be cleared.

124
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,839
Sis.

125
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,000
Why do they want him? The computer’s fixed.

126
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,839
That was fast.

127
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,560
You didn’t plug it in.

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,319
By the way, Ziwei—

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,839
I heard there’s trouble with your dad.

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,639
I brought you fifty thousand yuan.

131
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,560
It’s just a little help from me.

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
No, Brother Gongxi, you don’t have to do this.

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,279
Don’t be polite with me.

134
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:31,720
No need.

135
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Take it, don’t be polite.

136
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,480
Take it.

137
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,639
At least you’ve got some conscience.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,480
My parents didn’t feed you for nothing back then.

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,759
But is this little bit enough to repay them?

140
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,319
It’s not enough.

141
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,720
I’ll definitely repay the kindness of your parents.

142
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,160
But what’s it got to do with you?

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,879
What’s it got to do with me?

144
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,959
You and your sister ate and used everything at my house.

145
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,279
If my family hadn’t helped,

146
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,639
your mom wouldn’t even have had a place to be buried.

147
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,519
You should pay up, got it?

148
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,439
Xu Zisheng, shut up!

149
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,120
Looks like

150
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,120
your parents really didn’t teach you well.

151
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,879
What did you say?

152
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,480
I think you need to be taught a lesson.

153
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,519
Xu Zisheng.

154
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,839
Brother Gongxi.

155
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
Sorry, I apologize for my brother.

156
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,160
Let go.

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,199
Don’t bother with him, he’s just a kid.

158
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,399
Brother Gongxi.

159
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,160
Ziwei.

160
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,040
I’ve got something to do.

161
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,720
I’ll head back to the teahouse first.

162
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,399
Brother Gongxi.

163
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,720
Don’t forget about tonight’s gathering.

164
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,040
I’ll come find you later.

165
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,399
How is it? Does it hurt?

166
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
It hurts, sis.

167
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
That Chen Gongxi—

168
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,399
Don’t worry.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
The way you’ve been treated—

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
I’ll make sure you get justice.

171
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,759
Finally here.

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,919
If I catch you—

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
You’ll be sorry.

174
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,960
Hey, Dad.

175
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,200
My dear.

176
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,360
About the mahjong tournament,

177
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
Just let me handle it.

178
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,679
Why do you have to go so far?

179
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,799
I just want to help you.

180
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,399
Wait till I find the Mahjong God.

181
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
It's him.

182
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,720
At Gongxi Teahouse, could it be...

183
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
Gotta go, Dad. Love you!

184
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,639
Sweetie.

185
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,240
Follow that car up ahead.

186
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,120
What?

187
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,879
Got it.

188
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,120
Ziwei.

189
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,399
Didn't you say you were going to a class reunion?

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,159
I don't even know why I'm here.

191
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,799
Didn't you say you'd come with me?

192
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,360
Well...

193
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,080
We won't stay long, right?

194
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,879
It won't take long. Let's go.

195
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,399
Come on, get up!

196
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,320
Yeah, have another drink!

197
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,240
Just one, okay?

198
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,639
Alright, just one. Just one.

199
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,360
Cheers!

200
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,039
Qin Shao.

201
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
What are you doing?

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,639
Why aren't you finishing your drink?

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,519
Qin Shao.

204
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,559
You didn't finish it.

205
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,039
Qin Shao, little sister Ziwei.

206
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
Come sit with me.

207
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,600
You finally made it.

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,399
Let go of me.

209
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,879
You...

210
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,360
Where did this punk come from?

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,159
You dare boss around in my place?

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,399
I'm gonna teach you a lesson today.

213
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,639
Qin Shao, Qin Shao!

214
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,240
Didn't you ask me to find a mahjong master?

215
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,159
I've brought him.

216
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,559
He won the Mahjong God Championship three years ago.

217
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,200
Him?

218
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,559
Yeah, that's him.

219
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,080
Mahjong God Chen Gongxi.

220
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,039
Where is he?

221
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,639
Is he a mole or something?

222
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,360
You're Chen Gongxi?

223
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Sorry.

224
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
I really didn't expect it to be you.

225
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,919
Guess we only met because we clashed.

226
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,720
Uh...

227
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,440
Is he your guy?

228
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,360
He caused trouble at my teahouse.

229
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,480
What do you say about him?

230
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:11,960
Come here.

231
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,879
Stand straight.

232
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
Hurry up and apologize to Mahjong God Chen.

233
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,039
What are you doing?

234
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,480
I told you to find someone, not make a scene.

235
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,440
Forget it, Chen.

236
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,000
Stay away from my teahouse from now on.

237
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,120
Yes.

238
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,919
Ziwei, let's go.

239
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,279
Okay.

240
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Mahjong God Chen.

241
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
I've heard a lot about you.

242
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,879
It took me a lot of effort to find you.

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,519
Why don't we...

244
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,480
Play a round?

245
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
I'm done playing, Qin Shao.

246
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
If you want to play,

247
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,840
find someone else.

248
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:47,559
Ziwei.

249
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,759
Let's go.

250
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,840
Brother Gongxi.

251
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Qin Shao.

252
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,759
He's the one we owe money to.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,720
Your family's debt—

254
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,759
I'll figure something out for you.

255
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,600
Come here.

256
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
Not even giving me a round of mahjong?

257
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,600
What if I do this?

258
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,120
Are you in or not?

259
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:11,639
You...
