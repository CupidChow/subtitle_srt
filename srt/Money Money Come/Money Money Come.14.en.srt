1
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,959
Miss, your drink is ready.

2
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,519
Why are you drinking alone?

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,200
Where's Chen Gongxi?

4
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,319
Waiter.

5
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,280
Drinking alone

6
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,719
is better than being bothered.

7
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,239
Xiaoxue.

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,239
Do I really annoy you that much?

9
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,519
I don't get it.

10
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,239
How am I worse than Chen Gongxi?

11
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,480
He's not like you.

12
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,959
So fake.

13
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,400
He's the fake one, isn't he?

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,599
I know you're upset because of him.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,599
I'm not like him.

16
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,920
He's still with Qin Zhao.

17
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,680
Xiaoxue, wait for me.

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,959
How does he know who Gongxi is with?

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Tell me.

20
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,919
How could he learn that?

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,479
He picked it up in just one day.

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,520
I get it now.

23
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,199
Excuse me, bill please.

24
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,280
Go for it.

25
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,960
Chen Gongxi, you made me do this.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,759
Xiaoxue, you startled me.

27
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,000
What's going on?

28
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,199
It's just

29
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,360
something urgent at work.

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,599
I really can't stay with you today.

31
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,000
Order whatever you want.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,639
Put it on my tab.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Wait.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
Why the rush?

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,080
It's not something shady, is it?

36
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,439
Of course not, Xiaoxue.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,199
Then take me with you.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,120
So much for liking someone.

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Xiaoxue, I'm just worried you'll be bored.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,639
How could I be?

41
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,759
With you, I'd never be bored.

42
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,560
Alright.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,520
Let's go.

44
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,719
Who is this?

45
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,960
Messaging so late at night.

46
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,479
How's your practice going?

47
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
Is it going well?

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
Of course.

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,039
Definitely.

50
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,400
Thank you, Sister Zhaozhao.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,280
I couldn't have done it without you.

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,840
Aren't you afraid I'll trick you?

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,639
You wouldn't.

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,719
You're so naive, you never know.

55
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,120
Gongxi.

56
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,680
Let me ask you something.

57
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,960
Do you think I've changed?

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Or am I still the Sister Huacai you remember?

59
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,360
Let me ask another question.

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,639
What do you think of Bai Ruoxue?

61
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,040
You like her.

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,639
Gongxi.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,399
From now on,

64
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,040
don't become

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,319
a two-faced bad guy.

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
Xiaoxue, have a seat.

67
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:51,920
I have something to do.

68
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,399
Go ahead.

69
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,199
What are you doing?

70
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
So you really are watching him.

71
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,839
Not just that.

72
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,199
Qin Wuyao.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,519
I can't believe you'd do this.

74
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,920
Xiaoxue.

75
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
I did all this for you.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,759
For me?

77
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,240
Save your explanation for someone else.

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,759
Xiaoxue.

79
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,120
What's so great about him?

80
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,120
He's not like you.

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,639
Always using underhanded tactics.

82
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,519
Then come with me.

83
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't you want to play tricks too?

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,079
It's better to be safe than sorry.

85
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,680
Especially since you're his opponent.

86
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,000
But in the end,

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,839
you're just not as good as him.

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,720
Say it again.

89
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,240
I'll say it a million times.

90
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,199
You, Qin Wuyao, aren't as good as him.

91
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,600
Not even as good as one of Chen Gongxi's fingers.

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,000
You and my dad

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
are exactly the same.

94
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
You both think I'm not as good as him, right?

95
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,000
Fine.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,759
He can't even show up at the competition now.

97
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,680
He doesn't even qualify anymore.

98
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,040
I’ll show you all

99
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,879
that I’m the real winner.

100
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Chen Gongxi won’t show up.

101
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,800
As long as time’s up,

102
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,360
I win.

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,680
Sorry, Young Master Qin.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

105
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:05,720
Gongxi.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,600
What are you doing?

107
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,040
Don’t move.

108
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,720
Gongxi.

109
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,000
Your hand.

110
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,639
As agreed,

111
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,160
I brought the money for the house.

112
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,440
Where’s the deed?

113
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,559
All three deeds are here.

114
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
That’s settled.

115
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
Don’t forget about Xiaoxue.

116
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,080
Let’s begin.

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
The rule is to compare points.

118
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
The smaller one wins.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,120
Only the surface points of the dice count.

120
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,679
Best of three rounds.

121
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,759
Are you both ready?

122
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
Didn’t expect he’d only hurt his hand.

123
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,039
That’s fine.

124
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,399
It hit a vital spot.

125
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,960
He’s only learned for a few days.

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,200
How could he beat me?

127
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,600
The winner

128
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,639
will definitely be me.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,639
Go ahead.

130
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,759
Or is it

131
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,960
your hand isn’t up to it?
