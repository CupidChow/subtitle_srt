1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,760
You guys go ahead and play.

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Go ahead, it's fine.

3
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,159
Then I'll take this seat.

4
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,439
You're here.

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,799
I came to see you.

6
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
My dad

7
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,799
is already being questioned.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,719
The police have been watching him for a while.

9
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:56,920
I know.

10
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,280
You know.

11
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,079
Do you know why I chose you in the end?

12
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,159
Well...

13
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,280
I've always wanted to ask you.

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,639
When you helped the people of Beimen Street

15
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,919
get their deeds back that day,

16
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,280
I saw you and Xiao Xue caring for each other.

17
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,240
Honestly, I felt a bit down.

18
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,039
My dad showed me photos of my mom and Uncle Chen

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
and made up stories about their past.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,280
I mistakenly thought you and your father

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,719
owed something to my mom and me emotionally.

22
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,319
Later,

23
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,879
I watched my dad

24
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,360
use underhanded tricks

25
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,879
to take the shares and assets Uncle Dong left you.

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,960
He even tried to steal the evidence to hide the truth.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,919
He was willing to put your life at risk.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,199
When you were in danger,

29
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
I wanted to see who would dare hurt you.

30
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,919
I didn't hesitate.

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,159
I just wanted to protect you.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,639
That's when I knew

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
my feelings for you

34
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,680
wouldn't let me

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,400
stand against you anymore.

36
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,159
And Beimen Street is my mom's last hope.

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,039
Only you truly care to protect it.

38
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,719
That's

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,639
why I chose you without hesitation.

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,639
Thank you.

41
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,439
Gongxi Teahouse is always open to you.

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,719
But for now,

43
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,039
I won't be coming back soon.

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,319
Where are you going?

45
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,120
I'm going abroad.

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Taking my mom for treatment.

47
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,360
Once we leave,

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know when

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,719
we'll be back.

50
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,039
That's good.

51
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,840
Spend more time with your mom.

52
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,520
See you again someday.

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,560
Gong Xi,

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,280
see you again.

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,639
Alright.

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm leaving now.

57
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,279
I'm off.

58
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,079
Gong Xi,

59
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,319
it's all up to you now.

60
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,399
Everything

61
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,879
seems to be over.

62
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,160
But between me and Xiao Xue,

63
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,240
there's still one last step.

64
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,839
Auntie,

65
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,240
that's enough.

66
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,600
It's almost time.

67
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Gong Xi,

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
what's your zodiac sign?

69
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,079
Year of the Horse.

70
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,639
Horse is a good sign.

71
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,639
Our Xiao Xue is Year of the Goat.

72
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,879
I think...

73
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,399
Let the master calculate.

74
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,360
What's there to calculate?

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,720
The master might not be accurate.

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,959
Mom,

77
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,399
let Dad finish talking.

78
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,959
What I mean is,

79
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,480
our Xiao Xue is Year of the Goat.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Horse and Goat together...

81
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,439
Eat more vegetables.

82
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,399
Eat more vegetables.

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,879
Thank you, Auntie.

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,680
Mom,

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,680
I didn't stop him from talking.

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,199
Go ahead.

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,439
Gong Xi,

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,879
in our family,

89
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,480
men don't have much status.

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,959
I can see that.

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,720
See whatever you want to see.

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,079
Everyone is equal in our family.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,639
That's right.

94
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,560
In our family,

95
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,439
Auntie,

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,839
I understand what you mean.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,240
You don't want Xiao Xue to suffer.

98
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,720
No one wants their daughter

99
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,800
to have a hard life.

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,920
I...

101
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,800
I like Xiao Xue.

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,639
It's true.

103
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,920
I have nothing right now.

104
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,480
But I'll work hard.

105
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,120
Even though

106
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,959
it might be tough at first,

107
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,360
I promise

108
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,319
I won't let her suffer.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
How will you work hard?

110
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,959
Just running that teahouse?

111
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,639
Turning it into a senior activity center?

112
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,399
Can you make money with that?

113
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,199
A senior center alone isn't enough.

114
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,560
Young people nearby need fun too.

115
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
You can't just do charity.

116
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,879
You need to be strong yourself

117
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,240
to take care of others.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,240
Uncle Bai has business experience.

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Ask him for advice.

120
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:14,839
Mom,

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,000
So you mean

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,360
to give you a good life,

123
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,319
I need to learn more from your dad.

124
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,879
So you mean

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
you agree?

126
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,879
The food's getting cold.

127
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,639
Hurry and eat.

128
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Thank you, Mom.

129
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,600
Gong Xi,

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,199
eat up, eat up.

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,879
Auntie, your cooking is delicious.

132
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, stop it.

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
You haven't even tried it yet.

134
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,839
Eat more.

135
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,680
Mom, your cooking is the best.

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
I love my mom's food the most.

137
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,839
Uncle,

138
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,279
Here.

139
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,480
I can serve myself.

140
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
I'll get some for your mom.

141
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,399
Dad, you should eat more too.

142
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,480
Dad

143
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,639
Mom

144
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,399
This is Xiao Xue

145
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,800
I brought her to meet you

146
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,720
Uncle, Auntie

147
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,120
Don't worry

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
Leave Gong Xi to me

149
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
From now on

150
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll take good care of him

151
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
He won't be alone anymore

152
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,160
Gong Xi

153
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,079
Gong Xi

154
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Time for the ribbon-cutting

155
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,680
Gong Xi

156
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,200
Three

157
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,720
Two

158
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,240
One

159
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:52,759
Alright

160
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,440
Okay

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Okay

162
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,639
Thank you all for coming today

163
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,480
I announce

164
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,919
Gongxi Teahouse

165
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,519
is officially renamed today

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,039
Okay

167
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Inside are new activities by Cangwu Group

168
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,039
and fitness facilities

169
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,039
Enjoy yourselves, everyone

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay

171
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,799
Beat him in a few rounds

172
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,399
Healthy fun, no gambling allowed

173
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,480
Sister Xiaoyun

174
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,000
Gong Xi

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,159
Wishing you happiness and prosperity

176
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,879
Wishing you happiness and prosperity

177
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,320
Wishing you happiness and prosperity

178
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,960
Wishing you happiness and prosperity
