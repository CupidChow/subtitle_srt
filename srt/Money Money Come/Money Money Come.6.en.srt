1
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,680
If I promise you something, I’ll make sure to do it.

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,439
Uncle Dong, this...

3
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,239
Your mom has worked hard all these years.

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,439
The extra is just a little something from me.

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,719
Mom ended up like this

6
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,000
He’s the reason it happened.

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
No matter what,

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,879
I’ll protect my memories with Mom.

9
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,280
Including

10
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,319
Beimen Street.

11
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,079
I hope you, Gongxi, can understand this too.

12
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,079
And come to terms with it.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,040
Uncle Dong, what do you mean by that?

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
If someone has the urge to gamble,

15
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,199
even rock-paper-scissors can be gambling.

16
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,759
If you don’t have that urge,

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280
then mahjong

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,439
is no different from rock-paper-scissors.

19
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,520
Your mom told you not to gamble,

20
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,680
but she didn’t mean you can’t play mahjong.

21
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,199
Gongxi,

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,000
don’t get involved with anyone from Yaode Group.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,719
Do you understand?

24
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,039
Your dad got to know those people back then,

25
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,400
and gambled with them.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He lost everything and ended up taking his own life.

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,919
Gongxi,

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,360
do you remember when you were little

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,520
and I told you the story of mahjong?

30
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,719
They say Zheng He invented mahjong during his voyages.

31
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,560
Back then, a voyage could last for years.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,919
Life at sea was boring.

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,759
When people got bored,

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,719
they missed home, thought about dying,

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
wanted to run away or rebel.

36
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,439
Zheng He wondered what to do.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,919
So he used mahjong

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,280
with Bamboo tiles representing fish,

39
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,280
Circle tiles for flatbread, meaning food,

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,159
and Character tiles for a venture of great profit.

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Mahjong can be gambling,

42
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,599
it can be entertainment,

43
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,879
it can be hope,

44
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,520
or a way to settle disputes.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,159
It’s a tradition in the business association.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,039
A match helps avoid everyone fighting and losing in business.

47
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,919
Since we’re here, why not play a round?

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,159
Are you just going to watch everyone leave Beimen Street?

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,680
I don’t want to fight.

50
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,599
I don’t want anything to do with Yaode Group.

51
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
But the more I avoid it,

52
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,680
the more trouble keeps coming.

53
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,879
Gongxi, we’ll help you.

54
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,000
I just want to protect everyone and put an end to this.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,479
Ten years ago, your father protected Beimen Street.

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Now,

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,199
it’s my turn.

58
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,360
I’m really staying at your place?

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,560
About the match,

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,360
I’ve thought it over.

61
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,599
I’ll look for someone else.

62
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,480
I thought it was just a game.

63
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,720
I didn’t expect it to cause you so much trouble.

64
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,160
We still don’t know

65
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
what Qin Wuyao will do next.

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,399
So,

67
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,519
I have to take part.

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,279
You just...

69
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,439
My parents aren’t home anyway.

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,399
Isn’t that a bit inappropriate?

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,759
What are you thinking?

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,319
We’re partners now.

73
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,879
You’re here to focus on teaching me mahjong.

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,839
Since

75
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,800
you agreed,

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
there’s a rule about the match

77
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
that I need to explain to you.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,639
Sichuan Mahjong 2v2.

79
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,279
Both Qin Wuyao and I will compete.

80
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,079
We each need to find a teammate.

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,879
There’s only half a month left until the match.

82
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,120
Don’t tell me

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,680
you want me to train in your tiny rundown place?

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,639
No.

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,639
That would be too much for you.

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,680
Let’s go.

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,839
Wait here for a bit.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,959
I’ll go tidy up your room.

89
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,439
Okay.

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,959
Xiaoxue.

91
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,519
Is that you?

92
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,120
Xiaoxue.

93
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,959
Um, her.

94
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,079
I remember now.

95
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,279
Change your clothes in a bit.

96
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,079
Throw these clothes away.

97
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,000
The kitchen is over there.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,879
Italian or French is fine.

99
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,920
Xiaoxue prefers lighter flavors.

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,759
Manager Li told you, right? Payment is weekly.

101
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,199
Actually,

102
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,720
Please don’t interrupt me.

103
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,839
Bai Yuhang.

104
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,240
My princess.

105
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,360
What are you having for dinner?

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,279
Don’t say anything.

107
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,360
I’m actually a bit hungry.

108
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,600
What do you want to eat?

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,759
If you ask me,

110
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,160
I wasn’t asking you.

111
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,519
What are you eating?

112
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,160
Anything’s fine for me.

113
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,560
He’s...

114
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
This is my friend, Chen Gongxi.

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,399
Uh...

116
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,160
My cousin.

117
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:56,879
Bai Yuhang.

118
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,439
Hi, cousin.

119
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:58,759
Stop.

120
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,639
Zhaozhao.

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,279
Where did you go today?

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,639
The company doesn’t need me right now anyway.

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,839
Where I go is my own business, isn’t it?

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
So you went to see Uncle Dong.

125
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,879
Zhaozhao,

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,839
I’ve said before,

127
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,879
Yaode Group must get back

128
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,480
the land in Beimen Street.

129
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,079
That stall.

130
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,800
Wuyao is more suitable than you.

131
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,279
So,

132
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,399
You even want to tear down my mom’s last hope?

133
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:33,720
I...

134
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,639
I’m doing this for your own good.

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,199
For our good?

136
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,519
This kind of “good”?

137
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,879
Save your breath.

138
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:41,560
You...

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,000
Dad.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,560
Look.

141
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,800
Has Uncle Bo arrived?

142
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:52,920
He’ll be here tomorrow.

143
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,040
Okay.

144
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,879
I’ll leave it to you.

145
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,319
Don’t let me down again.

146
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:08,959
Xiaoxue.

147
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
I brought you some books.

148
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,439
This one’s good.

149
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
You read first, I’ll head out.

150
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Since you’re here,

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,680
Why not explain it to me?

152
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
I have some questions for you.

153
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,319
After a whole night of lessons, I only learned the basics.

154
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,519
There’s so little time left before the competition.

155
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,360
Gongxi.

156
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,920
Why don’t you just teach me your skills?

157
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,639
My skills won’t work for you.

158
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,199
Why?

159
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
I’ve been sensitive to mahjong tiles since I was a kid.

160
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,079
Any tile I’ve seen that’s been revealed,

161
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,759
I can remember the position of every single one.

162
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,839
What the opponent wants,

163
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
What I draw,

164
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,560
I can tell all of it.

165
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,079
So it’s a talent—you can’t learn it.

166
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,879
Miss, someone’s here for you.

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,639
Coming!

168
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,839
Mr. Qin, Uncle Bo has arrived.

169
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,920
I’ll take him to the villa to meet you now.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,199
Are you...

171
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,799
Gongxi isn’t here.

172
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,279
Alright then.

173
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,960
I was going to share something just for him.

174
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,879
Some news about the tournament.

175
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,399
I’ll look for him somewhere else.

176
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,039
What’s wrong?

177
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,600
He’s back again.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,799
What news?

179
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,159
I’ll only tell Gongxi.

180
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,360
Uncle Bo.

181
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,120
Three-time consecutive champion of the Mahjong God Championship.

182
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,799
You went to Lavis three years ago.

183
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,080
You didn’t attend the Mahjong God Championship.

184
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,279
While you were away,

185
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,080
Chen Gongxi won the championship.

186
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,879
I have videos of all Uncle Bo’s matches from the past three years.

187
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
You can use them for reference.

188
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
The videos you gave me—

189
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,480
I watched them several times before coming here.

190
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,240
His playing style is calculated with extreme precision.

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,759
Rather than just counting tiles,

192
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,200
it’s like he’s memorized every tile.

193
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,720
I didn’t expect

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
anyone besides me

195
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,960
could do that.

196
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,720
Uncle Bo’s strategy is a lot like yours.

197
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,399
Beating him won’t be easy.

198
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
Thank you, Miss Qin.

199
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,879
This information really helps me a lot.

200
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,240
We’re family.

201
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,919
No need to be so formal.

202
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,759
Thank you, Miss Qin.

203
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Gongxi and I will study it carefully.

204
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,039
Miss Qin, you probably have other things to do.

205
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,840
Well then—

206
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,440
I’m not busy.

207
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,279
I can join you for some practice.

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,600
But—

209
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,039
How do we play when we’re one player short?

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,519
I’m not going.

211
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,279
Bai Yuhang.

212
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,840
I’ll give you one last chance.

213
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,919
Xiaoxue—

214
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Even ten chances wouldn’t help.

215
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
I have class.

216
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,399
I need to cook.

217
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,360
I have to play with him too.

218
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,679
It’s impossible.

219
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,919
Miss Bai.
