1
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,040
Bai Xiaojie

2
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,400
If it doesn't work out, that's fine.

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,280
I'll find someone else.

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,319
No need to waste time.

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,560
Wait a moment.

6
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,519
I think I can step in.

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,439
It's an honor to help a beautiful lady.

8
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,360
I won't refuse.

9
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
May I know your name, miss?

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,520
Five Wan

11
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,199
Kong

12
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,000
Three Bamboos

13
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:25,719
Pong

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,680
One Bamboo

15
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,199
Hu

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,000
Hu

17
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:31,599
Hu

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Hu

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
Xiaoxue

20
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,599
Aren't you pretty familiar with Mahjong?

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,919
I've only watched.

22
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,560
I don't have much real experience.

23
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,080
What should we do?

24
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,960
Sorry.

25
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm holding everyone back.

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
It's okay.

27
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,599
We'll find a way.

28
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,599
It's getting late.

29
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,599
You all should get some rest.

30
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:55,800
What about you?

31
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,960
I'll review the materials.

32
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,840
They know us well.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,759
We can't fall behind.

34
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,520
But...

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,960
That's enough.

36
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,759
Let Chen Gongxi have some time alone.

37
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,520
Call us if you need anything.

38
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,960
We're all here.

39
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,560
Zhaozhao, Zhaozhao.

40
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,560
Zhaozhao.

41
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,000
Xiaoxue.

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,280
Don't worry.

43
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,080
Uncle Bo

44
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,120
You called me?

45
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,120
I heard your sister went to see Chen Gongxi.

46
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,159
Yes.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,039
What's wrong?

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,479
Looks like

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,879
He knows I can memorize tiles.

50
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,319
He knows too.

51
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,759
So how do we deal with it?

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,759
Go talk to the Chamber people.

53
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,520
Tell him

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,560
I want to add a rule.

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,319
As long as we can win,

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
we'll do whatever Uncle Bo says.

57
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,680
If I can't use my tile memory,

58
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,720
When it comes to experience,

59
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,319
you're no match for me.

60
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,160
The player before is playing aggressively.

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,519
Now Uncle Bo is playing conservatively.

62
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,720
Avoiding direct confrontation.

63
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
Unexpectedly, Uncle Bo drew the Golden Tile Two Wan.

64
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,800
He still needs One Wan and Four Wan.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,959
To get a ready hand.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,759
He actually waited for

67
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,040
Last Draw Win.

68
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,600
I said

69
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,879
Yaode Group must take back

70
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,480
that land on Beimen Street.

71
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,319
Zhaozhao.

72
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,720
We will definitely come back.

73
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,800
Are you hungry?

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,759
Gongxi hasn't had dinner.

75
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,079
I'll cook, you rest.

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,279
Bai Xiaojie can cook too.

77
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,279
Who are you looking down on?

78
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,319
You didn't invite me for the good food.

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,839
Perfect, come and try it.

80
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,040
Which one did Miss Zhaozhao make?

81
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,639
I want this one.

82
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,399
No.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,800
Try them all.

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,680
And

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,600
this one.

86
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Xiaoxue,

87
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,560
If I've sinned,

88
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,399
let the law punish me.

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,120
Don't torture me.

90
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,240
Eat.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
I’ve got an idea.

92
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,839
He’s got an idea.

93
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:41,800
Five Wan.

94
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,600
Hu!

95
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,519
Nine Dots.

96
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,680
Another win! Hu again!

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,600
Such good luck.

98
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,279
It’s not just luck.

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,319
Chen Gongxi keeps feeding her tiles.

100
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,199
Since Xiaoxue can’t beat Qin Wuyao and the others,

101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,800
I’ll fully support her.

102
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,920
As long as Xiaoxue’s score goes up,

103
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,920
I can focus on dealing with those two.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,360
Didn’t expect Tian Ji’s Horse Racing strategy

105
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,360
to work here.

106
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,439
No,

107
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,639
What horse racing?

108
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,920
It means,

109
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
you’re the weaker player.

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
You’re the weaker one!

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,879
More like a dark horse.

112
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
They’d never expect

113
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,439
Xiaoxue to be our attacker.

114
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,040
Alright.

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,600
You’ve got some skills.

116
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,519
Finally, we can take a break.

117
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,680
Um,

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,399
Let me suggest something.

119
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,639
We happen to have a pool at home.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,959
Why don’t we take a dip?

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,000
Let’s relax.

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,439
Bai Yuhang.

123
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,560
Sounds good.

124
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,120
What about Miss Zhaozhao?

125
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,360
I don’t mind.

126
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,399
Alright then.

127
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,279
Let’s arrange it.

128
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,360
Gongxi.

129
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,560
Gongxi.

130
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:36,840
Zhaozhao

131
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,440
You know,

132
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,519
from the moment I first met you,

133
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,840
I felt you were different from other girls.

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,279
And you know,

135
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,759
I met many girls in France,

136
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,759
but I think you’re better than all of them.

137
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,320
What’s wrong?

138
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,440
I’m still

139
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
afraid I’ll mess up.

140
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
You’ve almost memorized

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,480
all the Sichuan Mahjong techniques these days.

142
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,759
You can do it.

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,519
What if things change during the match

144
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,080
and I can’t handle it?

145
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,879
There’s one situation:

146
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,840
if we clash in suits,

147
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,559
it means I can’t support you anymore.

148
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,600
At that point,

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,120
just go for the highest tile efficiency on your own.

150
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,799
Play fast.

151
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,240
Don’t overthink it.

152
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,080
I’ve got your back, Zhaozhao.

153
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,200
Zhaozhao.

154
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,879
Jiangcheng Chamber Sichuan Mahjong 2v2 Tournament.

155
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,879
Professional competition rules apply.

156
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,039
Cangwu Group contestants:

157
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Chen Gongxi.

158
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,639
Bai Ruoxue.

159
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,600
Alright.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,399
Okay.

161
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,600
Go Xiaoxue! You got this!

162
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,720
Not bad, kid.

163
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,639
Go for it!
