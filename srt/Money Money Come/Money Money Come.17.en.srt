1
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Gongxi

2
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
Why are you here at this hour?

3
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,640
Uncle Dong, it's so late.

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,719
Where are you heading?

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,879
We're missing one for mahjong.

6
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,760
I need to go help out quickly.

7
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
I heard about it.

8
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,439
That was a beautiful win.

9
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,159
It's time for that Qin Wuyao kid

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,799
to get a reality check inside.

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
This time,

12
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,879
we really owe it to Uncle Dong.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Save the thanks for later.

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,760
I'm in a hurry.

15
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,719
You planned all of this,

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,319
didn't you?

17
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,879
Long time no see.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,919
Do you still remember me?

19
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,560
Uncle Qin

20
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,879
Gongxi,

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
you won.

22
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,039
Qin Wuyao, he...

23
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,039
No,

24
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,000
it's not your concern.

25
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,000
He made mistakes,

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,919
so he must face the consequences.

27
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,439
Uncle Qin,

28
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,080
you're not here to talk about this, right?

29
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,800
I know what you're thinking—

30
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,560
to protect Beimen Street.

31
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,360
But is your life now

32
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,039
really what you want?

33
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319
You think you're sacrificing your life

34
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
to protect the community.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,840
But maybe

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,080
someone planted that idea in you.

37
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,840
Gongxi,

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,639
sometimes a piece on the board

39
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,120
doesn't know who it's playing for.

40
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,080
I just want to run a small teahouse
in my family home.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,639
You had Zhao Zhao find me
and persuade me to compete.

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,639
Then you gave up your spot to me.

43
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,240
I always thought it was all by chance,

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,280
but it wasn't.

45
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,360
Yaode Group wants Beimen Street.

46
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,080
Cangwu isn't even a match.

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,199
You couldn't step in yourself,

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
so you wanted me to help you

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
deal with Yaode.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Or do you

51
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,599
want to hand Beimen Street to Qin Wuyao?

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,240
Qin Wuyao never wanted Beimen Street.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
It was Qin Defeng.

54
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,879
Are you scared?

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
He warned me.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,759
Tell me.

57
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,960
You gave me your spot

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,000
just to use me against Qin Defeng.

59
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,840
And I

60
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,639
am just a piece in your game.

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,000
Why are you laughing?

62
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,639
Most of your analysis is correct.

63
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,439
But the part that's wrong—

64
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,520
Xiao Yun

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,159
Uncle Dong

66
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,159
Go wait for me downstairs.

67
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:02,960
Yes.

68
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,479
Back then,

69
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,680
the three of us started a business together.

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,360
Your father led the way.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,079
Qin Defeng was hardworking,

72
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,800
and clever too.

73
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,800
But his ambition

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,439
would never

75
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,279
let him stay beneath anyone.

76
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,800
Why can't we do it?

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
No means no.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Opening a gambling house in Beimen Street—

79
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,240
are you trying to ruin everyone?

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,720
But—

81
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,720
No buts.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,839
As long as I'm here,

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
it's impossible.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,920
Fine.

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
This is as far as you go.

86
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,279
Defeng

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,560
Defeng

88
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,399
But what does this have to do
with Beimen Street?

89
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
Back then,

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,079
he was driven out by the people
of Beimen Street.

91
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,199
They kicked him out.

92
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,800
After all,

93
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,519
who could tolerate someone
who harmed them?

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,040
That's why Qin Defeng hates Beimen Street.

95
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,399
So that's

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,519
the reason he's obsessed with Beimen Street.

97
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,199
You're a smart person.

98
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
You got one thing wrong earlier.

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
I never saw you as just a piece.

100
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,959
I want you to be a player.

101
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm not interested in these grudges.

102
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,920
I just want an ordinary life.

103
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,279
That's enough for me.

104
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,720
I won't interfere with your choices.

105
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,800
But you should know

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
you have choices now

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,399
all because of your father.

108
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,160
It's because of him

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
my sister and I suffered for so many years.

110
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you insist

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,319
your father went out gambling?

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Uncle Dong

113
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,639
What do you mean

114
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,519
by that?

115
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,600
You've grown up.

116
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,399
It's time to think carefully.

117
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,120
Uncle Dong

118
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,079
Where are you really going?

119
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,040
Once I help you figure things out,

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,279
I'll tell you everything.

121
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,000
Who is it?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,560
Xiao Yun

123
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,759
Don't scare her.

124
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,079
Director Dong

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,879
Director Dong

126
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,839
Director Dong

127
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,879
Please let me go.

128
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,040
A Cai,

129
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,120
you're really wasting a good life.

130
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,439
Just tell the truth.

131
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,920
From now on,

132
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,279
you won't have to hide.

133
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,040
Zhao Zhao

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,959
You've finished reading the letter, right?

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,879
All this time, I didn't see your mom

136
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,199
because she had someone else in her heart.

137
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,639
But that's all in the past.

138
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,959
I've reached out to friends in the US.

139
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,079
Afterwards,

140
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,560
we can transfer your mom there.

141
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,879
They're quite authoritative in this field.

142
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,000
You...

143
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,199
Don't feel pressured.

144
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
I hope you can understand me.

145
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,519
I never meant to hurt your mom.

146
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,600
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,319
Dad.

148
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,199
Don't apologize.

149
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,600
From now on, the company...

150
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,959
will depend on you.

151
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,959
But I still...

152
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,360
Wuyao brought this on himself.

153
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,439
You did the right thing.

154
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,079
We're the real family.

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,439
The Chen family drove us out.

156
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,680
Your mom and I were both hurt by Chen Zhengli.

157
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,319
Get out!

158
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,759
If you truly want to do something for her,

159
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
then come with me

160
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,199
to seek justice for your mom.

161
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
I know.

162
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,039
That's all.

163
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,320
It really was him.

164
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,080
You need to testify against Qin Defeng.

165
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,679
I've said everything I should.

166
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,039
Please.

167
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,159
He's capable of anything.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,559
You think if you say nothing,

169
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,679
he'll let you go?

170
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,799
You have no choice.

171
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,080
You must testify in court.

172
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,799
Do you understand?

173
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,320
Xiao Yun,

174
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,840
what exactly happened?
