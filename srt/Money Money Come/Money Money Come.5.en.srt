1
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,079
Miss Qin

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Thank you for your help this time.

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,519
I've helped you twice.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,959
One thank you isn't enough.

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,719
I was the one who stopped them from coming in.

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,239
I remember what you did for me.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
But

8
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,760
if you want me to fight for Yaode,

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,239
I'd rather not.

10
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,519
Chen Gongxi

11
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,359
What I want

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,079
isn't that.

13
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,000
Then what do you want?

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,920
What I want

15
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,879
is you.

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,800
This is...

17
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,840
Chen Gongxi

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
horse stance

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,639
root your stance and focus your energy

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
palms together

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,759
strike

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,080
Just like that.

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,919
Not bad, your skills have improved.

24
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,599
How do you know Chen-style Taiji?

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,719
If you lose,

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
no crying, okay?

27
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,039
Come on.

28
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,960
No crying if you lose.

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,680
Huacai

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,599
Do you still remember me?

31
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,319
Chen Gongxi, are you okay?

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,520
What are you guys doing?

33
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,280
Xiaoxue

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,919
It's not what you think.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
It's pretty close though.

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,159
After all, the two of us

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,759
were even childhood betrothed.

38
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,159
Chen Gongxi is mine.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,840
I've known him

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,560
way longer than you have.

41
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:24,800
Mine.

42
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,159
Come here, Gongxi.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,879
Wait, when did I become yours?

44
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,360
Shut up.

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,280
You...

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,759
What exactly do you want?

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,960
Same as you, I want him to compete.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,639
Even if I go,

49
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,719
it'll be for Cangwu.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,520
What a coincidence.

51
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,439
I'm also asking him to fight for Cangwu.

52
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,120
Gongxi, I'll be straight with you.

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
Yaode wants Beimen Alley.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
It's my father's idea.

55
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,840
Uncle Qin

56
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,199
According to Yaode's plan,

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,439
this place will be turned into a commercial center.

58
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,759
The old neighbors probably don't want to move out, right?

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,319
Then why are you helping me?

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,719
Because Beimen Alley used to be my home too.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,719
Think about it.

62
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:04,879
I'm leaving now.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,840
Huacai

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,800
I've changed my name.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Call me Zhao Zhao from now on.

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,919
Zhao Zhao

67
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,520
Good girl.

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,800
You...

69
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,800
What's she really up to?

70
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,519
And also,

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,879
What's your relationship?

72
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,480
We're childhood sweethearts, I guess.

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,000
Then...

74
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,560
What's with the childhood betrothal?

75
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,720
That was our parents' arrangement.

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,199
But

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,040
I feel like she's changed.

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,879
I heard someone dared to impersonate Miss Qin here.

79
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,600
Was it you?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,439
If you want trouble, at least come up with a better excuse.

81
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:54,680
Perfect timing.

82
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,879
I've got a lot of anger to let out.

83
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,240
Gongxi, something's wrong!

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,079
That Miss Qin is fighting someone!

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Young Master Qin, should we go now?

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
No rush, wait until they come out.

87
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes.

88
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,199
Qin Wuyao sent you, didn't he?

89
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,040
You even dare call Young Master Qin by name.

90
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,959
Looks like you need to be taught a lesson.

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,720
Zhao Zhao, are you okay?

92
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,199
Where's Qin Wuyao?

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,920
Did you miss me?

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,360
Sis

95
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,959
It really is you.

96
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,040
They just said you were here.

97
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,279
I thought it had to be an imposter.

98
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,279
After all, taking over Beimen Alley

99
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,480
was Dad's idea.

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,839
If it really is you...

101
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,439
How could I possibly help Cangwu?

102
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:09,879
Right?

103
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,160
Beimen Street and Alley

104
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
doesn't belong to your Yaode Group.

105
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,959
Stay away from here.

106
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,399
Chen Gongxi

107
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,399
Let me tell you,

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm determined to get Beimen Street and Alley.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
This kid's kung fu is good, spar with him.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,600
Yes.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Gongxi

112
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,399
We're here to help you.

113
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,800
Don't be afraid, kid.

114
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,920
Come on!

115
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,360
Gongxi

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
Don't be scared, we're here.

117
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,560
Everyone's here.

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Saves me from having to find you one by one.

119
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,879
Why are you looking for them?

120
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,920
There’s more than one way to get Beimen Street and Alley.

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,839
I'm looking for them

122
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,360
Of course, to discuss cooperation.

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,279
I'm buying property.

124
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,160
It's reasonable.

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,399
We signed a contract, it's not like I'm not paying.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,319
Right?

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

128
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:06,759
That's right.

129
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,160
We're not selling.

130
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Exactly.

131
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:07,920
We're not selling.

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,480
Not selling, not selling.

133
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
Refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit.

134
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,680
Who are you?

135
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,120
Uncle Dong.

136
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,120
Uncle Dong.

137
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,560
I've heard a lot about you.

138
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,120
Uncle Dong.

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,040
Qin Wuyao.

140
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,680
Yaoyao.

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,920
Do you remember riding on my shoulders as a kid?

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
You peed all over my neck.

143
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,439
Long time no see.

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,600
You've grown up so much.

145
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,920
Yaoyao.

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,160
Do me a favor.

147
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,959
Let it go for today.

148
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,720
Uncle Dong.

149
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,399
Now you're being unreasonable.

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,879
I'm handling family matters.

151
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,120
He's the one who insisted on getting involved.

152
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,560
Technically,

153
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,439
you're still cousins.

154
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,000
Show some mercy when you can.

155
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,120
Uncle Dong.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,519
What if I don't let it go?

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,799
If you insist on dealing with him today,

158
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,360
then deal with me first.

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,559
Nobody move.

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,879
Alright.

161
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,919
For Uncle Dong's sake,

162
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,919
I can't refuse.

163
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,519
But I advise you,

164
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,120
from now on, matters between the Qin and Bai families

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,720
are best left alone.

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Of course.

167
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,440
Send my regards to your father.

168
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:32,919
Dad.

169
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
Dong Zhongping is here.

170
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,240
Yes.

171
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
No wonder Gongxi likes you.

172
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,720
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
So you like him?

174
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:56,960
I don't.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,600
I don't like him.

176
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
Then I'll make a move.

177
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,120
No way.

178
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,039
By the way, who was that person just now?

179
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,759
That's Dong Zhongping.

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,919
Uncle Dong.

181
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
The boss of Wenhua International Capital.

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,639
How does Gongxi know him?

183
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,679
There's a lot you don't know.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,720
Sister-in-law.

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,279
I'm here to see you.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,679
Uncle Dong.

187
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,039
You asked Zhaozhao to come find me, didn't you?

188
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
You've changed.

189
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,960
You've gotten smarter.

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,120
So,

191
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,879
are you going to join the competition?

192
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,559
Uncle Dong.

193
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,240
You know,

194
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,840
I promised my mom.

195
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,919
I know.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,639
No gambling.

197
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,919
Gongxi.

198
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,480
Since that's the case,

199
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,919
I've only got one way left.

200
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,399
Rock-paper-scissors.

201
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,440
What's this?
