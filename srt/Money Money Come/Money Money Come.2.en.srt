1
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,040
You

2
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,280
Chen Gongxi

3
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Play a round with me today.

4
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,079
No bets.

5
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,079
Let's see if you deserve the title of Mahjong God.

6
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,719
If you win,

7
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,920
you can take her home with you.

8
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,120
If you lose, it's no big deal.

9
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,079
But if you refuse to play,

10
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,159
she has to stay here.

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Guys, what do you think?

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Alright!

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,719
Qin

14
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,840
Young Master Qin

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,959
Well?

16
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,920
Chen Gongxi

17
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll give you five seconds to decide.

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,840
Brother Gongxi

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,959
Five

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,719
Four

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Three

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Two

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,199
One

24
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,960
Alright, I'll play with you.

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,039
So this game was set up for him.

26
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,319
Get the dealer to keep score.

27
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

28
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,360
Is he really the Mahjong God?

29
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,240
Otherwise, why set such tough rules?

30
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,840
Traditional Sichuan Mahjong.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,759
Fight to the End.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,759
You play against three.

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,280
Open hand.

34
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,439
Are you kidding me?

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,599
Open hand and three versus one? That's just bullying.

36
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,719
One round decides the winner.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,879
Standard scoring.

38
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,240
You just need a higher score than me to win.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
Most importantly,

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,599
you have no choice.

41
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,479
No one sits next to each other.

42
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,800
Divorce tiles.

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
So unlucky.

44
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,960
What's the point of choosing with these tiles?

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,599
Doesn't matter which suit is missing now.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,639
Let's begin.

47
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,199
In some situations,

48
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,280
Sichuan Mahjong can be played with open hands.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Because there are no honor tiles in Sichuan Mahjong.

50
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,159
Only three suits: Bamboo, Characters, and Dots.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,439
Players must discard one suit as their missing suit.

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,479
You must play your missing suit tiles.

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,479
If all three opponents have the same missing suit,

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,039
then the winning tiles are just their missing suits.

55
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,800
Playing open hand like this can still work.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,879
Missing Characters.

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,080
Missing Characters.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Missing Dots.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,719
Missing Bamboo.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,520
All three have different missing suits.

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,639
How will you play?

62
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,879
Six Characters.

63
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,199
Four Characters.

64
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,319
Sorry.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,919
Hidden kong, each player pays two points.

66
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,120
There's an eight-point gap right from the start.

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,759
How do you play with a hand full of divorce tiles?

68
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,079
One Dot.

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,120
Two Bamboo.

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,720
This kid's luck is pretty good.

71
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,800
Three rounds and not a single Character tile drawn.

72
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
Raw Nine Characters.

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,319
One Character and Five Characters haven't shown up.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
Plus, two players are missing Characters.

75
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,680
I konged Eight Characters.

76
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,360
If Baldy wants Characters,

77
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,000
it's probably Nine Characters.

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,000
Pung.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,319
Young Master Qin passed me a Character tile.

80
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,639
My row of Dots is all his missing suit.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
I can only give him one Character tile back.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,279
Then play the rawest one.

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,160
Pung.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,560
They didn't cheat,

85
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,560
but they're working together to pass tiles.

86
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,639
One versus three.

87
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,879
Winning now depends on luck.

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,199
Young Master Qin, play or not?

89
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,480
Play.

90
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,959
This tile is yours.

91
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,800
You let me pung, so I pung.

92
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Didn't pung Three Bamboo, drew Four Bamboo.

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,439
This kid lost big.

94
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,480
Got a winning tile.

95
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,439
Kept Four Bamboo, broke up Six and Seven.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,560
This kid doesn't even understand tile efficiency.

97
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,399
Every tile can be paired up.

98
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,720
This kid is really lucky.

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,519
Looks like he's aiming for All Pairs or Seven Pairs.

100
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,279
With the current score,

101
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,079
he can't just go for a regular win.

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,639
Another three of bamboo.

103
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,120
He'll definitely want the last one.

104
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,759
And if he claims it,

105
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,720
he'll have to discard two dots and feed me the win.

106
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,279
If I win first, it's good for Young Master Qin too.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,639
Three of bamboo.

108
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,079
Your turn.

109
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,160
Pass.

110
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,959
Seems you know we won't feed you the win.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Going for Seven Pairs, hoping for a self-draw win.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,879
You had your chance but didn't take it.

113
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,800
You could've claimed tiles but insist on Seven Pairs.

114
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,439
Claim.

115
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,199
Didn't claim three of bamboo, but claimed four.

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,279
The only possibility is you're keeping a sequence.

117
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,720
Are you trying for a regular win?

118
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,439
With the current score,

119
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,199
Even if you self-draw and beat three players, you still can't beat me.

120
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,480
Since you're so confident,

121
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,079
Here you go.

122
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,399
How did he know?

123
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,959
Take it.

124
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,199
Win.

125
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
Fed the win, one player out.

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,240
I think you just like to show off.

127
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,519
Even if all three self-draw, you can't beat me.

128
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,959
Now there are only two left.

129
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
What chance do you have now?

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,199
Don't rush, draw.

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,480
Six dots.

132
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,680
Nine dots.

133
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,399
The chance you mentioned earlier,

134
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,720
is this enough?

135
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,000
How did he know the next tile would be four of bamboo?

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,439
If this kid self-draws and beats two players,

137
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,759
he'll surpass me.

138
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:43,879
Six of bamboo.

139
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,920
What are you looking at?

140
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,439
Hurry up and play.

141
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,879
Once played, only one player left.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,959
At best, he can only tie with me.

143
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,959
Self-draw win.

144
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
There's still a six-point gap.

145
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
It's almost impossible to win now.

146
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,000
Kong.

147
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,600
Now you don't even have a chance to tie with me.

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
Chen Gongxi.

149
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,879
Do you know what they say in America?

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,639
Opportunity knocks but once.

151
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,600
Chance only knocks once.

152
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Last chance.

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,600
Mahjong God.

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,679
Isn't all that special.

155
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,039
The hardest part of this game isn't playing with an open hand.

156
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,480
It's that playing one against three is impossible.

157
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,960
One round decides the winner.

158
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,200
You just need a higher score than me to win.

159
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
But when I heard this rule,

160
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,519
I found my breakthrough.

161
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,360
I put myself at a disadvantage first.

162
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,440
Fed the win to one player to let them out first.

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,159
Win.

164
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,600
Then I applied some pressure.

165
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,679
You were afraid I'd self-draw and turn the tables.

166
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Self-draw win.

167
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
So another player would win and leave.

168
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,720
With two players out of the way,

169
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
my target is just one.

170
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,879
It's your missing suit.

171
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,519
Change of luck.

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,639
Ten thousand bonus points for kong are canceled.

173
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,120
Kong then feed with root, I gain four, you lose four.

174
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,240
Thanks for letting me win.

175
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,879
Calculated every tile precisely.

176
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,480
Still managed to turn the tables in this situation.

177
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,519
Young Mahjong God.

178
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,720
That's him.

179
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,480
You've got some skills, kid.

180
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,840
Time to keep your promise.

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,799
Let her go.

182
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,279
Chen Gongxi.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,039
We only met because we clashed.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,320
Come on.

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Let's wish ourselves

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,200
a victorious start.

187
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,279
What do you mean?

188
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,200
It's simple.

189
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,960
You represent Yaode Group

190
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,639
in the mahjong tournament.

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Otherwise, you can't just come and go here

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
as you please.

193
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,559
Who says so?

194
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,759
Xiaoxue.

195
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,879
Miss Bai.

196
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
Young Master Qin, this isn't how you ask for help.

197
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,159
Gongxi.

198
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,720
Let's go.

199
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,320
Miss Bai.

200
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,200
Miss Bai.

201
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,039
That's enough.

202
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,159
Miss Bai.

203
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,039
Look at your outfit.

204
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,080
You have the nerve to say that?

205
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,639
It's all thanks to you.

206
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,000
Thank you, Miss Bai, for helping me out.

207
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,480
No need to thank me.

208
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,080
As long as you

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,639
help me with a small favor.

210
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,480
You don't mean you want me to

211
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,879
play mahjong against Yaode Group, do you?

212
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,679
Miss Bai, I won't play mahjong anymore.

213
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,799
Just one match.

214
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,919
It's professional, and you're good at it.

215
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,519
Still, I can't.

216
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,080
Gongxi.

217
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,000
Ziwei.

218
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,320
You planned all this,

219
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,360
didn't you?

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,679
I lied to you.

222
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,240
But I really have no choice.

223
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,360
They want me to pay my debt quickly.

224
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,120
But I don't even know where my dad is now.

225
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,919
Forget it.

226
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,440
Let's go back first.

227
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
Sorry, Miss Bai.

228
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,039
I can't meet your request.

229
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,240
Why am I being left behind again?

230
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,559
Gongxi.

231
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,080
What's wrong?

232
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
Are you mad at me?

233
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,080
After my mom passed away,

234
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,360
I swore

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,679
not to play anymore.

236
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,799
But you're so talented.

237
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,000
Should talent be used like this?

238
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,279
Besides,

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,080
stay away from those people.

240
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,240
I can't help with this.

241
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,519
That's not what I meant.

242
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,000
Ziwei.

243
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,720
You know about my dad too.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
I don't want your family to repeat our mistakes.

245
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,679
Getting involved with those people

246
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,240
will only bring you endless trouble.

247
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm the one who should apologize.

248
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,600
I dragged you into this.

249
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,320
And broke your mother's promise.

250
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
It won't happen again.

251
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,600
Ziwei.

252
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,840
You should go back first.

253
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,799
I don't want to.

254
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,639
I just want to stay with you.

255
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,559
Listen to me.

256
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,360
Go back first.

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
I don't want to go alone.

258
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,720
What if something happens to me again?

259
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,639
Ziwei.

260
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,799
Are you hungry?

261
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:35,440
Let's go.

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,320
Get something to eat.

263
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,559
I'm not hungry, Gongxi.

264
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,519
Long time no see.

265
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,879
Chen Gongxi.
