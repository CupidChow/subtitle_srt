1
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,840
Jiangcheng Chamber of Commerce Sichuan Mahjong 2V2 Tournament

2
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,959
Professional competition rules apply

3
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,760
Cangwu Group contestants

4
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,159
Chen Gongxi

5
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,480
Bai Ruoxue

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,400
Let me introduce

7
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,200
This is Uncle Bo

8
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,159
Three-time Mahjong God Championship winner

9
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
This match uses Sichuan Mahjong ‘Fight to the End’ rules

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
Ranking is based on scores

11
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,200
Players are ranked from first to fourth

12
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,239
First place gets 4 points, fourth place gets 1 point

13
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,280
Team scores are the sum of both players’ ranks

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,000
The team with the higher score wins

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,680
Wait a minute

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,919
What are you doing?

17
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,599
It’s a competition

18
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,479
This way it’s fair

19
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,199
We’ve already consulted the Chamber

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,439
They agreed as well

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,439
This is clearly to suppress Gongxi’s card memory skills

22
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,280
If it’s just about mahjong skills

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,479
It’s not in our favor

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,080
Then

25
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,039
Let’s start the match

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,280
They figured out I can memorize the tiles

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,479
I knew this match wouldn’t be easy

28
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,879
But I can’t lose this time

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
This isn’t just a competition

30
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,599
It’s about protecting something

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,439
Don’t overthink it

32
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,159
I’m here with you

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,080
Why did he discard Wanzi?

34
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,080
Isn’t that Xiaoxue’s missing suit?

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Deliberately discarding a missing suit

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,159
Looks like he wants a quick win

37
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,439
Still too young to stay calm

38
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,159
Not only did he not claim a pung

39
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,319
He even broke a pair to discard

40
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,560
Gongxi

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
What are you doing?

42
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,759
This kid

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,319
What suit is he missing?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
He keeps all three suits

45
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,039
This isn’t even a strategy anymore

46
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,319
Still breaking pairs

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,039
Chen Gongxi, are you crazy?

48
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,680
Last four tiles

49
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,319
Chen Gongxi, I’m begging you

50
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,480
Please don’t draw another Tiaozi

51
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,079
Darn it, how many points for Flower Pig?

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Thirty-two points to each player

53
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,240
There’s nothing I can do

54
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,720
Here you go

55
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,519
Pung

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,639
Still couldn’t keep it

57
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,079
I noticed long ago

58
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,439
You’re playing defensively

59
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,439
But we’re playing Sichuan Mahjong

60
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,720
We have to check for ready hand and Flower Pig

61
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,319
Always defending

62
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,839
I bet you’re not even close to ready hand!

63
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,920
Gongxi discarded for Uncle Bo’s pung

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
He did it to give himself a chance to draw

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
First round

66
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,839
Draw

67
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,079
This kid really wasn’t ready

68
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,199
Thanks, Uncle Bo

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,959
If you hadn’t claimed that tile

70
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,199
I almost became a Flower Pig

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
Such an unusual playstyle

72
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,519
What is he planning?

73
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,879
Looks like Xiaoxue understands now

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,879
Time to fight back

75
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,720
Chen Gongxi was the only one not ready

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,040
The other three each get one point

77
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,920
Ready hand so quickly

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,439
That’s his true skill

79
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,240
Gongxi regained the advantage

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,199
Now it’s up to Xiaoxue

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,439
I’m missing Tiaozi, he’s missing Wanzi

82
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,120
He discards a Tongzi

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
Three and six Tongzi are already out

84
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,680
If helping him, it’s probably a high-number Tongzi

85
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,480
Looks like it’s not this one

86
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,439
Not four or seven

87
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,319
Then it must be five or eight

88
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,199
Win

89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
Now everything is ready

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
Chen Gongxi promised to help Xiaoxue

91
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,800
How did he win with Xiaoxue’s tile?

92
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,720
Self-draw win

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,560
Thanks, Xiaoxue

94
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,720
Wait.

95
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,319
I request a five-minute break.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,839
Uncle Bo.

97
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,839
There’s no halftime break in this tournament, right?

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,199
I’m getting old, can’t keep up with you youngsters.

99
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,759
No break.

100
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
We can’t continue playing like this.

101
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,680
Alright.

102
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,480
Let’s do as Uncle Bo says.

103
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,160
Take a five-minute break.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
Looks like Uncle Bo has figured it out.

105
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,040
What we’re trying to do.

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,199
You mean—

107
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,079
Chen Gongxi memorized all the tiles?

108
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,759
Impossible.

109
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,439
We covered the tiles from the start.

110
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,759
He exploited a loophole in the rules.

111
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
In the first round, he pretended to play defensively.

112
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
But he was actually aiming for a draw.

113
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,800
So all the tiles would be revealed.

114
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,639
Then in the last round, Xiaoxue deliberately gave him the dealer.

115
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,040
So he could take the dealer position.

116
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
If he had rolled the dice just now,

117
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,959
he could have made a hand like a self-draw win.

118
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Uncle Bo.

119
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,040
You’re really sharp.

120
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,480
So what should we do now?

121
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,000
If we want fairness,

122
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,639
let’s make it completely fair.

123
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,519
This way—

124
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,959
Uncle Bo will definitely make a move.

125
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,279
Then we—

126
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,360
Wait a second.

127
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,559
What now?

128
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,679
I request a new set of tiles for each round.
