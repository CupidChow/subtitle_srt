1
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
Chen Shao

2
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,079
Is it good news or bad news?

3
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,200
Beimen Alley

4
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,879
I don’t know what to do.

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,680
Sit down.

6
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,120
Tell me.

7
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,239
Qin Wuyao played dirty.

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,120
He tricked the villagers out of their houses.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,599
Cheated.

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,959
Do you have any proof?

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,080
No.

12
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,439
People’s hearts...

13
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,560
are like bottomless pits.

14
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,280
If they weren’t greedy,

15
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,919
they wouldn’t have fallen for it.

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,039
I grew up relying on neighbors’ kindness.

17
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,159
I believe

18
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
after this experience,

19
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,639
the villagers will remember this lesson.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,159
But I promised my mom

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,639
to protect them.

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Yes.

23
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,039
Protect my sister.

24
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,680
Give back to the community.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,879
Never get involved in gambling.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,479
Don’t you think you’re carrying too much?

27
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,520
I have to do it all.

28
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,680
Every single one.

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,159
Uncle Dong

30
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,240
Why are you laughing?

31
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,080
Seeing you like this now,

32
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,360
reminds me of your father.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,400
Beimen Village

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,599
That place isn’t good for investment.

35
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,439
Old Dong

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Not everything

37
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,159
can be measured by money.

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Beimen Village

39
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone chipped in

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,879
to send me to college.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,439
Now it’s my turn to give back.

42
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,879
He is him.

43
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,919
I am me.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,439
But there’s one thing you lack compared to him.

45
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,319
What?

46
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,400
Watch closely.

47
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,120
You lost.

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,599
At least your father understood this.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
You’re a leader with no support.

50
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,240
Yaode Group, top to bottom,

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,439
hundreds of people sneakily plot.

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,000
What do you have to fight them?

53
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,439
Even if we take a step back,

54
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,599
they paid for the houses.

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,759
Can you stop them?

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
You’re young.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,680
Naive.

58
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,560
Bold and stubborn.

59
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,680
That’s normal.

60
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,759
But

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,599
if your father were here now,

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,719
think about it.

63
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,240
What would he do?

64
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,319
Uncle Dong

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
I want to borrow something from you.

66
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,519
No, wait.

67
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,319
More than one thing.

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
What you want,

69
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,480
I’ve wanted to give you for a long time.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,639
No, it’s returning it to you.

71
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
He said

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,040
I couldn’t.

73
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,399
He wanted me to give it to you myself.

74
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,839
But I had to wait for you to ask for it.

75
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,120
Here, if you don’t sign, forget it.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
Wait, I’ll sign.

77
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,839
Hold on.

78
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,240
Who are you?

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,839
Do you know where this is?

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,240
Qin Shao

81
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,199
Someone wants to see you.

82
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,920
Give the houses back to them.

83
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,000
The money—

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,360
I’ll repay it myself.

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
I noticed after not seeing you for a few days,

86
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,720
you’ve learned to joke, huh?

87
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,120
You’ll repay?

88
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,680
Tell me,

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
how will you pay?

90
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Uncle Dong’s intention—

91
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,399
That’s starting a feud.

92
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,240
Uncle Dong voluntarily transfers his assets

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
and shares to Chen Shao.

94
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,600
He won’t get involved in your dispute.

95
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,199
He’s not participating.

96
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
I don’t care about this little money.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,079
Please tell Uncle Dong

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,720
the feud is set in stone.

99
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,759
Dad

100
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,759
Uncle Dong has made his move.

101
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,800
Alright.

102
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,959
Don't let me down this time.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,759
Okay.

104
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,199
Zhengli,

105
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,959
My son won't lose.

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,879
Elder

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,480
You need something from me?

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
According to the competition results,

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,959
Cangwu gets priority to negotiate share acquisition with the Lü family.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,519
Yaode is buying property now.

111
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,720
What are they planning?

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Don't break the rules.

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000
They're desperate to pay off their debts.

114
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,040
Isn't repaying debts the right thing to do?

115
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,480
I lent them money to help.

116
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,560
How does that break any rules?

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
If it's just about money,

118
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,680
then do me a favor.

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Let Gongxi buy the house back.

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,879
Call you Elder,

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,560
and you really think you're the Elder now?

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,839
Let me tell you,

123
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,160
I accept the competition results.

124
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,879
But now,

125
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,879
I set the rules.

126
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,399
Let's go.

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,240
Wait.

128
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,240
Return the houses of the Beimen villagers

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,879
back to them.

130
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,000
Money—

131
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,240
I'll give it to you.

132
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,279
What did you say?

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
Money.

134
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,480
Yaode doesn't lack this kind of money.

135
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,399
The initiative is in my hands now.

136
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,040
Chen, besides money,

137
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,519
do you have any other way?

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,279
Qin,

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,959
why not hear my proposal?

140
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,240
Xiaoxue,

141
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,360
I heard Uncle Qin wants a marriage alliance between our families.

142
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
If you agree to Mr. Chen,

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,439
I can give you a chance.

144
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Think it over.

145
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,120
Xiaoxue,

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,120
No need to think.

147
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,519
I'll take this chance.

148
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,319
But I have one condition.

149
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,600
You have to compete with me.

150
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,399
As long as you join,

151
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,959
you can buy the house back at the original price.

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,759
No other stakes.

153
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,240
I just want to see you completely defeated.

154
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Is that okay, Xiaoxue?

155
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,399
Sure.

156
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:30,879
Alright.

157
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,559
I accept.

158
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,399
It's settled.

159
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,240
But this time,

160
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,000
we won't play mahjong.

161
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,519
We'll play dice.

162
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,080
President Qin,

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,480
You—

164
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
It's none of your business.

165
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,000
It's decided.

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,279
Xiaoxue,

167
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,360
One week from now,

168
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,440
at Jiangcheng Palace.

169
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,320
Don't be late.

170
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,559
Xiaoxue,

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
No matter what, don't joke about yourself.

172
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,519
You're not a bargaining chip.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,600
You're overthinking.

174
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,600
I only listen to my dad.

175
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,840
If you win, it's good for the Bai family.

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,799
If you lose,

177
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I'll accept the outcome.

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,080
No.

179
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,519
Just because you say no, it's no?

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,679
Do friends really interfere this much?

181
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,679
That day, Sister Zhao came to me drunk.

182
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,600
I just made sure she was okay.

183
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,600
There's nothing between us.

184
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
Who cares about that?

185
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,919
Xiaoxue,
