1
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,719
Hurry up, congratulations!

2
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,799
Stop! Stop! Stop!

3
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,280
Brat, stop calling me!

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,359
If it weren't for you,

5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
I would've won this round.

6
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,000
Qin Defeng

7
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,280
You're playing me.

8
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,480
You can't get away.

9
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,680
You're just like your dad.

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,919
Like a stubborn bandage,

11
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,080
Impossible to tear off.

12
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,120
I'll take that as a compliment.

13
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,800
But

14
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you the only one who knows to hold back?

15
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,800
Do you want to know

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,159
how your dad begged me when he died?

17
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,120
Qin Defeng

18
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,520
I've never wronged you, have I?

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,240
Kicking me out of Beimen Street—

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,000
wasn't that your idea?

21
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,800
That was everyone's decision.

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
You dare say you had nothing to do with it?

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,000
Chen Zhengli

24
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,240
I just don't get it.

25
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,800
Why does everything I do

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,879
have to be opposed by you?

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
What's so great about them?

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
They helped me before.

29
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,159
Let me give you a choice.

30
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,520
Transfer all your shares to me,

31
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
and I'll let you live.

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,800
So,

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
this is what you wanted.

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,199
What else?

35
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,879
Did you think I really came to you

36
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,039
to talk about cooperation?

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,599
I would never hand Wenhua Group

38
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,919
over to someone like you.

39
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,159
I knew it.

40
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,879
Listen to this first.

41
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,360
Brat, stop calling me!

42
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,400
If it weren't for you,

43
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,639
I would've won this round.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,639
Not bad, right?

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,639
This is Country M's latest tech—synthetic audio.

46
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,800
I have dozens more like this.

47
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,240
I have dozens more.

48
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,879
And that's not all.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,960
Every game you played in Lavis,

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,400
I had someone record it.

51
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,680
Despicable.

52
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm despicable?

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,479
Maybe you don't know,

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
in Country M,

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,040
being despicable

56
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
is the winner's

57
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,600
passport.

58
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,879
Who would've thought

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,720
you and your father are just the same.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,519
Thanks for your real confession.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,240
You—

62
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,240
Uncle Gui

63
00:04:59,439 --> 00:04:59,680
You—

64
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,839
Sorry, Mr. Qin.

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
I have kids to think about.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,519
You shouldn't keep making mistakes.

67
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,040
Nice move.

68
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,480
When did it start?

69
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
My dad taught me—

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,639
always keep something in reserve.

71
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,279
If Qin Defeng does something,

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
covering for him makes you just as guilty.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,439
What are you really trying to say?

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,759
Do you think, when the time comes,

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Qin Defeng will protect you?

76
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,480
From the very start,

77
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,079
I never planned to beat him.

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Then why compete with him?

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I need to stall him.

80
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,399
If you want to convict Qin Defeng,

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
you need key evidence.

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,879
This match with him—

83
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,160
isn't about winning or losing.

84
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,879
It's just to get his confession.

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,480
So what should I do?

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,959
Go to the police.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,720
We'll cooperate with them.

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,439
Get Qin Defeng detained.

89
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,480
Okay.

90
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,680
I understand.

91
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,839
Dad.

92
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,279
Dad.

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
Don't keep making mistakes.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,720
Uncle Qin,

95
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,319
do it for Zhao Zhao.

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Confess.

97
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,600
General.

98
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,680
See, I didn't let you ride that horse earlier—

99
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
that incident

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
was over two months ago.

101
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Life is back to how it was.

102
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,879
Xiaoxue led Cangwu

103
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,439
to propose the Beimen Street development plan.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,519
It preserved the old neighborhood's culture.

105
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,319
It was recognized by the government.

106
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,279
She also became the Jiangcheng Chamber of Commerce's

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,920
youngest vice president. Impressive.

108
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
My precious daughter did great.

109
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:56,759
Of course.

110
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,160
Third Uncle accepted my suggestion too.

111
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
The Chamber's way of resolving disputes

112
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,439
should keep up with the times. Mahjong matches—

113
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,160
old customs need to be changed.

114
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,600
The Chamber has accepted the government's criticism.

115
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,959
They even set up the Anti-Gambling Advocacy Fund.

116
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
What surprised me most—

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,519
Ziwei and her brother found jobs.

118
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,079
They even paid me back recently.

119
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,720
Congrats, bro.

120
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,759
I did some foolish things before.

121
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,519
Sorry.

122
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Let the past be the past.

123
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,879
If you ever need help again,

124
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,759
you can still come to me.

125
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,160
As for Sister Zhao Zhao,

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
she should let me win a round!

127
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,440
After that day,

128
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,000
I haven't seen her since.

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,399
You guys play first.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,679
Go ahead. Sure.

131
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,440
I'll take this seat then.

132
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,799
I'll take this seat then.
