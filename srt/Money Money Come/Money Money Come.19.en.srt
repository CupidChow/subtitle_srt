1
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,519
Why are you still looking for me?

2
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,400
Gongxi,

3
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,799
do you still remember our childhood?

4
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,079
We studied together here,

5
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,120
and practiced martial arts.

6
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,840
Thinking back now,

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,959
those days were truly joyful.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Until

9
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,480
my whole family

10
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,159
was driven out by your father.

11
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,959
Only then did my dad tell me

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,319
the man my mom loved

13
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,039
was always Uncle Chen.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
But she still married my father.

15
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,759
She never expected

16
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,639
the man she loved

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,840
would personally drive her away.

18
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,879
So Qin Defeng wanted to harm Uncle Dong,

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,039
does he want to hurt everyone?

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,039
I still don't believe my dad would hurt them.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Zhaozhao Jie,

22
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,919
don't help him do evil.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,479
I don't want to be your enemy.

24
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,039
Gongxi,

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,319
I'm not trying to help him.

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,280
He promised me

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
to take my mom abroad for treatment.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
I'll try to persuade my dad.

29
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,479
Beimen Street—

30
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,000
we don't want it anymore.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,199
Do you think that's possible?

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,919
Go back and tell Qin Defeng,

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,800
as long as I'm here,

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,240
he can't touch Beimen Street.

35
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,280
That's pretty funny.

36
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
My mom and I

37
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,879
both loved the wrong person.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,680
Sir, please.

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,400
Who is that?

40
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,439
It's him.

41
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,120
Qin Defeng.

42
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,759
Why did he come back?

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,199
What's he doing here?

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Old Zhang,

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,759
what are you doing?

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,400
You dare show your face here?

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,759
Haven't you heard?

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,479
Beimen Street

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,039
is now being developed by Yaode Group.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm just back for old times' sake.

51
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,800
Is that a problem?

52
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,199
Don't even think about it.

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,439
Haven't you hurt us enough?

54
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,959
Compared to what you did back then,

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm being polite today.

56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
Move aside, move aside!

57
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,439
Beimen Street—

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm tearing it down for sure.

59
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,079
Is this how your father taught you to treat guests?

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,839
My father taught me

61
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,879
not to harm others unless they harm me.

62
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,279
If they do, I pay them back double.

63
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,199
Your dad and I go way back.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,680
It's not that bad.

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
You killed my father.

66
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,079
Where's your proof?

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,439
Don't you know in your heart?

68
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,680
Right now,

69
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,600
you should worry more about Beimen Street.

70
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,560
What do you mean?

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,319
The Bai family's accountant

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,920
ran off with the money.

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,439
They can't

74
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,680
develop Beimen Street now.

75
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:13,959
And you—

76
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,480
you've got nothing left.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,240
This is grown-up business.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,279
Kids should stay out of it.

79
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,480
Qin Defeng,

80
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,240
do you know why you were kicked out?

81
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,399
Because I'm better than him.

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Because you're more shameless.

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
Save your breath.

84
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,519
Wait a minute.

85
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,879
Explain yourself to the neighbors.

86
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,560
Who did this?

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,959
Qin Defeng!

88
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,519
We kicked you out once,

89
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,959
we can do it again and again.

90
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,120
That's right, that's right.

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,879
Qin Defeng!

92
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,199
Go, get out!

93
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,800
I told you,

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,079
as long as I'm here,

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,079
you can't touch Beimen Street.

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,639
And

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,800
my father's debt—

98
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll make you pay it back.

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
I said

100
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,959
it has nothing to do with me.

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,199
Qin Defeng,

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,079
do you dare to compete?

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,959
If I win,

104
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,160
Yaode Group can never set foot in Beimen Street.

105
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,600
Why should I agree?

106
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,439
Guess what this is.

107
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,079
Want to hear it?

108
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,399
It's pretty interesting.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,680
President Qin,

110
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,000
the trip abroad is arranged.

111
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,120
Is it really necessary to compete with them?

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
Besides, he's great at cards.

113
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,160
If we don't compete,

114
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,800
who knows what he's holding?

115
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,600
What if Acai really talks?

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,519
There's no "what if."

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
Our accountant ran away.

118
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
Qin Defeng must be behind it.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,519
No, I have to investigate.

120
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,240
Xiaoxue,

121
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,000
what is it?

122
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,560
This time is different.

123
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,480
I know.

124
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,600
It's very dangerous this time.

125
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,519
So?

126
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,519
Qin Defeng agreed to compete with me.

127
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,800
You're going alone?

128
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,959
Chen Gongxi,

129
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,959
why are you playing the hero?

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,959
Don't be mad.

131
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,079
How can I not be angry?

132
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,959
I ran into trouble here,

133
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,720
and now only you can face him.

134
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,399
Why are you laughing?

135
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,639
It's my first time seeing you angry.

136
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,800
So this is what it's like.

137
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
I told you,

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,959
if I can't do anything by your side,

139
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,879
I remember.

140
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,759
I didn't leave you behind this time.

141
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,079
Actually, I need you to stay even more.

142
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,600
What do you mean?

143
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,519
What do you want?

144
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,840
Just wandering around.

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,919
Ended up here.

146
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,440
Chen Gongxi sent you, didn't he?

147
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,240
Heard you're leaving the country.

148
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,960
Afraid you'd leave without saying goodbye.

149
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,600
At least settle things before you go.

150
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,519
What do you think?

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,879
Fine.

152
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,559
Tell him for me.

153
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,879
The match is tomorrow afternoon.

154
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,480
Aocheng.

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,600
Dad.

156
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
It all ends tomorrow.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,639
Mr. Qin.

158
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Everything's ready.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,159
Chen Gongxi.

160
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,399
I want to see

161
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,120
how you lose this time.
