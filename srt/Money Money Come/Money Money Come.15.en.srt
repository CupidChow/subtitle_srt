1
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,159
Go ahead.

2
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,159
Or is it

3
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,239
your hand's not working?

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Qin Wuyao, one point.

5
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,640
Chen Gongxi, four points.

6
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
First round.

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Qin Wuyao wins.

8
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,200
Not hard at all.

9
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,000
Chen Gongxi.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,879
People respect you

11
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,200
because you always win.

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
After this round,

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
I'll make Xiao Xue

14
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,719
never say I'm not as good as you.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,560
You've met Xiao Xue.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,879
Why should I explain to you?

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,560
Come on.

18
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,360
Wait.

19
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,360
I need a break.

20
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,840
Hope you understand.

21
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,479
Alright.

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,080
Don't blame me

23
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
for not giving you a chance.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,680
Hey.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,960
Is this Zhaozhao?

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
What's wrong, Gongxi?

27
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,000
Remember I said I couldn't reach Xiao Xue yesterday?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,599
They're using such dirty tricks now.

29
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,280
No need to guess who it is.

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll go find him.

31
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,199
The match is tomorrow.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,759
Ask Uncle San to cancel it.

33
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,240
No way.

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,759
I don't want him to keep pestering Xiao Xue.

35
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,639
I want to end this soon.

36
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,080
So I can explain to Xiao Xue.

37
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiao Xue didn't answer my calls all night.

38
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,840
I have to go to tomorrow's match.

39
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,560
I don't want to drag this out.

40
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,120
According to what Qin Wuyao said,

41
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,080
Xiao Xue might've argued with him.

42
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,319
Couldn't find Xiao Xue last night.

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
It might be related to Qin Wuyao.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,319
How was your break?

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,080
Let's change the game.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
What do you want to play?

47
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,639
Qin, you've spent plenty of nights out, right?

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,560
Let's play what you're good at.

49
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,000
Bluff.

50
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,199
Bluff.

51
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,000
Are you sure you want to play Bluff?

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,719
Alright.

53
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,159
Bluff it is.

54
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,599
Miss.

55
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,759
This is Mr. Qin's room.

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,439
You think I don't know?

57
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,879
Mr. Qin said

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
no one but him

59
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
can enter.

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,520
What if I insist on going in?

61
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll say it again.

62
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,279
Move aside.

63
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,439
Miss.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Please don't make this hard for me.

65
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,000
If something happens to her,

66
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,920
do you think the Bai family will spare you?

67
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,120
More importantly,

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Qin Wuyao.

69
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,839
Will he protect you?

70
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,839
Four sixes.

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,439
Add one.

72
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,680
Xiao Xue.

73
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:40,879
Xiao Xue.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,519
Six sixes.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,439
Add one.

76
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,519
Daring to raise twice.

77
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,600
There must be at least three sixes.

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,079
But he can't know all five of mine are sixes.

79
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,319
Eight sixes.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,399
Reveal.

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,279
Are you alright?

82
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,439
Where's Chen Gongxi?

83
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,439
Still competing.

84
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,199
Go, now.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,040
Wait.

86
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,079
I need to clear something up.

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,600
Not a single one.

88
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,160
Second round.

89
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Chen Gongxi wins.

90
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,480
Wait.

91
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Still comparing points?

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Lowest wins.

93
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,079
But this time,

94
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,680
we grab the dice.

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,120
Are you scared?

96
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,319
You in or not?

97
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,160
If you don't dare play me,

98
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,839
I can call it off right now.

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,319
If you lose,

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,279
remember your promise.

101
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,360
Get ready.

102
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Left hand.

103
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
Impossible.

104
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,839
How could you...

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,959
I'm ambidextrous.

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,759
Didn't he tell you?

107
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,839
Mr. Chen.

108
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,360
Let me show you.

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,759
You had someone watch me at Uncle San's.

110
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,560
Too bad they hid so poorly.

111
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,839
You knew all along.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,920
You bluffed me.

113
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,839
Sometimes, you're pretty naive.

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,639
Third round.

115
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,480
Chen Gongxi wins.

116
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,839
Chen Gongxi.

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,439
We'll see about that.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,759
Where are you going?

119
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,959
Xiao Xue.

120
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,399
Qin Wuyao.

121
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,800
Guess what this is.

122
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,439
Xiao Xue.

123
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
What are you really looking for?

124
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,839
We already know about the undercover.

125
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,879
Not that.

126
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,040
Earlier, on Qin Wuyao's computer,

127
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
I found something.

128
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,639
Got it.

129
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,879
Qin Wuyao.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Guess what this is.

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,040
I've called the police.

132
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,399
You're not going anywhere.

133
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,759
Even crippled, you want to stop me?

134
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,680
Bring me the stuff.

135
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,399
Qin Wuyao.

136
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,240
You think this way

137
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,920
you can keep Beimen Street?

138
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,160
At least for now,

139
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,879
you're the one who lost.

140
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,600
Did I lose?

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Chen Gongxi.

142
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,080
You're just like your useless dad.

143
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,519
Can't protect anything.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,960
But there's one thing

145
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,879
that's different, you know what?

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
It's that he

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,679
is already dead.

148
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Thank you, Chen Gongxi.

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,279
It's all thanks to you.

150
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:14,919
Thank you, Chen Gongxi.

151
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,080
See? I told you not to trust them.

152
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,440
It's all thanks to you.

153
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,919
Good thing we got it back.

154
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,519
Exactly, exactly.

155
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,039
It's all thanks to you.

156
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,240
Thank goodness for Chen Gongxi.
Thank you, Chen Gongxi.

157
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,840
It's what I should do.

158
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,240
But from now on, everyone

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
must never trust this again.

160
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
We won't, we won't.

161
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,039
Gambling really ruins lives.

162
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,159
We'll never gamble again.

163
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,200
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
That's right, we'll never gamble again.

165
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,159
Thank you, Chen Gongxi.

166
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,759
Thank you, Chen Gongxi.

167
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,639
Glad we got it back.

168
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,039
Now we can finally relax.

169
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,000
Gongxi.
