1
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,439
I really didn't expect this.

2
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,599
Today I'm facing Chen Zhengli's son.

3
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,000
My dad didn't know how to play cards.

4
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,599
People can change.

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,799
How he looked at the card table back then—

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,959
Didn't you all see it yourselves?

7
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,480
Even what you see isn't always true.

8
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,040
Besides,

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,159
he was with you.

10
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,760
Let's get started, then.

11
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,680
We're playing poker today.

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,359
Small and big blind: fifteen thousand.

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
Blinds go up in one hour.

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,360
Fold.

15
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Fold.

16
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:49,960
Fold.

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,400
Fold.

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Fold.

19
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,759
Are you just going to keep

20
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,879
folding all night against me?

21
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,719
Can't help it.

22
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,479
Bad cards.

23
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Fold.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,719
This isn't fun at all.

25
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,919
Why don't we change the rules?

26
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,280
Raise the blinds early.

27
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,120
Next hand, blinds are ten times higher.

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,479
How about it?

29
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,759
However Chairman Qin wants to play,

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,039
I'm in.

31
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,719
Fold.

32
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,639
Let's see how many more you'll fold.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,439
All in.

34
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,439
Fold.

35
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,000
No fun at all.

36
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,919
Why are you in such a rush?

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
If you're so impatient,

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,439
why not tell me

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,280
why you killed my dad?

40
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
Why would I rush?

41
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,280
With those few chips you have,

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,879
you'll only last one more hand.

43
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,680
Congratulations.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,039
This is your last chance.

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,560
Alright.

46
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
Let's settle it in one hand.

47
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,040
Zhao Zhao.

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
Deal.

49
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,000
All in.

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,439
Call.

51
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,879
You don't have as many chips as I do.

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,279
What are you calling me with?

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
What if I add this in?

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,079
Zhao Zhao.

55
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,199
Showdown.

56
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,319
I've got two pairs on the board.

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,360
Even luck is on my side.

58
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,240
Maybe I'll get a straight.

59
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,720
Congrats.

60
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,399
Just one card left.

61
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,920
Do you really think you'll get a straight?

62
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,040
Since I was little, everyone said

63
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,879
your dad gambled himself to death.

64
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,480
Never be like your dad.

65
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,079
For more than ten years,

66
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,240
I've hated him for being irresponsible.

67
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,959
I thought he caused my mom's death.

68
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,759
Until Xiaoxue found me

69
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,480
and had me play against Yaode.

70
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,639
I broke my vow.

71
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,519
You promised me you'd never gamble again.

72
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,120
Later,

73
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,759
I beat Qin Wuyao three times.

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,160
I did everything to protect Beimen Street's people

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,000
from getting hurt.

76
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,920
Each time, the odds

77
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,759
were painfully low.

78
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,560
Awen.

79
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,720
But I still ended up here.

80
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,040
Now,

81
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,079
I'm getting closer to the truth.

82
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,399
Whether I win this time or not,

83
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,240
let fate decide.

84
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,480
Showdown.

85
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,560
Sorry, Chairman Qin.

86
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
I've got it.

87
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:25,920
Chairman Qin.

88
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,560
That's pretty shameless.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,279
Just your style.

90
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,720
Dad.

91
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,000
Gongxi won.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,959
This was all set up for him.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Win or lose, he can't escape.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
The boat's almost here.

95
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,439
Zhao Zhao.

96
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Let's go.

97
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,800
Dad.

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,199
I'd like to see who dares.

99
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,519
President Qin.

100
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,120
Miss, she—

101
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,439
We can't worry about that now.

102
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,800
She has to face the consequences of her choice.

103
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,959
But after all, Miss—

104
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,279
Are you with her

105
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,079
or with me?

106
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,480
When does the boat arrive?

107
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,319
Five minutes.

108
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,240
I'll hold them off.

109
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:31,959
Go, quickly.

110
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,039
No.

111
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,159
It's too dangerous for you.

112
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
They won't dare touch me.

113
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,120
Go now.

114
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,519
Hesitate and you'll lose your chance.

115
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't force it.

116
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
Gongxi, go now.

117
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,279
Stop! Stop!
