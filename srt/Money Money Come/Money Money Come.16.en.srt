1
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,280
Of course.

2
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,640
But from now on,

3
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,719
never trust this again.

4
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,719
We won't, we won't.

5
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,480
Gambling really ruins lives.

6
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,599
I'll never gamble again.

7
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,840
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,680
We'll never gamble again.

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,640
Thank you, Gongxi.

10
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
Thanks, Gongxi.

11
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,560
Thanks, Brother Gongxi.

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

13
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,480
Gongxi.

14
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:52,959
I'm heading out.

15
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,519
Hey, Gongxi,

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,480
I've got something to do too.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,359
I'll head out as well.

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
We'll leave now too.

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
Goodbye.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,719
Take care.

21
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,159
That's great.

22
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,560
Finally, it's settled.

23
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,520
Yeah.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll need your help with the development later.

25
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,039
No problem.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,479
Before,

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,919
This is for you. See if you like it.

29
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:45,919
Actually, Zhaozhao and I...

30
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,560
I put it on.

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,599
Why are you telling me this?

32
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,960
We're just friends anyway.

33
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,400
I don't want to be just friends with you.

34
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,280
In the past,

35
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
it was only because I was afraid.

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,280
Afraid I wasn't good enough for my family.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
Or afraid Qin Wuyao would hurt me.

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,800
If something happened to you,

39
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,879
I'd never forgive myself.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,960
If I'm by your side

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
but can't help at all,

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
then I'd leave too.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,800
I understand.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,439
So...

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
What are we now?

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,520
What does this make us?

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,719
We...

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Gongxi, someone's looking for you!

49
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,840
Who is it?

50
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,479
Wait for me to come back.

51
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,920
Long time no see.

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you still remember me?

53
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,120
Why were you gone so long?

54
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,240
Yes.

55
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,720
Qin Defeng.

56
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,079
Why did he come to see you?

57
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,439
We sent his son to jail.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,920
He won't try to get back at us, will he?

59
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,879
I don't know.

60
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,279
It's getting late.

61
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,920
You should go home and rest.

62
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,160
You still haven't answered my question.

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,560
What are we now?

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
What's our relationship?

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,360
Qin Defeng showing up

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,959
reminded me again

67
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,439
that you might have

68
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,639
even if there's danger,

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,199
you'll protect me,

70
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,040
right?

71
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,680
I told you before,

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,000
if I can't help you at all,

73
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,879
then I'd rather not be there.

74
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,480
Do you understand?

75
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,240
It's late.

76
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,680
Get some rest.

77
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,959
I'm leaving now.

78
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:15,879
What is it?

79
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,519
Missing me already?

80
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,720
About your question,

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,959
I'll answer it again.

82
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:10,920
Zhaozhao.

83
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,079
Your brother's in jail.

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,439
I know.

85
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,399
You put him there.

86
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,600
He broke the law.

87
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,319
He should be punished.

88
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,439
If I didn't, the Qin family would be done for.

89
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,319
Then Beimen Street,

90
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,680
I'll leave it to you.

91
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,720
Yaode has already lost.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,959
Do you understand?

93
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,959
That's all my mom has left.

94
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,240
Do you really have to tear it down?

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,079
Zhaozhao.

96
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,240
Come with me.

97
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
This is Uncle Chen.

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,199
Tell me,

99
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,879
why didn't I help your mother?

100
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,079
What if I told you

101
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,879
it was all because of Chen Zhengli?

102
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,800
Once you've seen it,

103
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
you'll understand everything.

104
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,519
Chen Gongxi.

105
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,679
You're just like your useless father.

106
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't protect anything.

107
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
Gongxi.

108
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,440
Sometimes, the pieces on the board

109
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,639
don't even know

110
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,240
who they're playing for.

111
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,399
Got it.

112
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:04,840
Uncle Dong.

113
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,039
We've found him.

114
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,200
Pretty efficient.

115
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,799
I'll bring him to see you.

116
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,600
No need.

117
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,519
Let's go see him.

118
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,480
Xiaoyun.

119
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,279
Don't tell Gongxi about this yet.

120
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay.

121
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,600
Gongxi.
