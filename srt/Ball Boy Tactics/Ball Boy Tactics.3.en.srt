"Ball Boy Tactics"
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
No need to write too much.

3
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,340
Keep it clear and concise.

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
I'll add these details verbally later.

5
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,220
Let's post this to the main page.

6
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,100
Why don't you take your cap off?

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
We're indoors.

8
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Worried my hair will get messed up...

9
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,040
What difference does
it make if we're indoors?

10
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,180
Anyway, I'm the only
one who's going to see it.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,900
- Take it off.
- Ah... okay.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
It doesn't look that messy.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
Is it because your head is so round?

14
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,700
It won't get messed up.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,700
Oh, really?

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't you get nervous when
you give a presentation?

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,820
I've played basketball in front of a crowd.
What's there to be nervous about when giving a report?

18
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,900
Yeah, that's true.

19
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
What?

20
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,400
Oh, no, it's nothing like that. I just
think you're really good at everything.

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,900
I'm actually pretty envious, too.

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,100
Compared to me, it's like night and day.

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,100
Haha... that's exactly it.

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
I'm saying...

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Are you trying to say I'm
charming, just in a roundabout way?

26
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Huh, what?

27
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Do I think you're attractive?

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,700
No, that's not what I meant.

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,600
I wish I had a personality
like yours, not your charm.

30
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,149
How should I put this... I
don't think you have any charm.

31
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,776
It's just that... there's no,
you know, sexual attraction.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What?

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Han Jiwon.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,249
Why did you break up
with your girlfriend before?

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,109
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

36
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,199
Just a bit curious, that's all.

37
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Hmm...

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,500
I usually don't talk about
my love life with just anyone.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Oh, really?

40
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
That's pretty cool.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Are you two seriously dating?

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Yeah.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,500
Every time I get into a relationship,
I do it with marriage in mind.

44
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,449
What am I even saying?

45
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,600
Stop talking so much, you idiot!

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,240
I don't think you need to change
your personality on purpose.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
There's got to be a reason why
people like you so much, right?

48
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,000
I think I kind of get it now, too.

49
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Really?

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
But aren't you a little
too interested in me?

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
How about... adding a video to this part?

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,240
(Kwon Jungwoo girlfriend) (Kwon Jungwoo girlfriend social media)
(Kwon Jungwoo sexuality) (Kwon Jungwoo relationship)

53
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,000
Looks like you're more interested in me.

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
This is...

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,210
If you have questions, don't bother searching.
Just ask me directly. It'll be much faster that way.

56
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,100
Oh, that wasn't me searching for it. My sister was
the one when she came over to my place earlier.

57
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,979
You're an only child?

58
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,299
Who doesn't know about this?

59
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,020
Everyone in Korea knows that.

60
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,000
No... I misspoke. I meant my cousin.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
Who would believe something like that...

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Oh, I see.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,300
Keep working on the report.

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Me...

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,500
No sex appeal?

66
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,400
What? Why are you suddenly asking that?

67
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey, if you're not getting swole, just drink more
protein. Have you been working out less lately?

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
It probably isn't a muscle issue, right?

69
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,100
But someone really did
say I have no sex appeal.

70
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,100
You don't have sex appeal? Did
someone actually say that to you?

71
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,500
Yeah... that's exactly what he said.

72
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,810
What does it even mean
to have no sex appeal?

73
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,191
Does that mean they're just
not interested in you at all?

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,076
Maybe just imagining kissing you is
enough to make them feel grossed out.

75
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Is that so?

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
You have absolutely no
sex appeal to that person.

77
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,676
You're not already dating
someone new, are you?

78
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,869
That's really something to be jealous of.

79
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,100
What are you jealous of?

80
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,999
You're even less attractive.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Why not introduce them to me?
I've got a better body than you, you know.

82
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,000
Where's that dog barking coming from again?

83
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,299
Even Kwon Jungwoo got rejected.
What makes you think you have a chance?

84
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,399
- Hey, I'm not bad either, you know.
- Honestly, you're really nothing special.

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,500
- My hair is really pretty.
- I'm telling you, your hair just doesn't cut it.

86
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,600
This concludes the presentation
from Group 3. Thank you, everyone.

87
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
How about it?

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,840
As expected, really impressive.

89
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,600
- We did pretty well on our presentation.
- Feels like we have a shot at getting an A.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,800
- Let's go out for dinner together after class.
- Dinner?

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,810
Don't you want to go?

92
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:29,900
- Oh, no, it's fine, I can go.
- Alright, it's settled then.

93
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,136
The results will be announced later. Thank you
all for your hard work preparing the reports.

94
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,300
That's it for today's class.

95
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,164
- Thank you, Professor.
- Thank you, Professor.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
- Hey, let's grab something to eat.
- What should we have?

97
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Hey, Jiwon, do you have a moment to talk?

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Huh?

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
I have something I'd
like to talk to you about.

100
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
Oh, really?

101
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
So beautiful!

102
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,509
So, should we talk outside?

103
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,800
Sure.

104
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,059
- Is Jiwon about to get confessed to?
- Looks like it!

105
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,020
Does that mean Jiwon will be the
first one in our group to find a partner?

106
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Wow! Really full of hidden talents.

107
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Alright, that's enough.

108
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,300
I'm going to the restroom. Let me
know for sure if you want to go there.

109
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,700
Hey! Why is he in a bad mood again?

110
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,600
What do you want to tell me?

111
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Do you perhaps have a girlfriend?

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
A girlfriend?

113
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
- Nope.
- So, is there a girl you like?

114
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,900
A girl...

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,900
that I like?

116
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
No.

117
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Then can I like you?

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Uh... well...

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,700
Just be honest with me.

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,300
If I'm being honest,

121
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm not the kind of person
who falls for someone easily.

122
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,480
I don't really have much
interest in dating, either.

123
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
Honestly, I'm not really interested either.

124
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,000
So...

125
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,800
Do you understand what I mean?

126
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Do you get it?

127
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,780
Thank you.

128
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,800
Thank you for being so honest with me.

129
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
It's all right.

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Even if the outcome isn't great, I still
want to try confessing at least once.

131
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,600
I'll head out first, then.

132
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Alright.

133
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,960
No matter what, you just can't do that.

134
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
This is nothing like
what we agreed on, is it?

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,456
Back then, I did everything you
told me to, you know that, right?

136
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,650
I know, I know.

137
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,200
So I really appreciate it.

138
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,000
But just help me out one more time
this time. It's really just a small favor.

139
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,500
It's just a few rolls, that's all.

140
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,400
- Help me out, will you?
- It's not like we're out on the court.

141
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm really in a tough spot, man. I just
can't say yes to your request this time.

142
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,578
Hey! Is it really that hard to
do a roll? Plus, the professor

143
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,679
asked me to get your help.
Everyone's hoping you'll pitch in!

144
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,718
Come on, Jiwon, as long as
you go up there and do a few rolls,

145
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,499
our department's
talent show will win first place.

146
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,040
We could even win five million in prize money
and upgrade all the equipment in our department.

147
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,900
Come on, I'm begging you here, okay?

148
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,140
Sorry for being on the phone for so long.

149
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,120
- Why do you look so upset?
- Is that your girlfriend?

150
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,426
- Is everything okay?
- Is that your girlfriend?

151
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,000
- You okay?
- She's really pretty.

152
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,100
- Shut up.
- It's not like that, I'm fine.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,170
He'll talk about it when he's
ready. Why are you so concerned?

154
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,300
Hey, how could I not be curious?

155
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Han Jiwon has never been in a relationship,
so of course we care about his love life.

156
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,660
Never been in a relationship?

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Han Jiwon.

158
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,140
You've never been in a relationship?

159
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,430
Then why are you judging me like that!

160
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,290
Jiwon! No matter what happens
this time, you have to get out of there.

161
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,600
Just keep quiet and let them talk.

162
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,499
Jiwon! Chin up, stand tall.

163
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,269
What's so bad about being single?

164
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,000
Everyone has times when they're single.

165
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,920
You've only been single for 22 years.

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,060
Hey! No need to be so harsh.
People can live to 100 these days.

167
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,600
Jiwon! You still have 78 years to find a girlfriend.
Hang in there!

168
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
He's probably really
disappointed in me, isn't he?

169
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,980
It all turned out like this
because I lied in the first place.

170
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm done for...

171
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,270
Everyone, let's go for the afterparty!

172
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,330
I heard some classmates from our department are at
a nearby anime-themed bar. Want to check it out?

173
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,300
Ah, I'll pass. I feel like if I keep
drinking, something bad's gonna happen.

174
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
Then why don't you head back with me?

175
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:22,170
What?

176
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:25,260
Let's go together. I'm tired
too and just want to go home.

177
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,000
Han Zhengyu, you're not going either?

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,819
You guys are really too much.

179
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,580
No one's sticking
around for the afterparty.

180
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
Alright, let's leave it at that.

181
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,200
Stop complaining and
come have a drink with me.

182
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,130
- Ah, why are you all such killjoys!
- Alright, alright.

183
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,820
Alright, alright, just order
whatever you want later.

184
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,060
Don't you have something
you wanted to say to me?

185
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Let's go.

186
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,340
Do you feel uncomfortable being with me?

187
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,200
Not at all!

188
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
It's just that...

189
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
What about drinking?

190
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
It's all good.

191
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,900
You used to be so famous, but I
always forget you were a gymnast.

192
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Yeah, true.

193
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:32,465
Because you have such a strong fighting spirit,
that's probably how you won the gold medal, right?

194
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,036
Competitive spirit?

195
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
I never thought that kind of competitive
spirit would show up in love, too.

196
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,300
You just want to act like you have a lot of
experience in love. I can understand that.

197
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,240
Aren't all athletes like that?

198
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,500
That feeling of not wanting to fall behind.

199
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
I totally get it.

200
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,200
I just honestly hate lying, that's all.

201
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Sorry.

202
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,600
Actually, I didn't lie
because I was competitive.

203
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
It's just...

204
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,960
I guess it's because I
want to get closer to you.

205
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know if it'll work.

206
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
But I mean it.

207
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
I want you to feel that
I'm someone you can trust.

208
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Really.

209
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,200
Don't look at me with that expression.

210
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,200
It's easy for people to get the wrong idea.

211
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Are you feeling upset?

212
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,400
I just want to sincerely apologize to you.

213
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,020
It's alright, forget it.
Let's go.

214
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm heading this way, you go on ahead.

215
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,700
- What's wrong?
- Are you feeling tired?

216
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Not at all.

217
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
If you're not tired.

218
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Wanna go for another round with me?

219
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Where to?

220
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
My place.

221
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
What?

222
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Are you inviting me over to your
place for some instant noodles?

223
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,600
Don't you have a cousin at home?

224
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
Uh, well...

225
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah.

226
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,980
Let's keep the party going.

227
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Go to your place.

228
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,500
Are you good at taking photos?

229
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,680
I kind of want to see the photos you took.

230
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
What's wrong? Don't want to show me?

231
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,400
No... I can show you.

232
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
This is a photo I took last time.

233
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,500
Oh, really?

234
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,100
Isn't this a campus?

235
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
It really looks different from this angle.

236
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Really?

237
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,320
The streets here are really beautiful.

238
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,831
This is the parking lot.

239
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,720
The photo you took is really
beautiful, it has a great vibe.

240
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Thank you.

241
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
This...

242
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
Isn't that my jersey number?

243
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,980
No, it's not like that, um…

244
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,600
That was a shot I took on the court...
right at the moment you caught the ball.

245
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Is that so, Han Jiwon?

246
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,500
Are you secretly collecting my photos?

247
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,600
No way.

248
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
I only saved it because the
photo turned out really well.

249
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,300
You really just aren't
cut out to be a girl.

250
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,100
Han Jiwon, you really
are better suited as a guy.

251
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,420
Do you want to stay over tonight?

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
- What?
- Nah, it's just that we drank a lot of alcohol.

253
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,500
Leaving this late, you'll probably
be really tired for class tomorrow.

254
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,000
- Oh...
- That's all there is to it...

255
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,900
I just want... to sleep with you.

256
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,700
No, I mean it literally.

257
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,300
(Coach is calling)

258
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Hello, Coach.

259
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
Kwon Jungwoo, where are you right now?

260
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,300
You have five minutes. Get
back here right away, understood?

261
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,200
Looks like I have to head out first.

262
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,300
Did you get called back to the dorm?

263
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,000
There's a reason for that.

264
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
There are other reasons, too.

265
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,900
Got it, take care on your way.

266
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm heading out.

267
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Han Jiwon.

268
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,500
Are you pushing yourself too hard?

269
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,000
It's nothing...

270
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,000
Han Jiwon, Han Jiwon.

271
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Senior.

272
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,340
Because I heard you suddenly disappeared.

273
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Uh, hello?

274
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,000
You're Kwon Jungwoo, right?

275
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,719
The match was really exciting to watch.

276
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,400
I'm a fan of yours.

277
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,199
Jiwon! The manager might be coming by later,
too. Can you stick around a bit longer?

278
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,649
Do you have something urgent going on?

279
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,650
Hmm...

280
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,300
Ah, no, that's not it...

281
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,000
My ankle hurts a bit
from that roll just now.

282
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I want to take a break.

283
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,409
Hey, you don't have any more matches coming
up anyway. Why not just rest in the lounge?

284
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,400
If the manager comes by later and you're not
here, that might not look so good, right?

285
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,100
You get what I mean, right?

286
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Ah.

287
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Got it.

288
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,399
Yeah! Now that I think about it carefully.

289
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,560
Every year we have to show off our skills.
How come you can't handle it already?

290
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,230
That would be really embarrassing for me.

291
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,930
What?

292
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,200
Isn't this just a one-time thing?

293
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,200
No, that's not it, Jiwon.

294
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,600
That was just something
I said off the cuff.

295
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,239
There are so many kids who joined just to
see you. If you only perform this year...

296
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Is this really okay?

297
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,600
Don't you think you're being a bit selfish?

298
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,520
- But last time we were talking about a cover shoot.
- A cover shoot?

299
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
I've already said thank you for that.

300
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
And also.

301
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,800
That's only because you're
famous that you get these jobs.

302
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,080
I haven't made any unreasonable requests.
You should be thanking me.

303
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Excuse me, may I ask?

304
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,940
Didn't you say you were my fan?

305
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,760
If you're really a fan, you should
know my personality pretty well, right?

306
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,800
Why do you keep provoking me?

307
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,330
What do you mean by that?

308
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,590
When you deal with people, at least
show some consideration for their feelings.

309
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Han Jiwon won't be going back today.

310
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,400
I don't need to listen to
your pointless nonsense.

311
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Get lost.

312
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,220
You punk, are you looking for trouble?

313
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Han Jiwon.

314
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,600
Say something, will you? Are you
just going to stand there like a statue?

315
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Senior.

316
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,600
Just like Jung-woo said.

317
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,499
I'm not going back today.

318
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
So I have no intention of agreeing
to your unreasonable request.

319
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,940
Don't come to me for
help again in the future.

320
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,200
All the times I helped you before,
it was out of my own goodwill.

321
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,076
But that doesn't give you the right
to ask for whatever you want, senior.

322
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,500
Han Jiwon! If you're serving in the military
right now, that could be a huge problem.

323
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,680
Because I'm feeling generous
today, I'll let you off the hook.

324
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,120
Don't worry, senior.
I don't have to serve in the military.

325
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,620
Because I won the gold medal, I
don't have to serve in the military.

326
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Hello?

327
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,220
Am I causing trouble for you by doing this?

328
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,000
No, not at all. In fact, I
should be thanking you.

329
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
That feels amazing.

330
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Han Jiwon.

331
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,100
I was performing normally at first.

332
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,800
Every time I'm in front of you.

333
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,000
I always feel like I'm not myself.

334
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Kwon Jungwoo.

335
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
What do you mean?

336
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,300
Because...

337
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,500
I think I might be falling for you.

338
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
Do you like me?

339
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,480
(Next Episode)
Can you leave first?

340
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,400
I can't face you right now.

341
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,030
Did I do something wrong back then?

342
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
He's really popular, isn't he?

343
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,826
Since you're already here, why
not stay the night before you go?

344
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,400
