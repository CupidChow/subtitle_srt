1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,019
Wow! That's Han Jiwon…! Isn't that
the “Prince of Gymnastics” Han Jiwon?

2
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,509
- He's even cuter in person than on screen.
- How did he end up at our school?

3
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,861
Should we go talk to him? I
used to be such a huge fan of his.

4
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:45,700
Back then, if you weren't his fan,
you probably weren't even Korean.

5
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:53,338
Run, run, run!

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,699
What are you guys doing?

7
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,079
The ball keeps circling inside
the paint! You need to pass it out!

8
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,176
Pass the ball to the middle. Isn't it
easier to wait for a chance in the corner?

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,500
Even Jong-Soo caught up.
It's actually pretty simple, isn't it?

10
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:21,900
SeungJin, after you get in, go for a fast attack
at AAA. Then watch for the right moment here, okay?

11
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,400
Everyone, stay focused!

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

13
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,000
- Let's go!
- 1, 2, 3, let's go!

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Alright, focus.

15
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,700
"Ball Boy Tactics"
(Episode 1)

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
(Han Jiwon spotted at school!)

17
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:36,737
Haven't heard anything
about him, I thought he died.

18
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:38,799
If I go to Obok Uni will I also see Han Jiwon?
Then from today onwards my goal is Obok Uni.

19
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,597
But wasn't he doing gymnastics, why is he
suddenly in the Photography Department?

20
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,138
Does he think Photography is easy?

21
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,288
Let's stop this. If Han Jiwon sees
this, he'll be burdened, so let's not.

22
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,359
Now that I think about it, why did
he retire in the middle of everything?

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,300
When I announced my retirement.

24
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,300
The media just kept hounding me.

25
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,800
No one is willing to understand the truth.

26
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,800
A single truth is never enough.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
A hundred different guesses.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,500
Malicious rumors.

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Jiwon.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As long as you focus on your rehab, there's no
problem with coming back to compete as a player.

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,960
Give it a little more effort.

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
No need, Coach.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's all right.

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
I won't take back my decision to retire.

35
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,900
Maybe this is actually a good thing.

36
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
I already...

37
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Even though maybe I
could hold on until the end.

38
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,000
But I realized my own limits too soon.

39
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,840
If I can't be the best, then
there's no reason to keep going.

40
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,440
There's no reason left to stay.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's all gone.

42
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,399
When I was feeling down, something
else appeared to comfort me.

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,600
It was a camera.

44
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,700
No pressure to be perfect, and no
fear that one mistake means it's all over.

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Just like that.

46
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,100
Capture exactly what
you see in front of you.

47
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,500
That's already enough.

48
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,300
Don't be upset. You're not the
only one who makes mistakes.

49
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,600
You know the coach is
especially strict with you, right?

50
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,676
Let's go grab a drink! Just let it all out
while we're drinking and you'll feel better.

51
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,049
Where else can you find
a day as awesome as this?

52
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,200
Even the coach isn't here.

53
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,929
But why isn't there any training today?

54
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,579
Is it really because the
coach is mad at you?

55
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,860
Oh, come on, it's not like that.

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,800
Coach has something going on today—days like this
don't come around often. Let's go grab a drink!

57
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:57,037
Sure, let's go grab a drink!
That's how team spirit is built.

58
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:59,560
If you're not up for drinking, we
could hit up an internet café instead...

59
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,280
You guys go ahead and drink
without me. I'll sit this one out.

60
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,500
- That guy's off to do extra training again.
- He's really something else.

61
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,519
So are you going to the
internet café or out for drinks?

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,100
Hey, what's the point of
just the two of us drinking!

63
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,620
Let's just go play some games instead.

64
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Yang Enwu.

65
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,399
Have you been practicing enough?

66
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,300
Have you ever thought that we
lost today's match because of you?

67
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
It wasn't me!

68
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, Ji-Yuan, long time no see.
Can you come by the gym after class?

69
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Kwon Jungwoo.

70
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,220
I heard that the stands at the college basketball
court are packed with fans of Kwon Jungwoo.

71
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,139
Don't you feel uncomfortable
with all this attention and popularity?

72
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,500
I guess I'm just that good.

73
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,360
If you want to like me, then go for it.

74
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
I didn't know anyone was here, sorry.

75
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Are you Han Ji-yuan?

76
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Actually... I didn't mean to peek.

77
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm really, really sorry.

78
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,900
It's not because of me that your
practice got interrupted, right?

79
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,880
You're exactly the same
as how I saw you on TV.

80
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Uh... your face is a
little too close, isn't it?

81
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,219
I'll head out first.

82
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,600
Good luck with your practice!

83
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,100
You really haven't changed at all.

84
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
What's going on?

85
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,100
Why is Kwon Jungwoo here?

86
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
It takes ten minutes to
drive here from the school.

87
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
This is what you just
forgot to take with you.

88
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,100
Looks like you lose your stuff all the time. At
the very least, you should write your name on it.

89
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,500
Being rude? Well, the whole country
already knows about that, so whatever.

90
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,000
Not even a single thank you?
Isn't that a real problem?

91
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,300
Kwon Jungwoo... I'm really...

92
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,200
Thank you.

93
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Hey, what's up?

94
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm at the training center. If you
have something to say, just say it.

95
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,800
Take care.

96
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Ah... turns out I didn't
tie my shoelaces properly.

97
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,700
#DeliciousFriedChicken #BeerHouse

98
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,119
This freshman is the pride of
our photography department.

99
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,360
Let's give a round of applause.

100
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Alright, now...

101
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,300
Please start your self-introduction.

102
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Hello everyone, I'm Han Jiwon.

103
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,160
- Hey! I can't hear you.
- Your voice is too quiet.

104
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,340
- He's really good-looking!
- Everyone, please quiet down.

105
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Player Han Jiwon.

106
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,000
But calling him a player now
feels a bit strange, doesn't it?

107
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,900
He and I are in the same year.

108
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,256
You guys know what the
rookie's personality is like, right?

109
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,320
Don't keep pressuring him—let's just
quietly support him from the sidelines.

110
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,300
During this time, Han Jiwon can
think about what he wants to do.

111
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,000
You can show off a special talent, or
down the cocktails made by your teammates.

112
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,400
Chug! Chug! Chug!

113
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
When is the designated
driver going to arrive?

114
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,800
It's me... It's really me.

115
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
What?

116
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,400
There's a black sedan
next to the truck over there.

117
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
So what?

118
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,500
Green Garden Hill is right near
the entrance to Lakeside Park Road.

119
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,500
So... you want me to
drive you over there now?

120
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,700
You reek of alcohol, don't you?

121
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,300
Before we get there

122
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,200
I'll keep it a secret.

123
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's go.

124
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What the heck?

125
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
We're here.

126
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Wake up!

127
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Wake up, quick!

128
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,500
Did you just take a shower?

129
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,860
The scent of the body
wash is really nice...

130
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Do you like my scent?

131
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,700
Hello.

132
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,229
Kwon Jungwoo, where are you?

133
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,000
We're waiting for you in the
parking lot. Why aren't you here yet?

134
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Kwon Jungwoo?

135
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,209
- Oh! Someone asked me to be their designated driver.
- What's going on?

136
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,300
- Everyone's waiting for you.
- What's he doing here...?

137
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,000
Sir, did you sleep well?

138
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
No.

139
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,020
Since I was the one who drove you here,
does that mean I should call you my master?

140
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,200
You also do designated driving.

141
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Yeah.

142
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Han Jiwon.

143
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
You feel sorry for me?

144
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,000
How sorry are you?

145
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,000
I really am very sorry.

146
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,400
If you really feel that sorry.

147
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
Then I'll just drive your car away.

148
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
What?

149
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,700
It's all because I gave you a ride—now my
car is left all alone, freezing at school.

150
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
So that's why.

151
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Get out of the car.

152
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Wait a second.

153
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,860
You could've just refused
to give me a ride, you know.

154
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
So...

155
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,000
Why did you go out of
your way to give me a ride?

156
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,200
Our team won the match today.

157
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,660
Come pick it up at the
basketball court tomorrow.

158
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
I'm heading out.

159
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,800
May I ask who you're here to see?

160
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,700
Kwon Jungwoo...

161
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,200
Hey, who are you looking for?

162
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,670
I'm here to see Kwon Jungwoo.

163
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,000
Sorry, could you call him for me?

164
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,099
Kwon Jungwoo just left.

165
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,000
You can wait here for a bit.
He should be back soon...

166
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
You're Han Jiwon!

167
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,700
I'm a huge fan of yours.

168
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,040
I even downloaded all the high-definition
match videos to collect them.

169
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,120
Could you give me your autograph?

170
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Hey! You're making him feel pressured.

171
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Do you know Han Jiwon?

172
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Yeah.

173
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,800
- He's my boss.
- Boss?

174
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,970
Oh! The landlord! Han
Jiwon is your landlord?

175
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:53,000
If there's nothing else, hurry
up and get back to practice.

176
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
To be honest.

177
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,229
Han Jiwon is right here.

178
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,300
Can we wait a little
longer before going in?

179
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Why?

180
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,339
Wait for me, I'll come find you in a bit.

181
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,740
Han, I'll trouble you
for your autograph later.

182
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,000
Sign right here, hahaha.

183
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,560
I really appreciated
what you did yesterday.

184
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Just like before.

185
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,000
Excuse me... When can
I get my car keys back?

186
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,000
Which one is the real you?

187
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,620
I don't understand what you're saying.

188
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,520
Is the real you just someone who only says
nice things, or gets all flustered otherwise?

189
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Or maybe...

190
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,000
Is making anyone be your designated
driver, no matter who it is, the real you?

191
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Hmm... The one who's awkward
and at a loss is probably more like me.

192
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,660
I was actually being
sarcastic with you just now.

193
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,100
The strange thing is.

194
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,480
Whenever I see you, I always think...

195
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,640
Do you ever feel like shamelessly
saying something self-important, too?

196
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

197
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,000
I just look lost, and it
makes people feel a bit down.

198
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I just can't have as good
a personality as you do.

199
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,300
- That's exactly what I mean.
- Hm?

200
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,054
In moments like that, instead
of saying “I'm sorry,”

201
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:01,748
it's better to just say, “Hand over the car
keys and get out of the car, now!”

202
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
Thank you for thinking of me.

203
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Here you go.

204
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,151
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

205
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:14,376
If you're going to keep
apologizing, let's just stop here.

206
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
You might as well add
apologizing to your list of specialties.

207
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Like excessive apologizing.

208
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Like this?

209
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,540
It'd be a little weird to
add that to my list of skills.

210
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,000
Good point.

211
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,781
Besides that, you have
plenty of other skills, don't you?

212
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Like folding towels really neatly?

213
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,500
Do I have any special skills?

214
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,500
I wash dishes really clean
and fold towels super neatly.

215
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,700
Blinking really fast.

216
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,440
Keep giving it your all from here on out!

217
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Ah.

218
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,700
I finished all the gum in the car.

219
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,620
Looks like there isn't much left.

220
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,300
Let's just call this
your driver's fee, okay?

221
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So awkward...

222
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello, Jiwon.

223
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,700
This drink is for you.

224
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, it's alright, you
don't have to be so polite.

225
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I just wanted to get you a
drink, and it wasn't expensive.

226
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
I bought it at the concession stand
up front. Would you like to take it?

227
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,400
Thank you.

228
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,800
And we're in the same year, so you
don't have to be so formal with me.

229
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,876
You took the Introduction to Architecture
general education course, right?

230
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,000
I took it too.

231
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
We'll be seeing each
other a lot from now on.

232
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh, okay...

233
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,500
Hmm, no, it's not.

234
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,300
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your meal, see you next time.

235
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,600
Should I have said thank you one more time?

236
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm screwed.

237
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,940
Is it just another coincidence?

238
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Probably stalking, right?

239
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
What?

240
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,560
That might be fun, but I don't like it.

241
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,500
Aren't you going to apologize this time?

242
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,920
If you're going to keep haunting
me like this, never leaving my side.

243
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,900
Why not just apply to be a ball boy?

244
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Ball boy?

245
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,300
For us, this way.

246
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,520
Wouldn't that be more convenient?

247
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,959
(Next Episode)
Aren't you pretty close with him?

248
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,860
Say something.

249
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,941
Rather than calling us friends, it's
more like a master-servant relationship.

250
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm not interested in guys.

251
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,500
I guess so.

252
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,808
No, that's not what I meant.

253
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:59,980
So you mean I wouldn't
act like this around girls?

254
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
It's only because of
you that I act this way.
