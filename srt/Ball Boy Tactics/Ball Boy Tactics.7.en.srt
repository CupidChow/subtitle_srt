Hello?

7
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,930
Is the photo-taking going well?

8
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,650
Yes.

9
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,630
I'm taking a break now.

10
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:11,360
What's up?

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,940
I called because
I wanted to hear your voice.

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,880
You're so hard to reach.

13
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,900
I was taking photos.

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,830
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,980
Who did you go out with today?

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,430
Did you meet the friends
you met yesterday?

17
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,560
No.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,620
They didn't come.

19
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,270
Instead, Hyoseok is here.

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,789
Oh, that...

21
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,570
that one who took a selfie with you.

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,610
Right?

23
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,539
Yes.

24
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,360
That's right.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,700
He's nice and handsome.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,080
Oh.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,509
Jiwon.

28
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,580
You must be happy to be
on a date with a handsome guy.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,350
Gosh. What date?

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,340
That's not it.

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,700
Then Jiwon...

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,870
Hmm?

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,400
When will we meet again?

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,620
I see you every day.

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,630
Huh?

36
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,870
That's a good thing about
you being famous.

37
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,930
I can find out what you've been up to
by searching you up.

38
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,580
Hey, how is that meeting?

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,160
I miss you.

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm going crazy cause I want to
touch you so bad.

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,350
Seems like you're fine
with just looking at photos.

42
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,870
Actually,

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,920
it's not enough for me too...

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,329
Hey, Kwon Jeongwu. Come over quickly!

45
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,760
I was just enjoying this...

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,230
I have to go.

47
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,110
It's okay.

48
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,410
Go ahead.

49
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,610
Take nice photos till I'm back.

50
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,110
Don't cheat on me.

51
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,040
Bye.

52
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,540
Okay.

53
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,940
Darn it.

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,180
This training is too much.

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,570
Let's ask the coach to
change the training plan.

56
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,100
That's why I told you to
strengthen your stamina.

57
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,900
Don't complain all the time.

58
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,760
Do you think a normal athlete can run
as fast as you?

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,620
Your lung capacity is too strong.

60
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,120
By the way...

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,950
Is Jeongwu okay?

62
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,880
I think his ankle is getting worse.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,760
It's okay. The treatment went well today.

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm just telling you just in case but

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,829
don't tell Jiwon.

66
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,930
Why? A friend got injured,
of course we've got to tell him.

67
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,250
To save trouble.
If Jiwon finds out,

68
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,050
Jeongwu will feel burdened too.

69
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,250
Don't tell me...

70
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,400
You like Jiwon?

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,320
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,340
You seem

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,420
worried about Jiwon.

74
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,790
It's not like that.

75
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm just afraid they'd

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,060
worry about each other and feel pressured.

77
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,140
Both of them are the type to
overthink things.

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,670
That's true...

79
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,050
But... Who do you like?

80
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,990
Why’d you ask that all of a sudden?

81
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,000
Well.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,530
I'm just curious if
there's someone you like.

83
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,190
There is.

84
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,760
There is one. Well...

85
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,290
I don't know.

86
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,110
I don't know if I like them or not.

87
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,400
That happens.

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,350
Now that you mention it, I'm so curious.

89
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,460
Who is it?

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,520
It's a secret.

91
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,230
Why do all of you have so many secrets?

92
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,700
Just tell me!

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,030
In the future.

94
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,730
I'll tell you in the future.

95
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,110
Hey.

96
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,640
Your shoelaces are untied.

97
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,990
Whatever.

98
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Thank you.

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,580
Mm.

100
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,730
Are you out of your mind?

101
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,350
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,930
You came all the way here
to prepare for the season,

103
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,290
but you got hurt on the first day.

104
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,950
What are you thinking?

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,590
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,090
-What's the problem?
-Nothing.

107
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,650
Are you dating someone?

108
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,590
Fine. Although dating is your business,

109
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,720
we have to separate personal and work.

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,100
This is a team competition.

111
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,420
You should know how important
this season is.

112
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,430
Don't bring
personal emotions to the court.

113
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,910
Answer me.

114
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,380
Yes.

115
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,640
Get some rest.

120
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,230
Yes.

121
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,640
How are Mom and you?

122
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,610
What about those who came to our house?

123
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,920
Well, this is the countryside.

124
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,350
It's hard to find us.

125
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,680
We're fine. It's gotten quiet.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,710
Are you okay?

127
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,700
Yes.

128
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,010
It's gotten quiet here too.

129
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,300
That's good.

130
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,040
Jiwon, eat your meals on time.

131

132
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,450
we'll come visit you too.

133

Okay.

134
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,530
I'm always sorry and grateful.

135
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,090
We're more sorry.

136
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,530
No.

137

138

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,070
I thought I got used to things like this.

183
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,320
Why do I...

184
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,690

Hey!

188
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,660
What's going on?

189
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,700
It's all over the forum now.

190
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,090
Former national player Han Jiwon

191
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,220
and varsity basketball star Kwon Jeongwu
are secretly dating...

192
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,860
That's nonsense.

193
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,720
How could they believe such news?

194
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,320
How's Jiwon?

195
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,260
I can't reach him.

196
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,060
He didn't answer our calls either.

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,090
My Jiwon...

198
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,090
wouldn't believe such trash news
and get upset, right?

199
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,890
Jeongwu is a victim too.

200
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,380
Watch what you say.

201
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,530
It's not true anyway.

202
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,010
He's not one to play not as well
just cause he's dating.

203
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,780
He's still practicing
even with a swollen ankle.

204
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,790
Huh?

205
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,530
Speaking of, your ankle is sprained.

206
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,320
Is this the time to joke around?

207
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm worried.

208
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,150
I'm sure the coach thinks it's not true,

209
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,830
but there are so many eyes watching.

210
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,760
I'm afraid he'll reach out to you
one on one, Jeongwu.

211
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,420
It won't be just the coach contacting him.

212
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,450
Hey.

213
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,280
Don't cause trouble to Jiwon.

214
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,470
Go and clarify it.

215
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,830
As long as you say you have a girlfriend,

216
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,550
this would be dissolved.

217
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,070
Don't worry about it.

218
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,390
He'll take care of it.

Why didn't you call me right away?

226
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,530
I dropped my phone.

227
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,880
I just borrowed Hyoseok's phone to call you.

228
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,880
It'd be difficult to contact you then.

229
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,740
Well...

230

Are you with

231
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,740
Hyoseok now?

232
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,480
Yes.

233
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,530
I just borrowed his phone for a short while.

235
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,300
Should I just leave my practice and go back?

236
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,460
What?

237
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,800
Should I go back, drink some coffee,

238
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,280
and run after you?

239
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,080
It's not like my skills will deteriorate
with one week less of practice.

240

That's true,

241
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,570
but Jeongwu...

242
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,080
I'm afraid you'll just leave.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,910
Even without me by your side,

244
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,780

250
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,330

Call me when your phone is fixed.

256
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,180
Okay.

257
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,200
What are you doing?

258
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,390
Nothing.

259
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,480
I don't think it's nothing.

260
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,600
Something's up.

261
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,050
Why do you work so hard?

262
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,690
Well...

263
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,140
I just feel that I have to.

264
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,920
What are you anxious about?

265
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,470
Recently,

266
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
I've been kind of out of my mind.

267
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,650
The injury is one aspect.

268
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,980
My skills are deteriorating too.

269
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,630
Isn't it more difficult for you to act
like nothing's wrong?

270
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,170
I have to endure it.

271
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,280
Why?

272
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,400
Fine.

273
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,530
But Jeongwu,

274
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,300
do you really think enduring it

275
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,650
is for the better of the team?

276
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,500
Well...

277
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,170
I don't quite know now either.

278
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,580
I won't say anything to you.

279
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,800
If you insist,

280
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,980
I'll endure it with you.

281
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,680
But it's not just about waiting and enduring.

282
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,590
We could go further,

283
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,390
or we could get too close

284
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,850
and things become blurry.

285
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,500
If we keep waiting like this,

286
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,200
we might not know what we want in the future.

287
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,910
You know that.

288
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,370
Once you start to think too much,

289
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,610
misunderstandings and suspicions
will accumulate.

290
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,470
Then, there will be no progress.

291
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,860
Hey. Just do it your way.

292
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,400
Don't be so upset. It's not like you.

293
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,010
What? Weren't you comforting me?

294
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,240
It's no fun to do that too much.

295
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,820
I think humor can save the world.

296
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,780
But without Byeon Seungjin, it's not quite there.

297
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,390
That dude would only make things chaotic.

298
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,650
He's so annoying that I can't even think.

299
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,470

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,520
Yeah. I'm serious.

306
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,630
I know.

307
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,790
Then take a good rest.

308
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,800

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,830
To call me as soon as your phone is fixed.

360
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,400
So I was going to call you.

361
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,250
Shouldn't you tell me

362
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,690
before that clarification post
was uploaded?

363
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,190
If it's about Hyoseok,

364
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,670
don't worry about it.

365
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,300
As you know, he's just my friend.

366
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,040
Jiwon.

367
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm the same too.

368
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,960
Huh?

369
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,080
I'm saying...

370
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,390
in front of others, I'm also just your friend.

371
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,410
Just close friends.

372
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,300
Yeah...

373
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,110
If we were just friends,

374
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,020
you wouldn't be so upset.

375
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,120
What?

376
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,360
If we were just friends,

377
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,170
you wouldn't mind who I'm dating.

378
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,850
And I wouldn't have to say things like

379
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,980
you have a girlfriend.

380
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,420
What?

381
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,990
Jeongwu.

382
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,410
I...

383
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,900
always imagine us breaking up.

384
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,920
What do you want?

385
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,960
Do you want

386
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,290
to make our relationship public?

387
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,060
Or you just want

388
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,740
me gone from your side?

389
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,830
If this is what you want,
I'll do just that.

390
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,420
If this is really what you want,

391
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,010
I can do it.

392
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,090
You've been dating girls all along,

393
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,400
it must be hard to date a guy, right?

394
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,110
It's all my fault.

395
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,970
I'm sorry, Jeongwu.

396
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,920
I know I shouldn't have said that.

397
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,550
Jiwon.

398
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,640
Do you want me to
date a girl as soon as possible?

399
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,910
No.

400
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,090
That's not it.

401
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,070
I don't want to see me ruin your career.

402
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,650
What?

403
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,490
To an athlete,
reputation is very important.

404
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,720
I know how hard you've worked
to get where you are.

405
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,220
I don't want your efforts
to go down the drain

406
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,020
because of me.

407
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,700
What about my feelings?

408
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,490
Can't you see I'm hurt?

409
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,760
I get hurt too.

410
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,150
Why do you want to
carry this burden alone?

411
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,140
Can't you just tell me?

412
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,910
We're going through this together, Jiwon.

413
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,020
If it's too hard for you,

414
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,880
you can be selfish to me.

415
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,620
I can bear my own suffering.

416
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,660
Don't always feel sorry for me.

417
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,440
Don't try to understand me.

418
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,770
You just need to be greedy.

419
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,200
Do you hate me?

420
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,340
No.

421
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,280
It's not like that.

422
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,380
Let's...

423
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,200
give each other some time to think about it.

[In the next episode]

425
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,950
You've been so sensitive lately.

426
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,470
Is it because your relationship
isn't going well?

427
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,370
Stop going around
talking about others' privacy.

428
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,870
Then prove it to me.

429
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,070
What?

430
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,830
I don't know how much you like me.

431
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,460
I'm dating Jeongwu.

432
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,710
You must have seduced Jiwon.

433
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,180
I seduced him first.

434
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,440
Are you nervous?

435
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,910
Yes.

436
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,400
It's my first time.
