1
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm about to lose my mind.

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,300
Good thing it was just a dream...

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
"Ball Boy Tactics"
(Episode 4)

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,080
Are you coming down with a cold?

5
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,476
Do you just walk around
your house without a shirt on?

6
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,476
What are you talking about?
You're seriously messed up!

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Hey! I bet you walk around
your house completely naked!

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I was born with a perfect body.

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,759
Of course I have to show it off.

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,260
Ah, you really are a lunatic!

11
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,906
If Jiwon knew what kind of person you are,
would she still want to be friends with you?

12
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,400
Hey, what are you talking about?
My relationship with Jiwon is something truly sacred.

13
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,690
Why are you coughing so much?

14
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,746
If you keep coughing like that,
do you need to go to the hospital?

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,900
Could it be the flu?

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
You really need to get some rest.

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Wait up for me!

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
What are you doing here?

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,500
Uh... I was just about to head home.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,300
- At this hour? Don't you have class?
- Because... I'm not feeling too well.

21
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
What's wrong?

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
Is there a specific spot that hurts?

23
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,720
Is it your heart that hurts?

24
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,700
Then shouldn't you go see a doctor?

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,200
No need, I'll just go
home and get some rest.

26
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,799
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,119
Do you want me to give you a ride?

28
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,439
You drove here, right?

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
No!

30
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
No, that's not it...

31
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,140
I can head back on my own.

32
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,749
Shouldn't you be heading to class?

33
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,800
Hurry up, you're going to be late.

34
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah... but leaving someone who's
sick behind just doesn't feel right.

35
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
It's nothing.

36
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Can you go ahead first?

37
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,500
I can't face you right now.

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Alright...

39
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Got it.

40
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,500
Ah, I'm really about to lose it.

41
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,700
Why did I treat him like that?

42
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
Did I do something wrong back then?

43
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
I'm asking you.

44
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,800
Have you ever had someone
close to you show interest in you?

45
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,700
- What?
- Just what it sounds like.

46
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,400
Has anyone ever... shown interest in you?

47
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
Does it mean they like you?

48
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,980
Does that happen with the same sex too...?

49
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
No way!

50
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,600
After all, there's still something a bit...
different between people of the same sex.

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, I guess so...

52
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,000
It's really hard to imagine
two men being together.

53
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,700
Hey there!

54
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,940
I bought some medicine and porridge for you.
Go ahead and eat.

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey, are you feeling okay?

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,920
You should feel better after taking
your medicine and getting some sleep.

57
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh my gosh!

58
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,719
Han Jiwon rarely posts new photos on IG.

59
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,900
Really? I want to see it too.

60
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
(Kim Hyoseok: Honored teammate
Han Jiwon, I'm always available!)

61
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,690
Looks like Jiwon has made a new friend. That's great!

62
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,600
What? I've never even
made it to Han Jiwon's feed!

63
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
Who's this guy now?

64
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,600
I don't know. But he's
actually a handsome guy.

65
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,700
No way.

66
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm going to get a photo with Jiwon
tomorrow and post it on IG, too.

67
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,900
- Han Jiwon is really popular!
- What are you talking about!

68
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,460
Our Jiwon is the nation's
favorite grandson, you know.

69
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Stop talking nonsense.

70
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,589
After being the “Nation's Golden Grandchild,”
now Han Jiwon is the “Nation's Son.”

71
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,820
His popularity is off the charts!

72
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,100
Our father, mother, aunt, grandfather
and even distant relatives like Han Jiwon.

73
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,700
- Uh... what's wrong?
- Why does it feel so rough...

74
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,176
Don't be so harsh when you're talking in front of Han
Jiwon's superfans… He'll get all sensitive and hurt again.

75
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,760
You don't have to keep bringing him up!

76
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
What's going on?

77
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,600
Why is it that every time Han Jiwon
gets mentioned, he reacts that strongly?

78
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,880
Hey bro, is your exam prep going smoothly?

79
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,539
I've been working really hard.
Same for you, right?

80
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,580
Of course, I'm working
hard on my preparations too.

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Hello?

82
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Jiwon! Are you outside?

83
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,900
Yeah, I'm outside right now.

84
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Is something wrong?

85
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,300
Ah! That's good to hear.

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,200
If possible, can you come
to our dorm right now?

87
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,200
So sudden? What happened?

88
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,000
That guy...

89
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:43,710
Ever since he caught that cold,
he's been working hard to recover...

90
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,475
Even his mood seems to have been affected.

91
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
A cold?

92
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
Did Jungwoo catch a cold?

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Oh! It's nothing, really. But he does
seem to be having a tough time right now.

94
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
We were suddenly called in for training.

95
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
- I'm counting on you, then.
- Training right now?

96
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,380
Jiwon, where are you going?

97
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Ah, something urgent just came
up that I need to take care of.

98
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Sorry.

99
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Can you go ahead first?

100
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,300
I can't face you right now.

101
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Should I go in?

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
(Password: 1818
He's counting on you to look after him.)

103
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,381
Looks like you still remembered
to take your meds, right?

104
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why are you here today too...?

105
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,500
Are you okay?

106
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Sorry.

107
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,100
I thought I was dreaming.

108
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
Did I startle you by
showing up out of the blue?

109
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
Eun Oh asked me to come take care of you.

110
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,300
You don't have a fever, do you?

111
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
Your hand is so cold.

112
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Does it hurt?

113
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Huh?

114
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
The two of us, just being
here together like this.

115
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,800
It doesn't seem so bad after all.

116
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
It's just...

117
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
I can really feel it.

118
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Now it's just the two of us together.

119
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
What?

120
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
I honestly thought something
was about to happen to me.

121
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What I'm saying is...

122
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Comfort me.

123
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
How?

124
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Just say whatever you want.

125
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Yeah, nothing special really.

126
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,500
I got up at eight this morning,
then went to school for class.

127
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,820
When I was thinking about
which assignment to work on.

128
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
And then I ran into you.

129
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,100
Then I went to a café with Hyoseok.

130
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,000
- Then I got the call and came over.
- Hyoseok?

131
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,100
Yeah, he's a classmate from
the photography department.

132
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Are you close with him?

133
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,980
He's probably my best
friend in the department.

134
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,240
Are you closer to him than you are to me?

135
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
- What?
- Are you closer to him than you are to me?

136
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,060
There's really nothing to
compare here, is there?

137
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,740
Looks like you can't answer.
I guess I'm not your number one, am I?

138
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,400
- I guess I'll have to keep working harder for it.
- No, that's not what I meant!

139
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,500
What about besides friends?

140
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Is there someone you like?

141
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,300
I've never really thought about dating.

142
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,500
You sure sound calm saying that.

143
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,000
I think I'd better head out first.

144
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,976
I've been talking to you so much
even though you're not feeling well.

145
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,500
You woke me up, and now you just
want to walk away like nothing happened?

146
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,060
Since you're already here, why
not stay the night before you go?

147
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,500
What are you talking about!

148
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,700
Remember to eat your porridge,
and don't forget to take your medicine!

149
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Get well soon.

150
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
See you.

151
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Ah!

152
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
I must be losing my mind.

153
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,100
Did you take your medicine?

154
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,100
Are you feeling any better?

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Are you asleep?

156
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Is something up?

157
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,800
I want to hear your voice.

158
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,200
It's rare for you to reach out to me first.

159
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Do you have class tomorrow?

160
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,320
What time do you need to go to school?

161
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Class... Yeah, I have class at 9
tomorrow, so I need to head out early.

162
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,000
I see...

163
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I'll be at your place around
8:30, I'll give you a ride.

164
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,200
There's no need to do that.

165
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
I can just take the bus.

166
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,380
- We'll be there soon.
- If I give you a ride, we'll get there in no time too. Alright, see you tomorrow morning!

167
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Alright...

168
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Hello.

169
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,700
Are you feeling better now?

170
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
As you can see.

171
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
But.

172
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,248
Didn't you say you'd wear
your hat less from now on?

173
00:16:59,272 --> 00:16:59,880
Did I?

174
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,300
That's how I remember it.

175
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,580
Still planning to keep
wearing it all the time?

176
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,800
Can't you go without wearing it?

177
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Why?

178
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,500
There's a height difference between us.

179
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,900
If you keep wearing it.

180
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,740
Then I won't be able
to see your face clearly.

181
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,980
You're worried that not wearing
it might cause trouble, right?

182
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,600
Yeah, a little.

183
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Hmm... If someone
acts rude like last time...

184
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Just tell me.

185
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
So thoughtful of you.

186
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,800
I only act this way with you.

187
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
We're running late, let's hurry!

188
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
Thanks for giving me a ride.

189
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,600
Do you have any plans after class today?

190
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Hmm... I need to find a location
for my photography assignment.

191
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
A shooting location?

192
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,400
So is it something like
an outdoor photo shoot?

193
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Do we have to drive somewhere far?

194
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,300
No, it's not that serious.

195
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,340
A place like a gymnasium
would be good enough.

196
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,300
Is somewhere like a gymnasium good enough?

197
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,100
Yeah, that's right.

198
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,539
I'll just find it myself...

199
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,100
See you in a bit, then.

200
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,080
Hey! Where did Kwon
Jungwoo disappear to again?

201
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I got it! He's got a girlfriend, hasn't he!

202
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
What?

203
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,340
You're making things up again.

204
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,700
Not at all. He's just been really hard to reach
lately, and he disappears right after training.

205
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,800
Are you... jealous?

206
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,340
What nonsense are you talking about!

207
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Hey, stay still.

208
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Thanks!

209
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Hey.

210
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,943
How would someone as clueless about
romance even notice something like that?

211
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:06,970
Huh? I am not clueless!

212
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,330
You talk like you've actually
had a girlfriend before.

213
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,500
Forget it! Let Kwon Jungwoo
handle his own love life.

214
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,100
- Let's deepen our friendship.
- What friendship are you talking about!

215
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,700
There's nothing between us but competition.

216
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,220
Why don't you take a
look at yourself right now?

217
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,100
If Han Jiwon knew how childish you're being,
he'd definitely be disappointed in you.

218
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,500
No way, my Jiwon would never be disappointed
in me over something this trivial.

219
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,400
- We have... a special connection.
- Fine, if you say so.

220
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,100
Let's play another set!
Today is our showdown!

221
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Yeah, bring it on! You're done for today!

222
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,761
- Hey! Just follow my lead.
- Ah! Stop bossing me around all the time.

223
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,930
That's how I remember it.
Can't you leave without wearing it?

224
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,000
If you keep wearing it like
that, I can't really see your face.

225
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
You're here.

226
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Finally took off the hat.

227
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,500
Yeah, what are you doing?

228
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Competing.

229
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
What?

230
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,020
I took the whole day off, so
now I need to tidy things up.

231
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,049
Can I ask you something?

232
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,050
What's up?

233
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Your jersey number.

234
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Why number 17?

235
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,120
Does it have any special meaning?

236
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,920
It doesn't really have any special meaning.

237
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,700
It's just the number of
strokes in my name, that's all.

238
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,800
Wow! I totally didn't expect that.
Did you decide that yourself?

239
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,000
It was my ex-girlfriend
who picked it for me.

240
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Oh, really...

241
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,500
How many strokes are there in your name?

242
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Eighteen.

243
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
That's my next number.

244
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Yeah.

245
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Actually...

246
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,300
I'm not even sure who decided
my jersey number for me.

247
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
That's how it is.

248
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
She doesn't mean anything to me anymore.

249
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Isn't it a waste of time to
keep dwelling on the past?

250
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Right?

251
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Feels pretty heartless.

252
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,280
I don't think it's that easy for me to do.

253
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,700
Breaking up means it's over.

254
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Isn't it even more painful
to keep clinging on?

255
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I see.

256
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000
Wow! Thanks to your help,
we finished tidying up so quickly.

257
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Shouldn't you be taking pictures right now?

258
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,280
I'll take care of the rest.

259
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm going to take a shower first.

260
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Take your time.

261
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,600
Alright, thank you.

262
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,840
Are you done taking the photos?

263
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Almost done.

264
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Really?

265
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
Why did you choose the gym?

266
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,900
I feel like this theme best represents me.

267
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Is it this one?

268
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,560
So what does this basketball mean?

269
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,960
Because there was no one to photograph,
I had to use a basketball instead.

270
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,960
So this basketball represents me, then?

271
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Maybe.

272
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,300
Sitting around every day
without getting any exercise.

273
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
Isn't it boring?

274
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
A little bit.

275
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
So...

276
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,740
I still go for a run every early morning.

277
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Wanna have a match?

278
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,660
Loser buys dinner, how about that?

279
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,740
How could I possibly beat
you, a basketball player?

280
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,220
As long as you score one
point within the time limit.

281
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
You win, then.

282
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,669
Are you giving me too much credit?

283
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,430
If you're confident,
come and give it a try.

284
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Oh, looks like you're
pretty good at basketball.

285
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,280
- If you let your guard down, you might just lose.
- Are you talking about me?

286
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,300
All I need is to score one point?

287
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Yeah.

288
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Give it your best shot.

289
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,600
You...

290
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,900
Didn't I tell you not to underestimate me?

291
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,700
You owe me dinner tonight.

292
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This is the first time
I've seen you this happy.

293
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So that's how fierce a gold
medalist's competitive spirit can be.

294
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Are you leaving?

295
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Han Jiwon.

296
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You still have no
thoughts of dating at all?

297
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,300
Wait! Why are you doing
this all of a sudden...?

298
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,400
It's not sudden at all.

299
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,000
You probably know too, right...?

300
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I like you.

301
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,826
(Next Episode)
I think you need some time to think about it.

302
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,900
- One month...
- One month!

303
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
I'm gay.

304
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
I like guys.

305
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,280
- What do you want to say?
- Do you want to go see a movie together?

306
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,060
- Want to kiss?
- Ah!

307
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,300
So, finally, please say a few words to Han Jiwon.

308
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
Only two days left.

309
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
"Ball Boy Tactics"
