1
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,140
Is it just another coincidence?

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,360
He's probably been following me, right?

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Stalking?

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,703
If you're going to keep haunting me like this,
you might as well just apply to be a ball boy.

5
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,400
That way, for us.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,220
Wouldn't that be even more convenient?

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
Yeah...

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,900
I've been hiding out these past few days.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,600
As long as I don't run into him, all
that crap won't happen again, right?

10
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
"Ball Boy Tactics"
(Episode 2)

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Bro.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,544
Is this really a classroom?

13
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:47,918
There are way too many people here.

14
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,325
Hey, keep it down.
This is really embarrassing.

15
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:52,725
Hey, where did he go?

16
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,300
Go ask Kwon Jungwoo.

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,100
Where should I sit?

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,500
Han Jiwon, are you taking
this general education class too?

19
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,340
Then I'll sit next to you.

20
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,435
We've been running
into each other a lot lately.

21
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,600
Han Jiwon, do you remember me?
I'm Eun Oh.

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,700
I was your classmate at
Sanquan Elementary, remember?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Eun-Wu?

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
It was back then.

25
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,100
Are you Yang Eun Oh, the one who
lived at the entrance of our street?

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,900
Jerk! It's me!

27
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:36,375
See?

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,900
I told you, we were classmates in primary school.
We actually got along pretty well back then.

29
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,100
Ah, how did this happen?

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,965
Do you really know this guy?

31
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:51,900
Judging by his expression, it looks like
he just remembered something unpleasant.

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah... it's not like that.

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,300
In my memory, Eun-Wu was really short.

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,200
But a kind person.

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,800
Haha, you're absolutely right.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Hey! Kwon Jungwoo

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,943
Yang Eun Oh is acting all
chummy in front of your friends.

38
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,000
Say something.

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,880
Rather than calling us friends, it's
more like a master-servant relationship.

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,173
You're really something—you
didn't even tell me you know Jiwon.

41
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,374
My fragile heart is shattered.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,818
I'm honestly your biggest fan, so
whenever you're treated unfairly...

43
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:31,200
I was so heartbroken, I
ended up in the hospital.

44
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,806
He's the one who's hurting.
How bad could it be for you?

45
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,838
You just don't get it! I can't hear you,
I can't hear you! That's just how it is.

46
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,485
It's truly an honor to
be able to sit next to you.

47
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,486
The athlete, Han Jiwon.

48
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
The professor is here.

49
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,076
Seems like the students from the art department
and sports department are getting along well.

50
00:03:56,101 --> 00:04:00,181
For this general education class, why don't we
just let the students there form their own groups?

51
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,980
Alright, let's get started with the class.

52
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,600
There are four main elements.

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,032
Is this a shared choice we need to
make in our daily lives and activities?

54
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,700
Let's take an example.

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,439
Like going to the bathroom.

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
That's really interesting.

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,900
Does it not bother you
to be stared at like that?

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,200
I never thought about
becoming someone like him.

59
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
But.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,040
Why does Kwon Jungwoo give
me a completely different feeling?

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,340
We'll continue class
after a ten-minute break.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,593
- I'm heading out.
- Do you want me to tell the professor?

63
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:07,700
I'll tell him myself.

64
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,899
Why did you finish my drink?!

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,900
- I'll buy you another one tomorrow.
- Alright, forget it then.

66
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:25,351
Don't you have something
to say to Kwon Jungwoo?

67
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,016
You kept staring at
his back during class.

68
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:32,973
Do you have something you want to say?

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Uh... it's just...

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,800
- Uh...
- If you've got nothing to say, I'm heading out.

71
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,026
Every year on your birthday, there's
always a coffee truck ready for you, right?

72
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,614
I chipped in too.

73
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:17,615
How much did you chip in?

74
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:21,400
Let's not ask about that—I don't
want to put any pressure on my Jiwon.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,150
Thank you. Thanks to you, I get
to enjoy delicious coffee every year.

76
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,724
When's your birthday?

77
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,300
I'll celebrate for you in the future, too.

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
It's this very moment.

79
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:37,600
My birthday, from now on,
is March 24th at 9:03 PM.

80
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,928
Come have a drink.

81
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:44,100
Wow, time really flies—it's
already past nine o'clock.

82
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,840
Hey, if Kwon Jungwoo comes, how about heading
to the internet café for the afterparty?

83
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:51,568
- You're here.
- Sorry, something came up and I got held up.

84
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,389
Hey, Kwon Jungwoo, how about heading
to the internet café for the afterparty?

85
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,800
Jiwon, you can go too, right?

86
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,500
I need to head back early. I probably
won't make it to the after-party, sorry.

87
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,500
Are you heading home this early
because you've got something going on?

88
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,600
It's nothing, really.

89
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,820
I have a major class to
attend tomorrow morning.

90
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,466
Jiwon, you're really dedicated.

91
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,926
He's been like that
since elementary school.

92
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:21,800
He's never forgotten to bring anything,
so all the teachers really like him.

93
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Is that so?

94
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,380
Anyway... if you work this hard, you
can definitely achieve any goal you set.

95
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,276
Oh right, didn't you say you were going to
enter the photography department's competition?

96
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,340
I think... you'll probably
win an award too, right?

97
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Photography contest?

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, they said first-year
students can join too.

99
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,215
I think it really suits you.

100
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:45,037
Hey! We already talked
about all this in our group chat.

101
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:48,576
You should check the chat history, or you'll
miss out when we talk about something important.

102
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,520
Maybe this is something
really important to you.

103
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,434
You only call me when you need
help with homework. It's so annoying.

104
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:54,988
Oh right, you only pay attention
to what your girlfriend says.

105
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,599
Well, she is my girlfriend.

106
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,720
So we're not together, then?

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Cheers!

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,900
So... you're still together.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,300
Did you drive here today?

110
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,100
Yeah, but it's fine. We'll just
call a designated driver later.

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
I had a drink today too,
that's not okay, right?

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,137
This time, I'll get a real professional designated
driver and even ask him to show his business card.

113
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:33,800
I'll make sure to get
the app ready here, too.

114
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,299
Stop talking about it.
And don't wander off later.

115
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,299
Alright.

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Why are you suddenly being so polite?

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,740
Looks like I'm the only one
who thinks we're close, huh?

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,644
But didn't we say we're meeting up to work on the
assignment? When are we actually going to start?

119
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:57,878
Ah, today feels like... well, more
like an orientation session, I guess.

120
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,108
The assignment on Western
architectural culture, we just

121
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,279
need to pick a day to do
research and it'll be done.

122
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,922
Even though we used the homework as an excuse
to meet up, now that everyone's here...

123
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,328
Let's just follow Jiwon's suggestion
and split up the work first.

124
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,544
Otherwise, we'll end up scrambling to finish the
assignment at the last minute again.

125
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:13,500
- I'll look up the info.
- I'll look it up too.

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,803
That just leaves organizing the
data and giving the presentation.

127
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,616
Looks like I need
to step out for a bit.

128
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,023
- My girlfriend just said she's here.
- What's up? Is she mad again?

129
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:23,024
I'll go take a look.

130
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:26,700
Hey, hey, before you leave, you guys need
to decide who's in charge of the report.

131
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Sigh... I'll do it.

132
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,500
- Is something up with his girlfriend?
- Hmm...

133
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,500
His girlfriend works at a company.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,606
But showing up all of a sudden at
this time— I can pretty much guess why.

135
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,487
She probably hasn't
been doing too well lately.

136
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,623
Feels like they've been
together for a long time, right?

137
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,392
It's actually only
been six months.

138
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,057
But to outsiders, it probably looks like
they've been together for five years already.

139
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:07,175
Yeah! It really feels
like it's been a long time.

140
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,485
So Jiwon, you don't have a girlfriend?

141
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:13,800
Hmm... I don't have a girlfriend, and
I'm not really interested in dating either.

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,617
Huh... What's that supposed to mean?

143
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,217
Could it be…

144
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
You've never dated?

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,310
Maybe it's because his
fans are just as shy as he is.

146
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:29,381
I'm guessing... even if a girl made the
first move, he probably wouldn't even notice.

147
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:31,779
I can't believe our player
has been single since birth.

148
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:35,459
What's with this strange mix of feeling a
little sorry for him but also oddly relieved?

149
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:36,700
What does that feel like?

150
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm going to the restroom.

151
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Turn right for the restroom,
then go up to the second floor...

152
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,600
They're dating— what's the
big deal about them kissing?

153
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Han Jiwon.

154
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Han Jiwon!

155
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
What's wrong?

156
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,300
Are you drunk or something?

157
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Came back from the
restroom and totally zoned out.

158
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,000
I think I'm a little tired.

159
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,915
I have to go.

160
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,500
Hey, we haven't even
gone to the next place yet.

161
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:19,884
Is your girlfriend
still mad at you?

162
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:23,295
Hey, if this keeps up, you
might as well just break up.

163
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,978
I'm out, see you at the dorm.

164
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,600
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

165
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Bye!

166
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
Kwon Jungwoo.

167
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Is he with his girlfriend?

168
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Am I going crazy?

169
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,300
I was never interested in women to begin
with, let alone men. Why is this happening?!

170
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,880
Am I really the kind of pervert who gets excited
by secretly watching other people make out?

171
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,360
Kwon Jungwoo is
staying out overnight today.

172
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,400
You majored in photography, but
I've never seen you with a camera.

173
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Is that so?

174
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I heard photography
isn't that easy to learn.

175
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,300
Do you need a bit of talent for it, too?

176
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,200
Not really, I'm not that good.

177
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,880
Looks like you're really
putting in the effort.

178
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,520
Put aside what you were doing
and take on a new challenge.

179
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
That's no easy feat.

180
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,000
Once I make up my mind,
I really focus on one thing.

181
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Han Jiwon.

182
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I...

183
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,760
Are you just as devoted to the other
person when you're in a relationship?

184
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
What?

185
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,260
Are you just as devoted to the other
person when you're in a relationship?

186
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I...

187
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,376
If we're talking about being persistent...
I actually tend to give up more easily.

188
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,600
But it's not always like that.

189
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,240
I've never even been in a relationship...

190
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,898
You've been busy with your
athletic career since you were a kid.

191
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
But I bet you've worked really
hard in this area too, right?

192
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,780
It just ended up that way
before I even realized it.

193
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,600
I told SeungJin and Eun Oh that
I've never been in a relationship.

194
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Should be fine, right?

195
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
That's strange.

196
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not like your eyes
look particularly fancy.

197
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
What about it?

198
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,140
I guess your girlfriend
must have a tough time too.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Ah! It's so late already.
I have to head out now.

200
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Han Jiwon.

201
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Bye.

202
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,000
Kwon Jungwoo's girlfriend.

203
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I finally understand now.

204
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Bye.

205
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,600
What I want to know.

206
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,100
Is not exactly Kwon
Jungwoo's girlfriend.

207
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,200
It's about him and his girlfriend.

208
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Should I stop running away?

209
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,800
Yang Eun Oh.

210
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,300
Hello?

211
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,700
You picked up really
fast. What are you up to?

212
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,900
Hmm...

213
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:05,700
I'll be downstairs at your place in thirty
minutes, coming to pick you up with the others.

214
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,700
- That's so sudden.
- It's time to work on our group project.

215
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Eun Oh...

216
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,200
It's already 9 PM.

217
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,028
What does nine o'clock have
to do with our group project?

218
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,386
Earning the credits is
what really matters, right?

219
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,740
Anyway, get ready and come
downstairs in thirty minutes.

220
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Hey, Han Jiwon.

221
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,601
Jungwoo is still at school. He'll come straight
over after he finishes his self-training.

222
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,700
Oh, I see.

223
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,021
Are you doing the assignment at school?

224
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,600
Nope, I actually found a
great spot to do my homework.

225
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,767
Is Kwon Jungwoo okay with it too?

226
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,400
He's been training all this
time—he must be exhausted.

227
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,660
It was Jung-woo who suggested
that everyone should meet up.

228
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,581
He finally broke up
with his girlfriend, haha.

229
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,900
How about we let him
talk about it himself, okay?

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Oh... so they broke up.

231
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,400
Get in the car, quick.

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,040
Jiwon! The view here
is really beautiful, isn't it?

233
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Yeah.

234
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,354
Looks pretty relaxing.
Have you guys finished packing everything?

235
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:32,915
- Yeah! Let's have a refreshing beer.
- Let's have a breakup drinking party.

236
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:35,838
As friends, this is all we can do.

237
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:39,700
A breakup drinking party? Aren't we
supposed to be working on our group project?

238
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,985
We're working on a
group project, aren't we?

239
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:44,546
The first thing about group
projects is building team chemistry.

240
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:49,600
True! Jiwon's just a freshman, so he doesn't
really get what group projects are all about yet.

241
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,900
What's the main point of group projects?

242
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,300
It's all about socializing.

243
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,518
The group presentation is next week.
Isn't that cutting it a bit close?

244
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,327
Don't worry, we've already
divided up the work anyway.

245
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,403
Just find another time and
knock it all out in one go.

246
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:07,899
If we end up having to pull an all-nighter
that day, our teamwork is what matters most.

247
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
OK?

248
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
OK...

249
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,900
Jiwon, he's driving me crazy.
Can you help me open this snack?

250
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,210
What are you talking about! You're the
one who's best at driving people crazy.

251
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,234
Alright, I'll do it.

252
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you for helping me.

253
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

254
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,400
Alright, loser goes to buy the
beer. Rock, paper, scissors!

255
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,700
Alright, Jiwon wins.

256
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,481
Turns out you're not just
good at gymnastics after all.

257
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:01,600
Alright, loser goes to buy the beer.
Rock, paper, scissors!

258
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,100
Rock, paper, scissors! Yes! I won!

259
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Come with me.

260
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,200
- I'll come with you?
- Yeah.

261
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,199
- What's wrong?
- But... I won the first set.

262
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,399
Jiwon, I could go instead of you, but...

263
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,054
But we still have to follow
the rules of the game.

264
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:27,667
Kwon Jungwoo, you're really
terrible at rock-paper-scissors.

265
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,741
Hey, grab a squid
while you're at it.

266
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:33,600
Then you guys go cook the ramen,
so we can eat as soon as we get back.

267
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's go.

268
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,360
Get ready to cook some ramen.

269
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
Don't you feel confused?

270
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,060
Seeing you out here working on group
assignments at nine o'clock at night.

271
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,700
You must really want to
earn those credits, right?

272
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,900
But seeing how much fun you're
having, it doesn't really seem that way.

273
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,400
You really were tricked into coming out.

274
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Or.

275
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,540
Are you just pretending you
got tricked into coming out here?

276
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,800
Did I... get tricked?

277
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,500
I knew it as soon as I
saw you bring your laptop.

278
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,780
Even if you don't want to, just put it on.

279
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,100
- This... Why are you giving this to me?
- Your hand is all scratched up.

280
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,300
If you just leave it like that and
don't do anything, doesn't it hurt?

281
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Hurry up and put it on.

282
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Thank you.

283
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Thank you.

284
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Actually...

285
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Did you ask me to come with you just
so you could help me put on a bandage?

286
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
What do you mean?

287
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,160
Girls must misunderstand
you all the time, don't they?

288
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,740
- No, that's not what I meant.
- You mean I wouldn't do this for other girls?

289
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,180
It's because it's you that I act this way.

290
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Why?

291
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,300
Because you wouldn't
misunderstand me, right?

292
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Ah.

293
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,400
Exactly.

294
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,953
How could I possibly misunderstand you?

295
00:23:57,954 --> 00:24:00,674
There's nothing to misunderstand
between two guys, right?

296
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,700
Let me take care of that trash.

297
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,900
Lately, you've seen all
my embarrassing moments.

298
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,300
I remember the day I got slapped.

299
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,500
Ah, I'm really sorry about that back then.

300
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,520
Why are you apologizing?

301
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:30,041
I got slapped because I was the
one who brought up breaking up.

302
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
That day...

303
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,400
Why did you show up?

304
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
I want to find a place where no
one's around to have some coffee.

305
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
Hmm... That place is
perfect for being alone.

306
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,180
Hoping that the scene of my breakup would be
the perfect sweet treat to go with your coffee.

307
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Uh...

308
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,680
I really enjoy taking pictures of the sky.

309
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Uh... what I mean is.

310
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,480
I like taking photos of the sky or
places that make people feel relaxed.

311
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,700
Sometimes you can capture a moment
even more beautiful than the one before.

312
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,000
So what?

313
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,500
What are you really trying to say?

314
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,000
Uh... You'll definitely meet a better
girlfriend next time, so don't be too upset.

315
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,420
Did you get the wrong idea about something?

316
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm not upset about the breakup at
all, so you don't need to worry about it.

317
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,340
Wasn't it because you broke
up that you invited us here?

318
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Fair enough.

319
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Here to commemorate the breakup.

320
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,580
Did you get the wrong idea?

321
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not that much of a romantic guy.

322
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
So.

323
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,300
You don't have to be
so nice to me.

324
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,860
Just making eye contact was enough
to make my face flush bright red,

325
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:37,700
and it only made me even
more determined to run away.

326
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,000
I've fallen for Kwon Jungwoo.

327
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's go.

328
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,576
(Next Episode)
What I mean is, you know that feeling, right?

329
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,376
- Uh, you know... that sex appeal.
- What did you just say?

330
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Can I like you?

331
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,968
- Want to hit up another spot with me?
- Where to?

332
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:02,531
My place.

333
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,492
You want to go and eat ramyeon?

334
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,220
Do you want to stay over tonight?

335
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,820
Because I want to spend the night with you.

336
