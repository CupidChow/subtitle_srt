1
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,188
All right, but…

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,233
make sure you keep this to yourself.

3
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,068
I don't want anyone to find out.

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,695
Is that important now?

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,947
You may need a transplant.

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,450
Just don't tell anyone.

7
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,329
All right.
For now, let's focus on treating you.

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,458
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it to myself.

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,251
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

10
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,295
-Okay, I won't.
-And…

11
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,173
Jun-wan too.

12
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,558
Don't tell Jun-wan, no matter what.

13
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,310
Okay?

14
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,757
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,135
We started dating last summer.

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,932
We broke up though. I broke up with him.

17
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,019
It's my fault. I've had a change of heart.

18
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,438
Don't ask me why we broke up.

19
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,440
It's just one of the common reasons

20
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,194
why most couples break up.

21
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,657
Jun-wan doesn't know about my condition.

22
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,660
And I want things to stay this way.

23
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,663
I'm sorry, Ik-jun.

24
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,124
All right, I won't tell him.

25
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,625
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,586
Why do you keep saying sorry?
It's so unlike you.

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,879
I'm okay,

28
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,674
so just wrap things up at school
and get ready to come home.

29
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,300
When's your flight?

30
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,233
You scared me!

31
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,610
Why aren't you asleep?

32
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm going to. I can't seem to sleep.

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,493
-Is it because of a patient?
-No.

34
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
Is something going on with your family?

35
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,165
No, they're fine.

36
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,479
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

37
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,819
Good morning, everyone.

38
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,572
-Good morning, Professor Lee.
-Good morning!

39
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,791
Choi Eun-suk in Room 6006
who came to the ER yesterday

40
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,543
received an enema last night
due to hepatic encephalopathy.

41
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,213
But her temperature has gone up
to 38.6 degrees Celsius,

42
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,798
and her jaundice is quite severe.

43
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,677
Okay, we should do an MRCP tomorrow.

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,054
If the bile duct is enlarged
because of cancer,

45
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,514
we will perform PTBD.

46
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,598
Got it.

47
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,605
-Hello, Ms. Choi.
-Hello, Doctor Lee.

48
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,857
How is she?

49
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,904
She doesn't really recognize anyone
and seems listless.

50
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,072
It doesn't look good.

51
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,158
I wish I could go through this
instead of her.

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
Her jaundice is pretty severe
at the moment.

53
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,878
It seems like the cancer has spread
to the bile duct

54
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,588
and is causing a blockage.

55
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,675
We'll do an MRI for the bile duct
tomorrow.

56
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,803
If what we're suspecting is true,
we'll perform a biliary drainage.

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,931
It's a procedure
where a drainage tube is inserted

58
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,058
to drain extra bile.

59
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,020
We might have to perform this procedure.

60
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,357
Okay, sure. Sounds good.

61
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,775
Okay.

62
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,364
Then we'll talk again tomorrow
when we have the MRI results.

63
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,824
Sure.

64
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,747
Seok-hyeong has changed so much.
It still surprises me every time.

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,081
He bought us coffee, too.

66
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,376
He used to be so quiet and grumpy
all the time.

67
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,879
He still looks kind of grumpy
all the time.

68
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,093
You're right, though.
My son has changed a lot.

69
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,472
After his father's affair,
Ji-eun's passing,

70
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,266
and me collapsing
from the brain hemorrhage,

71
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,143
he really changed 180 degrees.

72
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,354
It felt like hell,

73
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,648
but I at least have my son.

74
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,234
There is always hope, after all.

75
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,031
Rosa.

76
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,993
I'm quite happy these days.

77
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,746
That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

78
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,331
But I'm unhappy about one thing.

79
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,876
It's my one last wish.

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
I'll be so happy if it comes true,

81
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,297
but it's not easy.

82
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,091
What is it? Something money-related?

83
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,134
I have a lot of money.

84
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,011
All I have is money.

85
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,513
What a snob.

86
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,518
I want to see Seok-hyeong get remarried.

87
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,022
I want him to meet someone nice
and get remarried soon.

88
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,775
That's the one last missing piece
to my happiness.

89
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,276
And my last wish.

90
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,904
Your "last wish"?
Why bring your son into this?

91
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,408
Only wish for things
that concern you and your own life.

92
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,495
Don't meddle in his life again
and make things harder for him.

93
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,455
When did I do such a thing?

94
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,749
Have you forgotten everything?

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,751
You picked on the dowry

96
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,962
and even made his ex-wife sign a prenup

97
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,422
that said her family would get
none of your money.

98
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,468
I'm actually impressed
that she lasted a year.

99
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,053
You stressed her out about money

100
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
and called her dozens of times every day.

101
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,102
I did that because
she kept giving our money to her family.

102
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,438
Come on.
Seok-hyeong gave her family the money.

103
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,816
Why can't he help out his wife's family?
It was none of your business.

104
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,694
It was a marriage scam. We were duped.

105
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,446
They were about to go bankrupt,

106
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,949
but the entire family put on an act
and duped us.

107
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,287
I let them get married because I was told

108
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,956
Professor Yoon's father was
one of the richest men in Gangnam

109
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,793
who owned three buildings, not because
she comes from a family of professors.

110
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,422
Goodness, it was all a lie though.

111
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,007
They were drowning in debt.

112
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,676
Forget about the buildings.
They had so many loans.

113
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,471
Everyone in that family is a fraud.

114
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,682
I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose.
They must have had a reason.

115
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,935
How could you treat
your daughter-in-law like a thief?

116
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,273
You picked on her for bringing no dowry
except for the two-carat diamond ring.

117
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,109
You accused her of taking the ring
when it went missing.

118
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,737
How could you say that?

119
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,116
Rosa, I still think she took the ring.

120
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:18,164
That was the first and last day
she cleaned my room.

121
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,874
She suddenly offered to do it.

122
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,709
I did think it was a bit odd.

123
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,212
But she insisted,
so I told her to go ahead.

124
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,216
And the ring went missing that day.

125
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,967
There were more expensive things,

126
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,095
but only that tiny ring went missing.

127
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,016
The two-carat diamond ring
she bought for me.

128
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,853
You need to see a shrink.
You're delusional.

129
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,524
That was her way of getting back at me.
She scares me.

130
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,282
What is she doing here?

131
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,742
Who?

132
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,452
Sin-hye.

133
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,079
Who is Sin-hye?

134
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,581
The diamond thief.

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,264
Is that what she looked like?

136
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,058
What is she up to?

137
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,643
What are you thinking?

138
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,104
She must have an appointment.
Mind your own business.

139
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,316
Rosa, I think that diamond is mine.

140
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,363
Did you not see the diamond necklace
she was wearing?

141
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,825
I think it's my diamond.

142
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,577
No, it is mine. I'm sure of it.

143
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,246
Hey, is that the only diamond
in the world?

144
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,414
How do you know?

145
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,003
Yeong-hye. This is enough, okay?

146
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,006
It'll look ugly
if you keep going on about it.

147
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,955
Professor, ROM just occurred
during patient Jang Mi-ra's induction.

148
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,625
Then it'll go well.
Okay, thank you for the update.

149
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,045
-Professor, I have a question.
-What is it?

150
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,047
Patient Kang Yun-a's husband is wondering

151
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,467
if he can bring in a camera
and record the birth.

152
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,096
If he's holding a camera during labor,

153
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,514
she might punch him.

154
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,225
No, just the birth.

155
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,853
Not during labor.
Just the moment the baby is born.

156
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,522
He wants to record the moment
you pick up the baby.

157
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,400
He'll make sure
our faces won't be in the frame.

158
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,570
That's fine. Tell him that he can do it.

159
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,864
From a high angle though, not a low angle.

160
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,824
If it's just the baby, it's fine.

161
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,701
I'm totally fine with it.

162
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,203
Okay, I'll let him know.

163
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,456
And Professor…

164
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,959
I have another question.

165
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,211
Go ahead.

166
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,214
Well, I was just wondering…

167
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,969
Can I buy you a coffee
and ask you the question?

168
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:20,930
Just ask me here.

169
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,640
What's the question?

170
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,225
I'm curious now.

171
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,937
Do you want me to ask you here?

172
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,401
All right, let's go for coffee.

173
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,653
-You can ask me on the way.
-Okay, thank you.

174
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,074
Hey.

175
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,578
Can't you even aim the water properly
when you're a chief resident?

176
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,164
You need to be precise
for me to see it well.

177
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,582
I'm sorry, sir.

178
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,127
He worked the night shift

179
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,921
and even had to do an emergency surgery,
so he got no sleep.

180
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,590
Stay focused!

181
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,008
Okay. I'm sorry.

182
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,721
Who here isn't sleep-deprived?

183
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,434
Hey, back in my day,

184
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,979
I managed to stay focused
even after working 180 hours a week.

185
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,689
It's all about the mind.

186
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,316
Your mental strength.

187
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,280
There are only 168 hours in a week.

188
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,409
However, there's a thing called
daylight savings.

189
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,995
-What?
-It's nothing.

190
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,580
I'll wrap this up, Professor.

191
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,373
Obviously.

192
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,499
Right?

193
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,051
-Good work, everyone.
-Thank you, Professor.

194
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,761
-Thank you.
-No problem.

195
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,850
Well done, at this early hour.

196
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,435
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

197
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,769
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

198
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,897
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

199
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,148
Great job, guys.

200
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,571
He really is one of a kind.

201
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,909
Have you ever seen Professor Ahn angry?

202
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,746
He scolds the residents or interns
once in a while.

203
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,749
Politely, using honorifics.

204
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,214
Professor Yang.
What kind of movies do you like?

205
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,133
-Is that the question?
-No.

206
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,474
-Min-ha.
-Yes.

207
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,186
I just remembered that you're only allowed
to ask one question a day,

208
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,604
and you've already asked one.

209
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,940
That one was about work.

210
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,402
Only ask me work-related questions.

211
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,238
You didn't say that before.

212
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,864
As of today, that's the rule.

213
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,496
I don't think I can comply with that rule.

214
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,083
I'll make sure to only ask questions
that don't cross the line.

215
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,922
Still, no more questions for today.

216
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,800
If it's not about work,
save your question for tomorrow.

217
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,971
Okay. It's not about work,
so I'll ask you next time.

218
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,140
Then I'll just buy you a coffee.

219
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,393
You should get the triple extra-large.

220
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,228
Is there such a size?

221
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,814
No, I made it up. Oh, sorry.

222
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,535
Does your father have
an appointment here today?

223
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,370
Yes, we're done.

224
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,873
I left my phone at the café,

225
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,124
so I just picked it up.

226
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,501
My dad is in the car now.

227
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,920
He's okay, right?

228
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,173
He's doing much better now.
He's started to exercise regularly.

229
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,258
I'm glad to hear that.

230
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,011
Hello.

231
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,472
Oh, she's my resident.

232
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,308
I see, hello.

233
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,434
Hello.

234
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,395
He just said "my resident"!

235
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,232
Dad wanted to treat you to dinner,
but I told him not to bother.

236
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,942
It'd make you uncomfortable.

237
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,277
Thanks.

238
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,113
Besides, I didn't even do anything.

239
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,954
I have to go.

240
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,417
Okay, bye.

241
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,367
Seon-bin.
You don't see any bleeding, right?

242
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,078
There's none.

243
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,830
Just go when you need to, okay?

244
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,123
We'll finish it up.

245
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,416
Okay, will do.

246
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,543
Look at this.

247
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,005
The optic nerve decompression
went very well,

248
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,840
so the patient's eyesight may improve.

249
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,135
Let's remove the halo retractor.

250
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,637
-Okay.
-Okay.

251
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,348
Go ahead and remove the microscope.

252
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,318
-Hello.
-Hello.

253
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,989
Hello.

254
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,450
Hi.

255
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,379
You haven't eaten yet?

256
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,463
No.

257
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,718
Gyeo-ul, this isn't…

258
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,803
for just one meal, right?

259
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,055
Two meals?

260
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,018
I see, two meals.

261
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,187
Hello.

262
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,355
Hi.

263
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,691
I'll take the next one.

264
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,735
Come on. Just get in.

265
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:09,987
Fine.

266
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,754
Aren't they here yet?

267
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,841
I told them on our group chat
to come here if they have a moment.

268
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,301
They'll be here in a minute.

269
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,973
By the way, it looks like you have
at least one surgery here a week.

270
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,726
What was the point of moving to Sokcho?

271
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,603
Only take care of the urgent VIP cases

272
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,481
and let Professor Choi
or Professor Jung handle the rest.

273
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,778
I'm only going to take care
of all the VIP surgeries until next week.

274
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,032
I'll have Professor Jung
handle the simple cases after that.

275
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,742
Good. I'm glad to hear this.

276
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,993
Hey! Darn it.

277
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,412
Can I borrow your charger?

278
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,124
I'm going to take a break.

279
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,837
I need to get my neck treated
and start exercising.

280
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,215
I need to recharge myself.

281
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,342
Do you want to use this?

282
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,348
I need your charger.

283
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,101
No! She needs it now to recharge herself.

284
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,776
You crazy clown.
I can't cuss you because you're funny.

285
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,156
Is everyone here? Where's Seok-hyeong?

286
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
That bear is probably
toddling along slowly like a turtle.

287
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,247
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes.

288
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,132
-Am I the last one to arrive?
-That's right.

289
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,216
Hurry up and sit down.

290
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,803
Tell us, Song-hwa.

291
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,849
Why did you call us here
in the middle of the day?

292
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,393
Are you getting married?

293
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,894
Hey.

294
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,815
It's about something

295
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,693
that's just as important.

296
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,200
-Snow crab?
-Snow crab?

297
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,205
Yes. There's this sashimi place I eat at
often in Sokcho.

298
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,874
The captain there called me.

299
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,627
They caught a lot of crabs today.
He'd sell me some at the wholesale price.

300
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,046
Call him now and tell him we want some!

301
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,923
I want snow crabs.

302
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,177
I really want some snow crabs.

303
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,014
How much can I buy?

304
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,809
What's he saying?

305
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,227
It's called acting.

306
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,521
How much? How much do you want?

307
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,857
Snow crab? I've got money.

308
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,651
Such a special friendship you have there.

309
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,861
You played along with that.

310
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,489
Of course you pay for them with money.

311
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,657
I already told him.

312
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,577
He'll steam them and send them to us
tomorrow.

313
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,913
He said it'd arrive on the weekend,
but I told him

314
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,624
to send it to Seok-hyeong's address.

315
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,792
-Seok-hyeong, keep an eye out for it.
-Okay.

316
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,170
We should have it together
before our practice.

317
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,131
Jeong-won is allergic to crab,

318
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,509
so order bossam and jokbal
as soon as the package arrives.

319
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,303
Sorry, Jeong-won.

320
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,474
-How many did you order?
-Ten.

321
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
-Ten?
-Ten?

322
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,523
Two per person.

323
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,610
Two snow crabs per person?

324
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,655
I can't have any,
so it's just the four of you.

325
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,241
Which means,
you'll each have to have 2.5 crabs.

326
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,325
Hey.

327
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,411
Are you talking about
those small hermit crabs?

328
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,539
No, snow crabs. Those big ones!

329
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,584
I bought a lot because they were cheap.

330
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,672
If it's too much,
you can all take one home.

331
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,840
You can give it to U-ju.

332
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,218
Give it to your mother.

333
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,804
Right, you can give it to Dr. Jang.

334
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,848
-You'll see her on the weekend, right?
-Of course.

335
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,852
And you… Well…

336
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,437
You can…

337
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,107
Don't worry. I'll take care of them.

338
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,400
Okay.

339
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,528
Then I'll see you guys this weekend.

340
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,323
Fast for eight hours before we meet up.
You know the drill.

341
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,243
Are we not even allowed to drink water?

342
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,744
Water is okay.

343
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,049
The clams taste very fresh.

344
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,051
Where are they from? The West Sea?

345
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,054
No, the grocery store.
These are frozen clams.

346
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:47,889
Really?

347
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,519
The fridges these days are very good.
They come with good freezers.

348
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,648
Cut it out. Are you really not
going to get a health checkup?

349
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,483
Don't be so stubborn.

350
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,861
If you fall ill,
your children will suffer.

351
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,572
Goodness. My kids won't even care.

352
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,616
They'll just call me a few times.
That's it.

353
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,788
As they say,

354
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,502
you can never defy your age.

355
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,839
It's natural to fall ill

356
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,215
and die when you're old.

357
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,011
You'll die anyway even if
you know about your health issues.

358
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,929
I'll just…

359
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,932
stay in the dark until I die.

360
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,852
I have no regrets left in life.

361
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,480
You've only just turned 70.
How could you say that?

362
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,149
And I never said
you should rely on your kids.

363
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,568
Let them live their lives
and do whatever you want.

364
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,987
What do you want to do?

365
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,865
-Nothing.
-Nothing? Why?

366
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,950
-What about you?
-Me?

367
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,078
What do I want to do…

368
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,914
I can't think of anything either.

369
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,126
Life's no fun anymore.

370
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,298
My only joy is eating a warm bowl of rice

371
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,760
and this delicious soybean paste soup
with you.

372
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,888
I don't know if I can say
you're pessimistic or just humble.

373
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,681
Eat up.

374
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,433
I am eating.

375
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,185
I'll make you this every spring.

376
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,106
Old friends are the best.

377
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,278
Is Jeong-won not coming this week?

378
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,657
He was here last week.
The other one's visiting today.

379
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,577
I see. You're lucky
you have such good children.

380
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,706
You're the very first person to say that.

381
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,794
All my kids are priests and nuns,
except for one. How is that "lucky"?

382
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,091
If I wrote a book about my life,
it'd be a weighty tome.

383
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,717
I've lived such a dramatic life.

384
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,637
Well, every family has a story.

385
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,724
Speaking of which…

386
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,102
About Peter.

387
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,354
Peter? Dong-il?

388
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,815
-Yes, Dong-il.
-What about him?

389
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,112
He is your son, right?

390
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,576
He's not Chairman Ahn's love child
that he took in

391
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,703
when the two of you got married, right?

392
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,707
He looks too old for his age, doesn't he?

393
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,377
Yes, he looks really old.

394
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,629
I gave birth to him.

395
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,548
If you look closely, he takes after me.

396
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,008
He looks nothing like you.

397
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,427
Sure, he has two eyes, one nose,
and one mouth.

398
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,928
That's the only resemblance.

399
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,849
Dong-il is quite handsome though.

400
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,226
He's the best-looking one
out of all my kids.

401
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,103
But he looks so old.

402
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,190
Maybe that's why he's so mature.

403
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,317
And he's very dependable.

404
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,485
Mom!

405
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,739
Mom!

406
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,451
Mom, why did you leave the door open?

407
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,994
What if thieves come in?

408
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,289
So was he the one who was coming today?

409
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,917
My gosh.

410
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,461
You're here too. Hello, Mr. Ju.

411
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,172
Mom.

412
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,382
Ta-da!

413
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,177
Where did you get this?

414
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,179
In the garden.

415
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,976
It looked like someone had tossed them
right by the wall,

416
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,103
so I brought them in.

417
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,941
What are you talking about? I've been
working so hard to look after them.

418
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,734
-Mom.
-What?

419
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,862
The stems were broken like this.

420
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,157
Gosh, seriously.

421
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,077
They weren't doing well,
so I've been giving them supplements.

422
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,204
I can't believe you picked them.

423
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,872
-Really?
-Gosh.

424
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,251
I see. I didn't know.

425
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,543
Goodness.

426
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,836
-Jeez.
-Hey!

427
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,338
Mom!

428
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,592
These are spikenards!
You're eating spikenards?

429
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,805
You grow them in your garden too,
so you can't pick them.

430
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,474
How are spikenards different
from the flowers, Mr. Ju?

431
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,893
You always have something to say.

432
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,271
When will you grow up?

433
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,523
Seriously, when will you grow up?

434
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,732
My goodness.

435
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,992
It doesn't look like
we can practice today.

436
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,535
It's not happening.

437
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,204
We don't have enough time
to eat all the crab.

438
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,416
We'll do it next time. Our vocalist
needs to take care of his throat.

439
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,253
Yes. You guys don't care
about my throat at all.

440
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,213
My throat has been hurting.

441
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,507
Just talk less.

442
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,802
You talk nonstop.
No wonder your throat is sore.

443
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,637
That being said,

444
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,681
the vocalist position…

445
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,516
How about I try--

446
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,442
-Nice!
-Ik-jun, that was amazing!

447
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,485
-My throat's better now.
-Have some bossam.

448
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,529
-It's really good.
-Try this.

449
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,072
Hey, you need to eat this first.

450
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,741
-Jeong-won.
-This is so refreshing.

451
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,200
-Eat up.
-Ahn Jeong-won.

452
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,786
-The bossam is so good.
-Andrea!

453
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,079
It's delicious.

454
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,664
-Isn't it good?
-Look at me.

455
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,583
My gosh, this is so nice.

456
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,172
I've been practicing a lot
on the beach in Sokcho.

457
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,466
I can sing much better now.

458
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,177
Hey, don't be swayed!

459
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,724
I even went to Mount Seorak
to improve my singing!

460
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,225
Not to eat those fritters?

461
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,894
Hey!

462
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,439
Well, we can't.

463
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,192
Hey, our answer is no.

464
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,156
She really wants to do it.
Why don't we let her sing once?

465
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,240
Stop!

466
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,622
-Just to be sure.
-We can't decide this today.

467
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,874
-But--
-Hey, what I'm saying is,

468
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,502
-why are we taking this so seriously?
-Hey, listen.

469
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:54,255
Song-hwa wanted to sing better,

470
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,843
so she even practiced
on the beach in Sokcho.

471
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,637
-Hey.
-No, I don't want to talk to you.

472
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,015
I know this isn't an easy decision.
Oh, dear.

473
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,393
I'm going to the bathroom.

474
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,520
Hey, this is important. Can't it wait?

475
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,146
I'm so full. I ate too much.

476
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,607
Gosh, I'm stuffed.

477
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,109
-My gosh.
-Hey.

478
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,237
Walk properly. Are you drunk?

479
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,906
No, not at all.
This is because I had snow crabs.

480
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,037
What's with him?

481
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,800
Hold on.

482
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,851
-Do it!
-Really?

483
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,644
You guys will let me sing?

484
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,147
-Yes!
-Yes, but…

485
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,857
only on your birthday.

486
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,735
Okay, deal! I'm fine with that.

487
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,612
-My birthday's coming up.
-Not this year.

488
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,533
You sang last year.

489
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,619
-Right, I did.
-So do it next year.

490
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,789
It'll be a biennial event.

491
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,084
So every two years?

492
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,962
Then I have to wait so long!

493
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,965
We made a big concession.

494
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,217
How am I going to wait until next April?

495
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,260
A year flies by.

496
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,595
It'll feel like forever!

497
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,722
But we'll let you choose the song.

498
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,058
Can you be considerate of us?
People think we're a comedy group.

499
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,686
-If you sing--
-Then I have one condition.

500
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,481
What? Come on now.

501
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,357
What is it?

502
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,361
Let's go to a karaoke.

503
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,783
-Now?
-Yes, now.

504
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,577
What?

505
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,788
Can't we?

506
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:04,761
On the day of our first date

507
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:09,891
With three yellow roses in my hand

508
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,063
I hummed all the way to Sinchon

509
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,901
With a fluttering heart

510
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,365
With your straight hair
Blowing in the wind

511
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:30,745
You were waving your hand at me

512
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,875
From head to toe

513
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:41,256
I'm smitten with everything about you

514
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,758
I like you

515
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,261
I like you so much

516
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,516
I want to give you my everything

517
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,938
I don't want to hide

518
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,317
My feelings for you

519
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,403
Forever

520
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,364
-Forever
-Forever

521
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,657
With you

522
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,328
-With you
-With you

523
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:17,083
Strolling in Sinchon with you

524
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:21,796
Feeling over the moon

525
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:27,302
Hello, my angel

526
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,347
How did you steal my heart?

527
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,645
It's okay, my angel

528
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:43,359
My heart is all yours now

529
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,778
I like you

530
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,448
I like you so much

531
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,702
I want to give you my everything

532
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:58,958
I don't want to hide

533
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,712
My feelings for you

534
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,757
Forever

535
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,426
-Forever
-Forever

536
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,510
With you

537
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,641
-With you
-With you

538
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,745
Hey, stop it!

539
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,458
What's with you?

540
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,612
Dig in.

541
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,031
Wait.

542
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,367
Is this all for me?

543
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,078
I know you can finish it.

544
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,624
You have to go back
to the hospital, right?

545
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,542
Yes.

546
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,671
Then I should drop you off

547
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,673
and pick up Jun-wan.

548
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,178
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

549
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,310
Do they remove all the shells
before sending crabs these days?

550
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,521
Whoever did this must be a pro at this.

551
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,398
It's shelled so cleanly.

552
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,150
I did it.

553
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,404
Jun-wan's on duty,
so after making him breakfast,

554
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,489
I put on gloves and shelled them.

555
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,950
But you can't even eat them.

556
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,952
I can still touch them.

557
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,663
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's so good.

558
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,084
Eat up. I'll buy you this often.

559
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,545
We should have it often
while Song-hwa is in Sokcho.

560
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,507
-Okay. Min-ha is also from Sokcho.
-Really?

561
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,219
Yes. Her parents run a bed and breakfast.
She always says I should visit.

562
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,304
But you can't go.

563
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,183
Right. Min-ha can't go, and neither can I.

564
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,642
We're too busy.

565
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,938
Let's go together
after your board exam next year.

566
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:30,526
You'll have some time then.
We can see the ocean and go for a drive.

567
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,778
We'll go for a few days.

568
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,363
Do you think we'll ever get to?

569
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,199
Why? Are you going somewhere?

570
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,160
No, a year is a long time away.

571
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,621
Who knows what could happen in a year?

572
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,915
It'll fly by.

573
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,338
Gyeo-ul, just promise me this one thing.

574
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,842
Whether it's something big or small,

575
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,596
tell me if anything ever happens to you.

576
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,020
I won't nag you
or try to give my two cents,

577
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,481
so just tell me. Okay?

578
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,442
Okay, I will.

579
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,320
You should promise me, too.

580
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,155
Promise what?

581
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,951
I'm so curious now.

582
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,126
Just once a day,

583
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,922
do something to express your affection.

584
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,730
Your allergy.

585
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,861
I have to say,
this flower looks just like a fried egg.

586
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,821
With the white part and the egg yolk.

587
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,617
Is this flower called

588
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,535
"fried egg"?

589
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,582
Mom! What's the name of this flower?

590
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,710
Daisy! How many times
do I have to tell you?

591
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,338
Right, daisy. That's right.

592
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,257
Just the perfect name
for this pretty flower.

593
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,635
Mom!

594
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,514
This flower comes
in different colors, right?

595
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,600
I feel like I've seen purple--

596
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,271
This won't revive the flowers.

597
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,192
Why did you take them out of the vase?

598
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,528
You're such a weirdo. Goodness.

599
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,197
-Mom!
-What?

600
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,950
-Mom!
-Goodness.

601
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,376
Mom!

602
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,545
Mom!

603
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,926
Hey, scarecrow.

604
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,347
I noticed that your kids
all have something in common.

605
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,226
What? What do they have in common?

606
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,936
They're chatty.

607
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,232
They're all chatty.

608
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,278
That's true. My kids can be pretty chatty.

609
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,822
They've always been that way
since they were little.

610
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,867
As soon as they get home from school,
they start chatting away.

611
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,122
About fighting with their friends
and their favorite singers…

612
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,958
They'd even tell me
about cutting the self-study class.

613
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,252
It makes them look a bit flippant,
doesn't it?

614
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,045
No, not at all.

615
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,466
They don't come across as flippant.
I can see that they're very thoughtful.

616
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,140
I really am jealous.

617
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,685
Look, do you still envy me?

618
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,068
Mom! Do you see this rainbow?

619
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,903
I'll make you a rainbow!

620
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,658
Do you see this? Look! I made a rainbow!

621
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,082
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

622
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,753
We moved Choi Eun-suk
to a six-bed room over the weekend.

623
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,046
Good. How's her jaundice?

624
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,173
Her bilirubin level is 2.5.
It keeps dropping.

625
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,924
How's her husband?

626
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,219
-Her husband?
-Yes.

627
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,513
I think he's doing okay. Why?

628
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,725
Nothing. I was just asking.

629
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,606
Choi Eun-suk's husband
asked for a medical certificate.

630
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,983
-He said it's for an insurance claim.
-Okay.

631
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,486
But he wants it to say
she's in serious condition

632
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:28,074
and that you're not sure
whether or not she'll recover.

633
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,076
But she's recovering.

634
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,787
-I know.
-Hello?

635
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,372
I can't lie.

636
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,123
I'll be right there.

637
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,668
Professor Lee,
I have to go get ready for surgery.

638
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,753
Sure.

639
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,505
I'll talk to him.

640
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,759
See you soon. Thank you. Have a great day!

641
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,511
CREDIT UNION

642
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,972
Hello, Professor Chae!

643
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,475
Dr. Chu, you seem to be
in a good mood today.

644
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,812
I opened an installment savings account.

645
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,773
Is that why you came here?
You can do it on the app.

646
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,360
I know. I wanted to do it at the bank
because it's a meaningful day for me.

647
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,530
Professor Chae.

648
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,283
I paid off my student loan in full!

649
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,286
My gosh, congratulations.

650
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,080
-You paid it off already?
-Yes.

651
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,249
I made the last payment today

652
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,293
and opened an installment savings account,
500,000 won a month.

653
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,838
I know I could've done it on my phone,

654
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,007
but I wanted to see the actual bankbook,

655
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,593
so I ran down here during our downtime.

656
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,430
They actually have some downtime
in OB-GYN.

657
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,390
-Hello?
-Where are you?

658
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,934
I think it's because
her cervix has dilated,

659
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,396
but Kang Yun-a is bleeding quite a bit.
Can you please check? Please hurry.

660
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,981
Okay, I'm coming now.

661
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,568
See you, Professor Chae. Bye, Dr. Heo!

662
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,361
My gosh, be careful not to fall.

663
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,906
By the way, how do you know Dr. Chu?

664
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,742
How can I not know her?
She's a member of We Love Tteokbokki.

665
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,745
-There's a tteokbokki club?
-Yes, apparently.

666
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,541
We should finish the thesis by tomorrow,
before I leave Seoul.

667
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,668
Aren't you coming to Seoul anymore?

668
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,587
No, I won't be coming for a while.

669
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,173
You won't see me for a while,
after tomorrow.

670
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,383
Please, Professor Chae.

671
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,218
Stop that.

672
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,138
Forget that I exist, okay?

673
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,182
Professor Chae.

674
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,725
Gosh, what's with you?

675
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,979
-Hello, Dr. Lee.
-Hello.

676
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,064
-Hello.
-We have the copy you asked for.

677
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,983
-You can pick it up anytime.
-Thank you.

678
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,736
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Yes, hello.

679
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,030
Ms. Choi, how are you feeling today?

680
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,282
I feel okay.

681
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,785
-What about the drainage?
-We've drained 400cc so far.

682
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,079
Has her temperature gone down?

683
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,000
It's much better now.
Just a little over 37 degrees Celsius.

684
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,505
The fever is caused by the inflammation
in the bile duct.

685
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,842
We'll tamp down the inflammation
with antibiotics and see how it goes.

686
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,601
She hasn't had a liver ultrasound
for a while.

687
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,105
Why don't we do it today?
Take her to the outpatient clinic.

688
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,901
Sure. I'll get it ready.

689
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,904
A liver ultrasound? Why, all of a sudden?

690
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,573
Well, it'll be quick.

691
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,159
Last week, we inserted a little tube here

692
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,079
to drain extra bile.

693
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,664
We want to make sure the drain

694
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,458
is working well
and also check her liver and gallbladder.

695
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,544
I can go in with her, right?

696
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,129
Why would you need to come in?
It's her ultrasound.

697
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,799
Can't you trust us?

698
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,803
No, it's not that.

699
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,930
I trust you, Professor Lee.

700
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,307
-All right, then.
-Have a good day.

701
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,809
-Get some rest.
-Thank you.

702
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,811
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

703
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,489
Pushing helps ease the pain,
so keep pushing.

704
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,366
That will help the baby come out.

705
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,952
Let's hang in there, okay?
You can do this.

706
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,588
Her husband can come in now.

707
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,464
Tell him to come in.

708
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,716
Okay.

709
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,598
Are you leaving already?

710
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,890
You still have some time.

711
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,309
What if the traffic is bad?

712
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,061
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok is in the lobby.
I already called a taxi.

713
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,189
I sent you the train tickets.

714
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,525
The return tickets
from Busan to Seoul as well.

715
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,403
It's the last train at 10:50 p.m.
so you'd have enough time.

716
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,363
Call me right away if you miss the train.

717
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,074
Okay, thank you. See you later.

11-YEAR-OLD BOY SONG HAN-GYEOL'S ORGANS
SAVE 5 CHILDREN'S LIVES

719
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,833
Your surgery finished early.

720
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,086
What are you talking about?
I got here at dawn today.

721
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,175
Oh, it must be this kid.

722
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,427
Yes, the kid who donated his heart
to Eun-ji.

723
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,803
There's an article about it.

724
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,100
Such young organ donors are rare,
you know.

725
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,900
Aren't you on duty?
I guess you can't drink tonight, then.

726
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,902
That's right. I'm on duty tonight.

727
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,696
You can drink with the others.
Song-hwa is here too.

728
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,992
I can still have dinner with you.

729
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
What about Gyeo-ul?

730
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,287
It's okay. I'll just eat with you.

731
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,211
I bet she's either on duty
or out for the procurement.

732
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,963
Yes.

733
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,766
You're doing great.

734
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,728
This is the last push.
Try to push a little harder.

735
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,898
How come her husband isn't coming in?

736
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,734
The baby will be out any second now.
He wanted to record it.

737
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:00,906
Ms. Kang, you're really almost there.
Keep pushing. Try to push a little harder.

738
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,825
Her husband is here.

739
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,745
One more time.

740
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,789
The baby is coming out.

741
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,084
You can relax your face.
Just try to push the baby down.

742
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,502
One last time. Push!

743
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,679
It's out.

744
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,515
The baby is out.

745
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,311
Hi, sweetheart.

746
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,733
-You did great.
-Current time, 14:40.

747
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,235
It's a baby girl.

748
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,487
Your baby is here.

749
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,072
Congratulations.

750
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,450
How adorable.

751
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,579
Say hello to your baby.

752
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,373
Hi, my baby.

753
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,127
Sir, you wanted to take a video
of the baby.

754
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,463
Sir…

755
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,760
-You did it, honey.
-Thanks.

756
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,433
I love you.

757
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,521
I'm so proud of you, honey.

758
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,615
I love you, honey.

759
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,471
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

760
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,377
When did you get here?

761
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,461
Just now.

762
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,006
Jeong-won said to give you this.
You probably skipped dinner.

763
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,261
Mozart?

764
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,804
Impressive.

765
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,764
Right there.

766
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,767
Right.

767
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,740
Did something good happen?

768
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,911
What? Oh, it's nothing special.

769
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,623
Today, I realized for the first time
after my divorce

770
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:01,461
that marriage isn't always a bad thing.

771
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,257
We delivered a baby earlier.

772
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,718
When the baby was born,

773
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,847
the husband went straight to his wife,
not to the baby.

774
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,892
He held her hand and said

775
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,437
he loves her
and that he's so proud of her.

776
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,941
It was such a beautiful moment.

777
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,236
They met as strangers,

778
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:30,532
yet they grew to love
and rely on each other.

779
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,702
I was so happy for them the whole time,

780
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,872
and it made me jealous.

781
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,290
Get married.

782
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,375
You can get married too.

783
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,543
Me?

784
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,920
I shouldn't.

785
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,506
Why not? Is it against the law?

786
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,841
You know my family.

787
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,552
I don't want to ruin anyone's life.

788
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,930
Come on.
Your mother won't be like that again.

789
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,560
She will be. She won't change.

790
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,779
It must've been very stressful
for Sin-hye.

791
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,201
What did you do?

792
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,287
What kind of effort did you make?

793
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,709
What kind of effort?

794
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,379
Let me think.

795
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,301
Even before we got married,
she was very stressed out

796
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,303
because of the whole dowry situation.

797
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:38,350
And after we got married,
my mom called her 30 times a day.

798
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,769
One day,

799
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,439
I saw Sin-hye
taking six sleeping pills before bed.

800
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,485
That got me really worried,

801
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,738
so I told her to go study abroad.

802
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,866
I said I'd take care of the expenses.

803
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,869
But even that fell through

804
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,290
because my mom found out
and called Sin-hye's family.

805
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,337
She said, "Why must my son
pay for your daughter's education?"

806
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,884
That was your first effort.
Offering to send her abroad.

807
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,513
I'm not sure if it counts,
but I at least made an attempt.

808
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,765
Well…

809
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,144
And Sin-hye…

810
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,567
She was quiet to begin with,
but she kept getting quieter.

811
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,945
When we were going through the divorce,

812
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,322
she hardly said a word, even to me.

813
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,535
Her depression was quite severe
at the time,

814
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,750
so I told her not to worry about me
and spend time with her parents.

815
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,793
Her mother was very worried about her.

816
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:51,089
Second effort, trying to send her
to her parents' place.

817
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,508
Are you summarizing them?

818
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,093
Yes.

819
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,512
It's just my habit. Don't mind me.

820
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,432
But that didn't work out either.

821
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,310
She couldn't do it
because she was afraid of my mom.

822
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,147
So we gave up without even trying.

823
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,443
And my last effort was…

824
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,617
Would this one even count?

825
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,244
What is it?

826
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,127
One day, Sin-hye said
she wanted to visit my mom at her place.

827
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,420
Why walk into the tiger's den?

828
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,508
I told her it wasn't necessary and that
we shouldn't bother, but she insisted.

829
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,552
She said she wanted to be
a good daughter-in-law.

830
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,557
I told her she didn't need to,
but we ended up going.

831
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,559
And that day,

832
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,146
a diamond ring went missing
from the master bedroom.

833
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,232
A ring went missing?

834
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,192
I had no idea.

835
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,654
My mom's diamond ring went missing,

836
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:03,787
but I saw Sin-hye taking the ring
from my mom's dressing table.

837
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,041
And Sin-hye saw me at that moment.

838
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,712
My gosh.

839
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,715
"Why did she steal the ring?

840
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,342
Why did she do it?

841
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,222
I suppose she was just that resentful."
I mulled over it,

842
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,851
but I never got to ask her about it.

843
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,644
I couldn't bring it up.

844
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,816
I thought it'd be best to pretend
not to know about it.

845
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,943
Third effort.

846
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,530
Feigned ignorance
about your ex-wife's criminal offense.

847
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,827
But those things
do count as efforts, right?

848
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,120
No.

849
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,914
You didn't put in any effort.

850
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,711
Sounds like all you did
was try to avoid the problem.

851
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:57,007
An effort is more like, asking her
why she did it and arguing about it.

852
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,967
You didn't do anything.

853
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,429
"Why are you taking
so many sleeping pills?

854
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,306
Maybe you should see a therapist."

855
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,100
You should've tried to talk to her
about it.

856
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,394
All you did was worry.

857
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,771
You didn't make any effort
to solve the situation.

858
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,232
How is it…

859
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,152
that you know everything?

860
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,947
I know that too.

861
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,201
I'm fully aware of the fact
that it was my fault.

862
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,455
That's why I told you everything
but that part,

863
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,000
but you called me out on it.

864
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,213
Sometimes,
I feel like you're 800 years old.

865
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,762
Why am I like this?

866
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,265
I'm such a coward.

867
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,354
I think of running away
the moment I'm faced with hardship.

868
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,610
I still have a lot of growing up
left to do. I'm immature.

869
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,572
As they say,
knowing the problem is half the solution.

870
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,038
I'll suggest a solution
now that we've identified the problem.

871
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,917
You have me in the palm of your hand.

872
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,670
Shut up and just do one thing.

873
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,091
You talk too much.

874
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,014
Me? I say what I need to say.
I speak out when I need to.

875
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,058
You need to say more useless things.

876
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:34,604
At work, only say what's necessary.
Outside of work, you don't need to.

877
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,232
Even if you think it's useless,

878
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,734
it may not be useless
to the person hearing it.

879
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,406
Don't do it to everyone, though.

880
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,409
Start with the people closest to you.

881
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,994
The ones you see most often

882
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,871
and feel most comfortable with.

883
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,552
Hey, Min-ha.

884
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,554
Professor Yang, you're still here, right?

885
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,265
It's Ms. Han Seung-ju's birthday
next week.

886
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,225
We're collecting money for a group gift.

887
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,520
You're a professor,

888
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,147
and you're well-off,

889
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,982
so how about you pitch in 100,000 won?

890
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,026
Okay, 100,000 won? Sure.

891
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,861
Nice! Thank you, Professor Yang.

892
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,988
Wait, Min-ha.

893
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,742
What kind of gift are we getting?

894
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,329
Well, we haven't decided yet.

895
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,458
But I'll go to the mall this weekend
and pick something up.

896
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,625
I see.

897
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,005
Which one? Which mall are you going to?

898
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,716
How are you getting there?

899
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,887
The subway? I see.

900
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,307
Which subway line?

901
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,062
Right, Line 3. I see.

902
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,689
The subway will probably be the fastest.

903
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,650
What kind of gift are we getting?

904
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,612
Right, I already asked you.

905
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,865
Yes, there's something wrong
with the bile duct.

906
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,658
They're doing a biopsy right now.

907
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,703
The Professor of Pathology is returning
to the hospital now,

908
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,748
so we'll have to wait another hour
for the results.

909
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,250
Really? What should we do, then?

910
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,836
You won't make it on time for the train.

911
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,798
No. Even if it's just due to necrosis,

912
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:29,052
we won't be able to complete
the procurement before 11 p.m.

913
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:30,845
Then let's do this.

914
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,890
I'll see if any of the ambulance drivers

915
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,060
can drive you to Seoul tonight.
I'll call you back.

916
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,436
I'm sure I can find someone.

917
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,896
I'll make it work.

918
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,731
Okay, thank you.

919
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,032
You're not on duty tonight.
Why are you still here?

920
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,283
Something came up.

921
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,620
What is it?

922
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,467
119 RESCUE SERVICES

923
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,644
-You sit in the front.
-Okay.

924
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,313
He got called into work,
so he's probably tired.

925
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,691
Try to keep him awake, okay?

926
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,192
Okay, got it.

927
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,747
-Would you like some gum?
-Sure, thank you.

928
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,132
-Have some dried squid.
-Thank you.

929
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:06,232
Sir! Let's stop at the next rest area.

930
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,193
-Sure.
-Thank you.

931
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,837
AMBULANCE ENTRY ONLY

932
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,803
MOM

933
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,977
Mom, you're still up?

934
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,687
Did something happen?

935
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,231
Why are you calling so late?

936
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:50,860
Nothing happened. I just missed you.

937
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,820
It's 4 a.m. now.

938
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,822
You should be asleep.

939
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,492
I'll go to sleep
now that I've heard your voice.

940
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,912
Everything's okay with you, right?

941
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,455
I'm doing fine.

942
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,918
Mom, did you fight with Dad?

943
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,128
Of course not.

944
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,673
You're sure, right?

945
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,590
Yes.

946
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:17,011
Gyeo-ul. You're out of side dishes, right?
Do you want me to send you some?

947
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,138
No, I still have a lot left.

948
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,434
Mom, you're sure everything's okay, right?

949
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,980
Of course. Everything's fine.

950
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,027
I'm getting a call.
I'm going into surgery now.

951
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,154
Okay. Go ahead.

952
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,408
Don't push yourself too hard. I love you.

953
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,576
Okay, love you too.

954
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,498
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

955
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,334
Right, Dr. Jang.

956
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,045
Cho Seung-su, the laparocholecystotomy
patient in Room 6010

957
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,589
has passed gas.

958
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,383
I see. Then he can have water now

959
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,552
and start eating tomorrow.
Order him porridge.

960
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,053
Got it.

961
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,474
Do you need something?

962
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,894
Ms. Song. We want to move
to a different room.

963
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,565
Those people are way too loud.

964
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,986
The patient… Gosh.

965
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:20,283
She screams
every time she becomes delirious,

966
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:25,163
and her husband shows up drunk
every single night.

967
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,335
I'm not 100 percent sure
because of the curtains,

968
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,753
but gosh…

969
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,465
I think he hits his wife.

970
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:40,470
You know, the sound…

971
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:45,308
It's the sound you hear
when someone's being punched.

972
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,313
I'm not sure
because I didn't actually see it,

973
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,607
but something definitely seems off.

974
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,570
Ms. Song, can we please move
to a different room?

975
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,323
They're loud and they keep us on edge.

976
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,950
My mother can't even sleep these days.

977
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,133
Hello, Doctor.

978
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,427
Have you eaten yet?

979
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,348
Here, have this.

980
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,100
No, it's okay.

981
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,856
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

982
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,741
-Kim Jun-wan.
-What's up, Lee Ik-jun?

983
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,201
What's your schedule like?

984
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:48,830
This week? I'm booked up tomorrow
and have a conference from Thursday.

985
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,081
Good.

986
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,750
-What?
-Nothing, never mind.

987
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:53,876
When do you come back?

988
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,754
Friday night, I think.
I'll probably go straight home.

989
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,214
-Why do you ask?
-Nothing, bye.

990
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,135
That little…

991
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,474
-Hey.
-Professor Kim.

992
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,977
Eun-ji's mother wants to talk to you.

993
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,645
Me?

994
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,028
Dr. Jang, you are not on duty tonight,
are you?

995
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,573
-I still have to organize some charts.
-I see.

996
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:51,601
We can't accept things like this, ma'am.

997
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:52,727
You know that.

998
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,188
I baked them myself.

999
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,648
It cost me less than 30,000 won.

1000
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,526
My gosh, thank you.

1001
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:05,156
Share them with Ms. Cho Mi-yeong
and Ms. Yoo Ji-yun who are on duty today.

1002
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:08,618
Also, the nurse who left this morning.

1003
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,453
Ms. Kim Mi-suk, with the pretty voice.

1004
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,998
And make sure the yoga enthusiast,
Ms. Jang Gyeong-hwa, gets some too.

1005
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,501
Yes, don't worry.
I'll make sure everyone gets some.

1006
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,670
Thank you so much…

1007
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,049
for all your help.

1008
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,804
Thanks to all the nurses in the PICU,

1009
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:32,850
Eun-ji managed to stay strong
and even got the transplant.

1010
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,981
Thank you for adoring Eun-ji
like your own,

1011
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,652
and thank you so much
for taking such great care of her.

1012
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,865
We're grateful to see Eun-ji
recovering so quickly.

1013
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,662
We received help from so many people.

1014
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,124
All the nurses went out of their way
for Eun-ji,

1015
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:01,921
and Professor Kim Jun-wan
worked so hard too.

1016
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,299
But you know…

1017
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:09,428
There's someone I'm most grateful to.

1018
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,767
What is this?

1019
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,938
I wrote a letter to the donor's family.

1020
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,901
And there's a little gift for them
as well.

1021
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,866
You know, the kid who donated his heart
to Eun-ji and passed away…

1022
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,830
Please make sure his family gets it.

1023
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,375
Please do it for me, Professor Kim.

1024
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,628
You know that is against the law.

1025
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:47,341
We can't tell you anything about
the donor, and I don't know who it is.

1026
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,677
-I'm afraid I can't--
-I…

1027
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,597
read the article.

1028
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,561
Only a few pediatric heart transplants
are performed a year.

1029
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,857
The date he became a baby angel

1030
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,446
coincides with the date
when Eun-ji got the heart.

1031
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,200
The age and the region also seem to match.

1032
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,791
Professor Kim.

1033
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,673
While praying and waiting for months

1034
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,927
for Eun-ji to find the right donor heart,

1035
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:36,933
I was extremely anxious and worried.

1036
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:44,065
This is a huge blessing and miracle to us,

1037
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:50,404
but that family must be devastated.

1038
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,618
The fact that I prayed every single night
for this to happen…

1039
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,038
That really…

1040
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,583
breaks my heart.

1041
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,736
CERTIFICATE OF DONATION
SONG HAN-GYEOL

1042
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,114
It's a small amount,

1043
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,283
but we made the donation under his name.

1044
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,000
We're going to do it every year,

1045
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,463
and we will never forget him.
He'll forever remain alive in our hearts.

1046
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,968
Professor Kim.
Please make sure his family gets it.

1047
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,805
And please let them know…

1048
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,481
that I thank them
from the bottom of my heart.

1049
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,694
Their kindness and this gratitude I feel…

1050
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,531
It'll be engraved in my heart forever.

1051
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,411
I'll do my very best to raise Eun-ji

1052
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:23,080
to be a wonderful person
to make our baby angel proud.

1053
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,960
Please let them know.

1054
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,557
PATIENT ELEVATOR

1055
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,769
Could you please come this way
for a moment?

1056
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,329
He's at it again.
What is wrong with that man?

1057
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,837
What are you doing?

1058
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,344
Damn it, woman. Are you insane?

1059
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,513
Hey! What the hell?

1060
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,307
You little…

1061
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,353
Let go. I said, let go! Let go of me.

1062
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,854
-Let go.
-Stay still.

1063
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,356
-I said, let go!
-Stay still!

1064
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,858
Let go. Let go of me.

1065
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,194
-Let's talk outside.
-Let go!

1066
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,987
-You're dead meat.
-Are you all right?

1067
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,906
-Can you get up?
-We'll call the police.

1068
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,407
-I said, let go!
-Are you okay?

1069
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,409
-I'll sue you. Let go!
-Calm down!

1070
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,662
-Let go! Let go of me!
-Be quiet.

1071
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,706
Where do you think you're going?

1072
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,292
-Let go! Hey, you!
-We'll call the police.

1073
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,627
Let me go!

1074
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,433
Dr. Jang.

1075
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,104
Are you brave or reckless?

1076
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,022
I'm sorry.

1077
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,401
You don't need to apologize to me,

1078
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,029
but you're too brave for your own good.

1079
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,614
Why did you do that?

1080
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,576
What would you have done
had you hit your head on the floor?

1081
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:28,164
There's the emergency bell,
and the security guards were there too.

1082
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:32,793
You could have waited a moment.
Why step in right away?

1083
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,379
That's enough, Gwang-hyeon.
You should get back to work.

1084
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:37,548
Yes, I have to go anyway.

1085
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:40,217
The shoulder will hurt for a few days.

1086
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:44,388
You know that microfractures
may not show up in an X-ray, right?

1087
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,309
Try not to use the arm.
Take the meds, and let's see how it goes.

1088
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,981
-You should get going.
-All right. Gosh.

1089
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,545
I can't promise you…

1090
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,006
I won't do it again.

1091
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,761
He was hitting her.
How could I just stand back and watch?

1092
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:26,597
The security guards were there.

1093
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,642
You should have let them handle it.

1094
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:33,604
I didn't know that
the security guards were nearby.

1095
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,857
They're usually not on that floor.

1096
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,860
They've been there the whole week.

1097
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,030
Ik-jun asked the security team
to keep an eye on him.

1098
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,202
He told them he was suspecting
domestic violence,

1099
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,622
but the patient seemed too afraid
of her husband to tell us.

1100
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:52,706
And he asked them

1101
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,502
to send a few security guards
for this week, just in case.

1102
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,257
What's going on?

1103
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,228
The husband wipes the patient's face
with a warm cloth

1104
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:17,147
but doesn't care to know
about her treatment.

1105
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,820
And I saw her flinch every time
his hand came near her face.

1106
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:25,406
I contacted security for help last week
just in case.

1107
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,826
I told them I wasn't sure,
but asked them to send two guards.

1108
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:32,329
I figured I'd just let people
call me nosy if I was wrong.

1109
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,124
But when I was doing rounds earlier today,

1110
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,711
I noticed a bruise on her forehead.

1111
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,464
We should call the police.

1112
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,885
I wanted to talk to her about it first,

1113
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,471
so I pulled her aside and asked her.

1114
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:55,477
Are you in need of help, by any chance?

1115
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:02,943
We have a team that can help you.

1116
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,739
We can make sure
your husband won't find out.

1117
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,704
I'm sorry…

1118
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,249
but I'm okay.

1119
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,461
You got the wrong idea.

1120
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:26,550
Don't hesitate to let us know.

1121
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,553
We can help you right away
if you need help.

1122
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,306
We can make sure you're protected.

1123
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:34,850
Okay.

1124
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,356
I'm sorry, Professor Lee.

1125
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,776
Why are you sorry? It's not your fault.

1126
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,737
You're the victim.

1127
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,116
You have no reason to apologize,
whatsoever.

1128
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:02,294
Could you give me some time?

1129
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,173
Okay, sure.

1130
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,010
So what will happen
to Ms. Choi Eun-suk now?

1131
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,888
What if he wants her discharged…

1132
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,808
What if he wants to move her
to a different hospital?

1133
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,104
Ik-jun has moved her to the ICU.

1134
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,690
I see.

1135
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,403
Why didn't I think of that?

1136
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,281
That way, we can protect her.

1137
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:36,286
He's probably not allowing any visitors,
saying she needs absolute rest.

1138
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,289
He said he'd see how things go
for a couple of days

1139
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,875
and try to look for more ways to help her,

1140
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,837
so don't worry.
Ik-jun will take care of it.

1141
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:52,219
I was so worried, feeling daunted
and not knowing what to do.

1142
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,390
We can find a solution like this
now that everyone knows about it.

1143
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:00,352
When something bad happens,
you should tell others

1144
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,104
and ask for help.

1145
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:05,858
Okay.

1146
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,447
Gyeo-ul.

1147
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:17,244
Is there something
you should be telling me?

1148
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,837
No, everything's good.

1149
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,426
I'm glad to hear that.

1150
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:38,599
But if you're ever worried

1151
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:41,768
or stressed out about something,
just tell me.

1152
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,438
I may be able to help you.

1153
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,983
Okay, I will.

1154
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,986
But everything's fine at the moment.

1155
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,155
Except for the fact
that my patients suffer

1156
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:55,532
because I'm dumb and incompetent,

1157
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,784
everything's fine.

1158
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:13,550
Jang Gyeo-ul! Gyeo-ul!
Where are you, Gyeo-ul?

1159
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,553
Jang Gyeo-ul! Gyeo-ul!

1160
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:19,640
Gosh, my throat hurts.
Where are you, Gyeo-ul?

1161
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,310
Jang Gyeo-ul!

1162
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,563
Gyeo-ul, where are you?

1163
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,242
Are you a celebrity?

1164
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,372
No one will recognize you at the hospital.

1165
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,166
My friends aren't there today.

1166
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,671
I know. I just forgot to take it off.

1167
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,760
Why did you come to the airport?
I told you not to bother.

1168
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:59,471
It's not like I don't know where Yulje is.

1169
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,057
Well, I'm going to treat you like a baby
from now on.

1170
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,519
Just do as I say.

1171
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:08,146
The tests will take
about three to four hours,

1172
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,815
and the results will be right out.

1173
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,234
You'll probably be sent to Changwon
for treatment,

1174
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,361
but if the results don't look good,

1175
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,614
forget Jun-wan.
You'll be hospitalized right away, okay?

1176
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,825
All right, I'll do as you say.

1177
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,704
I'm scared too, you know.

1178
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,629
I miss U-ju. You should have brought him.

1179
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,258
U-ju and Uncle Jun-wan are close.

1180
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:45,809
Hey, don't tell me

1181
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:48,061
you're going to wait at the door

1182
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,188
or follow me in during my tests.

1183
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,983
No, don't you worry. I'll be in my office.

1184
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,586
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1185
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:15,672
Once hepatocirrhosis begins,
there's no going back.

1186
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,468
Especially in your case,

1187
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,512
hepatocirrhosis could pose a greater risk.

1188
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,606
Also, the inflammation in your bile duct
has gotten worse.

1189
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,275
I thought you took
good care of it in the UK.

1190
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,903
You had a fever a few times,
so you took your meds.

1191
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:41,073
The meds used to bring
the fever down right away.

1192
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,159
But when I had a fever recently,
the meds didn't really work.

1193
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,787
I had no idea it was due to
the inflammation.

1194
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:51,500
I just thought I was stressed
by being overseas, away from home.

1195
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,335
Weren't you really tired recently?

1196
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,836
Yes, I was.

1197
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,465
But I just thought
it was because I was getting older.

1198
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:00,175
I just thought,

1199
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:05,263
"I used to be full of energy,
but I guess I'm getting old too."

1200
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,393
I had no idea
it was because of hepatocirrhosis.

1201
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,854
It's still in its early stages,

1202
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,648
so let's get you treated.

1203
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,652
Eat Mom's home-cooked meals

1204
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:21,113
and think only about your health
for a year.

1205
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:22,739
All right.

1206
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,200
Let's go. Mom must be waiting.

1207
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,871
I told Mom and Dad

1208
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,748
so you can be comfortable at home.

1209
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:34,584
Yes, that's fine.
I was going to tell them anyway.

1210
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,297
I can just take a taxi to the terminal,
so we'll talk later.

1211
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,717
What are you talking about?

1212
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,095
I haven't seen Mom and Dad in a while,
so I'm going to Changwon with you.

1213
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:46,596
Just come with me.

1214
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,306
I'm really okay.

1215
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,683
So am I.

1216
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,650
Yes, I can come. I'm in a taxi now.

1217
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:02,070
-Sorry, could you drop me off at Yulje?
-Sure.

1218
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,572
What's the BP and saturation?

1219
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:05,615
BP, 50. Oxygen saturation is about 60.

1220
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,576
We just intubated the patient.

1221
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,911
Okay. I'm close by, so I can stop by now.

1222
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,580
All right, okay.

1223
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,594
What are you looking for?

1224
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,513
I bought a supplement for Mom,

1225
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,307
but I must have left it in my office.

1226
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,809
Wait here. I'll go get it quickly.

1227
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,187
"ALREADY ONE YEAR"
BROWN EYES

1228
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,044
Professor Kim!

1229
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:17,497
It just happened
I'll be okay in a few days

1230
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:21,835
I kept telling myself that
And it's already been a year

1231
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:26,423
Every time our anniversaries roll around

1232
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:30,176
Sadness finds me

1233
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:36,016
The excitement and the fluttering heart
When I confessed my love to you

1234
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:40,312
And the day we first met passes by

1235
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:44,900
Then your birthday comes along
I light the cake in tears

1236
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,862
And wish you a happy birthday

1237
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:58,079
Even though a year has passed already

1238
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:04,252
Even after another year
And yet another year

1239
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:08,214
I will be waiting for you

1240
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:09,799
She's decided to press charges.

1241
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,428
She called the insurance company
and changed the beneficiary to her mother.

1242
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,097
We're trying to find a caregiver for her.

1243
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,182
Really?

1244
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,645
My gosh, you made the right decision.

1245
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,315
Great. Just focus on your recovery now.

1246
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:26,524
Will do.

1247
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,237
I know I have terminal liver cancer,

1248
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:37,619
but I want to live in peace
even if I only have one more day to live.

1249
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,666
I just assumed

1250
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,753
no one would help me
even if I asked for help,

1251
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:52,258
but the social worker
and all the doctors and nurses here

1252
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:55,971
kept checking in on me

1253
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:01,226
and continued to give me advice,

1254
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:06,856
so I now know that I'm not alone.

1255
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:09,693
Thanks to you,

1256
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,488
I could finally muster up the courage.

1257
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,366
Thank you.

1258
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:22,414
Strawberry…

1259
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,290
This is hard.

1260
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,341
He asked me which mall I was going to

1261
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:35,385
and how I'd get there.

1262
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,096
That was so unlike him.

1263
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,017
But the fact
that he asked me those things…

1264
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:46,271
It's a green light for sure.

1265
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,986
I can do it. I got this.

1266
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,948
Hey!

1267
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,867
-Do you not know?
-One.

1268
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,035
Right! Kyoho grapes!

1269
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,881
Professor, I have a question.

1270
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,175
Okay, what is it?

1271
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:17,343
Can I…

1272
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,930
ask you out, just five times?

1273
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,562
If it doesn't make you uncomfortable,

1274
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:29,898
you'll let me do it, right?

1275
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:34,903
Well…

1276
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:43,203
I don't think it'll make me uncomfortable,

1277
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,248
but my answer will be no.

1278
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,212
But I haven't even done it yet.

1279
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,963
You can't reject me already.

1280
01:24:57,717 --> 01:24:59,135
Well, anyway…

1281
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:01,930
Then I can do it, right?

1282
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:05,266
Well, that's up to you.

1283
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,018
Then…

1284
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,106
I'll just ask you five times. That's it.

1285
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,401
Professor, I really like you.

1286
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,247
Do you want to go to the movies with me
this weekend?

1287
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,374
I'm going to a temple with my mom.

1288
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,585
I see. A temple…

1289
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:40,343
You have four attempts left.

1290
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:01,573
I want it cut short.

1291
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,033
How short?

1292
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,120
I want it very short. Cut them right off.

1293
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,330
Okay.

1294
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:18,298
I couldn't say I miss you so much
So please come back to me

1295
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:22,635
Not because of the warm look in his eyes
As he was looking at you

1296
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:27,223
Not because of the ring on your left hand

1297
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:31,227
But because of how happy you looked

1298
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:40,570
I know you've started over

1299
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:46,826
I know that you are now making memories

1300
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:52,040
Without me

1301
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:11,017
But the memories that fill my heart

1302
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,605
Are of our laughter, stories, and hopes

1303
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:20,401
And now I only have one new memory to make

1304
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:24,447
All the waiting and tears

1305
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:28,785
For you

1306
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,715
I know you've started over

1307
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:49,222
I know that you are now making memories

1308
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:53,726
Without me

1309
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:58,690
Even though a year has passed already

1310
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:05,238
Even after another year
And yet another year

1311
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:12,328
I will be waiting for you

1312
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,920
"Duty appointment order.

1313
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:23,589
According to Order 50
issued by Division 95,

1314
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:28,761
Major Lee Ik-sun is now stationed
in Division 95.

1315
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,514
April 22, 2020.

1316
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:35,435
The Commander of Division 95,
Major General Jeon Seong-hun."

1317
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,688
Salute Commander Jeon.

1318
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:40,189
Salute.

1319
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,317
Salute.

1320
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,401
At ease.

1321
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:51,034
TASTE OF SUMMER
COLD SOYBEAN NOODLE SOUP

1322
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,995
How are things in your unit?

1323
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,621
This one must be quite different.

1324
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,374
Yes, a little. It's a rearguard unit,

1325
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,001
so it's not like the one in Inje.

1326
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:02,253
-How's U-ju?
-He's doing great.

1327
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,131
Have you been seeing your doctor?

1328
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:12,388
It's nice being a soldier.
They gave you a month-long medical leave.

1329
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:14,432
I have to work harder now that I'm back.

1330
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,145
-Ik-jun.
-Yes.

1331
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,149
Stop visiting me in Changwon.
It's too much.

1332
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:32,033
And give me back my cherry tomato.

1333
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:36,245
You saw that?

1334
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:37,872
Yes.

1335
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,143
-Why is this so good?
-Should we order a few more?

1336
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,896
No, my stomach is turning
into an aquarium now.

1337
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:03,689
Any plans for Christmas?

1338
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:06,275
Christmas? The leaves
haven't even turned colors yet.

1339
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:09,028
What about you?
Have you ever been off on Christmas Day?

1340
01:30:09,112 --> 01:30:10,863
This year, I will be. No matter what.

1341
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:12,448
That's all good,

1342
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:15,535
but leave me out of your plans.
I don't want to see you.

1343
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,874
Gosh, why is this so good?

1344
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:28,548
I can't believe you're here again.
Seriously?

1345
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:33,511
I came to see Mom and Dad, not you.

1346
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,097
-Where is U-ju?
-At a ski camp.

1347
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,598
He went with Mo-ne and her dad.

1348
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,433
It's for four days, so I couldn't go.

1349
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:42,562
I bet U-ju wasn't sad at all
about you not being there.

1350
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,272
Right, he only cares about Mo-ne.

1351
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:47,567
He was so excited.
He didn't even turn around once.

1352
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,944
U-ju is all grown up now. He's so mature.

1353
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:52,905
I want to go skiing too.
Can't I go on trips now?

1354
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:55,241
Your liver index is higher.

1355
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,120
How did you know?

1356
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,621
I asked your doctor.

1357
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:04,250
-Does my doctor report to you every day?
-No, I ask your doctor every day.

1358
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,294
Stop bugging me and go date someone.

1359
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:07,628
U-ju is more mature than you.

1360
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:11,257
I will. Gosh, why would you
even be worried about that?

1361
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:16,304
KIM JUN-WAN

1362
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,685
Hey. What's up?

1363
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:58,763
U-ju, wash your hands thoroughly
until the color changes, okay?

1364
01:31:58,846 --> 01:31:59,722
Okay!

1365
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:20,326
U-ju, you're already seven.

1366
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:22,536
This is hard to believe.

1367
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,330
Lucky seven. It's a lucky age.

1368
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:27,500
So you're the oldest kid
at the kindergarten now.

1369
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:31,128
Are you happy to be back?

1370
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,589
Yes, I am. I get to see Mo-ne.

1371
01:32:34,423 --> 01:32:36,008
But you see Mo-ne every day.

1372
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:39,011
I do, but I'm still happy to see Mo-ne
every day.

1373
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,097
Just like how I'm happy
to see you every day.

1374
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,016
Oh, my heart!

1375
01:33:05,204 --> 01:33:06,330
My gosh.

1376
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:13,546
Dad, is it a new semester
at the hospital too?

1377
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:15,256
Yes, you could say that.

1378
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:16,924
Will you meet many new friends?

1379
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:21,387
Yes, so many.
From new interns to new residents.

1380
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:26,517
And my old friend is coming back too.

1381
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,102
"Old friend"?

1382
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:01,010
I knew you'd be here already.

1383
01:34:01,093 --> 01:34:02,887
Ta-da! It's for you.

1384
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,430
Flowers?

1385
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:06,932
My eldest brother is
really into gardening these days.

1386
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:09,352
Let me know if you want more.
I have a ton.

1387
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:10,519
All right.

1388
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:13,898
How's your neck?

1389
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,692
It's much better now.

1390
01:34:19,403 --> 01:34:20,613
Where is Jun-wan?

1391
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:23,449
Didn't you come in together?

1392
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:25,951
Welcome back.

1393
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:27,578
Thanks.

1394
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:29,497
-I have surgery. See you later.
-Okay.

1395
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:32,958
Why does it have to rain so much?

1396
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,796
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

1397
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,188
The good old days are behind you now.

1398
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:58,818
You're in trouble now.

1399
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:02,655
See you. Hey, look.

1400
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:05,282
Even the sky is crying for you.

1401
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:16,085
Let's go eat.

1402
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,004
-Sure.
-Come on.

1403
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:20,381
Okay.

1404
01:35:22,716 --> 01:35:24,343
It's raining.

1405
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:25,970
I see that.

1406
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:29,348
My gosh, I love it.

1407
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,641
Let's go.

1408
01:35:30,724 --> 01:35:33,436
How about we have breakfast quickly
and watch the rain?

1409
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:34,854
Yes, let's do that.

1410
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:40,586
The new interns who are scarier
than the devil have arrived.

1411
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:42,129
-Hello Professor.
-Hello.

1412
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:45,382
Interns only need to do what
the professors tell them to do.

1413
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:49,595
I've always worked alone,
but now I'm happy to have lots of interns.

1414
01:36:49,678 --> 01:36:53,682
The professors said that they'll guarantee
the quality of life of residents.

1415
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:55,851
Cardiology is trying to
reduce the work hours.

1416
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:57,728
Are you on night duty every day?

1417
01:36:57,811 --> 01:37:00,356
March is a difficult month.
You're just starting out.

1418
01:37:00,439 --> 01:37:04,818
-Were you ever a stupid intern?
-I did a lot of stupid things.

1419
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:07,530
-It's all in the past.
-Why you little…

1420
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:11,325
-That was when I was an intern.
-All right. Fine.

1421
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:14,787
Yes, I'll give it a try.

1422
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,709
Professor.

1423
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,424
I'm a resident, yet I still make mistakes.

1424
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,385
I don't seem to have improved at all.

1425
01:37:29,468 --> 01:37:32,137
No one is at fault here.

1426
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:33,430
It just happened.

1427
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,767
You're doing fine and you'll do better.
You just need more time.

1428
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:38,018
I'll do my best.

1429
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:42,773
