1
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,936
You can get the lights
back up today, right?

2
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,273
Seok-hyeong, I'm holding a cup of coffee.

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
Sorry.

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,869
How long has this place been empty?

5
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,954
Gosh, look at all this dust.

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,834
-About three to four years?
-Gosh.

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,424
I feel like I'm in a club.

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,427
That light will burn out soon.

9
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,637
Goodness.

10
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,188
Mom, the power went out again.

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,315
Can you get a technician quickly?

12
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,733
I see.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,943
He'll be here shortly, then.

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,612
Okay.

15
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,075
Why didn't you also ask her
if it's okay for you to drink coffee?

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,618
She said one cup a day is okay.

17
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,999
You haven't thrown those out yet.

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,375
Why would I throw them out?

19
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,212
By the way,
are you really not going to do it?

20
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,006
Gosh, no. Of course not.

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
Then why are you here?

22
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,927
To see you. I was worried about you.

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,762
Then just do it.

24
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,806
You just need Ik-jun.

25
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,891
You don't need me.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,101
He said no.

27
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,937
Seriously? He won't?

28
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,732
I won't do it either.

29
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,694
I don't have time anyway.
I need to help my guys with their thesis.

30
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,364
-Help me too.
-Why should I?

31
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,867
By the way, did you see Ji-eun today?

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,494
Yes.

33
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,955
Did you buy her things that she likes?

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,581
I bought her some food

35
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,127
and gave her a Bluetooth speaker
so that she can listen to music.

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,171
If only you were half as nice as that
to your friends.

37
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,799
Did the lights go out again?

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,886
Yes. This one was flickering
for a bit and burned out.

39
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,474
Gosh, it looks like
you probably should redo all the wiring.

40
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,685
We'll get this working temporarily,

41
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,728
-but call a bigger company if it reoccurs.
-Okay.

42
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,898
You could've worked on my room tomorrow.
You didn't have to work so late.

43
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,275
Thank you.

44
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,943
-All right.
-Oh, no.

45
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
Be careful, sir.

46
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,031
Sir, you should shut off the breaker
before you do that.

47
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,784
You're not even wearing gloves.
You'll get an electric shock.

48
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,123
Call an ambulance.

49
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,839
Are you all right? Are you in pain?

50
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,593
Hello? The address here
is 33-1 Jogang-dong.

51
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,261
A man collapsed due to an electric shock.

52
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,555
Get here quickly, please.
As soon as possible.

53
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,473
Are you having difficulty breathing?

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,478
My goodness. What's happening?

55
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,771
Goodness.

56
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh, no. What's happening to him?

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,328
Here!

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,204
We're here!

59
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,956
Here!

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,166
Sir.

61
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,710
Sir?

62
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,923
Sir, do you know where you are now?

63
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,556
Just leave him there, please.
You did great.

64
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,986
Hey, I'll be back soon.

65
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,158
He had an electric shock seven minutes ago
and got a mild burn on his right hand.

66
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,910
I performed CPR for two minutes.

67
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,537
His heart is pumping again,
but it's not stable yet.

68
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,248
-Are you a doctor?
-Yes.

69
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,793
His vitals seem unstable.

70
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,212
-Could you come with us?
-I got an emergency call.

71
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,339
Another doctor will accompany you.

72
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,134
That one.

73
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,222
Are you all right?

74
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,519
You were extremely lucky, man.

75
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,729
Both of them happened to be doctors.

76
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,065
You can hear me, right?

77
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,074
Both his BP and pulse are okay now.

78
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,450
I see.

79
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
Why is he shivering like this though?

80
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,125
Hey, are you okay?

81
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,010
He's just cold.

82
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,390
Excuse me.
Can you please turn up the heater?

83
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
Can you message him or something?

84
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,023
Tell him to jack up the heater.

85
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,249
Seok-hyeong texted you, right?
I said I'd do it.

86
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,002
-My answer is no.
-So, you got his text?

87
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,879
No, that's what I'll say if he does.

88
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,006
I mean, aren't we too old for that?

89
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,301
I'd much rather go see my girlfriend.
Why would I see you guys?

90
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,803
Hey, are you getting engaged today
or something?

91
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,972
Why get all dressed up
just to see your girlfriend?

92
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,434
I made a reservation at a romantic place
in Busan with an ocean view.

93
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,146
Good for you. You're going on a date,
while I'm just going to work.

94
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,524
-By the way, how will you get there?
-By my girlfriend's car.

95
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,569
There she is. Pull over.

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,949
It looks like she's still drunk.

97
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,535
She pulled an all-nighter.
And we're leaving right away.

98
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,496
-Hey, you should drive.
-All right.

99
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,997
-Hey.
-Yes.

100
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,333
Work hard.

101
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,168
You prick.

102
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,836
According to my research,

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,713
Daeseong Hospital uses

104
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,426
a non-surgical procedure
to treat intussusception.

105
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,137
I've explained to you just now.

106
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,599
As for Bit-na, it's likely that necrosis
has already begun.

107
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,392
So surgery is the only option, ma'am.

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,771
You're sure, right?
Can she actually undergo the surgery?

109
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,190
She definitely needs the surgery, ma'am.

110
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,153
I read on the Internet that it stops kids
from growing taller after the surgery.

111
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,614
Don't believe things like that.

112
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,825
Just go to the reception
and have them book her surgery.

113
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,535
Okay.

114
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,579
-Then I'll trust you and--
-According to my research,

115
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,875
Daeseong Hospital
uses a non-surgical procedure to treat...

116
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,254
Do we have a room for Bit-na?
Call the ward again.

117
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,213
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,715
Please take good care of Bit-na.

119
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
-Thank you.
-No problem.

120
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,808
Dong-min, can we pull up your top
for a moment?

121
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,270
Just once, please.

122
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,984
My gosh, Teddy Bear.
You're here because of a stomachache?

123
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,694
Let me have a look.

124
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:29,282
Yes, doctor. My stomach hurts so much.

125
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,992
Let's see. What?

126
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,371
Wow, this took all the pain away.
You're totally fine now, right?

127
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
Yes, I'm fine now.

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,792
All right, then.

129
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,296
Let's check your mom's stomach now.

130
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,632
Doctor, I already feel much better.

131
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,217
I'm totally fine now.

132
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,972
All right. Then who's next?

133
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,601
-Dong-min, you want to try it?
-You want to go next?

134
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,438
Let's see. Good boy.
You're such a good boy.

135
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,613
Is this Busan?

136
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,948
I bet I got here before you did.

137
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,408
Let's have dinner together.

138
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,202
Okay. I just need to check
on a patient first.

139
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,537
-Doors are closing.
-Take it easy.

140
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,957
Who's in charge of Room 513?

141
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,544
Then who worked last night? You?

142
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,632
Who prescribed the fever reducer
to Kim Suk-hui in Room 513?

143
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,884
-It must've been you.
-No, it wasn't me.

144
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,011
Then was it you?

145
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,431
No, not a chance. I don't even know
what she looks like.

146
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,974
Right? You've never even seen her.

147
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,852
You prescribed it without even seeing her
because you wanted to sleep.

148
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,105
How dare you prescribe without seeing her?

149
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,274
Are you that confident as a doctor?

150
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,861
If you don't want to be a doctor,
just tell me. Don't waste my time.

151
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,696
Do you understand?

152
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,032
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

153
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,410
Hey.

154
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,788
Why all of a sudden?

155
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,581
Okay, I'll be right there.

156
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,835
Come on! Let's go.

157
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,303
Dr. Kim, the patient was hooked up
to the ECMO,

158
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,265
but she developed pulmonary edema,
so we intubated her.

159
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,725
We looked at the echo
but her heart was barely beating.

160
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,811
But Eun-a was okay up until yesterday.

161
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,021
We were going to remove ECMO
and move her to the ward.

162
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,440
-Does her family know?
-Yes.

163
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,703
Please spare us a moment, ma'am.

164
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,291
Eun-a has developed pulmonary edema
as her heart is not functioning well.

165
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,917
ECMO isn't enough anymore.

166
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,587
An artificial heart will be better

167
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,839
in reducing the pressure
on her left ventricle.

168
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,091
She needs surgery
either today or tomorrow.

169
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,801
My gosh, what should I do?

170
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,264
Doctor, we can't afford to pay
for the surgery at the moment.

171
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
It'll cost a fortune.

172
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,393
Where can I get the money?

173
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,104
Doctor, please give me a week.

174
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,898
Then I'll figure out a way
to get some money no matter what.

175
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,776
Please... My Eun-a...

176
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,362
Please save her.

177
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,574
We can't really wait though.
She needs surgery immediately.

178
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,117
If we wait, she may not make it.

179
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,952
What do I do, then?

180
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,206
Don't worry. We have many programs
to support our patients,

181
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,585
so I'm sure Eun-a can get the surgery.
And we can do it right away.

182
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,128
Hey, look into it.

183
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,344
-Hey, call them now.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,262
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY CHAT ROOM

185
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,806
5-YEAR-OLD GIRL, DCMP
WHERE SHOULD I CALL?

186
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,937
I have to do the surgery
and take care of this?

187
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,230
What do you do?

188
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,902
Hello? This is Kim Jun-wan
from Cardiothoracic Surgery.

189
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,863
Can we get some help
from the Daddy-Long-Legs Program?

190
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,491
Just a second, please.

191
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,537
SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE

192
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,584
Hello. I'm Lee Seok-hyeon,
a cardiothoracic surgery resident.

193
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,087
Could you help one of our patients
with her surgery costs?

194
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,507
We can't wait.
She needs surgery immediately.

195
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,594
Yes, can the Daddy-Long-Legs Program
help her finance it?

196
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,638
She's five.

197
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,182
It's for implanting
a ventricular assist device.

198
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,899
What did you order?
Did you order tteokbokki again?

199
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,234
When can we find out?

200
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,735
Go ahead and eat.

201
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,655
Hey, why didn't you order burgers instead?

202
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,949
I got level one, so it won't be spicy.
Just eat, will you?

203
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,367
You haven't texted them yet?

204
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,745
We had to do some final checks.
We'll text them now.

205
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,499
If everything looks good,
you'll get the money in a couple of days.

206
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,503
I see. Please let me know
as soon as you hear from them. Thank you.

207
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,839
It's not spicy, right?

208
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,425
You don't find this spicy?
You need to see a doctor.

209
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,759
No, that will cost me.

210
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,639
I'll probably get a call soon.

211
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,392
-See? Tteokbokki was a good call.
-Just answer that, prick.

212
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,769
Gosh, today's been a disaster.

213
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,691
Hey, I'm still at the hospital.

214
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,234
I'm going to leave now.

215
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,069
Yes, where are you?

216
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,574
Why? I didn't eat anything. Right.

217
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,491
Of course.

218
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,535
-Where are you?
-What do you think?

219
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,412
What are you doing this weekend?

220
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,664
I've got a date.
Professor Jang is free this weekend.

221
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,125
Everyone's going on a date.

222
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,085
Is Jun-wan still seeing that girl?

223
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,795
This one's lasting for a while.

224
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,922
Why did you call?
I bet it's about Seok-hyeong.

225
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,424
I already said no.

226
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,718
No. As for that fool,
we can just ignore him.

227
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,429
I have a favor to ask.

228
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,223
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, everything's fine.

229
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,267
There's something I've been working on.

230
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,854
You know what? Let's talk in person.
You should go home.

231
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,731
I'm going home early for a change.

232
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,443
-What's up?
-Min-yeong's vitals aren't looking good.

233
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,694
I have to go.

234
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,863
-What's going on?
-Her BP keeps dropping.

235
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,407
It's not getting better
even after a full 100ml bag of saline.

236
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,952
-Has she gotten norepinephrine?
-Yes, but her vitals are still unstable.

237
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,957
It doesn't sound like
you can go home tonight.

238
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,845
YULJE'S CHAIRMAN AHN BYEONG-U
UNCONSCIOUS DUE TO BRAIN HEMORRHAGE

239
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,639
CHAIRMAN AHN HAS FALLEN INTO A COMA

240
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,520
WILL HIS THIRD SON TAKE OVER
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER?

241
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,400
ALL EYES ARE ON WHO WILL BE
THE NEXT LEADER OF YULJE FOUNDATION

242
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,239
Yes, sir.

243
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,492
I read the article.

244
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,869
I have to stay
with the chairman all night.

245
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,206
So take care of the craniectomy
for the subdural hematoma patient,

246
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,083
as well as the VP shunt surgery tomorrow.

247
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,543
Yes, sir.

248
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,962
But are you all right?

249
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,799
No, everyone's getting ready
for the worst-case scenario. It's hard.

250
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,361
-Hello, how are you?
-Not well, obviously.

251
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,072
My apologies, ma'am.

252
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,074
No need to apologize. It is what it is.

253
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,325
Don't worry about it.

254
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,786
He's the director of the hospital.

255
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,831
And he is in charge of the Brain Center.

256
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,791
Is that important now?

257
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,836
Right. It's nice to meet you anyway.

258
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,172
Will he not make it?

259
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,675
Frankly, it won't be easy.

260
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,427
But we'll do our very best.

261
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,095
Mr. Pyeon, you're here.

262
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,848
What on earth happened?

263
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,894
Ma'am, please spare me a moment.

264
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,029
Mr. Ju, why don't we have some coffee
in my office?

265
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,448
Don't worry about things here.

266
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,200
DIRECTOR JU JEON

267
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,458
-Hey, come and have some coffee.
-Oh, I was going to do it.

268
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,126
What's the point of saying that now?

269
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,879
Hey, come join us.

270
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,804
The night view is awesome.

271
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,974
Can you actually enjoy
the night view right now?

272
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,770
That punk who's still wet behind the ears
is about to inherit the hospital.

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,772
He's 40. He's not that young.

274
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,649
Will the hospital

275
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,652
fall into the hands
of his youngest son who's a doctor?

276
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,654
I bet he hasn't even written his will yet.

277
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,030
Even if he has one,

278
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,199
the board will have to vote
to make the decision.

279
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,494
But they may vote
to appoint Mr. Ju to the position.

280
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,623
I think you should call
the board members, ma'am.

281
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,250
Even better
if Andrea can call them himself.

282
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,924
I'm sure things will go smoothly,
but just in case. I mean, you never know.

283
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,844
I suggest you call Chairman Hwang
first thing tomorrow.

284
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,930
It's because of Mr. Ju, isn't it?

285
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,767
All the board members
are Chairman Ahn's people.

286
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,437
The other members tend to follow
Chairman Hwang's lead.

287
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,064
He's Chairman Ahn's friend for 30 years.

288
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,026
Chairman Ahn's wife just needs
to make one phone call to him.

289
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,611
Then it's game over.

290
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,907
Chairman Ahn is such a wonderful person.

291
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,828
But he, too, is a greedy man after all.

292
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,247
You can't call him greedy for this.

293
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,708
He's donated most of his assets.

294
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,920
Why did you pick the foundation
to begin with?

295
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,465
As for all the other subsidiaries,
they hired management specialists.

296
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,679
Jeez, I thought I'd ride on my cousin's
coattails for the first time ever.

297
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,475
We don't know yet.

298
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,314
I should do my best.

299
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,945
I called them a while ago.
Why aren't they here yet?

300
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,239
I taught my children wrong.

301
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,116
There he is.

302
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,498
Where did Mr. Ju go?

303
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,542
He probably went to see his wife.

304
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,589
What an eventful year
this has been for him.

305
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,176
By the way,

306
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,095
why would Chairman Ahn pass
the hospital down to his youngest son?

307
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,638
I heard he has three sons.

308
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,184
Did the elder ones cause trouble
or something?

309
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,019
Is next week your last week here?

310
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,021
-Yes.
-Back to your hometown?

311
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,941
I suppose you really have no interest
in worldly matters.

312
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,235
Even little kids would know
the answer to that.

313
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,613
As for his eldest son,

314
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,574
he's too busy with his current job.

315
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,120
Hello.

316
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,957
Hey, you came.

317
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,293
Hi.

318
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,838
Mom, are you all right?

319
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,884
-What about his second son?
-He assists someone who's very high up.

320
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,865
Doesn't he also have a daughter?

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,701
She's the same.

322
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,376
It's been a while.

323
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,088
Dad...

324
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,883
His second daughter too?

325
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,691
Is my youngest coming or what?

326
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,944
At this rate, he'll get here
after your dad's funeral.

327
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:18,031
Mom, Andrea is in the elevator now.

328
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,201
Finally. Your brothers and sisters are
all here.

329
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,842
Spare me a second.

330
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,594
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

331
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,888
-You told him, right?
-Yes.

332
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,640
It would be a good idea to call him now.

333
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,560
I know it's late, but he'll answer
because he's a businessman.

334
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,228
I told him to call him right away.

335
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,273
He's the only one
that actually listens to my advice.

336
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,192
He's the most reasonable of them all.

337
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,820
The number you've called is busy.
Please leave a message...

338
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,364
He's been on the phone
for so long already.

339
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,161
You probably didn't get any sleep.
Go get some sleep.

340
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,293
Do you smoke?

341
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,128
Since when?

342
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,549
Jeez, you're a doctor.
You shouldn't be smoking. My goodness.

343
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,552
Good.

344
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,889
Mom, he smokes.

345
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,974
I taught him how to smoke 20 years ago.

346
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,145
Did you talk to him?

347
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,393
-Have a good day.
-Thanks, you too.

348
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,631
Ground floor.

349
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,294
Such injuries can cause mild bruises
and even serious adverse effects.

350
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,005
It tends to happen more often
at nighttime.

351
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,258
So if you're a guardian, keep an eye
on the patient you're looking after.

352
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,386
If you're a patient
on high-risk medication,

353
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,890
or if you need to leave your bed
at nighttime,

354
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,768
please make sure
you're accompanied by your guardian

355
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,772
or call your nurse for help.

356
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,358
Yulje Medical Center
will always do its best

357
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,653
to ensure all patients' fast recovery.
Thank you.

358
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,238
PROFESSOR OF NEUROSURGERY
CHAE SONG-HWA

359
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,949
All right. Open your mouth like this.

360
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,830
How does this feel?

361
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,123
Both your left and right sides.

362
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,501
-Both feel good.
-I see.

363
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,212
I was worried you might experience
facial palsy, but it looks good.

364
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,588
You're doing great.

365
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,926
As for your medication,
I'll keep you on the same routine.

366
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,844
You can come back in three months.

367
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,387
Thank you for coming all the way here.

368
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,972
Thank you.

369
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,184
Well, I have something for you.

370
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,103
It's just something small.

371
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,814
It's a great book, so I got one for you.

372
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,275
Isn't this book amazing? I have one.

373
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,777
You read it too, right?

374
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,321
Yes, I've read it too.

375
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,368
-My favorite.
-I see. You've already read it.

376
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,954
My husband told me to give it to you.

377
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,206
All right, then.
I'll see you in three months.

378
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,124
Okay.

379
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,506
-Hello, doctor.
-Hello, have a seat here.

380
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
Mom, sit here.

381
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,679
We have the results.

382
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,685
A lump was seen on your CT scan,
so you got an MRI done.

383
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,314
Unfortunately,
it looks like it might be cancerous,

384
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,024
so we'll have to do a biopsy.

385
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,904
You aren't young,

386
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,657
and the location of the tumor isn't ideal,

387
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,160
so it'll be quite difficult
to remove it surgically.

388
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,582
You must've been experiencing
severe headaches though.

389
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,500
How did you endure the pain?

390
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,963
Can it be treated by surgery, doctor?

391
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,551
No, she needs chemotherapy
or radiation therapy.

392
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,304
But before that, we need to do a biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis.

393
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,891
I'm suspecting that it's neuroglioma.
If I'm right,

394
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,767
and if it's not too bad
like grade one or two,

395
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,437
the survival rate will be high.
Even just with radiation therapy.

396
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,064
If it's grade three or four,

397
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,610
we'll have to combine chemotherapy
with radiation therapy.

398
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,445
But the recurrence rate

399
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,364
and the survival rate
will be substantially lower.

400
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,533
My gosh.

401
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,994
What do we do?

402
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,787
Mom.

403
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,706
Mom.

404
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,584
Gosh, my poor mom.

405
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,461
It's okay.

406
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,090
I've lived long enough, so I'm fine.

407
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,926
Gosh, I don't want to hear it.

408
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,306
Oh, Ma'am. It can be treated.

409
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,475
Please don't cry... Oh, my.

410
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,480
First, let's get her admitted
so that we can do a biopsy.

411
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,691
I'll explain the plan in more detail
when we have the results.

412
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,611
You need to stay strong for your mother.

413
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,114
I'm sorry, doctor.

414
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,908
Thank you.

415
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,410
Thank you.

416
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,544
I feel bad.

417
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,510
By the way, that patient's daughter.
Doesn't she look familiar?

418
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,471
I feel like I've seen her somewhere.

419
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,225
KANGWOON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER
PEDIATRIC ICU

420
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,063
Gosh, another skin tear?

421
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,485
Doctor, that last one
took a long time to heal.

422
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,778
My goodness.

423
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,990
Min-yeong, it must be stinging.

424
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,159
-I'll tell him off.
-Her skin is delicate,

425
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,953
and she had it on for too long.

426
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,621
My daughter can feel pain too, you know.

427
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,332
Right, I'll be careful from now on.

428
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,751
When is the professor coming?

429
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:31,131
What he prescribed yesterday is so
different from what she got last month.

430
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,719
She takes Vitamin K and traces elements
every Thursday. Why doesn't she anymore?

431
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,430
And as for the blood tests,

432
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,599
you used to draw 30ml.
Why do you need 70ml now?

433
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,894
-She's already exhausted.
-I explained everything to you before.

434
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,857
-Min-yeong is no longer...
-Min-yeong.

435
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,571
Hi, Min-yeong.

436
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,326
Doctor, why did her prescription change?

437
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,746
And last month, she was
on the TPN drip for 16 hours last month.

438
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,247
Why is it shorter now?

439
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:09,794
And don't you think she looks like
she's having trouble breathing?

440
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,007
She keeps grimacing too.
Something must be bothering her.

441
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,637
Ma'am, Min-yeong doesn't have the strength
to hold out for much longer.

442
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,475
I'm sure Dr. Jo already told you,

443
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,729
but we should start mentally preparing--

444
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,106
What's the problem?
I did everything you told me to do.

445
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,484
She was doing great yesterday.

446
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,195
Were her vitals good yesterday?

447
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,199
-They were about the same as today.
-You doctors rarely see her.

448
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,867
I know much better than you.
I'm her mother.

449
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,953
Then I'll have Dr. Jo monitor her
all day today.

450
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,164
Call me right away if anything happens.

451
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:47,999
Yes, sir.

452
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
Min-yeong.

453
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,089
Min-yeong.

454
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,424
I'm so sorry.

455
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,468
I'm sorry, Min-yeong.

456
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,472
I'm so sorry
that you have to suffer like this.

457
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,058
I'm really sorry, Min-yeong.

458
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,144
My sweet daughter, I'm so sorry.

459
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,938
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

460
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,982
Is BP low?
How much norepinephrine did you use?

461
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,318
-We're scaling it up.
-I'll do it!

462
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,445
My son is waiting for a liver transplant.

463
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,824
I see. That's why you looked familiar.

464
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,620
He was in and out of the hospital
all the time for six months.

465
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,873
He practically lived here.

466
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,083
Then three days ago,

467
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,670
his condition suddenly worsened.

468
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,882
My son...

469
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,720
I guess I should give up now.

470
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,346
No, don't say that.

471
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,349
Ma'am, he can get better.

472
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,395
I was so preoccupied with my son
and his illness

473
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,648
that I had no idea
that my mother was also ill.

474
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,275
It's all my fault.

475
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,070
What kind of mother would think
of something else

476
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,199
when her son is critically ill?

477
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,744
No one can blame you, ma'am.

478
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,920
DID YOU MAKE DINNER FOR MY MOM?
COME HOME NOW!

479
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,349
Doctor.

480
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,437
I'm pretty sure I'm the unluckiest woman
in the whole wide world.

481
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,065
I put up with my in-laws for 40 years,

482
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,191
and my husband

483
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,695
spilled every last penny we had
into his darned business.

484
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,114
And my one and only son...

485
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,161
He has a heart of gold, so he's the one
that got me through everything.

486
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,207
I must be cursed or something.

487
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,168
I guess that's why both my mom
and my son ended up like that.

488
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,920
I'm telling you.

489
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,423
I've been so unlucky in life.

490
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,428
Seriously, I don't even want to live.

491
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,431
Not even one bit.

492
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,101
I just want to end my life.

493
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,068
Doors are opening.

494
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,239
Take the next one.

495
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,907
Okay.

496
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,119
Doors are closing.

497
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,140
ICED AMERICANO FOR ME

498
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,233
I performed your mom's brain surgery.

499
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,777
Shouldn't you be buying me coffee,
not the other way around?

500
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,114
When your dad came to the ER at night
with a broken leg,

501
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,784
I ran to the ER even though I was off
that night. And what? Just iced Americano?

502
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,661
It should be good enough.

503
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,331
If I get you something better,
it'll make you uncomfortable.

504
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,124
You have such a way with words.

505
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,626
I guess the ER isn't busy today.

506
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,544
You had time
to go to the convenience store.

507
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,880
Watch what you say.
You should never say that.

508
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,132
Near Bupyeong IC
on the Gyeongin Expressway,

509
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,719
four vehicles, including a one-ton truck,
have collided.

510
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,347
In total, six people,
including the 52-year-old truck driver,

511
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,432
got critically injured in the accident.

512
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,101
-They're being transferred...
-They'll get here soon. I have to go.

513
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,313
Two of them
are said to be fatally injured.

514
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,649
The Gyeongin Expressway
is partially restricted...

515
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,534
He was found barely conscious.

516
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,746
When we got there, his BP was 60 over 30.
And his oxygen saturation was around 70.

517
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,127
He's bled a lot due to a scalp laceration.

518
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,256
Get him ready for an IV
and give him normal saline.

519
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:48,883
What?

520
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,521
Doctor.

521
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,231
Doctor.

522
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,443
My son can finally get the surgery.

523
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,821
Is this a dream? I still can't believe it.

524
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,490
I almost gave up,
because he was only third in line.

525
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,867
My gosh, is this really happening?

526
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,954
I heard the patients before him
can't get the surgery anymore.

527
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,955
Thank you, God.

528
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,417
That's such amazing news.
I'm so happy for you, ma'am.

529
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,338
But I have to say, I feel so bad
for the ones who passed away.

530
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,510
I'm not sure if it's okay for me
to feel this happy.

531
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,889
I guess we're all selfish after all.

532
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,475
Who's your son's doctor?

533
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,270
He's very famous.

534
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,898
What's that show called?
Good Doctors. He was on that show.

535
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,568
-Dr. Kwon Sun-jeong?
-Yes, that's right.

536
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,320
He and I are close. He's a great doctor.

537
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,742
Wait. I think he's away today though.

538
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,118
He already heard the news.

539
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,996
He'll come back as soon as
he finishes the surgery in Milyang.

540
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,833
He also said he'll operate on my son
as soon as he returns.

541
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,253
But... Poor him. He'll be exhausted.

542
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,296
I see.

543
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,797
Is that what's happening?

544
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,925
Doctor, there's another patient
over there.

545
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,927
This kid put super glue all over a helmet,

546
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,388
and his dad wore the helmet
because he had no idea.

547
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,141
Now, the helmet is stuck on his head.
He can't take it off.

548
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,603
He needs to be looked at immediately.
Can you take him in first?

549
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,023
But then I'm dealing with an emergency
case now. Please wait.

550
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,025
This is an emergency case too!

551
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,904
He's embarrassed to death right now.

552
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,614
Excuse me. Coming through!

553
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,579
Sir, shall we go to a different hospital?

554
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,957
Where are you going, sir?
They haven't called your name yet.

555
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,667
U-ju, stop your dad.

556
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,129
Daddy is fuming mad.
He said he'll knock them all down.

557
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,892
Professor Kwon, what happened?

558
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,728
I didn't dislocate my shoulder,
so don't worry too much.

559
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,689
I can't really move my fingers,

560
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,525
so it's probably a radius fracture.

561
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,777
Get an X-ray done and call Orthopedics.

562
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,904
-What about Neurosurgery?
-I'm here.

563
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,740
Hey, you.

564
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,833
This is bad.

565
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,294
Professor Kwon, what about the surgery?

566
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,504
How do you know about it?

567
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,674
You should call another professor at once.
The patient needs surgery immediately.

568
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,760
Had there been someone else, I wouldn't
have come here after an all-nighter.

569
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,263
There's no one.

570
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,682
Send the patient to another hospital.

571
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,227
If we say we can't do the surgery,
they'll just want to take the liver.

572
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,146
This is his last chance.

573
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,566
A long midline incision is required,
so it won't be an easy operation.

574
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,693
Gosh, this is nuts.

575
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,368
Let's do this.

576
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,078
How?

577
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,082
We have him.

578
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,794
Me? Hey.

579
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,963
I am double board-certified,

580
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,507
but I haven't dealt with any operations
for over five years.

581
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,760
Transplant surgery is no joke.

582
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,053
I'm not talking about you.

583
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,097
Gosh.

584
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:09,810
Crap.

585
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,816
This is... Oh, right. U-ju, say hello.

586
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,944
They're Daddy's friends. Good boy.

587
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,580
But...

588
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,667
What if the director finds out?
Are we going to be okay?

589
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,418
Dr. Chae said she sorted everything out.

590
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,047
But we need to get his mother's consent
and explain everything to her.

591
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,634
Dr. Chae knows her well,
so she got her to sign it in five minutes.

592
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:45,680
Still, wouldn't this upset his doctor?
I mean, I would be.

593
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,516
Dr. Chae already talked to him
and got him on board.

594
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,019
What the heck?

595
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,981
She should get this off my head
if she has all that time.

596
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,319
Thank you all in advance.

597
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,823
Let's save this patient.

598
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,579

603
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,816
Yes. Hello, sir.

604
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,069
Dr. Chae,
you're still at the hospital, right?

605
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,070
Yes.

606
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,488
He didn't make it.

607
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,324
Kim Dong-hyeok's surgery didn't go well?

608
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,494
What are you talking about?
The chairman passed away.

609
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,245
I see.

610
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,415
His funeral will take place in Room 201.
You head over there first.

611
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,418
I came home to get changed.
I'll be there shortly.

612
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,837
Yes, sir. Will do.

613
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,360
CHAIRMAN AHN BYEONG-U
HAS PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF 78.

614
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,659
Hello.

615
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,715
I'm so sorry for your loss, ma'am.

616
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,761
You know
that you were his favorite, right?

617
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,555
Yes, of course.

618
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,640
That's why...

619
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,809
I am completely...

620
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,520
heartbroken for him.

621
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,817
I guess we are not too old for tears.

622
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,016
We seem to meet a lot these days.

623
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,084
Aren't you Jeong-won's best friend
since little?

624
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,586
I thought you knew his family well.

625
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,338
Yes.

626
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,342
-You knew who he was, right?
-Yes.

627
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,094
-Why didn't you tell us?
-You didn't ask.

628
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,389
You knew Jeong-won's family was loaded.

629
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,099
I had no idea they were this rich.

630
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,894
Actually, I thought
his family went broke these days.

631
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,812
He's been mooching off me for years now.

632
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,773
Seriously. Rich people are stingier.

633
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,985
How could he keep it a secret
for 20 years?

634
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,321
So what if we knew?
Would we ask for jobs or money?

635
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,864
-That's possible.
-That's possible.

636
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,077
That's why that jerk didn't tell us.

637
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,870
Why isn't Ik-jun here?

638
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,373
He's still in surgery.
He's probably finishing up now.

639
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,291
It's a difficult one.
It'll take him some time.

640
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,335
What do you mean?
Why would he do surgery here?

641
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,963
Things just happened that way.
We needed him to do surgery.

642
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,591
-He knew about this.
-No, he didn't.

643
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,426
Wait. The director is here.

644
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,724
-Hello, sir.
-What brings you here?

645
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,645
Say hello. He had been
a student of mine long ago.

646
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,939
-I see. Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

647
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,400
Do you know the chairman's son,
Professor Ahn?

648
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,112
Yes. He's my closest friend.

649
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,206
-Thanks for coming.
-No need to thank us.

650
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,375
We ought to come
to our friend's father's funeral.

651
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,668
Is the chairman your father?

652
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,212
Why didn't you tell us?
You thought we'd ask for money?

653
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,341
I just couldn't find the right time
to tell you guys. I'm sorry.

654
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,427
I didn't try to hide it from you.

655
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,181
I mean, there's nothing to tell you.
I don't have any money. I swear.

656
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,808
That's more annoying.

657
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,935
What about the hospital?
Will you take charge of the hospital?

658
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,188
The hospital?

659
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,276
I thought I lost my unborn child.

660
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,486
-My heart almost exploded.
-We all know you're a doctor.

661
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,071
-Why that ringtone?
-Well...

662
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,741
Heart explosion sounds scary.
How can you say that so casually?

663
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,077
Do you know how sad it is to lose
an unborn child? How can you say that?

664
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,704
You know what?

665
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,456
You don't have any paternal love.

666
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,292
Hey, guys. Stop arguing.
My head is about to crack.

667
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,170
Your head is about to crack?
Then, you'll die.

668
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,173
Jeong-won.

669
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,342
Uncle is here.

670
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,968
He's here?

671
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,095
Thank you for coming, guys.

672
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,057
Please take care of my brother, Jeong-won.

673
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,810
I called you multiple times.
Why didn't you answer?

674
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,313
Sorry. I set my phone to vibrate.

675
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,484
-Dr. Chae, I have the result.
-Okay.

676
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,114
Thanks.

677
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,743
Hey, Ik-jun.

678
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,497
All right. I'll be there soon.

679
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,542
-Did the surgery go well?
-Yes.

680
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,294
Tell him to come here right away.

681
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,297
I need to do something. I'll be back soon.

682
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,215
-Okay.
-Sure.

683
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,475
You were the one who did the surgery.

684
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,768
You should tell her.

685
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,646
Looking like this? Forget it.

686
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,066
If she sees me,
she'd lose all of her confidence in me.

687
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:54,983
Gosh.

688
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:59,196
I thought about asking the resident
to inform his mother.

689
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:02,116
But I thought hearing it from you
would be better. You should go now.

690
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,784
She must've waited for long.

691
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,412
Okay.

692
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,091
Ma'am.

693
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,718
Goodness.

694
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,056
His surgery went really well.

695
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,352
It was a difficult one.

696
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,229
But there's almost no bleeding now,

697
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,440
and the liver he received
seems very healthy.

698
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,608
Right now, he's transferred to the ICU.

699
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,735
Thank you.

700
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,822
Oh, my. I mean it.

701
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,991
Thank you so much.

702
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,409
Thank you.

703
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,703
Thank you so much.

704
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,622
And I have your mother's biopsy result.

705
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,125
It's only stage one cancer.

706
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,462
With the radiation treatment,
she'll be healthy for another ten years.

707
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,762
This is good news. Why are you crying?

708
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,348
My goodness.

709
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,392
Doctor.

710
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,520
Thank you so much.

711
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,815
Thank you for everything.
Thank you so much.

712
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,736
Doctor.

713
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:25,532
I am the luckiest woman in this world.

714
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,910
There's no other woman
who's as lucky as I am.

715
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,787
I am such a lucky person.

716
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,873
I am the happiest person in the world.

717
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,459
That's why I was able to meet
a nice doctor like you

718
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,045
and my mother will live now.

719
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,381
How can I not call myself lucky?

720
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,051
My goodness. Oh, my.

721
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,847
Doctor...

722
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,355
OUR CONDOLENCES TO YOU

723
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,357
Why on earth would he come here?

724
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,692
He must be out of his mind.

725
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,706
CHAIRMAN AHN BYEONG-U

726
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,130
Mom, should I put
our family photo in the box, too?

727
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,174
Put it in my bag over there.

728
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,023
This is a lot of money for a medical bill.

729
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,650
It's a VIP ward.

730
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,236
Your father is a VIP, you know.

731
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,863
Is the funeral service fee included?

732
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,407
No, that's only for the room.

733
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,451
They completely overcharged us.

734
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,620
The bill is over ten million won
for less than a week?

735
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,913
You're being absurd.

736
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,333
Compared to other hospitals,
our bill is considered not much.

737
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,878
The cost isn't important
to these VIP patients.

738
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,757
Even if it means they must pay
triple or quadruple the price,

739
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,968
as long as they can become healthy,

740
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,928
they would even pay tenfold.

741
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,515
Mom, do you have money for this?

742
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,641
Are you serious?

743
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,936
You might've forgotten it,
but I married for convenience.

744
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,735
It was a loveless marriage,
but I was happy in my own way.

745
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,736
Mom.

746
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:30,198
-What?
-Don't worry. It's nothing.

747
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,034
Mr. Ju is here.

748
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,785
Okay. I'll be there.

749
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,457
Gosh, Mom.

750
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,541
Seriously.

751
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,213
My brother agreed.

752
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,132
And I persuaded my mother, too.

753
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,804
Ma'am, you're coming
to the board meeting tomorrow, right?

754
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,098
No, I'm not.

755
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,602
Jeong-won will be disappointed.

756
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,317
I know how hard you have been working
all these years.

757
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,027
I am sorry.

758
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,364
I hope I can continue to count on you.

759
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,994
Goodness.

760
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,290
Your family is definitely not ordinary.

761
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,460
So this is already a done deal.

762
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,587
Yes. It's over.

763
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,676
Did Chairman Hwang agree to that?

764
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,719
Jeong-won went to him
and personally asked him

765
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,971
to choose Mr. Ju over himself.

766
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,727
I told him to call Chairman Hwang to get
him on his side. Gosh, I raised him wrong.

767
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,814
All of my effort to raise my children
went to nothing.

768
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,650
I understand.

769
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,903
But tomorrow is the board meeting.

770
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,864
How can I trust you?

771
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,329
I have the agreement letters Chairman
Hwang got from the board of directors.

772
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,457
And I put in my mother
and my resignation letters as well.

773
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,256
But...

774
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,508
I have one condition.

775
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,514
YULJE FOUNDATION

776
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,016
THE PROFIT FROM THE VIP WARDS
WILL GO TO PARTY A

777
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,477
PARTY A HAS THE RIGHTS
TO USE AND MANAGE THE FUND

778
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,520
If you don't mind,

779
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:29,067
can I ask you about
how you will use the money?

780
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,154
I'm still a guy from a rich family.

781
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,573
Everyone puts away some money.

782
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,788
The concept of VIP wards is
fascinating, isn't it?

783
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,250
There are only four wards.

784
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,628
But we don't need more than those.

785
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,467
The moment they become accessible,
no one will want them.

786
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,636
We must set an astronomical price

787
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,598
to attract astronomically rich patients.

788
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,437
We just need to focus on
is staffing talented doctors.

789
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,609
By the way, finding a good professor
will be difficult.

790
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,531
I heard that our hospital
needs more professors.

791
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,451
I'll take care of that.

792
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,205
Please prepare to pay handsomely
for their salaries.

793
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,968
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
AS EXCLUSIVE MEDICAL STAFF FOR VIP WARDS

794
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,054
You'll do it, right?

795
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,430
This is a long contract.

796
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,182
Can someone explain what it means?

797
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,892
To sum it up,

798
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,061
if Party A asks for surgery,

799
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,647
we have to perform emergency surgery
even on weekends.

800
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,691
And we have to participate
in the surgery Party A assigns.

801
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,860
-Who's Party A?
-Him.

802
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,821
It must come with a crazy reward.

803
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,740
-You're asking us to be your slaves.
-Twice the annual salary you get now.

804
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,450
Hey!

805
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,788
Next time,
write that on top of the contract.

806
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,082
He does come from a rich family.
He's very generous.

807
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,959
I won't resign from my job anyway. I'm in.

808
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,126
-Is there an ink pad?
-Here.

809
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,253
I should sign it with my thumbprint.

810
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,297
Hey, what about you?

811
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,091
I want to have more time off.

812
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,427
My goodness,
you sound like you're so well-off.

813
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,013
Hey, you came back to Korea
two months ago after your fellowship.

814
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,640
Shouldn't you get a job?

815
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,475
I want to hang out with my mom more.

816
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,980
Twice your annual salary
and an assigned parking spot.

817
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,065
-What about us?
-What about us?

818
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,191
Hey, be quiet.

819
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,401
I don't know.

820
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,156
On top of that, I'll throw in an exclusive
research lab and your own office.

821
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,785
-What about us? Who do you think we are?
-What? Do you think we're fools?

822
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,911
I don't want those things.

823
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,498
I only have one condition.

824
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,500
What is it? I'll make it work.

825
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,460
A band.

826
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,546
-What?
-What on earth is he jabbering about?

827
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,131
You can barely manage to text.

828
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,759
I won't do it. I said no.

829
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,386
I'm in. I like it.

830
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,306
I'm busy. I don't have time for that.
I can't do it.

831
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,559
Then, will you work here?

832
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,354
Sure. How can you run VIP wards
without an ob-gyn?

833
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,773
I don't think that's possible at all.

834
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,901
Goodness. I'm leaving now.

835
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,777
-Count me out from this.
-Hey.

836
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,362
I'd rather work right now.

837
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,783
-I don't have my ID. Help me go down.
-Okay. Let's go.

838
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:29,080
My answer was clear.
I don't have time to be in a band.

839
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,917
Hey, Song-hwa. You...

840
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,592
I just need Song-hwa to get on board.

841
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,260
It will be harder to persuade Jun-wan.

842
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,346
Jun-wan?

843
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,389
I can fix that with just a phone call.

844
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,938
You really won't do it?

845
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,524
I said no. I'm way too mature
for that kind of kiddie stuff.

846
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,028
I was going through
my old Cyworld account.

847
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,614
I found a beautiful photo in the album.

848
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:07,118
-It was in Hawaii.
-I'll do it.

849
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,703
Jun-wan is in.

850
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,457
What?

851
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,503
What on earth do you have on him?

852
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,922
We just need to persuade Song-hwa.

853
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,008
If she says no, she means it.
What should I do?

854
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,094
Hey, do you have anything on her?

855
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,845
My gosh, is that your strategy?

856
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,182
Why are you taking a negative approach
like finding people's weaknesses?

857
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:33,603
Try to think of what Song-hwa
would want or want to do.

858
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,814
-Take that approach.
-I know a way.

859
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,524
-What?
-What is it?

860
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,026
-She'll do it if she's the vocalist.
-You lunatic.

861
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,362
A vocalist? Is she still hung up on that?

862
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,824
I told her first. She said she'd be in it
if she's the vocalist.

863
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:49,661
I can't believe this. Song-hwa is
tone-deaf and has no sense of rhythm.

864
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,080
It took her five years to learn
to play the bass guitar.

865
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,335
Seok-hyeong, do you want our band
to win a Grammy Award?

866
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,336
What?

867
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,588
-You don't want to perform at Wembley?
-I don't want to.

868
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,631
Then...

869
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,509
let Song-hwa sing.

870
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,635
Hey.

871
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,012
I don't care.

872
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,515
I just want to do something together
with my friends.

873
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,268
I thought that
Song-hwa had an attractive voice.

874
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,478
My gosh, you're awful.

875
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,813
She has a unique voice.

876
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,940
My goodness. You're all going nuts!

877
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,526
Don't be so mean to her.

878
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,278
You ought to bring her to the right path.

879
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,655
If you care about her,
you can't do this to her.

880
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,741
It's all good now.

881
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,202
Ik-jun, you're truly looking out for her.
Which means you should be okay with this.

882
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,370
We'll start the band.

883
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,747
You're starting work next week.

884
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,290
Nice to meet you, Dr. Yang.

885
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,877
My gosh, it's nice to meet you.

886
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,212
I've heard a lot about you.
People call you "Buddha".

887
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,297
I'm Catholic.

888
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,965
I see.

889
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,642
Hurry up, Song-hwa.
We might get called in any minute.

890
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,059
Gosh.

891
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,270
Gosh, that stinks.

892
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,356
You're ridiculous.

893
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,859
-Which song should we start with?
-Seok-hyeong already picked out a song.

894
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,444
You'll know as soon as you hear it.

895
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,893
I miss you even more around this time

896
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,523
When I am all alone

897
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,319
I know that you are gone now

898
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,074
But I keep thinking of you

899
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,705
Why did you leave me then?

900
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:44,794
You told me that
Things were getting tough between us

901
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,298
That could have been
The reason you left me

902
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,595
But I can't know for sure

903
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,854
I remember the night when you left me

904
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,780
You in my memory

905
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,126
You really scared me just now.

906

SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
PRE-MED FRESHMEN ORIENTATION

907
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:35,637
I remember the night when you left me

908
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,194
Give it up for him!

909
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,158
His singing gave me the chills
and his face gave me even more chills.

910
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,035
All right. Who wants to go next?

911
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,204
-Me!
-Give it up for him!

912
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,585
I will impersonate Nam Bo-won
on Nam Bo-won's Show.

913
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,506
It's a mountain valley
in Gangwon Province in 1950.

914
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,132
Frogs were croaking.

915
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,806
-The soldiers were having a rest.
-Hey, where are you going?

916
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,808
I'd rather drop out of college
than do that.

917
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,436
-Hey.
-Hey, Corporal Kim.

919
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,070
Where are you going?

920
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,864
We wanted to use the restroom.

921
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,742
My friend is very drunk.

922
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,786
Hey, are you okay?

923
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,545
Damn it. Why aren't they going back in?
They are so annoying.

924
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,132
It's cold out here.
Should we stay in the restroom?

925
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,466
We'll smell like toilets.

926
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,552
Gosh, is there a place to hide?

927
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,455
Why are they here?

928
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:26,873
Why do you think?

929
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,210
Like us, when things were getting lame,
they lied to people and came to hide here.

930
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,254
Are they Japanese?

931
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,964
-He's ridiculous.
-My gosh.

932
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,216
Can we come in?

933
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,305
His standard Korean accent is dope.

934
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,265
It's like listening to the radio.

935
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,060
-"Can we come in?"
-"Can we come in?"

936
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,395
Come on in.

937
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,606
Hurry up.

938
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,316
I know there's not much space here.

939
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,527
Staying in here is a much better deal
than putting on a show over there.

940
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,246
My name is Ahn Jeong-won.
His name is Yang Seok-hyeong.

941
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,624
-Nice to meet you.
-My name is Lee Ik-jun.

942
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,250
You crazy punk.

943
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,046
His name is Lee Ik-jun.
My name is Kim Jun-wan.

944
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,547
We're both from Changwon.

945
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:20,009
We went to the same high school.
Did you two go to school together?

946
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,845
We went to elementary
and middle school together.

947
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,559
-You won't die from it.
-You're such a crybaby.

948
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,355
How long do we need to stay here?
It's too cramped here.

949
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,565
At least it's just the four of us.

950
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:52,500
I'm Ahn Jeong-won. He's Yang Seok-hyeong.
They're Kim Jun-wan and Lee Ik-jun.

951
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,335
My name is Chae Song-hwa.

952
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,379
Are you guys friends?

953
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,381
-No, we are not.
-Are you crazy?

954
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,091
-We met five minutes ago.
-What?

955
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,551
No, we are not.

956
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,886
You can just say no. What's all this fuss?

957
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,682
Hey, it's a fun coincidence
that we all met here.

958
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,600
Do you want to take a photo together?

959
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,769
Are you for real?

960
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,563
I'm for real.

961
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:14,897
Sure.

962
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,193
We can get the chair
and put the camera on top.

963
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,987
Okay.

964
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,447
Hold on.

965
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,532
It will blink before taking the photo.

966
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,242
Hey, it's starting.

967
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,717
We're playing
"Love over a Thousand Years" next.

968
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,053
-You jerk.
-Hey.

969
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,555
-Hey!
-Yes?

970
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:50,057
-This is Chae Song-hwa. Go on.
-Hey, Jun-wan!

971
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,309
-I got it.
-Crazy jerk.

972
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,060
-Bring it back. Hey.
-Okay.

973
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,854
Open up. Hey. Damn it.

974
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,355
Hey, Seok-hyeong.

975
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,149
Hey, Jeong-won.

976
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,653
Damn it. Come on, give it back!

977
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,119
Let me see.

978
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,957
Here it is.

979
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,129
HELLO, MR. DADDY-LONG-LEGS.
EUN-A WAS DISCHARGED AS HEALTHY GIRL.

980
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,849
THANK YOU FOR THE MESSAGE.
I'LL BE ABLE TO HELP MORE PATIENTS.

981
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,648
Hey.

982
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,609
I don't have any money.

983
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:45,071
I barely got enough money to cover
the bills for a kid with heart disease.

984
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,240
I'm completely broke.

985
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,327
You're a priest.
Why do you always ask for wine?

986
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,204
-Have a life of non-possession!
-Hey, Jun-wan!

987
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,623
-You should be happy if you are
-Open up!

988
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,209
-as respected as Bopjong.
-Hey, even you?

989
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,127
-Seriously?
-Whatever. I don't have money.

990
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,129
You're a priest, not a sommelier.

991
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:15,393
How did you...

992
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:19,188
Mr. Ju heard
about his wife's condition today.

993
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,316
He would do anything
for his wife, you know.

994
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,527
I'm very sorry for him.

995
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:26,654
What do you mean?

996
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,699
Jong-su is already having a hard time.
I made him run the foundation.

997
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,993
I don't know if I can face him.

998
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,706
Jong-su is Mr. Ju's first name.

999
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,542
-I see.
-We're old friends.

1000
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:45,923
I told him not to come to my husband's
funeral since his wife is sick.

1001
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,550
No one can stop that stubborn man.

1002
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,719
Mr. Ju wouldn't be himself if he didn't.

1003
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,722
Goodness.

1004
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,309
He was always quiet
and didn't express any emotions.

1005
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,938
To be honest, I just thought that
I could never read his mind.

1006
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:04,108
So I was always cautious around him.

1007
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,737
-But it turns out--
-He just doesn't have any schemes.

1008
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,696
Gosh.

1009
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,449
He was just like that
when he was five years old.

1010
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,200
And even on his wedding day.

1011
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:17,371
He looks sulky so people get
the wrong idea that he's hiding something.

1012
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,583
-He doesn't have any ulterior motives.
-Right.

1013
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,419
That reminds me. About two days
before your husband passed away,

1014
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,921
he came to see me at my house.

1015
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,299
He came to my house at a late hour.

1016
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:33,387
I just assumed that he came to ask me
to vote for him at the board meeting.

1017
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,265
Well, I was irritated
that he came to see me.

1018
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:39,769
But since your son asked me for a favor,

1019
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:43,397
-I thought I'd give him what he wants.
-What did he say?

1020
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,649
Goodness.

1021
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,400
I think I already know.

1022
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,319
Yes.

1023
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,447
He didn't say anything to me.

1024
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,785
He stared at the flower tree
in my garden for a long time.

1025
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,956
Then he asked me for the tree
because his wife likes flowers.

1026
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,916
He can never ask for favors.

1027
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,043
He's frustrating.

1028
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,128
That fool.

1029
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,630
Gosh.

1030
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,842
Goodness, it's already past 8 p.m.

1031
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,219
You should go now.

1032
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,806
I think he's waiting for you.

1033
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,224
He asked me to cook for him.

1034
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:23,312
It's been 30 years
since I last packed a dinner.

1035
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,231
-Bye.
-Bye.

1036
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,774
Code Blue, third floor.

1037
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,652
CPR in the ICU.

1038
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,946
Third floor of the main building.

1039
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,170
Min-yeong, hang in there.

1040
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,505
Hang in there, Min-yeong.

1041
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,008
-How long?
-Ten minutes. I can't get her sinus back.

1042
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,885
No way. Please do it one more time.

1043
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,928
You brought her back last time!

1044
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,639
Ma'am, you should let Min-yeong go now...

1045
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,267
Just try it one more time, please. Please.

1046
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,478
I'll do it. I'll keep trying.

1047
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,734
Min-yeong.

1048
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,779
Min-yeong.

1049
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,575
Min-yeong, hang in there, please.

1050
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,911
Hang in there, Min-yeong.

1051
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,954
Min-yeong.

1052
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,962
Min-yeong, please.
Hang in there. Min-yeong!

1053
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,068
Ma'am, she must be in a lot of pain.

1054
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,989
We should let her rest now.

1055
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,465
My sweet Min-yeong,

1056
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,426
do you want to go now?

1057
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:02,346
But I don't want you to.

1058
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,433
If you stay here a little longer,

1059
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,811
would that be too painful for you?

1060
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,690
I would like to see you a bit more.

1061
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,319
I'm sorry, Min-yeong.

1062
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:23,284
I am so sorry
for making you go through this pain.

1063
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,705
Min-yeong.

1064
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:32,084
I love you so much.

1065
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,378
My daughter.

1066
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,217
I love you.

1067
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,769
March 26, 2019. At 2:29 p.m.

1068
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,441
I pronounce Kim Min-yeong dead.

1069
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,616
Min-yeong.

1070
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,869
Min-yeong.

1071
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,915
Min-yeong.

1072
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,506
Min-yeong.

1073
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,560
Did she want to see all of us?

1074
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,856
I bet she'll just complain.

1075
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,484
You're right. Her face changed completely.

1076
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:41,820
What choice do we have?

1077
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,615
Whatever she says,
we should try to understand her.

1078
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,325
I can understand her.

1079
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:49,662
I understand her, but we did our best.

1080
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:53,415
Professor Ahn didn't get a day off
for three months because of Min-yeong.

1081
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,001
There he comes.

1082
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,137
Thank you so much for your hard work.

1083
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,306
You should get back to work.

1084
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,893
-Pardon?
-I can meet with her alone.

1085
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,311
You should go.

1086
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,230
You have a lot of work.

1087
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,600
Doctor.

1088
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,187
Thank you so much for everything.

1089
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,899
Min-yeong...

1090
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:08,449
was in so much pain
because I wanted to see her more.

1091
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,953
But thanks to great doctors
and nurses she had,

1092
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,957
she had three years of a happy life.

1093
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,503
Thank you for your hard work.

1094
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,216
Thank you for loving my daughter

1095
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,052
and treating her

1096
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,721
the best you could.

1097
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:33,724
Thank you so much.

1098
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:58,999
Father, a girl went to heaven today.

1099
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,336
I was at her 100th-day celebration.

1100
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:07,591
Every year, we celebrated her birthday
together. We made so many memories.

1101
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,098
Just three years...

1102
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,768
After only three years,

1103
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:20,813
Min-yeong left this world.

1104
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,152
I'm his child,

1105
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,990
but I can't stop resenting God.

1106
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,996
I hate him.

1107
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,249
And I resent him, too.

1108
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,628
It's so hard to move on
with my life, Father.

1109
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,590
What should I do?

1110
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,560
TO THE FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT
ON THE POLICE STATION ALLEY

1111
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:02,646
That's why I told you
I wasn't going to be a doctor.

1112
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:06,150
I told you I was going
to be a priest, too, didn't I?

1113
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,484
Remember what you guys told me?

1114
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:10,195
That I could be a priest
whenever I wanted,

1115
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,157
but that's not the case for a doctor.

1116
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,701
I worked all these years as a doctor
because of you guys.

1117
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:19,455
Starting now, I'm going to do
what I want with my life. Okay?

1118
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,956
Did you get that?

1119
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:22,958
I don't...

1120
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,586
deserve to be a doctor.

1121
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,962
I can't...

1122
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,798
I can't control my emotions.

1123
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,177
I empathize too easily.

1124
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:35,637
Other doctors tell me

1125
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,516
that once time passes,
it becomes like nothing.

1126
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,895
You know what?

1127
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:47,399
I care too much about all my patients.

1128
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:51,528
I completely go nuts for them, you know?

1129
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,699
I didn't cry
even when our father passed away.

1130
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:00,704
My father recently passed away, you know.

1131
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,414
Is that so?

1132
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,082
But...

1133
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:08,045
when Min-yeong's mother

1134
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,673
thanked me...

1135
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:14,259
for treating her today.

1136
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,638
Damn it.

1137
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:21,975
My patient's mother comforted me.
But I'm the doctor!

1138
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,272
But then,

1139
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,025
to tell you the truth,

1140
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,736
it was the most wonderful feeling...

1141
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,240
It was a kind of feeling

1142
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,992
that I couldn't experience in this world.

1143
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:43,121
I was so grateful,
but I was sorry at the same time.

1144
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,459
Anyway,

1145
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,711
I don't deserve to be a doctor.

1146
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,466
No. It's too hard.

1147
01:15:56,802 --> 01:16:00,222
I won't do it. I'll quit being a doctor!

1148
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,892
As a matter of fact,
I was going to quit after this year.

1149
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,229
I was planning to hand off
things I do to my friend anyway.

1150
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,648
It's over now.

1151
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:13,485
I'll quit my job tomorrow. Damn it.

1152
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,574
Andrea, if that's how you feel,

1153
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,701
I'll tell you to quit later.

1154
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:23,203
So why don't you hang in there
one more year?

1155
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,039
Seriously.

1156
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,670
1 YEAR AGO

1157
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,721
Hey, Min-u...

1158
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,607
Min-u...

1159
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,069
wrote me a letter.

1160
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,157
He couldn't even read Korean.

1161
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,998
But he wrote me a letter before he died.

1162
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:12,586
I...

1163
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,255
don't deserve to be a doctor.

1164
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:18,258
I'm not good enough
and I've got nothing to show for!

1165
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:20,844
I'm going to quit being a doctor.

1166
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:24,264
I'm going to quit tomorrow!

1167
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,600
Andrea.

1168
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,644
Hang in there for one more year.

1169
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,898
Seriously.

1170
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,524
2 YEARS AGO

1171
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,943
You know, my patient, Min-ji?

1172
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,238
Min-ji woke up today.

1173
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:45,327
She was even able to breathe on her own.

1174
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:49,331
She looked at me
and winked at me like this.

1175
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,750
Just like this.

1176
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,879
She looked at me and winked at me.

1177
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,758
Okay. Cheers.

1178
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,303
It's the happiest day of my life. Cheers!

1179
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:04,888
Cheers!

1180
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:07,516
3 YEARS AGO

1181
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,021
I'm going to quit.

1182
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,941
I'm not a doctor.

1183
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,527
I'm a fraud!

1184
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,822
Die! I should die!

1185
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,783
Andrea.

1186
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,911
Let's try this for one more year. Okay?

1187
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:32,582
My gosh, how adorable.

1188
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,718
Yes, come in.

1189
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:46,930
What's a good menu in the cafeteria?

1190
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:51,059
-Look at you. You came to work early.
-I didn't go home last night.

1191
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:53,353
I'll have breakfast before I go.

1192
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,814
Should you drive after an all-nighter?

1193
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,441
I'll grab a cab. Bye.

1194
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,944
Do you have a symposium this weekend?
Was it at J Hotel?

1195
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:02,738
How do you know about it?

1196
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,949
Right. Professor Jang?

1197
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:08,869
I'll send him your regards. I'm leaving.

1198
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,203
Bye.

1199
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,338
Hey.

1200
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:26,636
Get off now.

1201
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,515
Listen to me.

1202
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,101
I'm sober now. I swear.

1203
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,479
I'm completely sober.

1204
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,772
Are you kidding me?

1205
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:41,109
-I smell alcohol whenever you talk.
-No way. It's been hours.

1206
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,695
I just smell like alcohol.

1207
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:47,073
When we talked on the phone earlier,
you were still drinking at the wrap party.

1208
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:50,285
That was five hours ago.
You were totally drunk then.

1209
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:53,246
-This is a crime.
-I'm completely fine now.

1210
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:54,956
Forget it. Let's just go.

1211
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,584
No one will know anyway.
What's your problem?

1212
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,504
Do you see the sauna over there?
Get some sleep there.

1213
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,884
That's enough.

1214
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,386
Stop making a big deal out of nothing!

1215
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:13,475
I'll drop off your car at your house.
Let's talk later.

1216
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,143
And we should...

1217
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,771
end it then.

1218
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:40,544
SYMPOSIUM FOR CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

1219
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,712
The doors are opening.

1220
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,976
Her nickname is "ghost."
She teaches and does a lot of surgery.

1221
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:42,022
She checks residents' papers thoroughly.
She goes hiking and camping on weekends.

1222
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:46,234
But she still manages to come to work
at 7 a.m. Only ghosts can do that.

1223
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,613
I knew it was you. You're famous.
Your name pops up on search engines.

1224
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,781
Gosh, Chae Song-hwa. She's amazing.

1225
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,366
Are you going to watch the patient die?

1226
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:56,328
-Hey!
-We can't do that to a patient.

1227
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,787
Dr. Min said it won't be

1228
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,332
such a dangerous procedure.
I want to stick with him.

1229
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,710
Reporters have their eyes on us.

1230
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:05,795
We can use this surgery
to get your name out there.

1231
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,925
They're all so nosy.
I'll just suffer and die alone.

1232
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,802
Will I live until then?

1233
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,972
-A cold cup of iced Americano, please.
-I'd like a warm cup of hot latte.

1234
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,267
-And mine too.
-Jeong-won, do you know Daddy-Long-Legs?

1235
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,561
-What?
-He's quite famous at your last hospital.

1236
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,022
You can't trust rich people.
They lie all the time.

1237
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:24,940
Prick.

1238
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,650
This patient will get
a liver transplant tomorrow morning.

1239
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,485
Liver transplant.
And I'm leading the surgery.

1240
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,362
Do you want to join me?

1241
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:34,115
You're all good-looking.
How did nothing happen between you guys?

1242
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,242
Why would you do that?

1243
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:37,702
Why disturb the calm water?

1244
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,961
