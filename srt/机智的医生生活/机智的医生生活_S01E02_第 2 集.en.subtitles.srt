1
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,897
Thank you.

2
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,318
I'm looking forward to your involvement
at the Neuroscience Center,

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,820
-Chief Min.
-Goodness.

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,905
Yes. I'm looking forward to it, too.

5
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,908
It's only been a few days,
but I can see you have a great system

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,285
and talented medical staff here.

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,495
I should thank you
for allowing me to join.

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,748
Professor Chae,
I'm looking forward to working with you.

9
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,168
Why don't we all have a meal together?
The cafeteria serves good food.

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,461
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,921
Don't be so formal.
You can talk to me casually.

12
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,006
Okay.

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,176
Professor Min looks much better
in person than on TV.

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,927
He's on a lot of TV shows,

15
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,221
but he performs
all of his surgeries himself.

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,686
I want you to take
Gong Hyeong-u's surgery.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,481
He's not in critical condition.
But this surgery is tricky.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,775
Reporters have their eyes on us,

19
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,568
so his surgery must go well,
no matter what.

20
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,238
We can use this surgery
to get your name out there.

21
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,909
My surgery schedule for next week is full.
I don't have time for it.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,828
Come on.

23
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,831
Min-sik, I heard you have
a third baby on the way.

24
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,750
What? How did you know?

25
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,001
I heard you guys talking.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,461
You should go home.

27
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,882
I can handle your emergency calls.
I can take two or three calls a month.

28
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,468
-Thank you. It's a nice gesture.
-It's not just a gesture.

29
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,969
You're breaking my heart.

30
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,346
Thank you.

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,810
By the way,
how much longer are they going to film us?

32
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,229
Gosh, working as a TV director
must be so hard.

33
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,106
Goodness, nothing is easy in this world.

34
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,774
Sir.

35
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,609
You should just eat comfortably.

36
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,944
I won't go anywhere.

37
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,154
I'll do everything you ask.
Just enjoy your meal.

38
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,239
Thank you.

39
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,786
Dr. Yong.

40
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,579
Han Seung-hyeok needs a lumbar drain.

41
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,789
Have you done it?

42
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,000
Who?

43
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,335
Han Seung-hyeok in Room 7104.

44
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,629
Isn't that Professor Min Gi-jun's patient?

45
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,922
Yes.

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,470
This is Park Jeong-su. I took a look
at his CT angiography scan this morning.

47
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,431
I saw an unruptured cerebral aneurysm,
so he was admitted today.

48
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,100
His surgery is scheduled next week.

49
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,020
You look more handsome
in the patient gown.

50
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,649
Dr. Min, this surgery
isn't difficult, is it?

51
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,360
I have performed this surgery
hundreds of times.

52
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,862
You don't have to worry.

53
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,406
Where's the location of his aneurysm?

54
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,658
The right paraclinoid aneurysm
is on the cerebral artery.

55
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,035
-But its neck seemed narrow.
-I see.

56
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,289
There won't be any problems.
It's a simple surgery.

57
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,500
Do you have a girlfriend?

58
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,918
Yes.

59
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,045
Wait, no.

60
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,381
What? Do you think I'd be
against you having a girlfriend?

61
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,342
Gosh, he's making me look bad.

62
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,053
-All right, then.
-Thank you, Doctor.

63
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,138
Sure.

64
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,145
Hello. How do you feel today?

65
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,317
Whatever.

66
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,278
What? What are you going to do?

67
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,822
-Is that so?
-They only ran a blood test

68
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,115
and gave him an IV drip.

69
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,159
And no one came to check on him!

70
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,953
We still haven't heard
about his surgery date.

71
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,163
No one gave us an update.

72
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,749
Do you just want him to die? Is that it?

73
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,460
I am truly sorry.

74
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,338
I believe my resident missed it
as he was busy.

75
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,174
I will apologize on his behalf.

76
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,009
I am very sorry.

77
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,723
Who's in charge?

78
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,059
Should I just do it myself?

79
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,229
Han Seung-hyeok really needs
to get a lumbar drain today.

80
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,688
You can't just do it yourself.

81
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,524
Professor Min told you
to check everything with him.

82
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,693
Don't you remember
the colossal disaster last week?

83
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,280
Professor Min should
at least give you orders.

84
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,616
He didn't give any orders
after the patient got admitted.

85
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,286
He seems nice in front of patients,
but he doesn't care about them at all.

86
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,956
Seok-min, I moved up
Lee Myeong-gi's surgery.

87
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,207
Get his guardian's consent.

88
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,124
Okay.

89
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,002
It's not that urgent.
Finish your ramyeon and take a breather.

90
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,420
I'm done.

91
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,297
Take your time.

92
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,382
You!

93
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,842
How can you be eating right now?

94
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,594
How can you eat now?

95
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,098
Why didn't you do a lumbar drain
for Han Seung-hyeok?

96
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,891
-Why didn't you do it?
-Sir.

97
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,228
Do you call yourself a doctor?

98
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,813
How can you call yourself a doctor?

99
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,232
What if the hydrocephalus gets worse
and puts him in danger?

100
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,734
Will you take responsibility for that?
Will you?

101
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,362
You didn't give me any orders.
Why are you blaming me?

102
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,697
Are you out of your mind?

103
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,992
How dare you talk back to me?

104
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,660
Hey.

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,245
Hey.

106
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,580
You call yourself a chief resident?

107
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,459
You can't even make a judgment call.
You shouldn't be a chief resident.

108
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,295
Seriously?

109
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,796
Look at you.

110
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,173
Are you glaring at me?

111
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,550
Stop glaring.

112
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,760
Stop glaring at me, you bastard!

113
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,472
Stop glaring!

114
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,491
Lastly, the complications.

115
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,952
One percent of patients experience
altered consciousness,

116
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,705
convulsion, dyskinesia, and so on.
Sequelae are infectious diseases,

117
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,333
encephalitis, meningitis,
and brain abscess. Any questions?

118
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,585
I doubt you have any.

119
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,339
All right, then.

120
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,761
Okay.

121
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,306
Lastly, due to the lack
of oxygen in the organs,

122
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,100
one percent of patients suffer
organ failure, brain damage, and--

123
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,435
"Brain damage"?

124
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,605
How did you not know Mother was this sick?

125
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,734
Doctor, is my mom's surgery that serious?

126
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,277
No, they're just the possibilities.

127
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,780
I'm only informing you
of the possibilities.

128
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
Her heart muscles may be damaged
during the surgery.

129
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,950
In severe cases, she may die.

130
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,410
"Die"?

131
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,830
She was fine just a few minutes ago.

132
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,624
I'm not saying that she will die.

133
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,250
I'm saying that could happen.

134
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,502
Oh, Mom.

135
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,754
What if Mom dies during the surgery?

136
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,215
I feel so bad for her!

137
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,803
I won't be able to live!
I'm going to miss her so much!

138
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,763
I can't live without her.

139
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,849
Mom. You!

140
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,144
Mom!

141
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,190
Poor Mom!

142
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,860
Excuse me. She's still alive.

143
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,779
Mom.

144
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,989
Mom.

145
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,618
Mom.

146
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,668
Did you just get here?
Are you on the night shift again?

147
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,962
-No, I'm not.
-Are you going home now?

148
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,046
I have the morning shift.

149
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,589
Then why are you here at seven?

150
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,007
This is when my shift starts.

151
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,926
-It's night.
-It's morning.

152
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,845
What?

153
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,937
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

154
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,496
Tell me about the patient.

155
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,625
He had a stomachache and was constipated,
so I performed an enema. He's fine now.

156
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm sorry, sir.

157
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,088
My intern was so scared
that they called you directly.

158
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,506
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,549
No, that's okay.

160
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,843
You must have been scared, too.

161
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,096
You were scared, weren't you?

162
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,059
This happens to kids often,
so you don't need to worry too much.

163
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,730
A lot of kids around Jeong-hu's age
come to the ER because of constipation.

164
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,232
-Isn't he your first son?
-Yes.

165
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,818
Moms get scared for their first children
and come to the ER a lot.

166
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,780
Moms with second or third children
are like experts.

167
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,950
They come here, ask for the meds,
chat a little, and leave.

168
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,160
Really?

169
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,456
I was so scared that something
would happen to my son.

170
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,918
My gosh, I still have
a long way to go as a mother.

171
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,962
Even experienced mothers get scared
for their first children.

172
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,548
It's natural to be scared.
Don't beat yourself up.

173
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,801
It looks like he fell asleep.

174
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,471
We should let him sleep.
Do you want to get some coffee?

175
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,181
-Sounds great.
-Let's go.

176
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,642
Is the café open?

177
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:20,101
Professor Lee, I noticed that the date
for my returning flight is next week,

178
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,519
not this week.

179
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,231
I'm grateful that you paid for my flight.

180
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,776
But what about U-ju? Who will watch U-ju?

181
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,904
U-ju?
My parents are coming this afternoon.

182
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,199
They will watch him for me.
You have nothing to worry about.

183
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,619
Okay. Go sightseeing with your daughter.

184
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,080
You know, China is a big country.

185
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,874
U-ju, that's spicy.

186
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,084
It's really spicy.

187
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,003
You should eat your soup. Eat your food.

188
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,213
Okay. Bye.

189
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,091
Hi, Mom.

190
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,513
Why would I go there with Professor Jang?

191
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,683
Gosh. I can't go there for a reason.

192
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,936
I broke up with him.

193
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,940
I broke up with Professor Jang.

194
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,859
What? Why?

195
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,611
He cheated on me.

196
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,654
He cheated on...

197
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,283
That jerk, Professor Jang, cheated on me.

198
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,493
Last week, when I was tired after surgery,

199
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,455
he came to my office himself
and confessed everything.

200
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,332
He said he was seeing someone else.

201
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,377
My gosh. I'm not in my 20s.
Of course, I'm fine.

202
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,671
I'm really busy these days.
Maybe it's better this way.

203
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,799
I can live without him.
Or I can get a new boyfriend.

204
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,219
Mom, I'm going into surgery. Bye.

205
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,597
You startled me.

206
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,813
Are you trying to look funny?

207
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,649
That, too.

208
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,816
Stay ten steps away from me.

209
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,401
It's embarrassing to be seen with you.

210
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,779
Did Professor Jang cheat on you?

211
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,072
Did you hear that?

212
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,282
If I didn't, I should go to an ENT doctor.

213
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,992
Hey, by the way,

214
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,495
your vocalization is really nice.

215
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,163
You have perfect pitch.

216
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,499
I'm the band's vocalist for a reason.

217
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,380
That... Gosh.

218
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,265
A cold cup of iced Americano, please.

219
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,184
Iced Americano is already cold.

220
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,437
-They mean the same thing.
-Yes, they do. So just pick one.

221
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,981
You pay for this. Bye.

222
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,527
Gosh, that rude jerk.

223
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,950
A cold cup of iced Americano
and that jerk's chocolate milk.

225
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,661
And the scone, too.

226
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,413
I came to the hospital, so I could live.

227
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,456
Did you think I came here to die?

228
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,585
You know what? When someone is in pain,
you should give them painkillers

229
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,422
or check if everything's okay
with the surgical wound.

230
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,799
You just come here once or twice a day.
Is that all you do?

231
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,967
Is that all?

232
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,510
Excuse me. When you scream like this,

233
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,637
you make other patients
uncomfortable.

234
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm in pain! I said I'm in severe pain!

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,060
If a patient is in so much pain,
shouldn't you do something about it?

236
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,771
Dr. Chae.

237
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,150
They need to dress the wound
three times a day.

238
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,652
Dressing it twice won't disinfect
the wound enough.

239
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,655
I'll tell them to take better care of you.
Please don't be upset.

240
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,075
If you say so.

241
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,704
It would've been great if you'd done
a better job from the start.

242
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,874
Do you have urination problems?

243
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,709
No. It's all good.

244
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,627
I pee just the right amount.

245
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,129
Okay, then.

246
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,635
Discharge the patient.

247
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,720
Pardon?

248
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,346
Didn't you hear her voice just now?

249
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,765
She's full of energy.

250
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,975
She's all better now. Let's discharge her.

251
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:48,893
Okay.

252
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,563
The patient's INR is off the charts!
What were you doing?

253
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,898
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,107
Is that all?

255
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,067
Didn't I tell you to check his INR

256
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,236
and give him two FFPs
if his INR went over two?

257
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,573
I even told you the number of FFPs
because you can't do that yourself.

258
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,158
You should've followed my orders.

259
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,534
Doctor.

260
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,662
I came here because my heart is not well.

261
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,291
But my heart is about
to explode right now.

262
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,544
Do your job, please.

264
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,509
Doctor, are you all right?

265
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,761
Yes.

266
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,180
Is there anything else?

267
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,265
No. I'm fine.

268
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,768
I'm sorry. You got scolded because of me.

269
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,020
My gosh,
I got scolded because I messed up.

270
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,022
Sorry?

271
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,817
I'll come back after my meal.

272
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,619
Is Dr. Yong here?

273
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,413
What brings you
all the way to NS, Jae-hak?

274
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,458
Say hello to the chief resident for CS.
It's Dr. Do Jae-hak.

275
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,584
-Hello.
-Hello.

276
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,046
-Are these the med students?
-Yes. Guys, sit down.

277
00:13:59,129 --> 00:13:59,964
-Okay.
-Okay.

278
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,508
They are med students.
Our department has them this week.

279
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,219
He looks pretty old, doesn't he?

280
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,054
He started college before some professors.

281
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:07,972
No, I didn't.

282
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,015
I took the CSAT four times
and the bar exam six times.

283
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,226
Memorize that. Let's go eat.

284
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,186
Eat? What's that?

285
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,438
I must attend the conference
for Gong Hyeong-u's surgery.

286
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,566
I know him.
The good Samaritan, Gong Hyeong-u.

287
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,109
He was a subway homeless guy.

288
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,653
He's a hero who saved
a pregnant lady from the tracks.

289
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,489
I don't get why Chief Min
is suddenly leading this surgery.

290
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,408
This patient needs
transsphenoidal surgery.

291
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,077
Dr. Chae is the specialist for it.
How could he steal that?

292
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,663
An endoscope is inserted into the nose.

293
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,833
I gathered all of his data, too.

294
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,711
It will be perfect
if I do this with Dr. Chae.

295
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,713
My gosh. Aren't you going to eat?

296
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,299
I told you I have a conference.

297
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,634
Dr. Heo Seon-bin. Dr. Ahn Chi-hong.

298
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,094
They are three-year residents.

299
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,596
-Hello.
-Hello.

300
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,432
I've got a question for you.
Are you guys a thing, too?

301
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,809
-No, we are not.
-We are not a thing, either.

302
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,812
Why are you always together?
Captain Ahn is older than you.

303
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,231
He's from the military academy.
People are fascinating.

304
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,066
We're close.
We went to the same med school.

305
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,401
But your genders...

306
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,987
-My gosh. He's so old-fashioned.
-Oh, Father.

307
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,323
That's what I should say.

308
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,949
What am I going to do with this surgery?

309
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,410
Dr. Heo, take the med students with you.

310
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,704
Dr. Ahn, come with me to the conference.

311
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,622
Okay.

312
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,168
It's a large pituitary tumor.

313
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,213
I don't think I can remove the tumor
completely through the TSA.

314
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,759
So I'll take the pterional approach
to resect the tumor.

315
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,554
If you do,
there will be a lot of bleeding.

316
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,264
Won't that cause a brain injury?

317
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,391
It's an unusually big tumor.

318
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,560
It's deeply expanded
into the suprasellar region.

319
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,437
It's better
if I take the pterional approach.

320
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,814
But I still believe
the TSA is a better approach.

321
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,524
He'll need radiation therapy later,

322
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,152
but given that he has diabetes
and his wounds will heal slowly,

323
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,654
performing a craniotomy is too much.

324
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,156
We must remove the tumor completely.

325
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,701
The first thing the press asks will be
the result of the surgery.

326
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,580
If we say some of the tumor remains
and he might undergo radiation therapy,

327
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,874
what do you think
those reporters will write?

328
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,293
It will only ruin
the hospital's reputation.

329
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,922
Saving the patient and removing the tumor
completely is important.

330
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,215
But if you take that approach,

331
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,094
his optic nerves or his pituitary stalk
might be damaged.

332
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,889
I don't think you guys have
much experience with this surgery.

333
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,141
I've performed this surgery
hundreds of times.

334
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,727
The quality of his life is important,

335
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,521
but seeing the tumor myself

336
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,815
and removing it completely
will be much better for him.

337
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,193
I've had a very low percentage
of sequelae among my patients.

338
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,987
Their recoveries weren't that bad.

339
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,614
It's got to be more than
a low chance of suffering from sequelae.

340
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,826
Even if our reputation gets ruined
for a while,

341
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,913
the patient's quality of life
must be taken into account.

342
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,669
Wait here. I'm going to the bank.

343
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,088
Hey, Old-timer.

344
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,134
Share your wisdom with the med students.
You've lived twice as long as them.

345
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,137
"Old-timer"? I'm still in my 30s.

346
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,805
But you turn 40 next year.

347
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,438
All right. First off, what are your names?

348
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,231
My name is Jang Hong-do.

349
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,359
I bet you were good at ssireum
at your school.

350
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,362
What do you do for fun? Calligraphy?

351
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,199
No, I play the guitar.
I'm in a band at my church.

352
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,868
Not a traditional instrument?

353
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,788
Sorry.

354
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,373
What's your name?

355
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,042
It's Yun-bok.

356
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,546
Don't joke around.

357
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,758
You informed Dr. Chae, right?

358
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,718
Her phone was off, so I sent a text.

359
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,678
Okay. She has a lecture today.

360
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,096
She will respond soon.

361
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,723
-Does she give lectures?
-Yes.

362
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,310
She teaches and does a lot of surgery.

363
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,562
And she checks
residents' papers thoroughly.

364
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,899
And she attends symposiums.
She goes hiking and camping on weekends.

365
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,819
But she still manages to come
to work at 7 a.m. She's never late.

366
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,738
Is that even possible?

367
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,783
That's why her nickname is Ghost.
I gave her that nickname.

368
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,244
She's in the lobby.
She's coming with Ms. Hwang.

369
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,162
See?

370
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,625
There's no other explanation of how she
can do everything unless she's a ghost.

371
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,667
Let's go in.

372
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,882
You're known as the Ghost.
And yet, your shoes are worn out.

373
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,343
-I'm the Ghost?
-Yes, that's your nickname.

374
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,512
-Why is that?
-Because you can't be human.

375
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,680
It's post-op day seven for Kim Ju-chan.
How is he?

376
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,475
His wound is clean.
We can take his stitches out.

377
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,727
By the way, your birthday is next week.

378
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,270
I'll buy you a pair of shoes.

379
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,231
This pair can last me ten more years.

380
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,274
It's been about ten years
since I first saw them.

381
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,318
You got them when you were a resident.

382
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,112
You should bid farewell to your shoes.

383
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,822
Who was it?

384
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,490
Who nicknamed me?

385
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,741
Yong Seok-min did.

386
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,867
Got it.

387
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,957
My gosh.

388
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,212
You still have a long way to go,

389
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,423
but make sure you choose GS for your field
when you become residents.

390
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,804
Don't say,
"You mean the GS convenience store?"

391
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,473
It's not
the GS home-shopping network either.

392
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,434
I see. You mean, general surgery?

393
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,562
That's right.

394
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,940
I know there aren't a lot of residents
for other fields either.

395
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,111
But there are only
a handful of GS residents in Korea.

396
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,404
You know what?

397
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,033
There has been a new dynamic to this.

398
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,373
Listen up, Jang-hwa and Hong-ryeon.

399
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,209
Our names are Hong-do and Yun-bok.

400
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,129
Okay. Hong-do and Yun-bok.
Listen carefully.

401
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,092
Here in our hospital,
there are 13 general surgeons.

402
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,137
But there is only one resident.

403
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,389
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul, what are you doing?

404
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,185
She's like the only daughter of 13 dads.

405
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,604
Then, who do you think has the upper hand?

406
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,482
Guys, general surgery isn't so bad.

407
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,818
Dr. Jang, why did you come
to work so early?

408
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,111
I told you to take today off.

409
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,488
She prepared the materials
for a colorectal surgery meeting.

410
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,407
Don't talk to her. She's busy.

411
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,491
And get lost.

412
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,702
Go.

413
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,591
My goodness. Dr. Jang, have you eaten?

414
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,343
I had pot noodles here earlier.

415
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,344
Pot noodles?

416
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,222
That's not real food. Come on.

417
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,182
Let's go. I'll buy you a meal. Come.

418
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,478
If you collapse,
General Surgery will collapse, too. Come.

419
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,396
-I'm fine.
-Really?

420
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,859
You were reading Lee Yong-chan's chart.

421
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,237
This patient will get
a liver transplant tomorrow morning.

422
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,782
Liver transplant.
And I'm leading the surgery.

423
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,910
Do you want to join me?

424
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,207
He's an HCC patient.

425
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,127
Dr. Jang, I'm doing my rounds.

426
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,420
Can you come with me?

427
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,839
-No, she can't. No.
-Hey, hold on.

428
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,344
You'll join me, right?

429
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,264
I still can't turn my head because
I had to do surgery alone yesterday.

430
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,100
I can do it if it's in the morning.

431
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,227
Really?

432
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,062
Really?

433
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,649
There you are, Dr. Jang.

434
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:21,071
Can you help me with my breast cancer
surgery tomorrow morning?

435
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,243
Yes, I will.

436
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,038
Hey, you.

437
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,541
Dr. Lee Ik-jun.

438
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,834
Hello, sir.

439
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,920
You know what?

440
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,550
How are you such a great dancer? How?

441
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,054
I have never seen anyone who's
as good at singing and dancing as you

442
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,933
and who knows how to have fun
as much as you.

443
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,476
I'm flattered, sir.

444
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,354
I'll see you at the next gathering.

445
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,689
-Okay.
-Have a good day.

446
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,825
Dr. Jang, that means that you won't be
joining me tomorrow morning, right?

447
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,369
I'm sorry.

448
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
I'll disinfect everything tomorrow,

449
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,333
open the patient up,
and close him up by myself.

450
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,335
But next time,

451
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
please...

452
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,549
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

453
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,928
-Pick me, pick me, pick me up
-Yes?

454
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,805
I'll be right there.

455
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,183
-Where? Eat the sausage.
-It's the ER.

456
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,101
Should I call Jeong-won?
I heard he's not busy.

457
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,770
It was a personal call to me.

458
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,818
Hello, ma'am.

459
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,240
What? Okay. I'll be there.

460
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,784
Don't worry. Just go.

461
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,952
I'll take care of it. Yes.

462
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,623
That's the Blood Collection Room,
CT Scan Room,

463
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,124
X-Ray Room and MRI Room.

464
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,001
If you go straight,
there's the PET Scan Room.

465
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,170
You've heard of PET, right?

466
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,089
PET? Like a plastic bottle?

467
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,341
Positron emission tomography?

468
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,467
What is that used for?

469
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,595
I don't know that much yet.

470
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,472
We just got into med school.

471
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,516
You guys are soulmates, aren't you?

472
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,018
-Yes.
-I knew it.

473
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,523
Dr. Heo, will we be going
to the operating rooms?

474
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,982
Someday.

475
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,486
Hui-su, I saw your Instagram post.
You had a soufflé pancake yesterday.

476
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,363
-Was that any good?
-Totally.

477
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,907
I went to the cafe at 3 p.m. after work.
I didn't have to wait.

478
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,076
You should go and try it, too.

479
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,911
If only I had time.

480
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,663
Can you come with me, then?

481
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,457
Actually, I should treat you to a meal
for looking after my interns.

482
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,044
You always treat me. It's on me next time.

483
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,883
Dr. Jang, have some cookies.

484
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,219
No, I don't like sweets.

485
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,012
I see. Okay.

486
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,973
How old is the patient?

487
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,142
He's a seven-year-old
and was in a traffic accident.

488
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,018
And he shows signs of stupor.

489
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,395
That's why I called the GS.

490
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,896
I see.

491
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,941
Hello.

492
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,610
Okay.

493
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,988
It will take 20 more minutes.

494
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,032
-Then, I'll come back after my meal.
-Okay.

495
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,040
Guys, this isn't free.
It's coming out of my paycheck.

496
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,876
We had pot noodles just now.

497
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,586
Thank you for the meal.

498
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,504
Let's go.

499
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,847
Sir, a lot of sausages, please.

500
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,765
-Are you a resident?
-Pardon?

501
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,561
-Yes.
-Okay. Then, you can have three sausages.

502
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,646
She told me not to give more than two,

503
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,149
but I gave you three
since you're a resident. Next.

504
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,986
-Are you an intern?
-No, I'm a med student.

505
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,613
My gosh. I'll give you five sausages.

506
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,448
Here.

507
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,824
There you go.

508
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,202
-You, too?
-Yes.

509
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,579
Okay. Here. There you go.

510
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,874
What are you doing here?

511
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,209
You're a professor.

512
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,585
You get one sausage.

513
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,926
That way, I can even out the sausages.

514
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,803
I gave a lot of sausages
to the people in front of you.

515
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,306
The higher your position is,
the fewer sausages you get.

516
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,933
Don't stand there. Keep moving.

517
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,022
The cafeteria lady and I are best friends.

518
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,608
Her son suddenly ended up
at the police station.

519
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,988
I'm wearing gloves and a mask.

520
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,406
Give me one more.

521
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,493
-Just one more.
-Get lost. Next.

522
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,577
Okay.

523
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,672
Seriously?

524
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,341
Darn it.

525
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,552
Gosh.

526
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,136
Here.

527
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,975
This way, I can balance
supply and demand.

528
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,185
I gave a lot of sausages
to the people in front of you.

529
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,437
You should make a small sacrifice, sir.

530
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,605
Next.

531
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,696
Hi.

532
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,124
You know how much I care, right?

533
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,543
Thank you.

534
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,253
Wait.

535
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,677
They prepare everything

536
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,847
from breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night
snacks to boxed meals during surgery.

537
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,056
Even boxed meals?

538
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,017
They send meal boxes upstairs.

539
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,185
We can't come down to eat during surgery.

540
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,982
After eating this meal,
will we go to the operating rooms?

541
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,775
I don't know.

542
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,069
Okay.

543
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,471
A seven-year-old boy
from a traffic accident.

544
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,474
He was out with his mom.
He was trying to pick up a toy on the road

545
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,268
when a speeding truck crashed into him.
His BP is 60/40.

546
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,228
I think his pelvis
and chest bone are broken.

547
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,522
Ju-hwan.

548
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,240
I see intraperitoneal bleeding
and thoracic injury.

549
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,117
From the X-ray,
he has a cervical spine injury.

550
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,328
And it seems
he has a pelvic fracture, too.

551
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,247
What should we do?

552
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,375
What do you mean?
We should try to save him.

553
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,751
Get a CT scan now.

554
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,712
He might have a brain injury,
so call Dr. Chae.

555
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,672
Okay.

556
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,131
Where's Dr. Ahn Jeong-won?

557
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,717
He was working outside today,
but he's almost here.

558
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,054
This will be a tough case
even with Jeong-won's help. Goodness.

559
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,516
He's losing consciousness.

560
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,893
And we can't get his pulse,
and his breathing is weak.

561
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,229
We only checked his ultrasound
and X-ray scan.

562
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,563
He has hemoperitoneum,

563
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,482
cervical spine injury,
and a pelvic fracture.

564
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,068
We'll know more once we take his brain CT.

565
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,113
There's a high chance that
his brain might be swelling as well.

566
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,156
We can operate, but even if we do,

567
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,158
it may be hard for him
to regain consciousness.

568
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,246
What are you doing? Go.

569
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,832
His guardian must be waiting.
Go talk to her now.

570
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,542
Yes, Doctor.

571
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,086
We have our conference rooms here.

572
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,256
When a patient needs surgery, the surgeon
doesn't make all the decisions.

573
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,007
All the professors
in the department gather,

574
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,260
discuss the best approach for the patient,

575
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,678
and advise each other.

576
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,222
Let's see if this room is open.

577
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,522
They are cute.

578
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,066
I used to be young like them.

579
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,404
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,449
Anyway, we have our precious med students.

581
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,325
Let's listen to why
they applied to med school.

582
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,786
What's wrong with him? Just let them go.

583
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,330
Right? You don't like that, either.

584
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,792
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry.

585
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,128
I won't talk to you.

586
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,091
Both of my parents are doctors,
so I didn't have much choice--

587
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,719
Hey, Seon-bin.
We're not interested in your story.

588
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,265
Let's start with you, first.

589
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,018
Why did you decide to study medicine?

590
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,561
Well...

591
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,106
my mother had major surgery ten years ago.

592
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,026
I was moved by the devoted doctor
who treated my mom.

593
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,527
So I decided to study medicine.

594
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,945
Gosh, that's great.

595
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,864
Next.

596
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,699
Well...

597
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:50,121
my mother had major surgery ten years ago.

598
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,957
I was moved by her passionate doctor--

599
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,626
She already said that.

600
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,836
Your friend just said that.

601
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,714
I'm sorry. We'll get going now.

602
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,882
-Let's go.
-Bye.

603
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,300
Bye.

604
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,760
Bye.

605
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,096
-Let's go that way.
-Thank you.

606
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,723
TELL THEM YOU'LL DO IT, PROFESSOR

607
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,641
Thank you.

608
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,230
Yes. This is Chae Song-hwa speaking.

609
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,401
I called you at the perfect time, right?

610
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,153
Yes. Nicely done.

611
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,032
Who is it? Come in.

612
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,162
You should volunteer to do it.

613
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,580
Unbelievable.

614
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,250
Do you think doing surgery
is like booking a hotel room?

615
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,544
Changing the lead surgeon
isn't that simple.

616
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,754
Are you going to watch the patient die?

617
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,672
Hey!

618
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,594
Professor Min said he won't do
a craniotomy. He'll do the TSA.

619
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,720
What's the problem here?

620
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,016
He's only performed a TSA
once in his career.

621
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,477
And his fellow doctor

622
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,896
did most of the work
while he just stood in the OR.

623
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,440
The tumor expanded
into the suprasellar region.

624
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,110
Executing the TSA will be
especially difficult for this case.

625
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,362
I'm sure he can handle it.

626
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,739
At his previous hospital,
his fellow doctor

627
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,700
did the TSA for him. But what about us?

628
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,035
We have you. You can assist him.

629
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,704
I don't know anything!

630
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,248
You startled me. Keep your voice down.

631
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,125
Professor Chae.

632
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,170
Will you let Professor Min
operate on Gong Hyeong-u?

633
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,840
That's not right.
We can't do that to a patient.

634
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,968
You should talk to the hospital director.

635
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,261
Tell him you'll do it.

636
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,929
Isn't that in two days?

637
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,100
I have skull base tumor surgery
tomorrow afternoon.

638
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,310
It won't have ended by then.

639
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,936
I just don't have time for it.

640
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,398
You can ask the anesthesiologist
to buy you some time.

641
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,483
I'll set up everything.

642
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,444
I don't know.
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

643
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,362
Jun-wan, do you have anything
for headaches?

644
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,656
You're a neurosurgeon.
Don't you have anything?

645
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,782
Let's go to my office.

646
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,243
Professor Chae. Please.

647
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,162
-Professor Chae.
-Stop it.

648
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,080
That's enough whining.

649
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,301
-What did I just say?
-You saw Professor Jang with his junior.

650
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,432
-You knew it, didn't you?
-It was a coincidence.

651
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,436
-Hey.
-It's a day or two before he came clean.

652
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,896
I was going to tell you.

653
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,314
You should've told me right away.

654
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,274
I can't assume anything
about relationships.

655
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,318
If you see something,
just tell me as it is.

656
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,028
Your concern doesn't matter.

657
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,614
Hey, it's not that easy to do.
You think you could've told me?

658
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,616
Yes. I would tell you right away.

659
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,869
I would tell you your girlfriend was
cheating on you the second I saw it.

660
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,748
-What is it?
-It's time for your outpatients.

661
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,918
-I don't have outpatients today.
-I was talking to Professor Chae.

662
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,670
Right.

663
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,673
We're not done.

664
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,598
Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS
was waiting by the door.

665
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,641
Okay.

666
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,937
Good. This is the best thing
you've done this year.

667
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,663
It's highly likely
that he's having hemorrhagic shock.

668
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,040
Then, what should we do?

669
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,583
His pulse is weak.

670
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,961
We believe he may have
a thoracic and brain injury.

671
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,838
We took him up for CT.

672
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,340
But we're not sure if he will last.

673
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,592
There's a slim chance we can save him.

674
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,803
There's no hope for him.

675
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,726
Doctor, please save Ju-hwan.

676
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,061
If he's gone,

677
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,397
I won't be able to live.

678
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,527
Did you perform CPR?

679
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,696
Pardon?

680
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,531
Did you do chest compressions?

681
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,825
No.

682
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,370
He could have lived if you had done that.

683
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,622
-What?
-Dr. Jang.

684
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,750
-Yes?
-A word, please.

685
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,094
I'm Professor Ahn from Pediatric Surgery.

686
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,764
It is true that things
aren't good for your son,

687
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,266
but we will do everything
we can to save him.

688
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,519
I'll talk to you once we get the CT scan.

689
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,066
Ma'am, it's too early to be sure
about anything.

690
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,331
Dr. Jang, how long
have you been a resident?

691
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,792
-Three years.
-Is that how you talk to guardians?

692
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,419
He could've lived if she did CPR?

693
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,088
How could you say that?

694
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,674
Did you think about how guilty
she would feel for the rest of her life?

695
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,969
And how can you be certain
if he has no hope or a slim chance?

696
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,306
I've observed him since he got here.

697
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,390
I only told her the facts

698
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,476
after reading his chart
and observing his condition.

699
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,814
But what I told her is true.

700
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,983
He indeed has a slim chance.

701
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,946
I told her the truth because I believed
she needed to know her son's condition.

702
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,702
Telling her that
she should have performed CPR...

703
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,581
It was my mistake. I am sorry.

704
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,085
What are you doing here?

705
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,753
Come out. We need this bed.

706
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,797
How's the kid? Did you call Song-hwa?

707
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,924
I don't have to.

708
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,384
What?

709
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,178
There's no brain damage from the CT scan.

710
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,056
We can save him if we focus
on stopping the bleeding.

711
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,642
My gosh. That was a close one.

712
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,103
I need to treat a patient
with a stomachache.

713
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,688
And I'm taking Dr. Bae Jun-hui.

714
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,773
Dr. Jang, talk to the guardian for me.

715
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,111
Dr. Jang.

716
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,576
Do you know why doctors only give vague
answers such as "We can't be sure yet,"

717
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,244
"We don't know yet,"

718
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,830
and "We need to observe a bit more"?

719
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,042
Doctors must take
responsibility for their words.

720
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,336
So we must be careful with our words.

721
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,508
There's only one thing we, doctors,
can tell our patients with certainty.

722
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,511
"We will do our best."

723
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,014
That's the only thing.

724
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,352
Go.

725
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,563
His mother will be so happy to hear that.

726
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,613
Okay. Bye.

727
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,367
I looked at this patient's chart
this morning.

728
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,662
The patient had breast cancer surgery
at our hospital a month ago.

729
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,374
I do see a 3cm-metastatic tumor
in the parietal lobe.

730
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,003
From her record,
after the breast cancer surgery,

731
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,796
she was also treated for depression.

732
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,049
Was that why she didn't do chemotherapy?

733
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,093
Bring her in. What's her name?

734
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,094
It's Ba-ram.

735
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,388
Her name is Ba-ram.

736
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,101
I went to high school
with a girl who had the same name.

737
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,770
We were quite close.

738
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,605
I still remember her number.

739
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,565
She's the same age as you.

740
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,068
-My gosh.
-No.

741
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,237
She has a unique last name.

742
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,947
-It's Gal.
-Yes.

743
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,490
So her attendance number was...

744
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,868
My gosh.

745
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,536
I knew it was you.

746
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,748
You're famous.
Your name pops up on search engines.

747
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,168
That's enough.
Why didn't you do chemotherapy?

748
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,379
If you had, you could've stopped it
from spreading.

749
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,506
It would have spread even if I did.

750
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,676
I will die in the end no matter what.
What's the point?

751
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,889
Is my surgery difficult?

752
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,059
No. It's on the layer
that wraps around your head.

753
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,645
So it's not hard. You don't have to worry.

754
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,438
I'm not worried...

755
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,190
since my doctor is you.

756
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,110
Do I need to get admitted today?

757
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,862
Well, we're not pressed for time
to do the surgery.

758
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,031
But still, it's best to do it
as soon as possible.

759
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,617
I'm available this weekend.
Let's do it then.

760
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,287
You should get admitted today
and get all the tests.

761
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,663
Thank you.

762
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,625
You can thank me at our school reunion
after you get discharged.

763
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,170
Will I live until then?

764
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,463
Hey.

765
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,349
What a long day.

766
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,935
Professor Chae, didn't you drive today?

767
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,355
I did. But I don't have energy
to drive now.

768
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,442
And I'm hungry, too.

769
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,200
Dr. Chae, I'm hungry.
Let's get some kalguksu.

770
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,577
Sounds great.

771
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,162
Should I call the others?

772
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,830
-I'm here.
-God, you're so loud.

773
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,790
-I'm here. Get in.
-I'm right here!

774
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,459
-Hey, pull up your seat.
-Wait.

775
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,543
-Hurry.
-Pull up. Come on.

776
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,754
-Hey, pull up your seat, too.
-This is it.

777
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,547
-You should drive yourselves!
-Hey, hold on.

778
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,466
-What about your car?
-Okay. Hold on.

779
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,967
-Come on.
-There are five of us!

780
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,761
MAMA'S HOMEMADE KALGUKSU, 24 HOURS

781
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,480
Want a pain relief patch?

782
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,482
You carry all sorts of stuff there.

783
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,608
Ma'am.

784
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,528
My mother likes kalguksu.
Should I take some home?

785
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,447
-Jeong-won, give me your cup.
-Okay.

786
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,450
Do you know what your nickname is?

787
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,535
What is it? Is it Angel?

788
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,662
-It's Buddha.
-I see.

789
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,500
That makes no sense, right?
His family has two priests and two nuns.

790
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,043
I love Buddha, too.

791
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,505
My goodness. Jeong-won is my ideal friend.

792
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,841
Gosh, if I had a younger sister,
I would set you up with her.

793
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,552
-You do have a sister.
-Oh, right. I do.

794
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,430
Mom. Do you want me
to bring home some kalguksu?

795
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,557
Why are you asking her that?
Just buy some for her.

796
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,975
Kalguksu.

797
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,645
I'll be home soon after this meal.

798
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,230
Is something bothering you?

799
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,648
What? No.

800
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,191
I bet it's because of Gong Hyeong-u.

801
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,902
The good Samaritan from the subway?
What about him?

802
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,947
I heard the new chief
will be performing the surgery.

803
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,615
What does she have to do with it?

804
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,494
I heard Professor Min doesn't have
much experience with TSA.

805
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,288
And given the location
of the tumor and sequelae,

806
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,874
going with TSA is a much better choice
than a craniotomy.

807
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,085
Since he was originally my patient,

808
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,796
I'm thinking of telling him
that I'll take the patient.

809
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,923
But that might be a bit awkward.

810
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,758
He's Professor Min's patient now
after all.

811
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,468
My mom wants to talk to you.

812
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,637
Hello, Mother. It's Ik-jun, your stepson,

813
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,056
who's cheerful and bubbly
unlike your biological son.

814
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,558
-Yes.
-Right?

815
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,436
My gosh. How am I going
to take the surgery from him?

816
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,062
I would just tell him.

817
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,314
-Of course, you would.
-Yes.

818
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,442
If that's a better option
for the patient, I ought to.

819
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,485
"I can perform that surgery
better than you.

820
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,237
And it's better for the patient."

821
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,864
I'd tell him exactly that.

822
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,868
I couldn't do it. Every doctor
has their methods and stories.

823
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,494
It's crossing the line.

824
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,830
No, it is not. We must stick to the facts.

825
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,915
If you're so inclined to stick to facts,

826
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,626
why didn't you tell me the fact
that my ex was cheating on me?

827
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,837
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

828
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,505
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

829
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,715
Okay.

830
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,134
Is that so? Okay.

831
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,345
Okay. Thank you.
Anyway, I'll get it checked out.

832
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,847
I know a few clinics.

833
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,642
Okay. Thank you. Take care.

834
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,061
-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes?

835
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,814
I don't want your mom to know
about my prostate problems.

836
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:28,068
I told my mom that you're going
to the bathroom too often these days,

837
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,404
due to frequent urination
and urinary retention.

838
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,781
Professor Min's case
is different from your ex's.

839
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,575
He has nothing to do with me.

840
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,410
It's strictly work,
whereas you're a couple.

841
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,703
I can't tell you what to do.

842
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,205
I never told you to.

843
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,248
I'm saying
you should've told me what you saw.

844
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,791
-Could you have done it?
-Yes, totally.

845
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,793
-Liar.
-Hey.

846
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,921
The kalguksu is ready.

847
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,756
Fight later. Let's eat first.

848
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:54,637
If I saw your girlfriend with another guy,
I'd call you right away.

849
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,305
Goodness, it's easier said than done.

850
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,520
I never liked Professor Jang
to begin with.

851
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,605
-Pass me the chili powder.
-Okay.

852
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,735
Excuse me. Can we get another spoon?

853
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,247
Hey, U-ju. Daddy will be home soon.

854
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,040
Why are you still up?

855
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,792
U-ju is still awake?

856
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,878
Hey, I heard you bought a big-ass TV.

857
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,713
I'll see you in your dreams. Bye.

858
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,050
Seok-hyeong's TV is like his girlfriend.

859
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,343
It was pretty expensive.

860
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,183
I want to see it when we meet up
for our next band practice session.

861
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,894
Right, when should we meet up for that?

862
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,771
How about this weekend?

863
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,856
I have surgery booked this weekend.

864
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,525
How many bowls of rice would you like?

865
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,443
-Two?
-Just one.

866
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,612
-Two will be too many, right?
-Yes, I'm getting full.

867
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,906
-Just one, please.
-Jeez!

868
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,159
We want five.
Please stir-fry five bowls of rice.

869
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,371
-I knew Jeong-won would get this angry.
-Hey, aren't you full?

870
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,623
-Hey, what the--
-He didn't eat much.

871
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,751
And us, too. We just started eating.

872
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,046
Guys, no one would eat that fast
even during a war. Why eat so quickly?

873
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,091
Okay. Why are you getting so worked up?
Order five servings.

874
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,968
You're so self-centered.

875
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,554
What a weird thing to hear
in the middle of eating kalguksu.

876
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,930
Why don't you try to eat faster?

877
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,850
Why don't you try to slow down a little?

878
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,767
Hi, Mom.

879
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,936
Oh, fresh kimchi?

880
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,397
Excuse me. I'll take some fresh kimchi
to go as well.

881
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,566
Why must I control my pace
when I'm paying for my food?

882
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,027
No, you're not.
The hospital's paying for this.

883
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,946
And it's my dad's hospital.
So strictly speaking, it is my money.

884
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,156
Jeez, you petty prick.

885
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,283
Fine. I'll pay for what I ate.
How much do I owe you?

886
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,160
-Pay me.
-Okay, so how much?

887
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,703
Guys, stop. Enough!

888
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,913
Gosh, seriously.

889
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,915
You guys are acting like
you're around U-ju's age.

890
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,043
You're 40. Must you fight over fried rice?

891
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,753
Hey, you have no idea what they did to me.

892
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,172
When we had cheonggukjang last time,
I only ate tofu.

893
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,716
-These two ate all the beef.
-Jeez.

894
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,720
Okay, I heard you.
Jeez, the things this prick remembers.

895
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,639
So how many bowls of rice?

896
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,182
-Five, please!
-Just two!

897
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,060
Give us 3.5 bowls, please.

898
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:17,529
DID I REALLY HURT YOUR FEELINGS?

899
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,377
NO, I UNDERSTAND.
I WAS JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

900
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,003
OKAY

901
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,725
-Hello, Professor.
-You haven't given up yet?

902
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,145
Of course not. How could I?
It's important for the patient.

903
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,273
Professor, I'm begging you
for the last time.

904
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,025
Please perform the surgery.

905
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,653
I can't.
I'd be overstepping the bounds if I did.

906
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,281
Unless the patient requests me.

907
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,078
It's getting late,
so don't bring it up today.

908
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,748
Speak with the patient tomorrow morning.

909
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,917
Explain the situation well.

910
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,051
How are you feeling?

911
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,262
Well, you know.

912
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,014
-Where's your husband?
-I have my caregiver, so it's fine.

913
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:30,310
If he were here, he'd just
get on my nerves, so this is better.

914
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,731
I get it, but he needs to sign
the consent for your surgery.

915
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,483
-Did you e-mail him?
-Yes, I did.

916
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,404
He read it but hasn't replied yet.

917
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,282
Who cares about a reply?
He should come here right away.

918
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,869
It takes him two days to just
get out of there. He's in Indonesia.

919
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,037
What was the place called?

920
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,415
I can never remember the name.

921
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,625
He's probably busy cutting down the trees.

922
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,879
Was he around
for your breast cancer surgery?

923
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,173
I never told him. He has no idea.

924
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,717
-Hey.
-Nothing changes even if he knows.

925
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,512
I don't want to think about my husband
and everything else.

926
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,643
I'll just suffer and die alone.

927
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,896
What are you talking about?

928
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,107
And what's with the curtains?
Don't you feel stuffy?

929
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,276
This ward is filled with elderly ladies.

930
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,070
They're all so nosy.

931
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,782
A breast cancer patient fascinates them.

932
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,785
I think they want to know whether
one of my breasts is fake or not.

933
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,412
They keep looking at me.

934
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,248
That's why I closed the curtains.

935
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,417
Have some rice cake.

936
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,753
No, thanks.

937
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,631
Are you fasting right now?

938
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,424
No, I don't want to eat.

939
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,765
My gosh, you're here too.

940
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,351
Doctor, try some rice cake.

941
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,061
Sure, I'll try one.

942
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,063
You can urinate
without any problems, right?

943
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,608
Yes, of course.
I'm doing great these days.

944
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,278
It's all because you took
such good care of me.

945
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,447
-I'm totally fine now.
-I see.

946
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:10,118
My head used to turn to one side like this
for no reason,

947
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:14,289
and my lips used to twitch
as if someone was trying to pull them.

948
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,085
-Like this. It used to twitch like this.
-Right, I see.

949
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,255
You should still take it easy.
And make sure you eat well.

950
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,965
-I will.
-See you.

951
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,100
-Chi-hong.
-Yes.

952
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,476
Go get ready for the surgery.

953
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,271
I'll take care of the positioning.
Just set up the Wilson frame.

954
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,064
-Call me when everything's ready.
-Will do.

955
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,070
Thank you, Doctor.

956
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,242
Gosh, you're really not understanding
what I'm trying to say.

957
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,913
Your tumor is located behind your nose,
near the center of the brain,

958
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,623
which isn't ideal at all.

959
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,793
It'd be dangerous to open the skull
to get to the cranial base,

960
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,253
so we'll do a procedure called TSA,

961
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,755
where an endoscope is inserted
in the nose to remove the tumor,

962
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,717
but Professor Min Gi-jun
does not specialize in that surgery.

963
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,929
Dr. Min said it won't be
such a dangerous procedure.

964
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,306
He told me to trust him.

965
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,184
I just like Dr. Min.

966
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,936
I want to stick with him.

967
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,023
It's your life that's on the line.

968
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:26,904
I'd never suggest you do
something that is bad for you.

969
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:31,617
I've explained it to you multiple times.
What can I do if you just don't get it?

970
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,785
Please just do as I say, okay?

971
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,371
Just do as you're told
if you don't know anything.

972
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,665
Your guardian doesn't get it either.

973
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,752
I've already put it
in layman's terms for you.

974
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,472
-Hey.
-Professor, we're ready.

975
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,307
Okay.

976
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,189
PROFESSOR OF NEUROSURGERY

977
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,326
Aren't you performing
occipital lobe surgery today?

978
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,161
Yes, I have to go to the OR now.

979
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,081
Gosh, you'll probably be done
tomorrow morning.

980
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,333
Anyway, what brought you here?

981
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,003
Sir, about the patient Gong Hyeong-u...

982
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,422
Jeez, these punks...

983
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,091
I'll assist you.

984
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,137
I still don't feel confident
with the TSA surgery.

985
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,016
I'd love the opportunity
to learn from you.

986
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,443
Thank you. I have to go.

987
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,697
Hey, I'm on my way now.

988
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,575
Professor Chae
got the patient's permission,

989
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,786
-so you should thank her later.
-Okay.

990
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:03,166
The surgery is for a skull base tumor,
so it'll take 10 to 13 hours.

991
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,585
You can observe the beginning
and just go home.

992
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,087
It can take up to 13 hours?

993
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,922
Most neurosurgery procedures
take many hours.

994
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,091
The skull base surgery
especially takes a long time.

995
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,051
It takes an hour
just to position the patient.

996
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,387
-Let's go.
-Okay.

997
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,140
The earliest I'll be done is 6 a.m.

998
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,684
Call Anesthesiology
and ask them to push Gong by an hour.

999
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,186
You go in first and drape the patient.

1000
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,981
-And call the ENT professor.
-Professor, I love you--

1001
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,578
They're still positioning the patient.

1002
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,539
Let's wait for a few minutes. Follow me.

1003
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,041
-Okay.
-Okay.

1004
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,625
Let's go.

1005
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,804
Yun-bok, why did you decide
to go to med school?

1006
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,556
Did you get good grades like I did?

1007
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,308
-Thank you for this.
-Thank you.

1008
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,144
My mom had major surgery ten years ago,

1009
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,938
and I was so inspired by her doctor
back then.

1010
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,565
What? Seriously?

1011
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:13,028
Yes, my mom was very ill
when I was in seventh grade.

1012
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,530
Her surgery took over ten hours.

1013
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,075
They kept her in the ICU
for a week after the surgery...

1014
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,410
but she never woke up. She passed away.

1015
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,497
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1016
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,583
Looking back now,

1017
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,628
I think she was either an intern
or a resident.

1018
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,590
But back then, I thought
everyone in the white coat was a doctor.

1019
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,635
The doctor bawled her eyes out

1020
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,262
and apologized to me
for not being able to save my mom.

1021
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,974
I was only a seventh grader,
but I still knew

1022
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,143
that my mom was in
a very serious condition.

1023
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,396
And all the doctors in the ICU
worked so hard to save her.

1024
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,690
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1025
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,361
I was actually
pretty calm about it at first.

1026
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,446
I was okay

1027
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,575
until an old doctor came
and told me that my mom passed away.

1028
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:05,205
But that doctor started bawling
as soon as she saw us.

1029
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,332
And she apologized.

1030
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:12,963
"Your mom will watch over you from heaven,
so grow into a wonderful woman."

1031
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,299
Then she said she'd be a better doctor.

1032
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,177
She said that in tears
to a seventh grader.

1033
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,141
That's when it really hit us,
both me and Hong-do.

1034
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,770
"We don't have a mom anymore.

1035
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,941
Everyone else has a mom, but we don't."

1036
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,027
I cried my eyes out.

1037
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,197
But what do you mean by "we"?

1038
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,912
Hong-do and I are twins.

1039
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,376
Hey, don't cry.

1040
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,629
He still cries his eyes out
whenever we talk about Mom.

1041
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,048
You should've told me.
Why didn't you tell me?

1042
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,800
It's fun to keep it a secret.

1043
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,804
All our teachers and friends
asked us about it all the time,

1044
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,183
which felt like such a hassle.
So we've decided to just have fun.

1045
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,060
Please don't tell anyone. Sorry.

1046
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,188
We're sorry.

1047
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,566
I won't tell anyone for the time being.

1048
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,028
Yun-bok, do you know the doctor's name?

1049
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,363
You should find her.
She'd be happy to see you.

1050
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,282
And tell her
that you're now a doctor, too.

1051
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,577
-I don't know her name.
-Do you remember her face?

1052
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,413
No, barely.

1053
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,249
Her shoes are the only thing we remember.

1054
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,375
Shoes?

1055
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,128
Yes, our eyes were glued to the floor
because we kept crying.

1056
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,714
I think the doctor was wearing
a new pair of shoes that day,

1057
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,425
but she forgot to take off
the size sticker because she was too busy.

1058
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,763
It was 225 mm. That's all I remember.

1059
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,932
Gosh, you can't find her with that alone.

1060
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,643
Hey, okay.

1061
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,479
-Let's go. They're starting.
-Okay.

1062
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,397
Let's go.

1063
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:58,318
The adhesion is pretty bad, so it'll
take a while to separate the tumor.

1064
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,736
Let's all do our best.

1065
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,993
-Vitals?
-The BP is 120.

1066
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,621
The heart rate is stable,
hovering between 70 and 80.

1067
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:10,622
Good.

1068
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,257
Professor, the med students are here
to observe.

1069
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,801
Okay, tell them to come closer.

1070
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,887
You may come closer.

1071
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,430
Thank you.

1072
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,765
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1073
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,268
Please stay out of this line.

1074
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,270
And be careful
not to bump into the equipment.

1075
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,562
-Okay.
-Okay.

1076
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,564
Observe carefully.

1077
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,317
And don't hesitate to ask me
if you have any questions.

1078
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:40,902
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1079
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,991
This way, more of them
will apply to Neurosurgery.

1080
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,330
-It's for a skull base tumor, right?
-Yes.

1081
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,040
How long do you think it'll take?

1082
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:58,295
Since our ace Professor Chae is doing it,

1083
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,173
-I think it'll take about 13 hours.
-That's very fast.

1085
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,974
Hello, everyone.

1086
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,394
I'm doing this alone again,

1087
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,440
but a competent fellow is here
to assist me.

1088
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,066
What's that word?

1089
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,902
Right, "honor." I'm honored.

1090
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,781
Seriously, thanks.
You're the best, Dr. Jong.

1091
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,162
Treat yourself to some expensive pastries
when we're done.

1092
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,210
Let's save another precious life today.

1093
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,253
-Okay.
-Okay.

1094
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,047
Let's begin. Scalpel.

1095
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,008
PROFESSOR KIM JUN-WAN

1096
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,885
Mr. No Jin-hyeok!

1097
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,054
No Jin-hyeok?

1098
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,889
He had surgery in 2015.

1099
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,266
What? Why is he back?

1100
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,436
Isn't he the college student who got
the ASD surgery from me four years ago?

1101
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,189
Yes, the one you treated
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

1102
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,650
He looks like a different person
in a suit.

1103
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,986
What's going on? I'm worried.

1104
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,529
Anyway, let him in.

1105
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,496
CREDIT CARD APPLICATION

1106
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,623
Doctor.

1107
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,959
You fixed the hole in my heart.

1108
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,129
Please help me out...

1109
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,092
just once more.

1110
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:35,392
KIM JUN-WAN

1111
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,895
Thank you!

1112
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,233
Thank you.

1113
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,871
I hope all goes well.

1114
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:05,213
You see, I just want to be able to buy
clothes for my baby in advance.

1115
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:10,427
Will my baby become BTS or Blackpink?

1116
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,597
Sharp.

1117
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,767
Pardon me? Who?

1118
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,477
Let's say Sharp.

1119
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,063
Sharp? Who's that?

1120
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,815
Oh, you don't know Sharp.

1121
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:24,941
Then...

1122
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,818
How about ZAM?

1123
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,281
Let's say Akdong Musician, AKMU.

1124
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,325
All right.

1125
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,413
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1126
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,461
Hey, shall we pick up something
on the way?

1127
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,546
Let's just order in. It's a hassle.

SURGERY DURATION

1129

-I hope all goes well.
-Thanks, bye. Get some rest.

1130
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,031
A cold cup of iced Americano, please.

1131
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,909
I'd like a warm cup of hot latte.

1132
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,286
Pay for mine, please.

1134
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,835
We're done.

1135
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,756
It went well, right?

1136
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,466
Excellent work, Professor Chae.

1137
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,593
You, too.

1138
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,929
Wrap it up for me.

1139
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,772
You guys are still here?

1140
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

1141
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,900
-Gosh.
-I told you several times

1142
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,986
that you could leave and go home.
I'm impressed.

1143
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,406
-What's your name?
-I'm Jang Yun-bok.

1144
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,658
I'm Jang Hong-do.

1145
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,911
-What's your relationship?
-We're twins.

1146
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,496
Fraternal twins.

1147
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,333
-Professor.
-Yes?

1148
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,043
By any chance...

1149
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,758
Do you go to Myeongjin Church
in Sanggye-dong?

1150
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,593
I do.

1151
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,804
You're the prima donna
of the choir, right?

1152
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,431
-I'm known as the prima donna?
-Yes.

1153
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,016
We're in the church band.

1154
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,602
You're so famous.

1155
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,937
What's she famous for?

1156
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,481
She dances so passionately
while singing hymns.

1157
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,150
People say it's because
she's stressed out from work--

1158
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,320
Get going, guys. Go home.
It's time to go home.

1159
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,114
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

1160
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,783
-Take care.
-Take care.

1161
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,460
Well done, Professor.

1162
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,506
And I'm sorry. You have to operate
on two patients in a row because of me.

1163
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,092
I'm really sorry.

1164
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,469
No worries. I have some time
before the next one.

1165
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,430
We're getting ready for the surgery.

1166
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,349
Professor Min said he'll come down
when we're ready.

1167
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:07,770
I'll call you when we start
working on the sphenoid sinus.

1168
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,689
You should get some sleep.

1169
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,818
-Seok-min.
-Yes.

1170
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,237
Before you go into the OR,

1171
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,281
you should go apologize to him.

1172
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,745
Go apologize to him first.

1173
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,749
Okay.

1174
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,502
I'll go upstairs right now
and apologize to Professor Min.

1175
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,754
Not Professor Min.

1176
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,465
Go apologize to the patient...

1177
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,510
or I won't let you into the OR.

1178
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,475
Okay.

1179
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,422
I'm sorry.

1180
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,593
I sincerely apologize.

1181
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,419
I hope the rest goes well.

1182
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,258
The tumor's been removed,

1183
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,469
and it looks like we managed
to preserve the pituitary stalk as well.

1184
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,762
Seok-min.

1185
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,473
Come here.

1186
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,100
Yes.

1187
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,645
-Dr. Yong.
-Yes, Professor Chae.

1188
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,064
Do not talk like that.

1189
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,525
Okay.

1190
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,610
Wasn't it because of your thesis?

1191
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,781
Why did you talk like it was
for the patient?

1192
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,997
If you talk to any patient
in that tone again,

1193
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,957
I will not forgive you.

1194
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,586
-Okay.
-Do you understand?

1195
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,383
Yes, understood. I'm sorry.

1196
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,476
Why isn't Seok-hyeong answering his phone?

1197
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,561
Song-hwa, too.

1198
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,855
Seok-hyeong is seeing outpatients,

1199
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,231
and Song-hwa has surgery.

1200
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,567
Gosh, Chae Song-hwa. She's amazing.

1201
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,987
That's right.
She's not like you lazy-ass quacks.

1202
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,864
Ik-jun and I don't belong
to the same category.

1203
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,783
You sure do.

1204
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:10,077
You can't trust rich people.
They lie all the time.

1205
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:14,207
He's not rich. He's dirt poor.
He still lives at your place.

1206
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,042
-You promised me my own office.
-Prick.

1207
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,710
-Prick.
-Total prick.

1208
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,671
Hey, my office mate is a pro gamer.

1209
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,673
Professor Ban plays FreeCell all day.

1210
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,092
Actually, forget it.

1211
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,637
Seok-hyeong has the worst one.

1212
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,180
Have you seen his office?

1213
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,660
Professor Ban plays FreeCell
all day anyway.

1214
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,578
He's practically invisible,

1215
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,580
so you do have
the whole office to yourself.

1216
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,041
-I can't believe people call him Buddha.
-What about me?

1217
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:00,211
Hey, you and I are like soul mates.

1218
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,380
Soul mates, my ass.

1219
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,675
Hey, what's up?

1220
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,261
What's the systolic pressure?

1221
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,721
What about norepinephrine?

1222
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,181
Use vasopressin.

1223
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,934
If you still can't get it back up,
call me. I'll come right away.

1224
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,853
Good for you. You have a resident.

1225
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,646
You guys do, too.

1226
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,440
Right, I do. Dr. Long Winter.

1227
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,320
When will I get to work
with the high and lofty Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul?

1228
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,657
You've never worked with Dr. Jang, right?

1229
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,410
You have?

1230
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:35,913
Yes, I've dealt with her a few times as
there have been many emergency cases.

1231
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,749
-She's not my cup of tea.
-Really?

1232
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,379
She seems like the quiet type,
but she's hardworking.

1233
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,426
What's wrong with the patient?

1234
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,970
He's a homeless man,
found at a construction site,

1235
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,513
and got frostbite.

1236
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,182
His leg is rotting.

1237
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,727
119 RESCUE SERVICES

1238
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,355
I have to take your temperature.
Hold on, please.

1239
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:14,869
Hui-su.

1240
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,041
Stay still, please.

1241
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,504
Of course, she's hardworking.
Every resident works hard.

1242
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,131
Jeong-won.

1243
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,800
Oh, everyone's here.

1244
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,136
What's up?

1245
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,930
Do you know Daddy-Long-Legs?

1246
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,848
What?

1247
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,225
-Not sure.
-You don't know?

1248
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,436
He's famous at the hospital
you used to work at.

1249
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,438
Really?

1250
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,148
What about him?

1251
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,401
Oh, my friend who's a TV show director
wants to interview him.

1252
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,402
No, thanks.

1253
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,030
What? What do you mean?
Who are you to say no?

1254
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,991
I mean, he'll say no.

1255
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,743
You said you didn't know him.

1256
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,829
Well, I do know him.
Anyway, he won't do it. No way.

1257
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,039
All right.

1258
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,208
Hey.

1259
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,377
Yes.

1260
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,546
Really? I'll be right there.

1261
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,841
Wait, call Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul as well
just in case.

1262
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,010
What's going on?

1263
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,929
It was Dr. Bae.

1264
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:18,265
A homeless man just came in
with a severely frostbitten leg.

1265
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,768
He stayed at a construction site
with that leg for months.

1266
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,562
The leg is rotting
due to edema caused by frostbite.

1267
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,939
But the leg is totally...

1268
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,691
What?

1269
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,693
Apparently, it's covered with maggots.

1270
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,825
What do we do?

1271
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,952
How will we take them off his leg?

1272
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,415
You're here.

1273
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,127
He got injured at a construction site.

1274
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,296
The skin started rotting due to frostbite.
It's infested with maggots now.

1275
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,633
I've never seen so many maggots.

1276
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,595
We have to remove them
to be able to disinfect the skin.

1277
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,181
-Where's the suction unit?
-I'll go find it.

1278
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,987
Dr. Bae, let's use tweezers...

1279
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,794
She's quite something.

1280
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,345
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1281
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,225
-You're staying late?
-Yes.

1282
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:48,022
My high school friend's surgery
for her metastatic tumor is tomorrow.

1283
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,565
I want to read up on it.

1284
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,402
Get going.

1285
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,112
Bye.

1286
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,198
Take it easy.

1287
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,200
All right.

1288
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,745
Is the day shift better
than the night shift?

1289
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,622
No, the night shift is better.

1290
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,958
Seok-min, do we have the consent
for Gal Ba-ram's surgery?

1291
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,878
-Your high school friend, right?
-Yes.

1292
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,713
No, her husband is not here yet.

1293
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,381
The surgery's tomorrow. What do we do?

1294
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,029
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

1295
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,700
Are you that fascinated by me?

1296
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,120
What?

1297
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:47,164
It must be fascinating
to see a woman with a fake breast.

1298
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,293
No, I don't think that way.

1299
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,879
How could you say that?

1300
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,384
But you're always peeping at me.

1301
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,470
Am I a monkey in the zoo or what?

1302
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,264
Is it fun for you?

1303
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,979
It's because you're pretty.

1304
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,529
I think you're very pretty.

1305
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,201
But I only have one breast.

1306
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,079
I'm not pretty at all.

1307
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,914
You're still pretty.

1308
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,125
Like a beautiful flower.

1309
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,961
Who cares about only having one breast?

1310
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,547
You're beautiful because you're young.

1311
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,132
She's right.

1312
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,303
As for old people like us, even if
we get surgery and walk out of here

1313
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,971
feeling completely healthy,

1314
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:46,015
we'll never look pretty.

1315
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,516
That's right.

1316
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,853
I'd gladly lose both my breasts

1317
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,938
if I could go back to 20 years ago

1318
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,317
and look as young as you do.

1319
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,236
No, don't say that.

1320
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,447
I'm not young.

1321
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,115
You are young.

1322
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:07,244
If I were your age,
I'd divorce my husband.

1323
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,748
I'd just travel the world
and do everything I want to do

1324
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,167
while living my life to the fullest.

1325
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,672
Gosh, I'm just way too old for that now.

1326
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:22,092
My legs hurt, and I can't see well.

1327
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,510
Even my head hurts.

1328
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:32,102
My gosh, you look even prettier
when you smile.

1329
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,815
Everyone who is young looks so beautiful.

1330
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,402
When you're that young,
you just naturally radiate beauty.

1331
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,205
Honey...

1332
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:56,126
Honey.

1333
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,838
-Honey.
-Honey...

1334
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,717
Honey, what do I do?

1335
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,638
What if I die?

1336
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:12,643
What do I do? I don't want to die.

1337
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,105
You won't. You won't die, honey.

1338
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:19,358
I will...
I absolutely won't let that happen.

1339
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,570
I'm sorry, honey. I'm so sorry.

1340
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,155
I'm really sorry.

1341
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,534
Honey, I'm sorry.

1342
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,589
Are you envious?

1343
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,843
-You should date.
-I'm sorry, honey.

1344
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:48,304
No, I don't want to. I like being single.

1345
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,267
Her husband is here,
so we can have him sign the consent.

1346
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,601
Okay.

1347
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,272
Later, not now. Goodness.

1348
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,488
FUNERAL NOTICE
FOR THE DEATH OF JU JONG-SU'S WIFE

1349
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,699
We go to funerals fairly often these days.

1350
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,618
It means that we're at that age now.

1351
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,078
Mr. Ju...

1352
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,290
I mean, Director Ju.
He must be devastated.

1353
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,792
-They had a happy marriage, right?
-Yes, a very happy one.

1354
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,295
I heard he didn't leave his wife alone
even for a minute

1355
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,505
for two to three weeks before her death.

1356
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,926
FUNERAL HOME

1357
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,224
All of you must be busy.
You should get back to work.

1358
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,393
No, it's okay.
Did you get some sleep, sir?

1359
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,729
He didn't.
He's been greeting the guests all day.

1360
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,899
I dragged him here.
Jong-su, you need to eat something.

1361
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:44,735
I'm fine. I can't really eat anything
right now.

1362
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:47,404
Let me know if there's anything you need.

1363
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,114
Are you not drinking?

1364
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,034
No, we're good. Don't worry about us, sir.

1365
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,579
You saw Jeong-won many times
when he was little. Just talk casually.

1366
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:57,581
Exactly. Please talk casually to me, sir.

1367
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,792
Gosh, how could I?

1368
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,503
Our hospital can stay afloat
thanks to these doctors here.

1369
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,254
Maybe at the hospital,

1370
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,674
but you're his mom's friend here,
so please talk casually.

1371
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,259
It'll make us more comfortable.

1372
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,098
-Shall I?
-Yes, please.

1373
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:20,312
So the five of you are best friends?

1374
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,398
Yes, we went to school together.

1375
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,567
We were all in different classes
but somehow ended up becoming friends.

1376
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,529
-My gosh, how adorable.
-Adorable, my foot.

1377
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,366
They're all still single because they want
their parents to worry about them.

1378
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,660
-I'm divorced.
-And I'm married.

1379
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,370
Okay, I like you two.

1380
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:42,000
You're all good-looking.
How did nothing happen between you guys?

1381
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,586
Pardon?

1382
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,924
Why would you do that?

1383
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,678
Why disturb the calm water?

1384
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,472
Did I?

1385
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,392
Oh, romance?

1386
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,102
Has there been any?

1387
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,484
I told Song-hwa I had feelings for her
but got rejected.

1388
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,945
Seriously?

1389
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,738
-When?
-When?

1390
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,323
I don't even remember yesterday.

1391
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,159
On her birthday in our freshman year.

1392
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,494
I told her I had feelings for her
only to be rejected.

1393
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,289
-How did she reject you?
-She said she liked someone else.

1394
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,168
Gosh, that's such a cookie-cutter answer.

1395
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,670
We hear that all the time.
"I like someone else."

1396
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,215
-No, I really did.
-It was like that back in my day too.

1397
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,135
It's hard to say to the person's face
that you just don't like him.

1398
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,137
-That's right.
-Totally.

1399
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,097
-That's true, but...
-Let's change the topic.

1400
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:42,644
Hey, I'm sorry.

1401
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,605
No, I mean... Never mind.

1402
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,650
I still want to be friends with you.

1403
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,862
I don't want things to get awkward
between us because of this.

1404
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,120
Come on. Say something.

1405
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,289
I'm okay.

1406
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:06,126
Song-hwa, I'm sorry for bringing up
such nonsense.

1407
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,962
Gosh, it wasn't nonsense.

1408
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,007
Anyway, let's forget about it.

1409
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,717
It's my birthday today, right?

1410
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:17,221
That's great.
Let's cause some trouble today.

1411
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,098
Hey, let's go. Come on.

1412
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,518
Come on. Hurry.

1413
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:29,024
Just today, okay? I'll make an exception
because it's your birthday. 

1414
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,484
Okay!

1415
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:38,742
Is it because of the cold weather?

1416
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:43,330
Why do couples with their arms locked

1417
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:46,458
Make me teary-eyed?

1418
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:51,129
Do they remind me of the good old days?

1419
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:55,759
Do I want to meet someone new?

1420
01:15:55,842 --> 01:16:01,014
Or do I just miss my ex?

1421
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:08,438
If you know someone nice
Set me up with them

1422
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,901
Someone who's like water and fire

1423
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:17,906
Someone who will truly love me, only me

1424
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:23,370
I want someone who's mature and faithful

1425
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:28,166
If you know someone nice
Set me up with them

1426
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:32,629
Even love requires practice

1427
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:37,884
I want someone caring
Who notices even small details

1428
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:43,515
Someone with a lot of
Relationship experience

1429
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:48,061
I have wounds and scars

1430
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:53,900
So I don't feel comfortable dating someone
With no past whatsoever

1431
01:16:55,736 --> 01:17:00,407
I want to be consoled in the arms

1432
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:05,037
Of someone with pretty eyes who has cried

1433
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,123
Because of a breakup at least once

1434
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:12,753
If only I could lean on the shoulder

1435
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:17,424
Of someone with beautiful hands

1436
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:22,804
And forget my loneliness

1437
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:36,026
Someone with beautiful hands

1438
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:40,822
And forget my loneliness

1439
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,199
MOM

1440
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:45,118
-Hi, Mom.
-Happy birthday, sweetheart.

1441
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,287
Thanks for bringing me into this world.

1442
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:51,375
Had I known it'd be this lovely to have
a daughter, I would've had another one.

1443
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,419
It's not too late. I wouldn't mind
a sibling who's 40 years my junior.

1444
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,296
Your dad's running away.

1445
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,257
Get back here. Talk with your daughter.

1446
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,219
Mom, I'm driving now.
I'll call you when I get to the hospital.

1447
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:03,345
All right.

1448
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:10,394
If you know someone nice
Set me up with them

1449
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:17,484
I want someone who...

1450
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,899
TWO WEEKS AGO

1451
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:16,001
-Let's talk outside.
-Let's just talk here.

1452
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,797
Believe me.
It was just that day, only once.

1453
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,592
Whether it was just that day or not,
I don't care.

1454
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,385
Just tell Song-hwa.

1455
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,264
I said, tell Song-hwa.

1456
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,850
Whether it's just a fling
or a serious affair,

1457
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,144
she needs to know. Am I wrong?

1458
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,148
Don't make a fool of her. Call her now.

1459
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,649
Okay, I'll sort it out by myself.

1460
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,818
-Shall I tell her for you?
-I said, I'll do it.

1461
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,948
You're going overboard.

1462
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,495
This is between me and Song-hwa.

1463
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:54,539
Who are you to tell me what to do?

1464
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,336
Do you have feelings for her?

1465
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,383
I know you two are close,

1466
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,594
but this is too much.

1467
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:14,434
-I bet you have no friends.
-I have friends, of course.

1468
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,019
But you're a guy, and she's a girl.

1469
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:17,312
So what?

1470
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:23,944
You're so old-fashioned.

1471
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,282
Seriously, Song-hwa is too good for you.

1472
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:16,413
What if you can do only the things
you want to do for one day?

1473
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,165
How about we try to live today like that?

1474
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,418
May is the perfect month for that.

1475
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:24,337
Dr. Jang, who's that? Your boyfriend?

1476
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,173
-Even his photo makes you that happy?
-Yes, it does.

1477
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,884
What do you like so much about him?

1478
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,678
He's not authoritative,
and he always does his work.

1479
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,597
I like him.

1480
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,516
Don't cry.
You've been holding out so well.

1481
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,561
I didn't think you'd be like this,
but you're actually very charming.

1482
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,187
Guys, have you heard?

1483
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:42,772
-What?
-What?

1484
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:45,400
Professor Yang, why didn't you tell us?

1485
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:47,652
About what?

1486
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:50,864
Professor,
why didn't you answer your phone?

1487
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:53,366
-Go check in on Ik-jun.
-Why?

1488
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,410
I think something's up,
but he won't tell me.

1489
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:57,037
Hey, Jeong-won. What is this?

1490
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:01,124
Gosh, what is with him?

1491
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,918
He has no feelings.

1492
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:06,671
You prick, you'd better come
to your senses before I beat you up.

1493
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:10,550
What did you just say?
