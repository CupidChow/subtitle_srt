1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,685
I didn't see this coming at all.

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,147
All of a sudden, she said
her peripheral vision was gone,

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,898
so I took her to an ophthalmologist.

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,359
The doctor told me to see a neurosurgeon.

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,529
But So-mi is okay, right?

6
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,038
She hasn't had her first period yet?

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,543
No. Is that a problem?

8
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,172
I see.

9
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,806
Look over here.

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,559
Do you see a mass here?

11
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,189
From the blood test, I see that
her prolactin level is quite elevated.

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,317
It's because there's a tumor
in her pituitary gland.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,027
And the tumor is growing upward.

14
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,280
This part of the brain, optic chiasm,
is the crossing of the optic nerves,

15
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,199
and as you see,
the mass is pressing on this part.

16
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,659
So there has been
a loss of her peripheral vision.

17
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,996
That might be the reason
she still hasn't had her first period.

18
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,956
Does it mean

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,335
I have a brain tumor?

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,546
In my opinion,
it may be a pituitary tumor.

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,467
I can officially diagnose it
based on the biopsy result.

22
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,969
They usually turn out to be benign,
so don't worry.

23
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,889
It's okay, So-mi. This is treatable.

24
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,391
It's definitely treatable.
Isn't that right, doctor?

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,893
Of course.

26
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,438
So-mi, it won't be open brain surgery.

27
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,315
It's called TSA surgery.

28
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,567
We insert an endoscope through your nose

29
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,236
and scratch off the tumor.

30
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,363
If you take medication after the surgery,

31
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,949
you can recover from this
without a problem.

32
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,660
-Don't worry.
-Doctor.

33
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,704
When can she get the surgery?

34
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,749
There's no bleeding in her brain,
so it's not urgent.

35
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,209
But we shouldn't delay it.

36
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,044
Let's get her admitted and proceed.

37
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,838
I'll get her admitted today

38
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,382
and proceed with a blood test,
ECG, and a chest X-ray

39
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,676
to see if she can get the surgery.

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,096
As for the surgery, I'll perform it
when our ENT doctor is available

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,056
and discuss when it will be.

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,933
I'll try to book it as soon as possible.

43
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,393
Thank you.

44
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,437
But she must have been experiencing
headaches and there must've been

45
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,566
a gradual loss of her peripheral vision.
Why didn't you come sooner?

46
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,943
Her tumor progressed quite a bit.

47
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,445
She just told me about it.

48
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,409
I just found out about it.
My gosh, I'm sorry.

49
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,662
Why are you sorry?

50
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,498
Excuse me.

51
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,918
Yes, what is it? I'm with an outpatient.

52
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,798
Jun-wan just went in.

53
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,175
I don't think he can make it.

54
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,389
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

55
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,755
Aren't you cold?

56
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,090
Why didn't you just wait in your office?

57
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,928
Go and get some sleep.

58
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,096
You need to see your patients tomorrow.

59
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,515
I can't sleep.

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,769
I thought about going home,
but I just can't.

61
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,562
Song-hwa.

62
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,277
I don't know how I'm feeling.

63
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,238
What do you mean?

64
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,242
I don't know if I'm sad

65
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,994
or relieved.

66
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,874
I don't know

67
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,377
how I'm supposed to feel.

68
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,962
They are my feelings,

69
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,427
but I can't put a finger on it.

70
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,349
And I don't know

71
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,311
what kind of a face I should put on.

72
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,069
Then, just don't do anything.

73
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,045
Guys, go home. I'm all right.

74
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,505
Jeez.

75
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,970
Will you stay here all night?

76
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,264
Jun-wan will be here.

77
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,225
Yes. I have to be up all night anyway
to check in on the other patients.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,226
You should go home.

79
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,478
I'll call you if something happens.

80
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,440
Listen to him.

81
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,277
I swear.

82
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,363
I don't believe in superstitions.

83
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,076
But I have a bad feeling about it.
I don't think I should leave.

84
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,774
Perhaps,
I should wear a black suit all the time.

85
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,985
Goodness. There are so many funerals
to attend these days.

86
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,947
Chairman Yang had a bad heart,
to begin with, right?

87
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,076
Jeong-won told me he had angina.

88
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,994
And he had gotten the surgery for it.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,247
But he said it wasn't serious.

90
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,500
Gosh, I can't believe he died so suddenly.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,543
If this was going to be it,

92
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,546
he should have been nice
to his wife and children.

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,008
What's going to happen to
his company, then?

94
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,179
Isn't he the majority shareholder
of Taegeon Apparel?

95
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,767
I doubt Professor Yang's mom
can run the company.

96
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,145
-Will Professor Yang run the company?
-How can he do that?

97
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,190
Jong-su.

98
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,152
I guess we don't live in an unfair world.

99
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,197
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about his mistress.

100
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,865
She's left with nothing now.

101
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,576
I'm sure she wanted
to take over the company.

102
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,622
Thank you for coming.

103
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,499
Did you eat?

104
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,127
Can you give them
more side dishes and drinks, please?

105
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,920
We're okay. We ate a lot.

106
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,464
Did you get some sleep?
What about your friends?

107
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,383
I took a short nap.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,636
They all have surgery in the evening,

109
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,179
so they came this afternoon.

110
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,848
-Sir, do you want some beer?
-No.

111
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,100
What about your mother?

112
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,935
She went home just now.

113
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,772
I told her to sleep at home tonight
and come back tomorrow morning.

114
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,401
Most of his employees came
in the afternoon.

115
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,070
Only my guests are night owls.

116
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,239
Here come your night owls.

117
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,200
Jong-su, his friends are here.
We should go.

118
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,077
Okay. Let's go.

119
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,540
Bye. Hello, guys.

120
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,667
-Mom.
-Take care.

121
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,253
-Okay. Thanks for coming. Bye.
-Bye.

122
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,299
Your underwear and razor.

123
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,677
The underwear is new,
and I brought the razor from your office.

124
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,432
Thank you. I thought
about asking my mom to bring me some.

125
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,976
And this is a pain relief patch.
Put it on when you go to sleep.

126
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,061
When my dad passed away,

127
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,522
my knees hurt the most

128
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,274
because I had to bow a lot of times.

129
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,236
-You didn't eat dinner yet, right?
-I'm hungry.

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,113
-My gosh, I'm hungry.
-Give me one.

131
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,367
She came to the funeral? Really?

132
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,162
My gosh, she is one gutsy woman.

133
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,290
Luckily, my mom wasn't here,
so there wasn't a scene.

134
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,917
Did you curse and kick her out?

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,878
Don't you know Seok-hyeong?
I'm sure he sent her away quietly.

136
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,547
No, she paid her respect.

137
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,634
I told her to do that.

138
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,303
Are you insane?

139
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
The real Buddha was here.

140
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,182
Did she say anything else?

141
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,936
She told me that
she was six months pregnant.

142
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,812
Who wants to know that?

143
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,108
She said that the child may be fatherless
but will have a good older brother.

144
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,694
She kept going on about this and that.

145
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,863
I just listened to her.

146
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,907
She's on another level.

147
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,117
Well, that's how she could be
his mistress.

148
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,703
-Then, that lady...
-Lady? Are you mad?

149
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,291
-Then, she can't get anything, right?
-You bet.

150
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,085
When her baby is born,

151
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,671
the baby will have the right
to a part of the inheritance.

152
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,880
Will you let that happen?

153
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,300
It might be hard to prove paternity
since your father passed away.

154
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,427
Don't let them have a cent. Not a cent.

155
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,556
That's not up to me.

156
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,809
Besides, it's not the baby's fault.

157
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,477
-Hey!
-Hey!

158
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,536
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

159
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,496
Yes.

160
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,456
Okay. I got it.

161
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,002
Hello. We're here to get admitted.

162
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,336
I see. This way.

163
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,673
-What's your name?
-It's Park Byeong-su.

164
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,718
I see. I need to ask you a few questions.

165
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,344
Do you have any underlying conditions?

166
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,264
-I have diabetes.
-When were you diagnosed?

167
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,057
-Was it ten years ago?
-Yes.

168
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,475
It was a long time ago.

169
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,228
I see.
Have you had any surgery in the past?

170
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,813
-No, this is my first one.
-I see.

171
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,149
-I'll get your height and weight.
-Okay.

172
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,652
The patient from Room One is about
to get surgery. Is the patient ready?

173
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,945
Hold on.

174
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,697
-Let me add antibiotics.
-Okay.

175
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,700
Lee Jang-u is back from his surgery.

176
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,201
Hold on.

177
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,789
Yes. Okay. I'll get it ready.

178
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,499
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

179
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,877
The patient in Room Eight
came back from surgery.

180
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,795
And a patient will be moved
from the ER to Room Three.

181
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,423
But I'm not done going over
the steps with him.

182
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,966
-Head to Room Eight, please.
-Okay.

183
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,426
Get his medical history first.

184
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,305
I'll check the patient in Room Eight,
Lee Jang-u's vital signs

185
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,724
-and see if a bed is ready in Room Three.
-Thank you.

186
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,142
-This way.
-Take a seat.

187
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,730
Ma'am, we need to get
Lee Jae-guk's consent for ERCP.

188
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,898
How should I explain it?

189
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,818
After his cholecystectomy,
he has a high total bilirubin level.

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,529
From the MRCP exam, we found a CBD stone,
so he's getting ERCP.

191
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,656
Okay.

192
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,576
So-mi, I have portrait rights.

193
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,203
Why don't you get my permission first?

194
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,915
You totally got it wrong.
I wasn't filming you.

195
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,631
You're going to be moved
to a regular room now.

196
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,216
Are you feeling okay?

197
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,970
Taking deep breaths will help you recover.

198
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,640
Make sure to go
to your physical therapy sessions.

199
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,433
And I'll see you in three months.

200
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,560
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

201
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,323
Professor Chae,
your herniated disc got worse.

202
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,491
Did you take your pills?

203
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,284
I'm thinking about taking it.

204
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,287
But taking one isn't enough now.

205
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,206
-Aren't we almost done?
-Yes.

206
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,624
-Bring in the next patient.
-Okay.

207
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,960
Wait.

208
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,462
-Yes?
-Professor Chae.

209
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,005
He's in his 40s.

210
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,508
I see ICH in his left basal ganglia
from the CT scan.

211
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,927
And he's in a stupor
and his right motor skill is poor.

212
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,387
Okay. I'm on my way.

213
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,974
I have an emergency patient in the ER.
I must get going.

214
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,976
Please explain it to my outpatients.

215
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,185
Okay.

216
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,703
This is your last year here?

217
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,914
-Yes.
-Did something happen?

218
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,378
Your absence will affect
the hospital a lot.

219
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,174
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,094
I know there aren't a lot of
pediatric surgeons at our hospital.

221
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,181
-And I won't be here.
-That's not the point.

222
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,851
There are only 48 pediatric surgeons
in Korea.

223
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,813
We are the only major hospital
with two pediatric surgeons.

224
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,108
And there are over ten hospitals
without a pediatric surgeon.

225
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,694
I'm sure you know this better than I do,

226
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:04,575
but each pediatric surgeon
means the whole staff.

227
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,497
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

228
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,834
The other pediatric surgeons
went to our branch in Sokcho,

229
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,755
and without you, Pediatric Surgery
at our hospital will have to close down.

230
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,467
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,804
Okay.

232
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,474
I'll think about it.

233
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,102
So can you please reconsider
your decision?

234
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,188
Okay.

235
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,775
Sir, open your eyes.

236
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,568
What's your name?

237
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,771
I'll insert a catheter
after looking at the CT navigation,

238
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,648
so take the CT navigation
and arrange an OR.

239
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,316
-Call me once the patient is ready.
-Okay.

240
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,613
A thin blood vessel in his brain
called basal ganglia

241
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,199
ruptured and began to bleed.

242
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,160
That's why he is unconscious,
and his right side has become weak.

243
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,663
After checking the navigation system

244
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,124
and insert the catheter
in the right spot and remove blood,

245
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,459
he may regain his consciousness.

246
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,212
But if his bleeding gets worse,
it might be dangerous for him.

247
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,463
Oh, no.

248
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,968
Does it mean something could
happen to him during surgery?

249
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,638
Yes. But if he doesn't get the surgery,

250
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,392
he won't be able to regain his
consciousness and die due to the bleeding.

251
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,644
Surgery is the only option he has now.

252
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,189
There is brain damage
the moment the bleeding starts.

253
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,442
So there will be sequelae.

254
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,778
But we must remove
as much blood as we can in his brain

255
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,615
to hope that
he may regain his consciousness.

256
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,076
For now, I'll do my best
to perform the surgery.

257
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,456
Doctor, please save my husband.

258
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,792
If you just save him, I don't care
if his arms or legs are paralyzed.

259
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,544
Please just save him.

260
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,172
I'll do my best.

261
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,933
I'm in the OR lounge.

262
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,393
Yes. I have two back-to-back surgeries.

263
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,978
I'm drinking coffee after my first one.

264
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,772
-What are you doing?
-I'm shooting guns.

265
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,857
Stop lying.

266
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,401
Are you looking down on me
because I didn't serve in the army?

267
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,778
Officers have a firing drill.

268
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,988
We have to do it once every quarter.

269
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,283
We have to shoot a target that's 25m away
with a pistol, K5.

270
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,161
-I won first place.
-Was there a prize?

271
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,581
Gosh, do you think I'm at a festival?
What prize?

272
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,463
I'll go to Seoul this weekend, Jun-wan.

273
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,466
I'll sleep at my brother's house.
I miss U-ju so much.

274
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,510
I see. Do you want to do that?

275
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,180
Then, I'll head there, too.

276
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,308
Okay.

277
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,727
I can come up with an excuse.

278
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981
Okay.

279
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,900
Saturday?

280
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,486
Lunch? Okay.

281
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,196
What about dinner?

282
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,243
Right. Our lovely Universe
might go to sleep early.

283
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,331
Yes. Me, too. I love you.

284
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,544
My goodness. You're a nutcase!

285
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,422
Jeez. Gosh, I really want
to punch you right now.

286
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,341
-Why? Aren't I cute?
-Oh, my.

287
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,176
"I love you."

288
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,014
You're dating her quite long this time.
She must be a catch.

289
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,518
Yes.

290
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,897
That serious look on your face
doesn't suit you. Please don't do that.

291
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,155
FORMER MICKEY, CURRENTLY IK-SUN

292
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,742
Salute! What's up, Ik-sun?

293
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,286
I'm doing a liver transplant.
I'm on my break now.

294
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,915
Today? You're coming today?

295
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,170
I'd love it if you can sleepover.
My gosh, U-ju will be so thrilled.

296
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,757
What? What did you say?
What do you want to eat?

297
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,341
Snow crabs?

298
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,679
What are you doing?
How can I find snow crabs now?

299
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,267
What is this?

300
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,853
Can't you see? It's me.
And this is a box of snow crabs.

301
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,189
Why snow crabs all of a sudden?

302
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,650
U-ju, don't you love snow crabs?

303
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,527
I bought huge snow crabs.

304
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,530
-I love snow crabs?
-U-ju, thank him.

305
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,907
Thank you.

306
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,658
Thank you.

307
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,965
What? There is no water in your house?

308
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,884
Yes, it stopped all of a sudden.

309
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,845
But you just renovated your bathroom.

310
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,431
The construction was done poorly.
They are so awful.

311
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,851
How did you get your hair done
so neatly without the water?

312
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,186
Do I look neat? Me?

313
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,729
Not really. I just woke up.

314
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,030
So you're going to the hospital later?
Why? Are you also on call?

315
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,409
I have a symposium presentation
next month. So I must prepare for it.

316
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,036
And you guys are here anyway.

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,664
I'll go and study in a quiet place.
It's been a while.

318
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,833
-So you do study.
-Yes, sometimes.

319
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,000
You're so annoying.

320
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,670
-Where's the symposium?
-Spain. I have a bit more than a month.

321
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,215
U-ju, have fun with Aunt Ik-sun
and Uncle Snow Crab today.

322
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,259
I'll be at the hospital later, okay?

323
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,433
Dad, the snow crab is hurt.

324
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,103
What if its leg hurts a lot?

325
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,483
U-ju, can you close
your eyes for a second?

326
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,945
U-ju, look at me.

327
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,700
If you bend your joints correctly,
it doesn't hurt at all.

328
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,871
It just sounds loud,
but it doesn't hurt at all.

329
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,084
Whatever it is, if you bend it
the right way, it doesn't hurt.

330
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,006
U-ju, never copy your aunt, okay?

331
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,258
She's the Terminator,
so she can't feel any pain.

332
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,968
She's not a human. Stop it.

333
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,140
All right. Let's finish eating.

334
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,903
Hey, I'm leaving.
When U-ju wakes up, read him a book.

335
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,946
There's a book he likes
on his desk in his room.

336
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,489
-Okay.
-When are you coming back?

337
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,117
-I'll be back soon.
-Take your time.

338
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,038
You haven't had time for yourself lately.

339
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,956
Enjoy your alone time.

340
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,752
He's right. You can take your time.
We'll watch U-ju.

341
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,629
Okay. Gosh.

342
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,926
By the way, you two...

343
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,683
Don't fight.

344
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,187
-We won't fight. Why would we?
-No. Why would we?

345
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,396
My goodness.

346
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,148
Bye.

347
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,749
Leave them. I'll do it.
I'm good at washing dishes.

348
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,084
I'm almost done.

349
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,545
Give me a kiss.

350
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,016
U-ju.

351
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,978
Sleep in your room.

352
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,288
If U-ju gets hungry after he wakes up,

353
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,873
there's chocolate milk in the fridge.
Give him that.

354
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,208
And once he wakes up, call me.

355
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,877
Are you turning into Jeong-won?

356
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,379
That's enough.

357
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,132
Why are you wiping only one spot?

358
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,064
My brother changed a lot.
He became a new man after he got married.

359
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,025
Ik-jun changed a lot.

360
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,278
Yes. My brother went clubbing all the time

361
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,280
and went around the town like a dog.

362
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,284
So I thought he might freeze to death
on the street or would be beaten to death.

363
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,913
But when he became a father
after getting married,

364
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,749
he totally changed.

365
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,502
He stopped going clubbing
and playing games.

366
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,212
You know that he's good at poker, right?

367
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,339
Of course.

368
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,050
He used to play hard, but now,

369
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,844
I guess he gave up on having his own life.

370
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,180
He used to go out all the time,

371
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,891
but now, he lives only for his son.

372
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,479
It makes me sad and breaks my heart
when I see him.

373
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,273
That means he loves U-ju so much.

374
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,027
I think I would do the same
if I get married and have a family.

375
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,906
That's a huge blessing, too.

376
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,790
Yes, I just arrived at the hospital.

377
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,376
How could you leave
right after finishing your birthday meal?

378
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,003
You're breaking our hearts.

379
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,090
I'm sorry. I have a lot of work to do.

380
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,219
Okay. I'll call you often.

381
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,138
Thank you for giving birth to me.

382
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,849
Okay.

383
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,147
Why are you here? It's the weekend.

384
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,526
Hello. You're working hard.

385
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,283
Chi-hong is my friend and all,
but I respect him a lot.

386
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,202
He's diligent and thoughtful.

387
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,746
Everyone in the military academy thought

388
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,125
that he would become a general
because he's born to be in the military.

389
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,253
-I knew. I can tell he's diligent.
-Yes.

390
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,297
He always woke up at 5 a.m.
when he was in the military academy

391
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,841
to exercise by himself for an hour.

392
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,261
He even studied and read books.
He worked really hard to improve himself.

393
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,807
And when we heard that he was sick
and getting discharged all of a sudden,

394
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,186
a lot of us cried.
Chi-hong cried his eyes out, too.

395
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,731
Gosh, that was so awful.

396
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,941
It worked out well, though.

397
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,152
He'll take the medical board exam
after a year.

398
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,404
He must do a fellowship for a few years,

399
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,239
but he's almost at the finish line.

400
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,074
He just needs to work
his ass off for a year.

401
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,742
Right, it worked well.

402
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,327
I was so worried

403
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,122
when I heard he was going to med school
and apply for neurosurgery.

404
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,124
There are so many weirdos at hospitals.

405
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,962
I knew he wouldn't give up
because he's tough.

406
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,507
But I was worried that he might meet
an awful professor and have a hard time.

407
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,342
Everyone was worried.

408
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,597
Luckily, he met a great professor at Yulje
and adjusted well.

409
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,307
You don't know how relieved I am.

410
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,184
He has Chae Song-hwa.

411
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,811
His professor is my friend, Chae Song-hwa.

412
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,314
I also matured
because I had her as my friend.

413
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,609
Seriously. It's all thanks to Song-hwa.

414
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:50,280
She's a really good person.
Just the sight of her makes me happy.

415
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,786
Ik-jun should have tried to date her.
He's such a fool.

416
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,165
Are you sure there's nothing between them?

417
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,667
There's nothing between them.

418
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,173
You came to check on the drainage
of the patient from yesterday?

419
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,549
Yes, it's an ICH patient.

420
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,676
We inserted a catheter
with the navigation system.

421
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,305
The surgery went well,
but the drainage isn't that high.

422
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,515
So Professor Chae is very worried.

423
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,685
And I need to take care
of some charts, too.

424
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,896
So I decided to check on the patient
while I'm at it.

425
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,982
People like you should be doctors.

426
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,194
I think I would sleep all day
if I had the weekend off.

427
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,654
I slept a lot before coming in.

428
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,864
-How many hours?
-Five hours.

429
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,409
You're so lucky
that you don't need to sleep a lot.

430
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,080
My body is used to it. I'd been doing it
since the military academy.

431
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,998
You're not going to move?

432
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,960
Stop sleeping in the on-call room
because you live far.

433
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,586
Get a studio in front of the hospital.

434
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,839
You'll be busier once you become a chief.
Until when will you sleep in that room?

435
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,717
Actually, I'm considering that option.

436
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,642
Seventh floor, neurosurgery, right?

437
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,811
Yes. Thank you.

438
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,485
Fourth floor, pediatric ward?

439
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,862
How did you know?

440
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,365
I have superpowers.

441
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,454
You didn't go camping?

442
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,874
Why are you here, Professor Chae?

443
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,418
I should ask you the same thing.
You're not on-call today.

444
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,211
I had some work left to do.

445
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,880
Are you here to check on Im Jang-hun?

446
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,256
Yes.

447
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,592
I can't seem to leave.

448
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,306
What about dinner?
Let's have dinner together.

449
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,393
I don't want to.
Not when it's just the two of us.

450
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,437
Why not? Is it uncomfortable for you?

451
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,733
No, it's not uncomfortable at all.

452
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,362
But I just don't want you
to make the mood awkward again.

453
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,739
I won't do that.

454
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,033
I promise.

455
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,954
Fine. Let's get dinner together.
The elevator is here.

456
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,714
FORMER MICKY, CURRENTLY IK-SUN

457
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,177
-Go ahead.
-Dad.

458
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,387
Are you up, U-ju?

459
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,223
Ik-jun, he must have had a nightmare.
He keeps crying.

460
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,643
Seriously. Why did you pop your joints
in front of him? My gosh.

461
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,645
-I'm on my way now.
-My dove trick isn't working.

462
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,480
I flew about a dozen, but he keeps crying.

463
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,773
Your dove trick?

464
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,526
Stop. I don't want you to do anything.

465
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,111
There's a convenience store nearby.

466
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,029
The store sells the ice cream he likes.

467
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,407
Try to calm him down with that.
I'm leaving now.

468
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,158
Okay.

469
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,170
-First Basement floor.
-Okay.

470
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,765
Professor Chae, do you remember that day?

471
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,392
When?

472
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,936
My first day here as an intern.

473
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,772
I saw you on my way to work
on my first day.

474
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,733
Really? Where?

475
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,696
-Hello.
-Hi.

476
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,450
Weren't you going camping? What happened?

477
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,326
I couldn't go.

478
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,203
Why are you here?

479
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,289
To work on my paper
for the symposium next month.

480
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,040
Where are you two going?

481
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,085
-To have dinner.
-I see.

482
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,296
Did you have dinner?

483
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,047
I'll eat dinner at home. U-ju is waiting.

484
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,632
I see. Okay.

485
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,520
-I parked my car on the first floor. Bye.
-Okay.

486
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,907
Don't you have a lot to take care of?

487
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,869
-Not really.
-We really only have a month left.

488
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,416
I had no idea that I would be
in a long-distance relationship at my age.

489
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,835
I'm sorry.

490
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,714
Don't be sorry. It's all right.
It's a great opportunity for you.

491
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,427
Jun-wan, you'll be 43 in 3 years.

492
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,764
Being 40 or 43 aren't that different.

493
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,728
The time difference is eight hours,
so it'll be hard to call each other.

494
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,982
Then, we would misunderstand
each other and fight, right?

495
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,069
Right. We'll misunderstand
each other and fight.

496
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,196
We'll fight about who comes to where.

497
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,366
"Why are you leaving so quickly?
Why aren't you answering my calls?

498
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,994
It was on vibrate."
And we'll argue like crazy.

499
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,500
And we'll break up, then.

500
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,176
You didn't even leave yet.

501
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,596
Why are you worried about
something that hasn't happened yet?

502
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,559
Because you want
to get married and have children.

503
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,811
What if you waste your three years on me?

504
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,895
I really hate that.

505
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,273
No.

506
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,068
If you want, we can continue this
for five or ten years.

507
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,444
I'm okay with everything.

508
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,240
What I want isn't getting married.

509
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,118
It's to be with you for a long time.

510
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,912
Of course, I want to marry you.

511
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,790
But if you don't want it, we won't.

512
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,252
I'm already so happy with you.

513
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,717
Ik-sun.

514
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,387
Three years will go by fast.

515
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,015
Forty years went by fast, too.

516
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,357
Give me your hand.
I have something to give you.

517
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,776
Don't do it.

518
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,196
I clearly told you that's not what I want.

519
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,657
When we first started dating,

520
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,494
I made myself clear that
you shouldn't do anything for me.

521
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,414
I said I hate presents
like rings and necklaces.

522
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,252
Who said I had a ring or necklace?

523
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,140
-I bet you're embarrassed.
-Give me that.

524
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,143
If you tell me not to do something,
I'll never do it.

525
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,270
I'm a kind boyfriend.

526
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,482
Can you hear it?

527
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,442
It's not playing.

528
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,404
It's playing now.

529
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,199
This is nice.

530
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,663
I love this song, Jun-wan.

531
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,665
What was the title?

532
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,584
-"ER."
-No.

533
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,003
Yes, it is. "Emergency Room."

534
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,839
It's the song
hospital employees hate the most.

535
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,926
Why do they hate it? I love it.

536
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,432
This is the perfect song for the weather.

537
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,518
This is great.

538
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,410
It's the weekend.
Are you sleeping at the hospital?

539
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,495
I can drop you off at your house.

540
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,539
It's okay.
I feel more comfortable sleeping there.

541
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,499
You should get a place
close to the hospital.

542
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,418
Getting a good rest is necessary, too.

543
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,378
Okay.

544
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,755
GOOFBALL IK-JUN

545
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,468
I'm driving.

546
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,512
Chi-hong is with me.
You're on speakerphone.

547
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,139
Hang up if you want to goof around.

548
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,766
Are you giving Dr. Ahn a ride?

549
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,685
Yes, what is it? What's up?

550
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,228
I was wondering what you were up to.

551
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,565
Okay. Drive safely. Let's talk later.

552
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,691
Okay.

553
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,334
Have a goodnight. I'll see you on Monday.

554
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,046
Okay. Thank you.

555
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,052
-Professor Chae.
-Yes?

556
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,429
It's my birthday today.

557
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,265
Really? Why did you tell me that now?

558
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,975
Do you need anything?

559
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,020
Hey, did you come to the hospital
on your birthday?

560
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,397
What's wrong with you?

561
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,525
-Don't you have friends?
-I have a lot of friends.

562
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,237
I had a birthday party
with my friends yesterday.

563
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,990
I had dinner with the people
from the hospital yesterday.

564
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,119
I couldn't tell you
because your surgery ended late.

565
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,915
Your birthday isn't over yet.
Is there anything you want?

566
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,374
I'll buy it. Just tell me.

567
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,462
There's a present I want.

568
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:50,963
What is it?

569
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,426
Can I speak to you casually just once?

570
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,646
I won't cross the line.

571
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,856
Go ahead.

572
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,828
Drive safely.

573
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,672
See you at work on Monday.

574
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,242
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

575
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,662
Is Seok-hyeong coming back today?

576
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,582
Tomorrow. He'll call
once he arrives in Seoul tonight.

577
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,960
He should rest up
in Jeju Island a bit more.

578
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,587
Isn't he coming back so soon?

579
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,464
He was off for over a week.
It's about time he comes back to work.

580
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,841
Where's Ik-jun? I'm hungry.

581
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,135
I'm right here.

582
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,970
-What is it?
-What is it?

583
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,513
Pork belly.

584
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,765
-No way!
-No way!

585
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,784
Should we call them in now?

586
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,870
Hey.

587
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,080
Hold on.

588
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,295
This is so good.

589
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,429
-Call them in now.
-Now? Wait.

590
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,932
Okay.

591
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,739
Did you know that this was grilled kimchi?

592
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,075
There was grilled kimchi? Give me that.

593
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,081
Hey, try the meat
with the pickled Siberian onion leaf.

594
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,166
It tastes totally different.

595
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,257
Seriously.
They are a fantastic duo of eaters.

596
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,717
They are so adorable.

597
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,761
Stay friends for long.
Just don't marry each other,

598
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,596
-but have meals together.
-Exactly.

599
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,891
How can they watch each other eat
every meal like this as husband and wife?

600
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,142
Did you taste the kimchi?

601
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,478
It's really good.

602
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,530
-Yes?
-Professor Ahn, the patient went under.

603
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,865
Okay. Get it ready.

604
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,826
Okay.

605
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,413
Is that emergency surgery?
I thought you didn't have surgery today.

606
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,416
Well, I do. It's a urachal cyst excision,
and the patient is a seven-year-old child.

607
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,543
I think it was Gyeo-ul on the phone.

608
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,712
Yes, it was. She's the surgeon today.

609
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,007
She is? Does it mean
this is Gyeo-ul's first solo surgery?

610
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,719
If you don't want it, I will.

611
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,222
-Just eat the meat. Eat the meat!
-No.

612
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,808
I want to eat it with rice.

613
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,132
You will lead the surgery today, Dr. Jang.

614
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,051
I'll assist.

615
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,346
Congratulations, Dr. Jang.
It's your first surgery.

616
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,057
He doesn't let other doctors
lead pediatric surgeries.

617
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,100
So you should do really well today.

618
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,479
Thank you, Professor Ahn.

619
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
Sure.

620
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,651
I'll begin.

621
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,006
Pass me the tissue forceps.

622
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,059
You should peel off
the right side a bit more.

623
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,728
Okay.
I will ligate the blood vessel first.

624
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,523
-Okay. Sounds great.
-Mixter, please.

625
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,570
ELAPSED TIME

626
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,993
Is the structure I'm seeing the cyst?

627
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,664
Yes, it is. You need to remove it.

628
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,749
But you have to hold
the top and bottom tracks.

629
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,253
Okay. Right-angle forceps, please.

630
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,301
-I'll ligate it.
-Okay. Looking good.

631
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,512
-Mosquito forceps, please.
-One more pair, please.

632
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,098
Metzenbaum scissors, please.

633
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,024
-You did well.
-Thank you.

634
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,944
-Ligate closely on the blood vessel.
-Okay.

635
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,279
RESTRICTED AREA

636
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,911
When did he tell you that?

637
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,913
He told me a while ago.

638
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,040
I wasn't sure if telling you

639
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,918
was the right thing to do
since it's about the hospital.

640
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,920
That's why I didn't tell you earlier.

641
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,215
But

642
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,802
did something happen to him?

643
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,014
Jong-su, where's the smoking room?

644
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,309
Let's go out.

645
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
You have liver cirrhosis.

646
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,902
And we found a cancerous tumor
as big as 4cm.

647
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,654
In cases like this,

648
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,991
having liver transplant
is the best way to cure cancer.

649
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,410
Let's get you on the transplant list.

650
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,830
But cancer might progress
as you wait for a donor.

651
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,084
So as of now,
the best and the quickest way is

652
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,836
a living-donor liver transplant.

653
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,047
A living-donor liver transplant?

654
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,217
I don't want that, doctor.

655
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,470
I don't want to burden my family.

656
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,305
Chang-hak, what are you talking about?

657
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,266
You're not burdening us. Don't say that.
We're family.

658
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,561
Right, Chang-hak.
We'll talk about this together.

659
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,355
You don't have to worry, okay?

660
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,737
Professor Lee, if he's going on the list,
there are a few more things to check.

661
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,572
He should get the tests now.

662
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,782
Okay.

663
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,756
Sweetie,

664
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,051
why don't you donate
a piece of your liver?

665
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,809
You're still young.

666
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,604
It's only right that you do it.

667
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,693
Right. You are his wife after all.

668
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,572
Okay.

669
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,907
That's right. You must save your husband.

670
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,744
You need to save your husband first.
That comes first. Okay?

671
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,873
I'm sorry. We're pretty old.

672
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,711
Well, he's Chang-hak's brother,
but he's been weak since birth.

673
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:12,256
I think you might be his best chance.

674
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,176
Okay.

675
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,140
I will do it, doctor.

676
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,978
Then, when can she get the test done?

677
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,316
The faster she gets the test,
the faster he will get the surgery.

678
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,235
Schedule the test
as soon as possible, doctor.

679
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,280
Okay. Once the donor is decided,

680
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,866
I'll schedule the test
as soon as possible.

681
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,784
To proceed with his tests,

682
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,662
could you go to the first floor
and settle the medical bill first?

683
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,456
Okay.

684
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,585
Your son seemed in pretty bad condition.

685
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,504
I think it's better that someone stays
with him during the tests.

686
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,548
-Okay.
-Okay.

687
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,233
Donating a piece of your organ
is risking your life.

688
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,486
I understand
it may be difficult to decide.

689
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:20,991
And I know that it becomes harder
when you have a family to take care of.

690
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,205
No one can criticize you
for not saying yes.

691
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,919
If you don't want to do it,
be honest with me and just tell me.

692
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,172
I can tell them that it won't happen.

693
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,591
Doctor.

694
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,804
I will take the test.

695
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,684
And when you get the test result,

696
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,816
please tell them that I wasn't a match.

697
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,489
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,243
I'm really sorry.

699
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,331
There's nothing for you
to be sorry about. I'll talk to them.

700
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,376
I'm sorry.

701
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,348
Rosa.

702
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:30,227
It won't be easy to get
Jeong-won to change his mind.

703
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,438
I know that, too.

704
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,149
Stop putting him through this pain.

705
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,651
Why don't you let him do
what his heart wants to do?

706
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,784
You can hang out with me.

707
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,871
What is it? You don't want that?

708
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,165
Where's the center garden?

709
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,085
-Why?
-I was supposed to meet him there.

710
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,171
He's done with surgery.
He wants to meet there.

711
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,798
Okay. I'll take you.
It's right around the corner.

712
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,397
My goodness.

713
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,401
Gosh.

714
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,655
He's a grown man. What can you do?

715
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,741
He won't listen to us now.

716
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,620
Forget it. Just give up, okay?

717
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,461
Let's go.

718
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,893
-Hey. There he is.
-I was talking to you.

719
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,441
Hold on. Wait, Jong-su.

720
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,193
What is it?

721
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,657
Professor Ahn, my incision
wasn't too long, right?

722
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,534
No, it was pretty good.

723
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,953
My sutures were pretty good, right?

724
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,705
You did well.

725
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,583
It was your first time, but you finished
in 30 minutes. That's good.

726
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,960
The patient will recover, right?

727
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,588
I'm moving the patient to the ward.
Come with me.

728
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,883
-Pay attention when dressing tomorrow.
-Okay.

729
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,100
Okay.

730
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,129
Jong-su.

731
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,089
I have an idea.

732
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,050
-What idea?
-It's my last idea

733
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,221
that will make Jeong-won live
as my son, not a priest.

734
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,850
It's hit-or-miss.

735
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,269
But I ought to give it a try.

736
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,770
Try what?

737
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,189
Let's go. I'm craving jjamppong.

738
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,818
-What about Jeong-won?
-I won't see him. Come with me.

739
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,043
Her name is Chae-yun.

740
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,173
She had a microembolism in her brain
last week, so things don't look good.

741
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,550
And Professor Kim is troubled
because of that.

742
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,262
"Microembolism"? Is it a small clot?

743
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,182
You have to apply for CS.

744
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,018
Yes, that's it.

745
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,939
But as for Chae-yun, she has HLHS,
Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.

746
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,483
She was diagnosed before birth,

747
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,444
and was born prematurely at 34 weeks
and weighed 1.6kg.

748
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,863
The left side of her heart
hasn't formed at all.

749
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:13,492
To help her live with what she has,
she needs several surgeries.

750
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,327
So far, she had two surgeries after birth,

751
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,287
and was discharged 100 days after birth.

752
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:22,042
And she was scheduled for another surgery
six months after birth.

753
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,669
But

754
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,839
two months ago, her condition got worse,
so she was admitted to the ER.

755
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:32,260
And now, she's been
on ECMO for two months.

756
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,847
So now, the only option
she has is a transplant.

757
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,141
You can't find any donors for her?

758
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,727
It's very hard to find a donor
for a heart transplant for a baby.

759
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,270
Less than three heart transplants

760
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,107
are done for babies in a year
all over the country.

761
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,526
Dr. Do, tell Chae-yun's mom
that I'd like to speak with her.

762
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,694
Sure.

763
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,537
The paralysis of the arms
caused by microembolism

764
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,206
has gotten better
since we gave her an anticoagulant.

765
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,377
But to tell you the truth,
the situation isn't looking good.

766
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,675
I'm not sure
if it's okay for me to say this,

767
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,971
but I really hope we can find
a donor soon. At the moment,

768
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,515
that is the only way.

769
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,599
Doctor.

770
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,310
Chae-yun was born only seven months ago,

771
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,856
but she's spent five months
in the hospital.

772
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,025
There have been many emergencies,

773
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,070
but she's made it through all of them
thanks to you.

774
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,321
She's

775
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,159
breathing and moving.

776
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,119
She's still alive.

777
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,956
Doctor, I know that Chae-yun will live.

778
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,708
We will find a donor,

779
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,836
and she'll be able to undergo the surgery.

780
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,215
So please don't give up on Chae-yun.

781
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,012
Of course, I will never give up on her.

782
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,890
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

783
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,641
Thank you.

784
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,394
Thank you.

785
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,903
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

786
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,162
Professor Yang.

787
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,331
Professor Yang.

788
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,583
Professor Yang.

789
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,213
Professor Yang, have you eaten yet?

790
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,804
Professor Yang, have you eaten yet?

791
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,847
How's your mother?

792
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,392
Did you have dinner?
Would you like to have dinner with me?

793
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,604
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but he's having dinner with us.

794
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,149
Oh, hello! Bye!

795
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,985
Where am I going? Bye!

796
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,988
Gosh, I'm screwed!

797
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,412
You came earlier than I thought.

798
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,040
I have a lot of outpatients tomorrow,
so I went through the charts.

799
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,793
-Where's Song-hwa?
-At Neurosurgery's team dinner.

800
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,086
She'll join us later.

801
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,214
-What about Ik-jun?
-At Neurosurgery's team dinner.

802
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,259
Ik-jun sure loves to party.

803
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,597
-Hey, gosh.
-You're a lightweight.

804
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,266
You look so worried.

805
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,976
Are you sure you'll be okay?

806
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,645
People still play this game?

807
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,605
I haven't played this for 20 years.

808
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,649
They're young,
so they're curious about each other.

809
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,817
I think it's cute.

810
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,444
Why can't they just ask these questions
via text message?

811
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,656
Be quiet. Just be grateful
that they let us join them.

812
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,991
Spin it.

813
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,701
Good.

814
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,248
My gosh.

815
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,420
Well... You guys don't have
any questions for me, right?

816
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,630
-All right, pass.
-Doctor.

817
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,051
What do you think of Dr. Heo Seon-bin?

818
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,721
Hey, I told you
that nothing's going on between us.

819
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,306
How many times do I have to tell you?

820
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,849
Hey, be quiet.

821
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,476
Just drink it
if you don't want to answer the question.

822
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:11,897
Jeez.

823
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,106
Wait.

824
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,863
Now, you'll hear his answer.

825
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,365
Gosh, don't you know the drill?
Come on, guys.

826
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,660
Seok-min, answer the question.

827
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,789
What do you think?

828
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,333
I think she's a great colleague.

829
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,126
-Come on.
-Come on.

830
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,795
-There, I answered.
-Guys, you asked the wrong question.

831
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,048
Of course, he'd give an answer like that.

832
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,508
You guys don't really know
how to play this game. Get with it.

833
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,303
-How should they have worded it?
-Do you like Heo Seon-bin?

834
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,183
Seok-min, answer the question.

835
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,062
Gosh, I thought
you were just demonstrating.

836
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,813
See that? He got all worked up.

837
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,441
That's the reaction you're after. Got it?

838
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,984
Ask questions like that from now on.

839
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,528
What are you teaching them?

840
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,419
Me?

841
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,801
Ask me anything you want to know.
I'll tell you everything.

842
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,638
What is your relationship
with Professor Chae?

843
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,139
Oh, let me rephrase my question.

844
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,725
-Hey.
-I'm sorry, Professor Chae.

845
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,643
Professor Lee.

846
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:35,897
Has there been a moment
when you considered

847
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,401
Professor Chae
to be more than just your friend?

848
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,027
-Nice one.
-Great question!

849
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,904
Seon-bin, you're such a fast learner.

850
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,781
You're actually curious about that?

851
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:45,740
-Yes.
-Yes, totally.

852
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,659
Big-time. We're so curious.

853
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,912
We're really just friends.

854
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,164
We heard you,
but we're playing this game now.

855
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,168
Well...

856
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,255
Come on.
You said you'd tell us everything.

857
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,382
Well...

858
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,399
No comment.

859
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,860
No comment?
You practically said yes by doing that.

860
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,778
What? Hey.

861
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,905
Seon-bin, how dare you talk to me
as if I'm a friend?

862
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,866
I'm a professor. How could you...

863
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,121
Gosh, didn't I totally sound like
an old geezer just now?

864
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,208
Sorry, guys. I regret saying that.

865
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,377
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm really sorry.

866
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,464
I really mean it. Okay, let's move on!

867
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,973
Me, again? Gosh.

868
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,228
Jeez, I guess it's my lucky day.

869
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,521
I keep getting picked.

870
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,107
I'm going to buy a ton of lottery tickets
on my way home.

871
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:04,152
-Professor Lee.
-Jeez, you again?

872
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,196
Your first love.

873
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,490
Who and when was it?

874
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,083
Gosh.

875
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,506
What's happening here?

876
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,424
Hey.

877
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,094
Coming to his rescue?

878
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,596
Gosh, why would you do that for a guy?

879
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,724
I can tell you my wish now that
I've downed that whole thing, right?

880
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,101
Sure.

881
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,560
Okay.

882
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,397
Please answer the question
we asked you earlier.

883
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:50,031
You've had feelings
for Professor Chae, right?

884
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,921
Yes, I have.

885
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,593
Of course, I have.

886
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,766
You were that curious about it?

887
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,687
My gosh.

888
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,252
Are you guys still together?

889
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,837
We're at a karaoke bar!

890
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,172
Come join us.

891
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,798
I'll send you the address.

892
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,799
Karaoke bar? Forget it.

893
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,551
-Ik-jun is drunk.
-Tell them to hurry!

894
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,802
No.

895
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,512
-I'm not drunk.
-Hurry up!

896
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,347
-I'm a skunk.
-Come here now!

897
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,892
Hey, we're all hammered here.

898
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,019
Gosh, Seok-hyeong
has been drinking all night.

899
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,021
-Quiet down!
-Tell this guy to shut up.

900
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,273
Anyway, stop by
even for just a few minutes.

901
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,192
When will they get here?

902
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,193
Number three!

903
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,487
Here they are.

904
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,837
-Time to go home.
-What?

905
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,340
-When did you get here?
-Go home.

906
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,883
-Hey.
-Go home, guys!

907
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,802
Hey, we only have a minute left.
The last song.

908
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,387
I must sing the last song of the night.

909
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,430
Where is "Goodbye Now"?

910
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,558
You just sang.

911
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,809
-Get some rest.
-One, five,

912
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,603
-Why? Come on.
-eight, five, four.

913
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,940
"I KNEW I'D LOVE YOU"

914
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:49,836
The day I first saw the picture of you

915
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,383
January 31, 1999

916
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:01,514
-From that day until this moment
-Is Ik-jun going through something?

917
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,726
You waited

918
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,935
Something's up with him.

919
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,770
Only for me

920
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,063
What's going on?

921
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:17,155
I called you today, out of habit

922
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:23,369
And you answered
In your warm, welcoming voice

923
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:29,417
You made me the happiest person

924
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,755
In the whole wide world

925
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,384
I love you so much

926
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,306
I knew I'd love you

927
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,520
The day we first met

928
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:58,738
Even if you falter

929
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:03,785
As our love fades with time

930
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:11,167
I will be your anchor
Just like you were to me

931
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,547
APRIL 1999

932
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,509
What about this one?

933
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,262
Well, I'd prefer something simple.

934
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,182
Oh, I think this one will look better.

935
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,475
-The one at the front?
-Yes.

936
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,102
Just a second, please.

937
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,355
My girlfriend is very neat and cute.

938
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,611
I was mean to you

939
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,825
But you still waited for me

940
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:48,371
I knew I'd love you

941
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:55,378
The day we first met

942
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:04,178
Even if you falter

943
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:09,183
As our love fades with time

944
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:16,315
I will be your anchor
Just like you were to me

945
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,693
Seriously?

946
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:21,154
From Hawaii? That's nuts.

947
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,115
I must've been out of my mind.

948
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,743
Anyway, you and Jeong-won
are the only ones who know about it.

949
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,995
Don't tell anyone.

950
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,831
Especially your brother. Do not tell him.

951
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,501
-My brother is very discreet.
-I know.

952
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,212
But he'll tease me nonstop.

953
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,131
He certainly has a knack
for teasing others.

954
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,886
What about you?

955
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,475
Me? I don't really want to talk about it.

956
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,982
But I should tell you because we said
we won't keep anything from each other.

957
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,114
I can't believe
you dated such a douchebag.

958
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,497
Don't worry. I'll never lie to you.

959
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,624
That will never happen.

960
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,671
You see, Jun-wan...

961
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:25,885
Well, if we start growing apart
from each other,

962
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:31,849
and if the butterflies die
because we're no longer crazy in love,

963
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,686
I want you to tell me first

964
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,397
that we should break up.

965
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,399
Hey.

966
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,529
I was able to put my crazy ex-boyfriend
behind me for good

967
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,156
and start seeing you

968
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,035
because I really like you.

969
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:57,458
You were in tears
But I turned around and left

970
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,502
So I want us to only have good memories.

971
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:02,088
I was mean to you

972
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:07,009
But you still waited for me

973
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:11,806
I knew I'd love you

974
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:18,938
The day we first met

975
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:27,488
Even if you falter

976
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:32,827
As our love fades with time

977
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:39,292
I will be your anchor
Just like you were to me

978
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,921
It must've been so hard

979
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:50,595
You warmly embraced even my foolish tears

980
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:56,392
I knew I'd love you

981
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:03,149
The day we first met

982
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:11,949
Even if you falter

983
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,413
As our love fades with time

984
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,125
I will be your anchor

985
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,004
Don't worry about anything

986
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:28,299
Just hold my hand

987
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:33,095
Like the day we first met

988
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,015
Us two

989
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,580
SPRING OF 2016

990
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,258
PASSENGER ELEVATOR

991
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,305
Could you press seven?

992
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,682
Oh, sure.

993
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,016
Thank you.

994
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,274
Excuse me.

995
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,485
The sixth floor, right?

996
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,278
Done.

997
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,655
Thank you.

998
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,081
Be careful. Sorry.

999
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,083
Sorry about that. Thank you.

1000
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,459
Excuse me.

1001
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,086
I already pressed five for you.

1002
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,796
I hope you have an easy delivery.

1003
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,339
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1004
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:10,901
Excuse me.

1005
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,779
Are you headed to Neurosurgery
by any chance?

1006
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,281
Me? Yes.

1007
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,490
Are you an intern?

1008
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,495
It's my first day as an intern here.
I was wondering if you were an intern too.

1009
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,458
Do I look like an intern?

1010
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,297
You're starting in NS? Poor you.

1011
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:37,053
Did you two go to the same school?

1012
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,805
No, we met today.

1013
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,807
Hello, Professor Chae.

1014
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,267
Hi.

1015
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,229
Professor Chae, they are our new interns.

1016
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,232
Oh, hello.

1017
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,402
Say hello. This is Professor Chae Song-hwa
of Neurosurgery.

1018
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,237
-Hello.
-Hello.

1019
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,323
It's nice to meet you.

1020
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,952
I hope to see you guys again in NS
next year.

1021
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,432
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1022
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,227
I couldn't really hear you.
Can you say that again?

1023
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,395
We found a donor, Professor Kim.

1024
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,564
-Age?
-It's a four-year-old girl.

1025
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,399
She weighs 18kg, and her blood type is O.

1026
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,609
-She's a TA victim.
-My gosh.

1027
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,071
They'll soon decide whether
she should be declared brain-dead,

1028
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,198
so I'll call you
once they make their decision.

1029
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,449
Okay, thank you.

1030
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,382
I hope you didn't tell Chae-yun's mom
about this brain-dead patient.

1031
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,925
Gosh, seriously?

1032
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,886
Professor Kim, what do you take me for?

1033
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,013
No, I haven't told her.

1034
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,725
If Chae-yun can't get the surgery,
she'll be so disappointed.

1035
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,146
I know that much.

1036
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,897
I was asking just in case.

1037
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,151
-What happened?
-Professor Kim.

1038
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,861
The committee just met,

1039
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,904
and they declared her brain-dead.

1040
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,992
She'll be admitted at 9 a.m. tomorrow
as a donor.

1041
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,827
Thank you.

1042
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,503
We found a donor.

1043
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,841
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

1044
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,303
You should thank the donor's family,
not me.

1045
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,473
Well, we should be very thankful

1046
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:50,311
to have found a donor.
It is a huge relief,

1047
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:53,814
but the donor's heart is quite big
for Chae-yun.

1048
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,025
She weighs over three times more
than Chae-yun does,

1049
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,068
so even if Chae-yun's heart is enlarged,

1050
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,529
the heart will most likely be big
for Chae-yun.

1051
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:07,161
However, we're not in the position
where we can be picky about that stuff.

1052
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,080
The clock is ticking for Chae-yun.

1053
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:11,832
Let's do the surgery.

1054
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:13,834
Okay.

1055
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,503
They'll procure the donor's heart
tomorrow morning,

1056
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,631
and the two of us
will oversee the process in the OR.

1057
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,382
It won't be easy,

1058
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,968
but we'll do our best.

1059
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:51,205
Professor Kim, would you like me
to give you a wake-up call tomorrow?

1060
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,123
Jae-hak, I think I have a fever.
Can you check?

1061
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,757
Maybe a mild fever?

1062
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:06,845
I can't have a fever.
I have to perform the surgery tomorrow.

1063
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,738
You fool.

1064
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,164
-How does it look?
-The heart is in good condition.

1065
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,624
We can proceed with the surgery.

1066
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:42,172
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1067
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,550
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

1068
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,176
I feel pain where the surgery was done,

1069
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,429
and I'm all bloated.
I just don't feel well.

1070
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:51,890
I see. It's natural to experience
a lot of discomfort after the surgery.

1071
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,517
But the surgery went well.

1072
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,021
So hang in there,
and you'll become much healthier.

1073
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,356
I know it won't be easy
but try to walk a little.

1074
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,941
It'll help you pass the gas soon.

1075
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,192
Okay, thank you.

1076
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,569
No problem. Try to walk a little.

1077
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,653
I will.

1078
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,282
What are you guys looking at?

1079
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,452
So-mi uploaded her first video
after leaving the hospital.

1080
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,370
-Gosh.
-I subscribed to her channel.

1081
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,831
Ms. Song, So-mi is very good at editing.
She has a knack for this.

1082
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:18,334
Who's this? Hong-do is in the thumbnail.

1083
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,418
What?

1084
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,462
I'm off.

1085
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,423
Oh, it's not Hong-do.

1086
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,386
It's Ms. Song.

1087
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,097
Ms. Song, So-mi uploaded a video of you.

1088
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,641
What?

1089
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,311
STOP LOOKING AT THE HANDSOME MED STUDENT
THE WOMAN OF THE HOUR IS...

1090
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:41,982
Jae-hwan, the IV and IM ampoules
should be kept separate.

1091
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,692
-Got it.
-What is this?

1092
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,154
NURSE SONG SU-BIN AT YULJE MEDICAL CENTER
WHO IS ALSO SO-MI'S MOM

1093
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:48,530
Intern!

1094
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,576
This patient needs to get
the tests done now, so please go with him.

1095
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,662
You have to monitor his SpO2 level
to make sure it doesn't drop.

1096
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,374
Gosh, what do we do with all this?

1097
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,376
So-mi.

1098
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,795
I feel bad wasting all this food.

1099
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,172
Just have one more spoon of rice
with the soup, okay?

1100
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,841
No, I weigh 43kg now. I won't eat.

1101
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,427
You just got your surgery.
Why would you go on a diet now?

1102
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,471
Put that thing down.

1103
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,432
So what time
do I have to be here tomorrow?

1104
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,643
He didn't even explain everything.

1105
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,855
Ms. Yoo Sang-eun will be the first one
to go into surgery tomorrow morning.

1106
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,650
She'll be moved to the OR
around 7:30 a.m.,

1107
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,819
so just be here by 7 a.m.

1108
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,695
The surgery will take about two hours,

1109
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,698
but the whole process will take
a bit longer because of the anesthesia.

1110
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,701
The surgery will go well,
so don't worry. Get some rest.

1111
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,286
Okay, thank you.

1112
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,329
No problem.

1113
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:39,581
What are you doing?

1114
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,291
You need to eat.

1115
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,252
Put that down, So-mi.

1116
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,421
Just have one more spoon of rice, okay?

1117
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,339
MY MOM, WHO TOLD ME TO HAVE
ONE MORE SPOON OF RICE

1118
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,550
GOES TO CHECK ON PATIENTS
WITHOUT DRINKING A CUP A WATER...

1119
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,094
I'll check the patient in Room Eight,
Lee Jang-u's vital signs

1120
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,096
and see if a bed is ready in Room Three.

1121
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,807
OFF TO THE ROOM
WITH A BIG SMILE ON HER FACE!

1122
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,309
Ma'am, we need to get
Lee Jae-guk's consent for ERCP.

1123
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,352
How should I explain it?

1124
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,022
After his cholecystectomy,
he has a high total bilirubin level.

1125
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,567
From the MRCP exam, we found a CBD stone,
so he's getting ERCP.

1126
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,861
MY MOM IS AWESOME
I FEEL LIKE I'M WATCHING A MEDICAL DRAMA

1127
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,363
So-mi, I have portrait rights.

1128
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,240
Why don't you get my permission first?

1129
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,994
You totally got it wrong.
I wasn't filming you.

1130
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:24,543
HER BUSY DAY CONTINUED
EVEN AFTER THAT

1131
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:29,756
I'M ROOTING FOR MS. SONG
AND ALL THE OTHER NURSES

1132
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:31,967
My gosh.

1133
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,430
I should have a daughter too.

1134
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:37,681
Boys can do the same.

1135
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:41,059
I know. I'm just envious of Ms. Song.

1136
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,895
But... You know,

1137
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,105
So-mi and I had a huge fight this morning.

1138
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,649
Gosh, I never know
what that girl is thinking.

1139
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,443
My goodness.

1140
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:52,446
Im Jang-hun has been on POD for ten days,

1141
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:54,990
but his brain CT scan shows
that most of his ICH has resolved.

1142
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,911
His motor responses are also improving,
so we'll move him to Rehabilitation.

1143
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,956
That's such good news. I was so worried.

1144
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,338
Try lifting your right leg, please.

1145
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,884
Can you draw up your right knee?

1146
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,558
His leg has improved a lot more
than I expected.

1147
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,770
Yes, Doctor. It's still pretty weak,

1148
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,813
but it responds now.

1149
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,190
I'm so relieved.

1150
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,401
It'll improve a lot more
with the rehabilitation therapy.

1151
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,028
What's the point?

1152
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,821
I can't move my arm.

1153
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,741
Honey, why are you being like this?

1154
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:40,160
Your arm will recover soon too.

1155
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,328
No, it won't.

1156
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,539
It's been completely numb

1157
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:46,625
for over ten days.

1158
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,879
Doctor, I won't be able
to use the arm forever, right?

1159
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,174
I can't do anything with my right arm

1160
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,301
for the rest of my life, right?

1161
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,512
The hemorrhage took place

1162
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,431
in the part that controls the limbs.
That's why it's still weak.

1163
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,059
But the damage occurred
before the surgery,

1164
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,937
so at the moment, we're not sure
whether or not it can recover.

1165
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,566
The leg has certainly improved a lot,

1166
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,026
but the arm might take a while.

1167
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:18,282
You're still young,
so you shouldn't give up.

1168
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,702
I've seen patients recover
with ongoing rehabilitation therapy.

1169
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,204
Why did you bother saving my life?

1170
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,872
Honey, have you lost your mind?

1171
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,834
Seriously, why are you being like this?

1172
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:33,839
It was the best choice we could make.

1173
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,551
The surgery went well,
and the hemorrhage has resolved.

1174
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:40,971
I suggest you keep up with your
rehabilitation therapy and be patient.

1175
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,348
How can I live like this?

1176
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,602
I can't use one arm!

1177
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,354
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1178
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:52,691
I don't want to live.

1179
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,319
My life is over.

1180
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,874
There was some adhesion caused
by being on the ECMO for months.

1181
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,501
In cases like that,
it's important to make sure

1182
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:14,338
we can open the chest for the transplant
without a cardiac event.

1183
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,175
Thankfully, we managed to perform
the transplant without any events.

1184
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:22,554
-My gosh. Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you so much, Doctor.

1185
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,806
But it took a while for us
to open the chest.

1186
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,601
The donor's heart is pumping well,

1187
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,979
but it's a little big and swollen
as we expected.

1188
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,106
We left the chest open
as it was hard to close it up.

1189
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,858
We'll try closing it again

1190
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,777
when the swelling goes down in a few days.

1191
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,614
Anyway, the surgery went well.

1192
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,116
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank you, Doctor.

1193
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,076
Thank you so much.

1194
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,662
Please wait outside.
I'll make sure you can see Chae-yun soon.

1195
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,538
They're tidying up now,

1196
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,874
so you should be able to see her
in about an hour.

1197
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,377
-Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
-Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

1198
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,128
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1199
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:56,463
Thank you.

1200
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,141
Everything will go well, right?

1201
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,437
Professor Kim, you perform this surgery
every day. What's with you?

1202
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,147
The surgery went well, you know.

1203
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,148
Well...

1204
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,151
We have to reduce the IO ratio
to make the swelling go down.

1205
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,903
Let's close her up in a few days, okay?

1206
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,699
Keep monitoring her to see

1207
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,660
if she's bleeding
and make sure she's urinating well, okay?

1208
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:27,786
Got it?

1209
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,788
You got it?

1210
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,390
Because of the size of her liver,

1211
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:51,601
she can't be a donor.

1212
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,272
More than 30 percent of the liver

1213
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:58,692
should be left after the partial removal
to ensure the donor's safety.

1214
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,777
In her case, only 25 percent will be left.

1215
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,696
We'll need to find another donor.

1216
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,823
Gosh...

1217
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,326
Doctor, I'm relieved to hear this.

1218
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,958
Honey, I'm so relieved.

1219
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,545
Even if your liver was suitable,

1220
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,130
I wouldn't let you do it.

1221
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,467
I'm ill, you know.

1222
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:25,719
If you also ruin your health,

1223
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,763
it'll hurt me even more.

1224
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,728
Who will look after Dong-ju?

1225
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:37,773
His daddy is ill,

1226
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,025
so he needs a healthy mom.

1227
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,153
I'm really okay.

1228
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:47,157
Mother.

1229
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:52,412
Stop stressing my wife about this.

1230
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,748
This is about the three of us.

1231
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:57,876
We'll figure out what to do.

1232
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,778
Oh, thanks.

1233
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:26,822
It's cold.

1234
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,031
Thanks.

1235
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,415
He was out of line.

1236
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,420
I mean, you saved that patient,
Im Jang-hun.

1237
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,715
-Chi-hong.
-Yes.

1238
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,552
Can you go speak to his wife?

1239
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:54,307
She must be stressed out as well.

1240
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:59,229
Tell her that I'm not too busy
and let her know that she can call me

1241
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:03,900
whenever she has any questions
about his condition and rehabilitation.

1242
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:08,196
I might make her uncomfortable
if I tell her this myself,

1243
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,031
so I want you to tell her.

1244
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,677
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1245
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:32,929
What?

1246
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,561
I've already told the director

1247
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,731
that I want to work at the Sokcho branch
for just a year.

1248
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:44,524
What the heck are you talking about?

1249
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,110
Why would you go there all of a sudden?

1250
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:49,487
My neck hurts a lot.

1251
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,449
I need a break. I want to get some rest.

1252
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:56,912
They perform less surgical procedures
than we do,

1253
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,372
so I'll take it easy
and get my disc problem treated.

1254
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:01,499
I also want to study while I'm there.

1255
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,462
I'll visit Seoul often,

1256
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:09,633
and I'll take care of the VIP surgeries
if I can get the schedule in advance.

1257
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:13,887
And about that thing, I should definitely
be able to take care of it there.

1258
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,184
Why did you decide something
like that without talking to us first?

1259
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,895
I'm sure Song-hwa made
the best decision for herself.

1260
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,022
Don't get so worked up, okay?

1261
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,065
If she's gone...

1262
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:30,070
Then what about the band?
What will happen to our band?

1263
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,322
I'll be in Seoul every weekend.

1264
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,116
Sokcho is only two hours away.
It's not far.

1265
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,328
Yes, just divide your time
between Seoul and Sokcho.

1266
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:40,288
You should get your neck treated first.

1267
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,668
Hey, Seok-hyeong.

1268
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,544
How's your mom?

1269
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,630
She has to carefully monitor
her blood pressure.

1270
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,841
Worry about yourself first.

1271
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,760
My mom is healthier than you.

1272
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:58,932
She just feels weak these days.
That's why she's in the hospital now.

1273
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:00,392
It's nothing serious.

1274
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,401
Mom, Mr. Pyeon is here.

1275
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,860
Mr. Pyeon? Why is he here?

1276
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,782
Hello, Mr. Pyeon. How have you been?

1277
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:19,077
What brings you by?

1278
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:24,541
I just got a call
from Chairman Yang Tae-yang's lawyer.

1279
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:30,046
Apparently, Chairman Yang left a will.

1280
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:36,386
The lawyer
and Chairman Yang's chief secretary

1281
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:40,056
would like to go over the will
with the two of you in person.

1282
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,475
They're on their way here now.

1283
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:13,465
Me?

1284
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,717
But the thing is,

1285
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,928
I'm a nobody to Professor Ahn.

1286
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,014
I'm his mom, you know.

1287
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:23,683
I know my son very well.

1288
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:28,521
I saw you having a conversation
with my son.

1289
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:34,152
I could tell from the way
he was looking at you

1290
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,363
that he really

1291
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,158
cares about you

1292
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,619
and likes you a lot.

1293
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:55,590
When my son likes or dislikes something,

1294
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,302
it all shows on his face.

1295
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:05,683
You may think I'm nosy,
and I could be wrong.

1296
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,648
But this is like my last hope.
I'm afraid I must ask

1297
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:18,238
a big favor

1298
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,783
of you.

1299
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,293
Can you please ask him to stay?

1300
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:37,006
Ask him to give up

1301
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,511
becoming a priest

1302
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,722
and stay at the hospital.

1303
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:47,892
Please ask him for me.

1304
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,233
Please?

1305
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:38,902
Winter is here.

1306
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:42,530
Doctor,
the hospital is totally packed today.

1307
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:43,740
It's Christmas Eve, you know.

1308
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:46,326
You're worried about something, right?
Tell me.

1309
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:50,663
I'll encounter hundreds of thousands
of moments when I must make a decision.

1310
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,166
What if I make the wrong decision
every single time?

1311
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:54,167
Professor Kim.

1312
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:57,629
Do you have any plans for this evening?

1313
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,422
Dr. Chu confessed her feelings?

1314
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:00,798
Good for you.

1315
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:01,925
Did something happen?

1316
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,093
When was this will written?

1317
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,929
Is there anything else in the will?

1318
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:09,766
He only cared about himself all his life,
that worthless leech.

1319
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,101
You won't go to the airport tomorrow?

1320
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,895
Ik-sun is leaving.

1321
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:15,772
Am I putting too much pressure on her?

1322
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:17,440
Will it be okay to send this to her?

1323
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,361
Professor, I hope you don't have to work
all the time when you're there.

1324
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:24,072
Wait for just ten days
even if you miss Daddy, okay?

1325
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,699
If the surgery goes well
and the patient recovers,

1326
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,117
I'll take you out for a nice meal.

1327
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,286
I heard you're transferring
to the Sokcho branch.

1328
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,455
How did you know?

1329
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,291
-Who is it?
-It's me, Gyeo-ul.

1330
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,879
Take good care of Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

1331
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:48,471
Hey.
