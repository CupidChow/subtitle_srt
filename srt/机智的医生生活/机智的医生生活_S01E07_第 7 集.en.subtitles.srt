1
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,780
How's the liver? Are you heading here now?

2
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,490
We have a problem, Professor Ahn.

3
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,202
-What's wrong?
-The donor's liver is too thick.

4
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,665
It looks like it weighs over 500g.
And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,709
What should we do?

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,977
This liver seems too big for Ji-a.
It won't work.

7
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,272
I think you should give up.

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,733
No, we'll proceed as planned.

9
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,569
I'm going to do this.

10
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,997
Hello.

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,583
-You're still here?
-Yes.

12
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,919
Did the painter Mr. Jang Hong-do
leave for the day?

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,797
Yes, Mr. Jang was...

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,216
I mean, he was here, but he left just now.

15
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,802
All right. You should get going too.

16
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,719
Okay.

17
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,682
Want to see a liver transplant?

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,894
Yes.

19
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,523
Thank you.

20
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,079
For a baby to get a liver transplant,
the size is the most important factor.

21
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,082
If it's too big,
the results will be fatally affected.

22
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,502
For a baby, we'd usually cut
a brain-dead donor's liver in half,

23
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,046
but this donor's liver
is much bigger than we expected.

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,383
Even if we cut it in half,
it'll still be too big for the baby.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
Ji-a is only six months old.

26
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,805
So, Ji-a can't get the surgery?
Will she have to wait for another liver?

27
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,098
She doesn't have a "next time."

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,101
Her liver can't release the bile,
so hepatocirrhosis is worsening rapidly.

29
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,270
She vomited blood
and had blood in her excrement.

30
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,813
She won't last more than a week.

31
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,273
-Then what do we do?
-What?

32
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,234
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,611
Then what do we do, Professor?

34
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,282
She can't get the surgery
and won't live if we don't do anything.

35
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,200
-What do we do?
-We'll perform the surgery.

36
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,578
But you said
even the half-cut liver is too big.

37
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
-We can cut it again.
-What?

38
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,039
What? What's wrong?

39
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,125
I'm really sorry.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,754
Did you say we can cut the liver again?

41
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,755
Yes.

42
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,802
We'll cut the half-cut liver
in half again.

43
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,223
It happens occasionally. Of course,
the surgery will be very difficult.

44
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,226
Still, we have to do it.

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,020
It won't be easy,

46
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,149
but this is the last and only way
to save the baby.

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,063
-Ji-a.
-Please, God...

48
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,375
Here.

49
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,591
-Three, three, three.
-Three, three, three.

50
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,301
-Liver coming out.
-One.

51
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,345
-Gosh, it must have been hard for her.
-Two.

52
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,056
-Three, four.
-I'm amazed she held out with that liver.

53
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,767
-Five, six.
-Ji-a is really amazing.

54
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,686
-Seven, eight.
-Seven, eight.

55
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,188
-Nine.
-Nine, ten.

56
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,739
The liver is here.

57
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,122
Thank you. Thanks for your help, Dr. Jang.

58
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,834
You said you were
by the traffic light across the street.

59
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,544
You got here so fast.

60
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,213
-Did you run?
-Thankfully, the traffic wasn't so bad.

61
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,800
But the elevator in this building
is broken,

62
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,635
so I ran up here.

63
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,179
I mean, I didn't run.

64
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,432
I quickly...

65
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,977
I walked quickly. Just walked.

66
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,063
I was being careful
to deliver this safe and sound.

67
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,404
My gosh, Gyeo-ul.

68
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,114
Great job.

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,589
It looks like we're done, Professor.

70
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,341
Yes, thanks for all your help.

71
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,329
-We're ready, Professor.
-Okay.

72
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,004
Would you like to try
the next External Ventricular Drainage?

73
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,589
What?

74
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,884
You're in your third year,
so it's about time.

75
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,761
Get ready.

76
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,223
Thank you.

77
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,689
The liver has been cut,
so it's bleeding a lot.

78
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,649
Forceps. Quick.

79
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,533
This will take a while. Ik-jun.

80
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,535
Yes, I'll let her parents know.

81
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,790
There's a lot of bleeding, Doctor.

82
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,335
Yes, she's still okay though.

83
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,714
Focus. You have to do a thorough job
with the suction.

84
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,260
-I can't see.
-Okay.

85
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,595
Pass me the gauze.

86
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,864
Doctor.

87
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,074
Is Ji-a well now?

88
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,243
Did the surgery go well, Doctor?

89
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,580
Yes.

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,248
It went well.

91
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,175
Why are you crying? It went very well.
Ji-a is such a strong girl.

92
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,221
Please don't cry. People will think
that the surgery didn't go well.

93
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,307
Thank you.

94
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,976
Thank you, Doctor.

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,896
Thank you so much for everything.
We'll never forget this.

96
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,232
There was more bleeding
than we had expected, so it wasn't easy.

97
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,067
But we managed to get it under control.

98
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,362
She's stable now,
and we'll move her to the ICU shortly.

99
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,115
The transplant went well,

100
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,326
so she'll be fine
as long as the liver works well.

101
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,746
The surgery went successfully,
so Ji-a will recover soon.

102
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,915
-Thank you.
-This must've been so hard for you.

103
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,250
You held out very well.

104
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,045
I don't know
how I can express my gratitude.

105
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,173
Thank you so much.

106
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:33,095
Ji-a could live because she was
lucky enough to find a brain-dead donor.

107
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,097
This is truly a miracle.

108
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,601
And we were very lucky
to find a young donor.

109
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,728
We owe it all to you, Doctor.

110
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,688
Thank you so much, Doctor.

111
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,608
Thank you.

112
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,070
All I did was perform the surgery.

113
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,114
Pardon?

114
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,286
You should thank that person instead.

115
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,790
-Who?
-Who?

116
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,086
Age 22, female.

117
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,171
Tall and slim.

118
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,507
A traffic accident victim.

119
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,972
I'm talking about the donor.

120
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,182
The person who gave Ji-a the liver.

121
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,519
I can't give you

122
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,855
more information about the donor
as it's against our rules,

123
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,442
but Ji-a could live thanks to her.

124
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,905
I'm so ashamed, Doctor.

125
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,744
I'll thank her for the rest of my life.

126
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,539
I was only thinking about my baby.

127
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,709
-I'm so sorry.
-We're sorry.

128
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,962
No, don't be sorry. I fully understand.

129
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,300
But every year, on Ji-a's birthday,

130
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,385
please thank her

131
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,054
with all your heart.

132
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,683
-We will.
-Yes, thank you.

133
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,810
Thank you.

134
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,439
Then I'll see you in the PICU later.

135
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,107
Okay.

136
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,027
Thank you.

137
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,260
Yes. Can you send this to me
with the image?

138
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,304
Yes, thank you. Will do.

139
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,266
-Still, I'm worried.
-Don't be.

140
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,061
The contractions are under control,
and the baby is doing well too.

141
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,689
-She'll be fine.
-Do you have to keep using the drugs?

142
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,109
As I explained before,
those drugs are completely fine.

143
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,404
I'll go through them again with you.

144
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,572
Just a moment, please.

145
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,241
That patient, Park Mi-jeong.
What was her cervical length again?

146
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,618
-Hold on.
-It was 1.5cm.

147
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,328
I see, 1.5cm.

148
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,331
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes, Professor.

149
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,334
The C-section patient bled a lot
because her contractions weren't good.

150
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,628
Check the pad
and keep an eye on her contractions.

151
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,754
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,551
Doctor, my wife says that
she's in a lot of pain. What should I do?

153
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,472
I checked her five minutes ago but didn't
notice any changes with her cervix.

154
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,266
I'll check in a bit
and give her an analgesic if needed.

155
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,685
Can you please check now?

156
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,686
Sure.

157
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,480
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

158
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,857
We're giving Sin Hyo-jeong
ritodrine at 12gtt per minute,

159
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,401
but she has tachycardia.

160
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,445
Oh, let's bring it down to 8gtt.
And check her vitals in an hour.

161
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,363
Okay.

162
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,657
We'll see how the baby is doing

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,576
and keep the baby in the womb
for longer if needed.

164
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,790
Is there a chance that the baby
will be weak compared to other babies

165
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,584
or can't live for long?

166
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,545
No, that won't happen.

167
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,298
My mom also had a very hard time
when she had me.

168
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,009
-Really?
-In my case...

169
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,805
My mom is diabetic,
and she got pregnant unexpectedly.

170
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,223
She's diabetic?

171
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,518
Patient Seo Jeong-won's episiotomy site
looks pretty good, doesn't it?

172
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,147
Yes, I checked in the morning.
She doesn't have a hematoma. All good.

173
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,566
Dr. Chu, can you have a look at this NST?

174
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,401
Jeong Min-gyeong is exhibiting
decelerations.

175
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,154
Let's hydrate her.

176
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,739
Give her 3L of oxygen via nasal prong
in the lateral position.

177
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,657
Okay.

178
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,910
-Doctor.
-My sister's baby was born prematurely,

179
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,455
but she's so optimistic
and easygoing though.

180
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,375
I was worried about her
even though I'm an ob-gyn,

181
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,377
but she said she was happy
to meet her baby early.

182
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,963
-My gosh, really?
-Yes.

183
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,299
-Doctor.
-Yes?

184
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,051
I'm really hungry.

185
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,928
Can I eat something?

186
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,265
Let's check fetal movements.
Hold on. I'll be with you in a minute.

187
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,852
She'll have a healthy baby,
and the baby will stay healthy.

188
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,355
My sister's baby is already two years old.
Do you want to see photos?

189
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,482
Yes, I'd love to.

190
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,818
-Dr. Myeong.
-Yes?

191
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,196
We need to check
Sin Ha-yun's fetal movements,

192
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,073
and we have to check Jeong Min-gyeong
for decelerations.

193
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,909
Also, we have two C-sections scheduled,

194
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,244
so we have to get ready.
We have a lot to do.

195
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,705
Okay, got it.

196
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,925
Doctor, you're very straightforward.

197
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,093
Have a good day.

198
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,554
You too.

199
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,894
Well... I'll go check
the C-section patient's pad.

200
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,937
Okay.

201
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,277
Oh, boy.
A showdown between the bear and the fox.

202
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,697
-Who's the fox?
-Isn't it obvious?

203
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,994
RESTRICTED AREA

204
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,208
Professor, Jeong Min-gyeong is exhibiting
decelerations. I'll go check.

205
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,545
Give her 3L of oxygen
via nasal prong, right?

206
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,630
Yes.

207
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,674
Okay.

208
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,805
What's taking him so long?

209
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,182
I should've offered to pick it up.

210
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,850
It's his minor personal satisfaction.

211
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,811
He's probably chatting
with the delivery guy.

212
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,109
Couldn't you have hurried?
We're dying of hunger here.

213
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,280
How can you talk about death so easily
when you're a doctor?

214
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,534
Hong-do and Yun-bok,
eat as much as you want.

215
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,744
Eat up and join our department later on.

216
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,871
-Okay.
-Okay.

217
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,665
Here. If you don't, that's a eat and run.

218
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,958
-Okay.
-Okay.

219
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,253
Can I have Double Bacon?
It's my favorite sandwich.

220
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,838
My gosh, of course.

221
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,133
-You can have two.
-Great, I will.

222
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,635
We'll still have leftovers.

223
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,470
So I called someone to join us.

224
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,769
Oh, Jeong-won is--

225
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,024
-Sandwiches? Nice.
-What the...

226
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,067
Well, he's a rain check.

227
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,029
You should have let me finish my sentence.
Goodness.

228
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,781
Hello.

229
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,241
-Hello.
-Hello.

230
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,576
Sit down, guys.

231
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,789
-But why am I a rain check?
-Don't ask. You don't need to know.

232
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,250
Hurry and eat,
or Gyeo-ul will eat everything. Here.

233
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,296
Oh. It's been a while, guys.

234
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,132
Gyeon-u and Jik-nyeo, right?

235
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,844
You called us like that last time,
and I told you our names.

236
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,804
Right, they were some painters' names.

237
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,098
Ma-ne and Mo-ne?

238
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,143
We're Hong-do and Yun-bok.

239
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,688
Right. Gosh, I'm really sorry.
We even did the Wakanda gesture together.

240
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,565
-Sorry, guys.
-It's okay.

241
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,776
And Ma-ne and Mo-ne are our cousins.

242
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,820
What? Seriously?

243
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,863
Yes.

244
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,743
Don't tell me they're twins.

245
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,411
They are.

246
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,121
-Identical twins?
-Identical twins.

247
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,915
-Five years old?
-Five years old.

248
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,293
Why are you saying the exact same things?

249
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,845
Dr. Bong.

250
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,183
-Here, have some water.
-You're having a late lunch.

251
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,351
I brought you some napkins.

252
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:22,272
Oh, I had an emergency patient.
How did you guys all become friends?

253
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,234
We're both chief residents,
and I've known him for a while.

254
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,862
As for Chi-hong, he's Seok-min's favorite.

255
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,073
-What? When did I say that?
-Really?

256
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,659
I mean, he's very fond of you.

257
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,328
He talks about you all the time,
so I feel like I know you so well.

258
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,957
By the way, why did you leave
the military, Captain Ahn?

259
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,460
I bet it was because of a woman.
Come on. Tell us.

260
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,673
There wasn't any special reason.
I'll tell you another time.

261
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,344
I guess I should be like that too.
It makes him look all mysterious.

262
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,054
Professor.

263
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,058
I wasn't sure what you'd like,
so I got one of each.

264
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,352
An iced Americano,
a hot Americano, and a latte.

265
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
Hello.

266
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,982
What kind of story
shall I tell you guys today?

267
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,985
Dr. Chu, what happened to your face?

268
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,946
-What?
-Your skin looks ashy. Are you okay?

269
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,741
My foundation is to blame.
I'm wearing 25, which is quite dark.

270
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,911
It's too dark for you. Your neck looks
much lighter than your face now.

271
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,122
This is the Black Pearl Makeup.

272
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,958
Your face looks tiny if you wear this
because it makes you look tanned.

273
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,045
You look like you went to a tanning salon
because you couldn't go on vacation.

274
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,465
By the way,
how did you two become friends?

275
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,717
You're in different departments.
Also, your ages and even

276
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,719
your skin colors are different.

277
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,804
We're both members of ARMY.

278
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,433
You served in the military together?
Dr. Ahn, they're your juniors.

279
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,644
Not the army. They meant...

280
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,022
Did you get Internet service installed
yesterday?

281
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:45,981
Yes.

282
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,361
I got ADSL Mega pass installed yesterday,
the fastest Internet service in Korea.

283
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,281
I sold all my acorns

284
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,658
and used up all my KTF Bigi eggs for it.

285
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,038
-What's he saying?
-Anyway...

286
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:05,584
So you two like BTS.
My sister is a huge fan as well.

287
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,211
Yes, we met in the fan club.

288
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,506
Jeez, it looks like residents these days
have so much time on their hands.

289
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,550
You guys have time to join a fan club
and chat like this at the cafeteria.

290
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,970
-Back in my day--
-Professor, have this latte.

291
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,347
-A latte.
-Yes.

292
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,394
Forget the cafeteria.
We didn't even have time to eat.

293
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,315
Shall I tell you a story
about when I was a resident?

294
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,150
-Bye.
-Bye.

295
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,655
However, those two on the Gongnyong Ridge.

296
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,408
The first love. The old love.
I should tell you guys the love story.

297
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,078
My goodness.

298
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,502
I'm not really interested though.

299
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,924
Ik-jun and Jun-wan were always
dating someone. They were both popular.

300
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,927
I'm pretty sure
they always had girlfriends.

301
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,596
Wow, really? I'm impressed.

302
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,682
Moving on.
What about Professor Yang Seok-hyeong?

303
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,892
Seok-hyeong? He barely dated.

304
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,645
And he married the woman
his parents chose.

305
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,438
They got a divorce in less than a year.

306
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,150
He went to the US right after that,
but he did nothing but study.

307
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,067
I see.

308
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,529
But he's in love now. So in love.

309
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,197
What? With who?

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,074
With his TV.

311
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,452
No woman can beat his TV.

312
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,539
What about Professor Chae?
Was she a campus couple?

313
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,291
Yes, she was.

314
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,585
-Professor Lee Ik-jun, right?
-Ik-jun?

315
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,379
Gosh, no. They're really just friends.

316
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,799
Was it from the winter of
her freshman year or her second year?

317
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,634
Anyway,
she was in a long-term relationship.

318
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,803
She dated a senior guy
for a number of years.

319
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,807
They dated for over three to four years,
and she dated other guys after that too.

320
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,225
She just doesn't want to get married.

321
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,561
What about Professor Ahn Jeong-won?

322
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,024
If anyone has a crush on Jeong-won,

323
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,818
that person will have to beat God first.

324
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,613
Gosh, who can do that?

325
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,240
If there is someone that likes him,
she should give up.

326
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,203
How dare she compete against God?

327
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,542
Dr. Jang.

328
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,419
Are you a Buddhist?

329
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,048
This is probably making you uncomfortable.

330
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,634
Let's change the topic.

331
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,471
Okay, we are done. Finished.

332
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,808
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

333
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,907
Why are you still up?

334
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,702
-I'm studying the EVD procedure.
-EVD?

335
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,580
We do that all the time.

336
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,668
When we get an IVH patient,
I'll be the lead surgeon for the surgery.

337
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,338
What?

338
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,049
You still haven't done that yet?

339
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,760
Gosh, Professor Chae is too much.

340
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,722
I did it in my second year.

341
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,352
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

342
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,314
You'll probably get scolded,

343
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,442
-but still... Best of luck.
-Thanks.

344
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,027
Professor Chae...

345
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,614
When you make a mistake
for the first time, she lets it go.

346
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,741
But if you make another mistake...

347
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,081
Anyway, you can do it.

348
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,541
Thanks.

349
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,882
I can do this too.

350
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,580
Why don't you just shower here?

351
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,042
Oh, Professor Cheon. I'm sorry.

352
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,210
Do you have surgery?

353
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,505
Yes, I'm going into
Professor Kim Jun-wan's VSD surgery.

354
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,716
You two are like besties.

355
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,969
Yes.

356
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,889
He's quite fond of me.

357
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,601
-He speaks very highly of you.
-No way.

358
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,521
-Thank you.
-All right, get going.

359
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,356
Oh, right.

360
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,280
What's with him today?
He didn't even swear at me.

361
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,577
First, we'll block the hole
between the left and right ventricles.

362
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,206
If the mitral regurgitation continues
even after we block the VSD,

363
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,916
we'll fix that too.

364
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,711
We expect
that it'll take about five hours.

365
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,088
Don't worry too much.

366
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,715
Okay. Thank you for everything
in advance, Doctor.

367
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,593
-Thank you, Doctor.
-No problem. I'll see you later.

368
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,404
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

369
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,284
Captain Ahn will get an earful
from Professor Chae today.

370
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,622
It's so hard to set Kocher's point
when you can't see the coronal suture.

371
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,999
Go in and watch.
You guys are in the same year.

372
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,127
I can't. I'm too nervous for him.

373
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,546
I'm even more nervous now
than when I had to do it.

374
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,597
Can you see the coronal suture?

375
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,890
I'll try again.

376
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,769
Sometimes, you can't see it
because of the blood. Use gauze.

377
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,229
Okay. Forceps.

378
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,773
Bone wax, please.

379
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,567
WAXY SUBSTANCE USED TO CONTROL BLEEDING

380
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,032
Try to control bleeding with bone wax
while you're at it.

381
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,576
Heavy bleeding may occur
when you use the curette.

382
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,994
-Be careful.
-Okay.

383
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,373
Curette.

384
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,390
Tilt it a little.

385
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,435
No, up.

386
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,438
Good.

387
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,747
Well done. I think the angles
on the left and right are wrong.

388
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,500
Let's wrap up here. Can you pull it out?

389
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,585
Sure.

390
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,303
This has to go in straight.

391
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,015
You need to look at the inner canthus,
but you're not used to it yet.

392
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,767
Got it. I'm sorry.

393
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,396
This is a common mistake.
Just do a good job next time.

394
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:05,981
Okay.

395
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,900
Bayonet forceps, please.

396
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,582
Blade 15.

397
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,727
I cut through it again.

398
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,563
How many times have I done this already?

399
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,567
The valve is so delicate.

400
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,905
Get me a smaller needle.

401
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,163
ELAPSED TIME

402
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,416
Honey, it's been over nine hours.

403
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,960
He said it'd take around five hours.

404
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,090
What if

405
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,261
something went wrong?

406
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,439
All right. Let's go in together.

407
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,523
Okay.

408
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,281
It took longer than we had expected.

409
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,618
Even I wanted to cut my hand off.

410
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,412
-Pardon?
-Gosh, Doctor!

411
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,749
After repairing
the ventricular septal defect,

412
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,627
the mitral regurgitation was quite severe,
so I tried to fix it.

413
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,130
But the regurgitation continued to worsen
because the tissues kept ripping.

414
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,758
Right. But in conclusion,
everything went well.

415
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,761
-I see. Thank you.
-Thank you.

416
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,513
So Chang-mo is okay, right?

417
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,599
He bled quite a bit halfway through,
so we struggled a little,

418
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,975
but the surgery went well.

419
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,895
Then when can we see Chang-mo?

420
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,980
We managed to minimize the regurgitation,

421
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,816
so the baby is stable now.

422
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:17,028
As I explained before, we'll put Chang-mo
to sleep for the next three days--

423
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,864
You'll be able to see Chang-mo shortly
in the PICU.

424
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,491
Don't worry about a thing.

425
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,743
-Honey, we can see him shortly.
-Yes.

426
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,538
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

427
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,959
Professor, you need to state
the conclusion first.

428
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,713
Start with the conclusion,
whether it went well or not.

429
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,093
Doctors must inform the guardians
about everything that happens in the OR.

430
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,554
From beginning to end, in a calm manner.

431
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:47,058
If you keep doing that,
every guardian will get a heart attack.

432
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,185
Gosh, seriously.

433
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,605
You're so insensitive sometimes.

434
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,816
I'm not telling you to sugarcoat things.

435
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:59,112
State the facts.
But first, you need to ease their minds.

436
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,905
Gosh, forget it.

437
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,619
Hey, my mom never scolded like that
even when I was five.

438
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,539
He's right. Can you be more considerate
when you talk?

439
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,458
Dr. Do, well done.

440
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,210
-Hello, Professor.
-Yes, hello.

441
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,921
Please talk casually to me.

442
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,922
Gosh, no.

443
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,634
Don't you have to go home?
You took a shower, so go home already!

444
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,846
A baby got surgery for enteroclysis
earlier in the day.

445
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,514
But there was some bleeding,

446
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,601
so I want to monitor
the baby's vitals tonight.

447
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,437
You sure live up to your nickname, Buddha.

448
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,647
You should've done a better job
with the surgery.

449
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,692
And you too live up to...

450
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,987
Right, you sure are Buddha's buddy.

451
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,822
I'm Catholic.

452
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,576
I knew it! My wife is a devoted Catholic.

453
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,164
Catholics are beautiful inside and out.

454
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,373
Thank you.

455
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,710
Oh, right.

456
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,089
Is there a professor named
Cheon Myeong-tae in your department?

457
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,008
Yes. Why do you ask?

458
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,303
I heard we received an anonymous letter
about a pharmaceutical company's rebate.

459
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,138
He got a golf club membership

460
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:11,392
and free meals
at an upscale restaurant through them.

461
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,312
It sounds like most CS professors did it.

462
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,647
Hey, you didn't go, right?

463
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,410
Of course, I go often.
My brother owns the golf club.

464
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,415
By the way,

465
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,835
who told you?

466
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,963
That you don't need to know.

467
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,050
I heard it was paid for
with XG&YU's corporate credit card.

468
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,636
A guy who works there
put it on the wrong card.

469
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,808
We play golf together often,
so he got confused.

470
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,519
He kept apologizing.

471
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,772
Even today, he sent me over ten messages.

472
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:04,445
Sir, please. Don't make me look so petty.

473
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,949
A day on the golf course costs peanuts.

474
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,287
"Peanuts"?
I heard the membership for the golf course

475
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,292
costs two hundred million won.

476
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,045
My brother owns the golf club,
and I'm a member too.

477
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,756
Please believe me.
It is not what you think it is.

478
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,176
Professor Kim Jun-wan

479
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,679
got a big mouth.

480
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,222
He kept overreacting.

481
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,809
I see that he practically wrote a novel.

482
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,450
Stop sighing. Are you trying
to make the floor collapse or what?

483
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,873
I'm so embarrassed.

484
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,128
During Seon-bin's first surgery
as a lead surgeon,

485
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,505
she suddenly put up both hands like this
and said,

486
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,761
"I can't do this. I'm afraid
I'll end up killing this patient."

487
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,724
Come on. Let's grab a drink together.

488
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,352
I can't.
I'm working the night shift today.

489
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,103
Oh, boy.

490
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,440
I'm dying for a drink, but I happen
to be working the night shift today.

491
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,573
-You're still here?
-How's the baby?

492
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,868
The baby is doing okay at the moment.
I'll check back later.

493
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,163
I hope you didn't play golf
with Professor Cheon.

494
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,250
-I did, once.
-What? You did?

495
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,628
The golf course there is really great.

496
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,588
The ball rolls in by itself.

497
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,591
Damn it.
This will turn into a headache, then.

498
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,344
No, it won't. I paid for it myself.

499
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,012
How?

500
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,848
Didn't you guys use XG&YU's
corporate card and their membership?

501
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,810
I kept getting a bad feeling
during the game.

502
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,895
Professor Cheon
always brags about his money,

503
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,939
so I assumed we were using his membership.

504
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,650
But something seemed off
when we were cashing out.

505
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,069
So I went back and asked the staff

506
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,862
if we used their corporate credit card.

507
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,573
He said yes, so I paid for mine
on the spot and left.

508
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,450
How much did you pay?

509
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,328
The most expensive membership
is 200 million won.

510
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,705
It's usually for about 20 years,

511
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,498
so I multiplied it by 365,
and it was 7,300.

512
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,543
Then it's about 27,397 won per day
after dividing 200 million by 7,300 days.

513
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:27,171
Round it up to 28,000 won.
The green fee was about 150,000 won,

514
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,840
and the cart was 20,000 won per person.

515
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,675
On top of that, the caddie fee was
30,000 won per person.

516
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,677
So I paid 228,000 won in total.

517
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,099
What? My GPA was second-highest
in the entire Natural Science division.

518
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,102
Right, I'm relieved.

519
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,689
Gosh. Knowing how much you love golf,

520
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,859
I was worried you might've hung out
with them without thinking.

521
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,445
Jeong-won.

522
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,905
These days,

523
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,325
I'm not even thinking about golf.

524
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,119
Bye.

525
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:01,998
Goodness.

526
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,919
Professor, did you go there too?

527
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,714
Did you play golf last weekend?

528
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,632
It's none of your business! It's personal.

529
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,218
Why are you interrogating me like this?

530
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,054
Gosh, you're such a nuisance.

531
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,140
Hey, you keep acting up these days.

532
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,933
Enough. Mind your own business.

533
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,604
Then tell me what you did last weekend.

534
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,732
What did you do last weekend?

535
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,276
I ate jajangmyeon.

536
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,153
Jajangmyeon? What?

537
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,199
I had buljajangmyeon. Are we good now?

538
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,039
Good call.

539
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:52,215
BEST MENU: BULJAJANGMYEON
NEW MENU: NUKE BULJAJANGMYEON

540
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,137
Look at this name. It's so gutsy.

541
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,972
Don't your colleagues complain?

542
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
Even our commander is a regular here.

543
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:08,898
AUTHENTIC CHINESE RESTAURANT
NUCLEAR KITCHEN

544
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,776
Enjoy.

545
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,447
It's one level below
the one we had last week.

546
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,409
-Which level is this?
-Level Four. Last week, we had Level Five.

547
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,412
-Were you okay last week?
-I almost had to go to the ER.

548
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:29,544
I can definitely handle spicy food,
but the one we had last week was hard.

549
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,338
This one looks quite spicy too.

550
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,676
The buljajangmyeon here should be used
as the ROKA's new secret weapon.

551
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,471
Watch what you say.
My unit is right across the street.

552
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,558
Who cares? My girlfriend is a major.

553
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,393
I bet only a handful of people
outrank you.

554
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:49,021
No, there are so many officers
who outrank me. There's a ton.

555
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,983
A lieutenant general, then a general?

556
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,572
Jun-wan. You were exempted, weren't you?

557
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,034
There's no three-star general
in my division.

558
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,039
I knew it. I wondered how you became
a professor before my brother did.

559
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,795
That's right. I was exempted.

560
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,384
What do you say? Do you want
to hear my story? It's very long.

561
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,636
No, thanks. I'm sure you had your reason.

562
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:25,016
By the way, did you just mix
my jajangmyeon for me?

563
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,601
Yes.

564
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,063
I'm so touched.

565
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,316
What? This is nothing.

566
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,032
Do you do this for my brother
or your roomie, Jeong-won?

567
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,241
Hell no.

568
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,329
Why would I do it for them?
We're always busy stuffing our own faces.

569
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,872
I don't even do it for my mom.

570
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,956
Because it's you...

571
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,545
I only do it for you.

572
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,631
Did you get an emergency call already?

573
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,216
No, I'm late.

574
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
Don't you still have some time
until your rounds?

575
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,887
I'm late for breakfast.
I never skip breakfast.

576
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,430
Oh, Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul is here.

577
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,141
What? It's fall already?

578
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,269
Gosh, is fall here already?

579
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,731
Right? I put on this trench coat today
because of her.

580
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,359
What are you two talking about?

581
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,946
When you start wearing your denim shirt,
that means fall is here.

582
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,115
When we see your white T-shirt,
we know it's summer.

583
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,576
For us, you're like an indicator
of the passage of time.

584
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,578
So I'm like your human calendar.

585
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,789
-Exactly.
-Let's go, Dr. Jang.

586
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,501
Breakfast is on me
since you informed me that fall is here.

587
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,504
You'll buy me breakfast?

588
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,341
Yes, Professor Kim Jun-wan
gave me his card.

589
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,177
He gave me this yesterday,
but I haven't returned it.

590
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,266
Something good must've happened to him.
He's always in a good mood.

591
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,685
I bet he has no idea
that I still have his card.

592
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,353
Let's hurry.

593
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,942
A male patient, age 29.

594
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,361
Based on his MRI,
it looks like he has an astrocytoma.

595
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,781
The tumor is in the dominant hemisphere,
and the size is about 7cm.

596
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,410
We'll have him get a navigation CT
and a TFCA this afternoon.

597
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,080
Doctor.
The surgery won't be difficult, right?

598
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:58,544
Everyone around us is worried, saying
awake surgery is a difficult procedure.

599
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,380
There aren't any easy brain surgeries.

600
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,507
Awake surgery
is an especially complicated procedure.

601
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,720
As I explained before, Hyeon-su's tumor

602
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,140
has seeped into his normal brain tissues,
so the divide has been blurred.

603
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,225
That's why I think
awake surgery will be helpful.

604
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:18,272
Based on my experience, it's highly likely
that the tumor is affecting

605
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,108
the parts of his brain
that perform important functions.

606
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,611
We'll wake him up briefly
during the surgery

607
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,531
so that we can remove the tumor
while checking his neurological symptoms.

608
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,784
He's still young,

609
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,496
so it's very important to minimize
post-surgical neurological complications.

610
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,247
How long will the surgery take?

611
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,167
It all depends,

612
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,711
but it usually takes seven to eight hours.

613
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,632
And the amount of time
the patient is kept awake can vary,

614
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,093
but I'd say it usually ranges
from 30 minutes to an hour.

615
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,679
I'll quickly figure out brain functions
around the tumor

616
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,265
so that we can minimize
the time he has to stay awake for.

617
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,559
The experience
can traumatize some patients.

618
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,186
Okay.

619
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,146
You have a day before the surgery,

620
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,858
so let us know if you're too scared
or concerned.

621
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,485
Your condition matters the most.

622
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,822
I don't care.

623
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,241
I'll do as you say.

624
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:15,871
Hyeon-su, you can work again
after you get this surgery.

625
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,790
Don't be so listless.

626
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,084
How can I go back to work?

627
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,962
Stop talking nonsense, Mom.

628
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,715
Why not? You can totally do it.

629
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,845
I heard you're a cop.
It's very difficult to become a cop.

630
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,265
You even passed that difficult exam,
so don't be like this.

631
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,476
Hyeon-su, you can get through this.

632
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:43,023
Doctor, I don't care whether or not
he can go back to being a cop.

633
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,275
Please

634
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,652
just save my son.

635
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,905
Yes, we'll do our very best.

636
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,532
See you.

637
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,874
What happened
with Sin Mi-jin's liver index?

638
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,042
Her ALT is over 300.

639
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,210
ALT: A TRANSAMINASE ENZYME

640
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,504
Her bilirubin is over 10 as well.

641
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,131
HIGH LEVELS OF BILIRUBIN CAUSES JAUNDICE

642
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,884
The rejection reaction was low.
Why did it suddenly spike?

643
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,470
I actually ran into her in the hallway.

644
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,097
Well, I'll tell you later.

645
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,601
I don't feel

646
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,855
so bad. I feel all right.

647
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,357
You're not all right.
These numbers tell me that you need

648
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,319
to check in right away for tests
and treatment. It's not looking good.

649
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,947
Have you been taking your medication?

650
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,994
It doesn't look like
you've been taking it.

651
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,629
To me, it seems like you've been
off your medication for a while.

652
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,173
Did something happen?

653
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,344
If you continue to skip your medication,

654
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,555
your liver will get all ruined,
and you may need another transplant.

655
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,933
The liver won't function.
Let's get you checked in.

656
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,892
No,

657
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,394
I don't want to be hospitalized.

658
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,691
I just want to die, Doctor.

659
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,612
What are you talking about?

660
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,949
I worked very hard on your surgery.
Please don't say that to me.

661
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,159
Let's get you admitted
and get a CT scan of your liver.

662
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,120
Then, we'll run a biopsy
while doing your ultrasound.

663
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,081
We'll also treat transplant rejection.

664
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,255
He's a nine-year-old boy, who complained
of pain in his right abdomen,

665
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,257
so I took a CT and it showed appendicitis.

666
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,134
He has a fever and a high level of CRP.

667
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,554
Since when did it start to hurt?

668
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,722
Last night.

669
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,601
Oh, no. Let me take a look. All right.

670
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,397
I'll talk to the guardian.

671
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,774
Dr. Jang, please call Anesthesiology now.

672
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,858
Okay.

673
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,027
-Hello, Professor Ahn.
-Hi.

674
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,112
Professor Ahn.

675
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,489
Can we watch a movie together next time?

676
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,659
Sure. Let's watch one together
when we have time.

677
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,452
Bye.

678
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,165
What do you mean, "next time"?

679
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,209
Did you two meet in private?

680
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,462
Yes. I had dinner
with Professor Ahn last weekend.

681
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,631
Just the two of us? Outside the hospital?

682
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,884
Yes. Just the two of us,
outside the hospital.

683
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,469
In our own clothes, not in scrubs.

684
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,931
Did Professor Ahn ask you
to have dinner with him?

685
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,975
Well, I asked him.

686
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,685
I asked him to buy me dinner.

687
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,647
My gosh. Professor Ahn is known
to buy a lot of people meals.

688
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,609
He has a get-together
with the nurses often, too.

689
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,944
-I thought it was different.
-It was just us.

690
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,113
It doesn't matter
if it was just with you or 20 people.

691
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,282
When people ask him to buy them a meal,
he always does.

692
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,994
Dr. Bae. You know what?

693
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,789
I even watched a movie with Professor Ahn.
I'm serious.

694
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,375
Goodness. You got me there!

695
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,804
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

696
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,433
I miss you, too.

697
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,604
I have a photo of you,
so I can look at your photo.

698
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,273
I don't have a photo of you. Send me one.

699
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,858
Send me the best photo of you.

700
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,376
My goodness.

701
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:38,967
Who is it?

702
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,136
Who is it that you're so crazy about?

703
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,971
It's my mom.

704
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,183
Let's go. I'm hungry.

705
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,185
Give me a second. Let me change first.

706
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,311
Wait.

707
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,201
Jeong-won, you told the gang
to meet us in the basement, right?

708
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,828
We're only taking my car.

709
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,121
You do it.

710
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,705
Why do I always have to do that?

711
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,500
Because you did it already.

712
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,171
Let's go.
They said they'd meet us downstairs.

713
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:17,923
Okay.

714
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,980
What are you doing?

715
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,191
Do you think we're in Reply 1988?
That's such an old trick.

716
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,277
What about you? Are you in Seoul Claypot?

717
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,361
Jeez.

718
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,989
Should I buy you Bluetooth earphones?

719
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,741
These are more comfortable.
I just need to plug them in.

720
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,452
I don't have to use Bluetooth.

721
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,121
What? You just need to plug them in
to listen to songs? How--

722
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,875
Hey, give them to me. Let me try them.

723
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,668
What? Did that prick get a new car?

724
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,003
Really? Where?

725
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,005
He really did. When did he get a new car?

726
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,053
Hey, hop in.

727
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,806
Oh, my. Showing off your car now?

728
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,393
Hey, he's just too old
to show off things, right?

729
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,437
-Take the passenger seat, Song-hwa.
-Thanks.

730
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,106
-I'm starving. Did you make a reservation?
-Of course.

731
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,609
-Three orders of spicy pork and duck?
-Yes. Let's go.

732
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,578
You want to listen to music?

733
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,289
Yes. We should listen to the song
we'll practice this week.

734
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,417
This car smells nice.
I think it's women's perfume.

735
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,877
He is dating someone.

736
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,504
I'm 100 percent it's hers.

737
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,255
He's been glued to his phone.

738
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,924
No, I'm not.

739
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,676
The fragrance of the perfume

740
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,264
and the scent of nature are mixed
with a ratio of 5.5 and 4.5.

741
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,308
I don't think she's from the city.

742
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,684
She either works outside

743
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,478
or sweats a lot on the job.

744
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,313
-Really?
-She either lives

745
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,564
in Gangwon Province or farms.

746
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,191
Do you have a dog's nose?

747
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,945
I was just making stuff up.
Did you see his face?

748
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,905
One of these must be true.

749
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,157
Song-hwa, should we listen to music?

750
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,743
Yes, I want to listen to music,

751
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,538
but the Bluetooth isn't working.
Have you tried it before?

752
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,498
-Hey, forget about the music.
-Yes, I answer phone calls

753
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,375
-and listen to music!
-Jun-wan, who is she?

754
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,378
-Was it a blind date? An arranged meeting?
-No, I didn't go on a blind date.

755
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,507
It's not working.

756
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,635
Jun-wan, it's not working
because it's connected to your phone.

757
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,303
Jun-wan, do I know her?

758
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,807
Hey, do we know this lady?

759
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,060
My friend, does she work at the hospital
or did we know her from school?

760
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,562
Song-hwa, lower the volume.

761
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,273
No, don't. Can you increase the volume?
Please. I'm begging you.

762
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,733
My gosh. Why isn't this connecting?

763
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:43,986
What?

764
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,903
MY LOVELY BIDULGI

765
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,405
Jun-wan.

766
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,448
Someone saved as Bidulgi is calling you.

767
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,453
Hey, eyes on the road.
Will you kill us all?

768
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,415
Baby... I mean Jeong-won, can you
take out my phone in the bag?

769
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,083
Take it out and decline the call.

770
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,168
I see. Your phone is in your bag, sweetie?

771
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,504
-Sure, sweetie.
-Jeong-won, quickly. Hurry.

772
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,590
No, forget it. Jeong-won, leave it.

773
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,507
Hello.

774
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,509
-Your cell phone.
-Hello. Hi.

775
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,052
Hey, we're here.

776
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,430
-There are a lot of empty parking spots.
-Yes.

777
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,682
Where's your phone, sweetie?

778
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,183
Mom?

779
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,894
I'm out with my friends to have dinner.

780
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,271
Jun-wan has a girlfriend.

781
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,356
Her name is Bigulgi, as in "dove."

782
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,193
-Bi is a unique last name, right?
-Bi as in "Rain"?

783
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:26,903
Okay.

784
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,071
-I found it.
-Give me that.

785
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,325
Hello?

786
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,578
I'm Kim Jun-wan's friend, Lee Ik-jun.

787
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,539
He can't answer the phone right now.

788
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,625
If I may, please tell me your name.

789
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,710
I'll make sure I tell him--

790
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:45,130
I would like to do that,
but he took the phone.

791
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,048
Yes.

792
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,883
Okay. Yes.

793
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,177
I'm starving.
They serve nurungji, too, right?

794
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,387
Yes. They serve nurungji
and perilla seed sujuebi.

795
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,847
Jun-wan, we'll be inside.

796
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,849
It's already getting chilly.

797
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,976
It's pretty chilly at night.

798
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,061
It's autumn now.

799
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,355
This chilly weather
is making me miss my sister.

800
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,440
That never happened to me.

801
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,195
Even so, I think
it's better that you tell her.

802
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,405
Really?

803
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,617
I really can't decide.

804
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,578
Of course, you should tell your mom.
Why are you even thinking about it?

805
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,830
Don't make her feel like a fool.

806
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,707
You should tell her everything
that everyone knows,

807
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,210
so she divorces your dad right away
and lives a better life.

808
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,170
He's worried because of her health.

809
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,297
What if he tells her
and she collapses again

810
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,757
from the shock? What then?

811
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,759
But at the same time,

812
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,261
I think she should know about it.

813
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,477
Are you and Song-hwa possessed
by ghosts who'd starved for years?

814
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,396
I have three older brothers.

815
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,064
I'm really possessed by a ghost.

816
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,233
-Jeong-won, water, please.
-Okay.

817
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,568
Ma'am.

818
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,615
I should tell her, so it gets rid of
the slightest affection she has left.

819
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,493
Well, I don't think there's
any ounce of affection left.

820
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,413
But then,
I thought it would be better to tell her

821
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,415
to get a divorce
since that lady is pregnant,

822
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,542
so that Mom could live freely
without any stress.

823
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,460
But then again,

824
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,088
they are already strangers.

825
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,674
And what if her health gets worse
because of the shock?

826
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,342
I really don't want that.

827
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,261
But wouldn't it better to tell her?

828
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,303
I agree.

829
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,222
What about you?

830
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,850
Tell her or don't?

831
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,935
You should tell her.

832
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,063
What should I do?

833
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,566
-Just tell her.
-Tell her.

834
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,609
Hey, Song-hwa. What do you think?

835
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,487
Well,

836
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,614
I agree. I think you should tell her.

837
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,824
Really?

838
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,994
Yes. I think she should know.

839
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,662
Let her down gently.

840
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,540
Make sure to comfort her
before and after telling the news.

841
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,167
Okay. I'll tell her.

842
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,295
We've been telling you that for ten
minutes. You never take our advice.

843
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,590
If you are going to do this,
you should just ask her for the advice.

844
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,133
Go drink some tea separately.

845
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,885
We're just fillers here.

846
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,720
The owner personally dug up the arrowroot,

847
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,389
and it's on us, too.

848
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,141
Does anyone want it?

849
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,102
Okay. Please wait.

850
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,187
I'll bring it over.

851
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,022
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

852
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,025
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

853
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,236
Hey, you did well.

854
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,031
Your mother is okay, right?

855
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,201
Yes, she took the news
better than I expected.

856
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,536
At first, she was really shocked.

857
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,331
She didn't say a word for ten minutes,
so I was worried.

858
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,584
But I comforted her afterward.
She's divorcing him.

859
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,587
She said she wanted to emigrate
because she's humiliated.

860
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,220
It's all right. You guys managed to get
through such an unpleasant incident.

861
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,389
You weren't in your office,
so I knew you'd be here.

862
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,728
You should have at least dried
your hair. Goodness.

863
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,231
I guess you couldn't wait
to tell Song-hwa.

864
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,152
You haven't seen him yet, right?
But I guess he told you right away.

865
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,821
What are you talking about?

866
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,533
We were just talking about
how he told her about the pregnancy.

867
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,618
Why? Is something going on?

868
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,872
Seok-hyeong's father got admitted
to the hospital last night.

869
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,958
At our hospital. He's in VIP Room Three.

870
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,001
Is he sick?

871
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,837
No, he's faking it.

872
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,259
He kept getting summoned by the court,
so I think he got admitted here.

873
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,135
He didn't request me as his physician.

874
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,097
I think his secretary directly
called the hospital director.

875
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,102
Hey. Visit him later.

876
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,020
I'll go with you later.

877
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,981
It's time to meet the outpatients.

878
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,822
Jun-wan. Do not treat Chairman Yang.

879
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:40,949
Okay?

880
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,410
Yes.

881
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,416
She took the morning medication

882
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,668
because Nurse Song
literally begged her to take it.

883
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,420
But I don't know
if she'll take it tonight.

884
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,505
Judging from this morning,
I doubt that she will.

885
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,383
I get that she hates her husband,
but if her health deteriorates,

886
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,384
it's her loss.

887
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,636
I can somewhat understand her.

888
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,514
It doesn't matter if her husband donated
his liver. He cheated on her.

889
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,975
Would you want to live
with the liver of a cheating husband?

890
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,353
She probably hates her husband
and her new liver. I'd hate everything.

891
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,939
Even so, she has to take her medication.

892
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,900
Did you sleep well?

893
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,485
Yes, I slept well. It's been a while
since I had good sleep.

894
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,613
I'm glad to hear that.
You must exercise a lot.

895
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,573
Try to walk the hallways whenever you can.

896
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,825
Yes. I went back and forth
ten times yesterday.

897
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,453
I think I can even participate
in the Olympics.

898
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,248
Doctor, are you married?

899
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:31,666
Pardon?

900
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,044
Why do you ask?
Are you going to set him up?

901
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,421
Yes, I have a younger sister.

902
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,340
I want to set you up with my sister.

903
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,467
My goodness. Oh, my.

904
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,886
I'm married. And I have a son, too.

905
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,223
I should've known. Women wouldn't
have let a fine man like you alone.

906
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,850
No, I married late.

907
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,727
I wonder what lucky woman married you.

908
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,103
It's a pity you are married.

909
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,357
Seriously, you're my type.

910
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,192
My gosh.

911
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,987
Goodness, you're flattering me.
Your husband is here.

912
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,865
I mean, look at you, Doctor.
You're handsome.

913
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,326
And I bet you got good grades.

914
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,828
You're so amiable and great at your job.

915
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,082
You're totally my type. My gosh.

916
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,709
But my husband is a slug.

917
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,754
But he has such a likable face
and a good build.

918
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,923
He does, doesn't he?

919
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,132
He runs a jewelry shop.

920
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,760
He has a shop in Ssangmun-dong.
It's called Phoenix Shop.

921
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:24,844
I see.

922
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,058
I picked it up on my way here.

923
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,728
My gosh, no. I should get going.

924
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,564
Doctor, it's coming
from the bottom of my heart.

925
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,818
I want to give you everything I have.
I am so grateful for your help.

926
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,653
My son won this at a contest.

927
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,780
No, I can't accept this.
If I do, I'll be in trouble.

928
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,824
-I'm serious.
-Doctor, it's from my heart.

929
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,326
You saved my wife.
I am so thankful for it.

930
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,036
-Please accept this.
-Wait.

931
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,329
I'll be back later.

932
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,164
-Bye.
-Doctor.

933
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,749
-What?
-Rest up, ma'am.

934
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,710
I guess doctors can't accept
gifts these days.

935
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,004
How is the baby?
The baby is active, right?

936
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,923
-Yes.
-It's been 24 weeks now.

937
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:06,511
All right. The black part on the scan
is the amniotic fluid.

938
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,346
When you look at the scan...

939
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,185
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

940
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,566
Hello. What is this about?

941
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,195
I had a bad feeling about it in case--

942
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,656
Okay. I got it.

943
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:33,997
I'm sorry.

944
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,024
I guess they don't use that
anymore these days.

945
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,744
Hello, Ms. Sin.

946
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,455
Hello.

947
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,790
Did you eat?

948
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,458
She ate very little.

949
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,834
Why?

950
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,628
You should eat a lot.

951
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,588
Hospital meals are expensive.

952
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,257
You should eat a lot.
That's a waste of money if you don't.

953
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:27,926
Doctor,

954
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,179
I'm sure you heard about my situation.

955
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,556
That my husband cheated on me.

956
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,726
Yes.

957
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,272
Because he's having an affair
with another woman,

958
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,818
he felt guilty, so that's why
he gave me a piece of his liver.

959
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,278
To feel better about himself.

960
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,614
I'm sure that's not true.

961
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:53,868
Your husband took very good care of you
when you got the transplant surgery.

962
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,872
He held my hand and cried a lot at night.

963
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,959
You're very naive.

964
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,798
It sounds like you lived a good life
without undergoing any hardships.

965
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,717
How do you feel today?

966
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,930
Luckily, the CT scan shows
the biliary duct isn't stretched.

967
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,349
You didn't take any immunosuppressants,

968
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,810
so your body had
acute transplantation rejection.

969
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,770
We'll treat it
with a high dose of steroids.

970
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,981
And once you start taking
immunosuppressants,

971
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,316
you'll recover, so don't worry.

972
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,153
I'm not worried, Doctor.

973
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,323
I don't want

974
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,161
to live with his liver.

975
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,831
Goodness.

976
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:45,920
I had no idea that my husband was
cheating on me with a younger woman.

977
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,089
I even made a deep bow to him.

978
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,259
Gosh.

979
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,929
Doctor, he gave me a piece of his liver,

980
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,183
so he wouldn't feel guilty
about the affair.

981
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,768
He was just sorry.

982
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,564
I'm sure that's not true.
Your husband can't be that evil.

983
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,904
Doctor, everything in this world seems
beautiful and kind to you, right?

984
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:17,368
People who were raised by rich parents
and had a good education

985
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,245
will never understand me.

986
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,664
I don't need you to understand me.

987
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,625
And what's the point if you do?

988
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,962
-Help me go to the restroom.
-Okay.

989
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,725
WOMEN'S TOILET

990
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,817
Excuse me.

991
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,319
Yes?

992
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,287
-This is good.
-Yes.

993
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,836
Are there reporters outside?

994
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,921
No.

995
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,716
Mr. Jeong,

996
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,680
if there's a nurse outside, ask her
to give me an IV drip or something.

997
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,640
It can be a vitamin IV drip
or just saline.

998
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,767
People could barge in here
out of the blue.

999
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:29,274
This person here
told me not to let anyone inside.

1000
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,151
I even got permission
from the hospital director--

1001
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,319
Hey.

1002
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,743
So this is how he addresses me.

1003
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,161
My name

1004
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,455
is this person.

1005
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,085
You really can't address me properly?

1006
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,089
Why don't you call me
by my name, Tae-yeon?

1007
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,383
I'll be outside.

1008
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,011
And I'll tell the nurse
that you want an IV drip.

1009
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,221
-Okay.
-Unbelievable.

1010
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,807
Is he looking down on me?

1011
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,852
I'll talk to him.

1012
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,938
He’s new, so he doesn’t know how to act.

1013
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,858
No, it’s because
he knows exactly how to act.

1014
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,109
When he started his job,

1015
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,903
-it was obvious that I'm your wife.
-Yes.

1016
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,282
But from the first day he started,
he's been looking at me suspiciously.

1017
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:24,495
"I see. You're the mistress
people talked about."

1018
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,249
That's what he was saying with his eyes.

1019
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,502
You can come back later.

1020
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,676
What are you--

1021
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,262
You crazy bitch!

1022
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,597
I should ask you that.

1023
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,098
Are you out of your mind?

1024
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,225
How dare you come here?

1025
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,853
How dare you come to the hospital
your son works?

1026
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,855
Aren't you even embarrassed?

1027
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,065
Or humiliated?

1028
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,151
Did you come to the hospital
your son works with your mistress

1029
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,487
to show people
that you're living such a wonderful life?

1030
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,697
-Hey!
-You be quiet.

1031
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,740
Shut up.

1032
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,076
Leave now.

1033
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,995
Stop humiliating my son.

1034
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,331
Leave the hospital now, you asshole!

1035
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,041
Mom, let's go.

1036
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,709
Why did you come here?

1037
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,002
Let's just go. Please?

1038
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,921
Let go. Let go of me.

1039
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,009
You want me to divorce you? Never.

1040
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,720
Taking care of my health is hard enough,

1041
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,224
so up until yesterday,
I was going to divorce you.

1042
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,435
But I'm disgusted by your behaviors,

1043
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,396
so I will never divorce you.

1044
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,565
Before you or I die,

1045
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,025
I will not divorce you.

1046
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,197
You, quit dreaming. You will be
his cohabitant for the rest of his life.

1047
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,907
And so will be your child.

1048
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,325
Gosh.

1049
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,378
Cottonoid.

1050
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,270
Doctor, let's wake up the patient.

1051
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,813
Okay.

1052
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,616
ELAPSED TIME

1053
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,705
Can you lift your arm?

1054
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,752
Good job. All right. Squeeze my hand.

1055
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,630
He squeezed my hand.

1056
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,010
His facial muscles moved.

1057
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,187
Let's do a language test now.

1058
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,146
Okay.

1059
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,149
How are you holding up? Are you all right?

1060
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,110
Yes. I'm okay.

1061
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,821
Where do you live, Hyeon-su?

1062
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,579
Sadang-dong, Dongjak-gu.

1063
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,623
Do you have any siblings?

1064
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,919
I have a younger sister.

1065
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,921
You're doing great.

1066
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,508
What do you do? What's your job?

1067
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,177
Well...

1068
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,678
What do you do?

1069
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,305
I...

1070
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,358
Keep talking to him.

1071
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,444
Hyeon-su, aren't you a police officer?

1072
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,199
-Yes.
-Why did you want to be a police officer?

1073
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,786
It had been my dream

1074
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,414
ever since I was seven years old.

1075
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:57,667
But

1076
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,878
I can't be one anymore

1077
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,589
because I had this surgery.

1078
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:09,011
Hyeon-su, it's almost over.
I'll wrap it up quickly.

1079
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,055
Can you say a few more things?

1080
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,182
You can go back to work.

1081
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,560
Or you can take up another job.
It's not too late.

1082
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,396
I'm too old

1083
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,439
to get another job.

1084
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,571
When I was 29 years old,

1085
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,531
I also got sick.

1086
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,579
I suddenly got sick when I was 29,

1087
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,955
so I left the military.

1088
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,500
What was it?

1089
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,503
What was your illness?

1090
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:46,716
The ligament in the cervical spine
stiffened like a bone.

1091
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,886
It was paralyzed during my training.

1092
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,346
What did you do?

1093
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,140
What do you think?

1094
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,684
I'm living a great life now.

1095
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,521
Right.

1096
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,233
You became a doctor.

1097
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,862
You can do it, too, Hyeon-su.

1098
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:21,042
Hyeon-su,
once you recover from the surgery,

1099
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,171
you'll be able to start anything you want.

1100
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:27,798
Okay.

1101
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,508
Thank you.

1102
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:34,472
Chi-hong, I wanted the patient to talk.

1103
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,724
You went on about yourself.

1104
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,101
I'm sorry.

1105
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,187
Hyeon-su.

1106
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,607
Good job. It's done.

1107
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:47,318
I'll remove the tumor as safely as I can.

1108
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:50,529
Don't worry too much. And get some sleep.

1109
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,074
Okay. Thank you.

1110
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,159
Good job.

1111
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,037
Doctor.

1112
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,121
Yes?

1113
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,751
Good luck.

1114
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,137
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1115
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,306
Daddy will be a little late tonight.

1116
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,226
Dad, I baked cookies today.

1117
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,144
Really? How many did you bake?

1118
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,897
Three. But I ate two of the cookies.

1119
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,941
And I'll give one to Mo-ne.

1120
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:31,737
My gosh, Mo-ne will be over the moon!
Goodness.

1121
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,031
U-ju, make sure to brush your teeth.

1122
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:37,076
And I'll see you in your dream. Goodnight.

1123
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,452
Night.

1124
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,662
Okay.

1125
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,501
I see.

1126
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,254
Yes. Right.

1127
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,840
Yes, it went well.

1128
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,675
Yes.

1129
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,181
-My gosh, okay.
-Hello.

1130
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:02,852
Hello.

1131
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,731
Where's your caregiver?

1132
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,984
My children stayed with me today.

1133
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:12,069
She went out to see them off.

1134
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,159
You didn't take your medication yet.

1135
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,384
Ms. Sin.

1136
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:40,139
Your husband made a huge decision
by donating a piece of his liver.

1137
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:48,272
It doesn't matter when he had the affair
and why he decided to donate the liver.

1138
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,485
What he did was incredible.

1139
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,196
He risked his life to donate
a piece of his liver to you.

1140
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,202
You should just

1141
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:06,248
let your husband live his life
without you.

1142
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,798
You should live your own life now.

1143
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,638
I got divorced
because my wife cheated on me.

1144
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,727
I worked at the hospital all day,

1145
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,605
and looked after my son alone.
I really lived hard, but...

1146
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,902
She had an affair
with her friend's husband.

1147
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,321
At first,

1148
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,824
it hurt my pride.

1149
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,076
And

1150
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,705
I was embarrassed to face other people.

1151
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:50,376
I wondered why my life was getting
so difficult. It was really tough.

1152
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,212
But all of a sudden, one day,

1153
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,302
I realized how much time I was wasting.

1154
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,227
Wasting my life away like this

1155
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:12,815
because of what she did to me
was doing a disservice to myself.

1156
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:27,121
My goodness.
You spent a long time being sick.

1157
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,165
It was so hard to get your health back.

1158
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,585
For the sake of you, not your husband,
please take the medication.

1159
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,337
Give it your all

1160
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,507
to make a full recovery.

1161
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,680
It's your life, after all. Right?

1162
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,568
Excuse me.

1163
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,947
Can you bring me a cup of water?

1164
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,044
Thank you.

1165
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,338
Thank you.

1166
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,915
Who is it?

1167
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,250
It's Chi-hong.

1168
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,918
Come in.

1169
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,424
You knew? When?

1170
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,469
Let's see.

1171
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,098
The day when you bombed the EVD.

1172
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,891
That's when I found out.

1173
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,937
I checked your record.

1174
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,399
You got discharged as a captain
due to OPLL.

1175
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,484
I saw it in your record,
so I went digging.

1176
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,613
You don't have any problems
to live a normal life.

1177
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,325
It's a treatable condition with medication
or exercise when caught early in life.

1178
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,287
However, that doesn't apply
to sports or careers

1179
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,081
that require you
to move your body rigorously.

1180
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,086
If you hurt your neck,
it may lead to tetraplegia.

1181
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,339
I really didn't have any problems
with my condition so far.

1182
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,177
Perhaps, it was because
I was very nervous that day.

1183
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:50,556
During the surgery, my legs went numb.

1184
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,392
And I had a tingling sensation
in my neck, too.

1185
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,439
Feeling that pain all over again
after several years

1186
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,524
drove me crazy.

1187
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:02,234
Why didn't you tell me?

1188
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,444
It's not a serious condition.

1189
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,279
I was going to tell you,

1190
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,740
but I never had the right timing.

1191
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,201
Also, it hurt my pride a bit

1192
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,746
because everyone was so curious about it.

1193
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,957
Where does that pride come from?

1194
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,835
That's some pride you have.

1195
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,670
Should I tell you my medical conditions?

1196
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,258
Professor Chae.

1197
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,220
Why didn't you say anything
on the day of the surgery?

1198
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,973
I told you I found out after the surgery.

1199
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:34,433
I mean, I messed up a lot.

1200
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,227
But you didn't say anything in the OR.

1201
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,188
You didn't scold me either.

1202
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,650
I have faith in you.

1203
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,031
You are always diligent.

1204
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,492
And you study and read up
on the patients a lot.

1205
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:52,659
So I couldn't understand it.

1206
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,704
And I thought
there must have been a reason for it.

1207
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:58,624
So I decided to scold you later

1208
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,918
and look into this first.

1209
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,255
Why? Are you disappointed
that I didn't scold you?

1210
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,215
No.

1211
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,178
If you

1212
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,139
scolded me that day,

1213
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,682
I wouldn't have been here today.

1214
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,607
You should have bought me
some drinks, then.

1215
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,859
I was going to.

1216
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:31,657
When I went to the office to take you out,
you had already left to get drinks.

1217
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,702
Oh, right. Darn it.

1218
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:37,913
I'm sorry.

1219
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,540
I know that drinking with your colleagues

1220
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:42,000
is more comfortable than with me.

1221
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,045
Anyway,
we'll settle that I bought you drinks.

1222
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:47,965
Okay.

1223
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,594
I'm dying for a drink, but I happen
to be working the night shift today.

1224
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,561
Seon-bin took your shift.

1225
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,021
She'll be on call tonight for you.

1226
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:08,861
She said you shouldn't think
about anything else

1227
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,155
and should just go drink a lot tonight.

1228
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,951
My goodness.

1229
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,705
And she told you
not to get the wrong idea.

1230
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,291
She said she doesn't have
feelings for you.

1231
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,586
What are you doing?

1232
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,796
Go change now.

1233
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,175
Okay.

1234
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,391
Yes, I'm heading out, too.

1235
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,893
Okay.

1236
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,445
Is it an emergency patient?

1237
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,071
Let's go. We'll talk on our way.

1238
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:56,492
No, Professor Ahn.
We don't have a patient.

1239
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,789
Buy me dinner, please.

1240
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:11,048
Buy me dinner this weekend, Professor Ahn.

1241
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,637
Sure. Let's have a get-together
with everyone.

1242
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,013
Just the two of us.

1243
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,352
Just the two of us, outside the hospital

1244
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,729
and not in these scrubs,
but in our personal clothes.

1245
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:17,739
You were always

1246
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,290
You were always

1247
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:01,783
My longing for you

1248
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,954
Gets bigger every single day

1249
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:11,001
The pain of not seeing you always
Leaves me with fresh wounds

1250
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:14,087
But you're going your way

1251
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,799
If you want, I can wait for you

1252
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,176
Thank you.

1253
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,888
I haven't changed at all

1254
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:27,893
It was you who had changed

1255
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,103
So you can

1256
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,481
-Come back to me
-Thank you.

1257
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:40,155
If you're blaming me for my mistake

1258
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,785
You can still blame me after you come back

1259
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:51,541
We still have time for that

1260
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:57,089
I will be the same guy

1261
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,009
That you left

1262
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:05,764
I don't want to comfort myself

1263
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,684
With false hope anymore

1264
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:14,147
For the first time, I learned
What it means to be in love

1265
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,984
I'm going to get you back

1266
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:22,572
I just realized that the purpose

1267
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:27,953
Of my life had been you all along

1268
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,753
TRY THIS COOKIE, DAD!

1269
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:45,178
If you want, I can wait for you

1270
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:49,099
I haven't changed at all

1271
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:54,104
It was you who had changed

1272
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:58,692
So you can come back to me

1273
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:06,241
If you're blaming me for my mistake

1274
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:11,037
You can still blame me after you come back

1275
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:17,878
We still have time for that

1276
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:23,508
I will be the same guy

1277
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:27,345
That you left

1278
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:32,017
I don't want to comfort myself

1279
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,936
With false hope anymore

1280
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:40,400
For the first time, I learned
What it means to be in love

1281
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:44,154
I'm going to get you back

1282
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:48,825
I just realized that the purpose

1283
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:55,207
Of my life had been you all along

1284
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,104
-Hello.
-Hi.

1285
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:02,607
Where are you going?

1286
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,734
On a date with my wife.

1287
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:07,946
Didn't you say
you've been married for over ten years?

1288
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,781
Yes, this year is our tenth year together.

1289
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,994
We got a rent-free apartment
with just our deposit on our tenth year.

1290
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:16,705
We made reservations
to take our parents on a trip.

1291
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,377
People might think I beat you up
or something.

1292
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,004
I won't kill you.

1293
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:30,051
You can kill me with your words alone.

1294
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,732
I'll be out for a while.

1295
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,027
What? This wasn't going up?

1296
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,864
I will help you go up.

1297
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,325
Bye.

1298
01:21:58,872 --> 01:21:59,873
You're here.

1299
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,501
-Hello?
-Hi, this is your landlady.

1300
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,670
Hello. Have you been well?

1301
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:09,799
Yes. I just wanted to remind you that
you forgot to wire the rent this month.

1302
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,510
-Pardon?
-Your monthly rent.

1303
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,803
You forgot to wire me the rent.

1304
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,765
My gosh, what are you talking about?
I signed a deposit-based apartment.

1305
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,558
A 2-year contract and 200-million-won...

1306
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,062
I don't follow.

1307
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:23,355
Deposit-based apartment?

1308
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,024
You signed a contract with monthly rents.

1309
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,652
The deposit was 20 million won,
and the rent was 900,000 won.

1310
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:30,403
What...

1311
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:34,157
What are you talking about?

1312
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:15,365
My son is sensitive and delicate.

1313
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,242
It'd be nice
if he has a reliable life partner.

1314
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,868
Jeong-won, you can tell her now.

1315
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,663
I think it will be around the end
of December. Will that work?

1316
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,873
My goodness, what's wrong with Jeong-won?

1317
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,000
What are you doing? Focus.

1318
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,543
I'm bad at my job because I'm dumb.

1319
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:27,669
There's nothing I can do.

1320
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,671
-Dr. Chu.
-My professor

1321
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:31,381
is the biggest slug ever.

1322
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:32,966
Will you kill both the mother
and the baby?

1323
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,635
I'll go tell the slug tomorrow morning.

1324
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,178
I'll put an end to this.

1325
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,889
Have you gone mad? Why are you quitting?
I won't let you quit.

1326
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,642
I think I'm messing up my life.

1327
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:43,893
My existence is harming others.

1328
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,604
I barely managed to stop him
from talking to the TV station.

1329
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,064
Professor, I need to talk to you.

1330
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,525
-Min-ha isn't here yet?
-Did the resident who went MIA come back?

1331
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,444
MIA since yesterday morning,
no word for two days.

1332
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:53,778
Be nice to the resident.

1333
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,321
It must've been hard on the resident.

1334
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,116
I'll come back later.

1335
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,869
Song-hwa is beautiful and smart.

1336
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:02,787
-What about Jun-wan?
-He has plans.

1337
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,789
You're going crazy about this girl.

1338
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,459
Who are you dating? I'd love to meet her.

1339
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,626
So, she is your girlfriend.

1340
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,378
I'll tell you everything another time.

1341
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,673
Even I felt the warm fuzzies.
