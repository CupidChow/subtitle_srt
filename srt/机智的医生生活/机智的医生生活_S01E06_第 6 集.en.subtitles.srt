1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,399
Hey, Parking Master!

2
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,613
Well... Can you park my bike for me?

3
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,657
Me? "Parking Master"?

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,910
Why did you turn around, then?
Come on. Take this.

5
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,829
Hey, get me some coffee!

6
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,998
I'll meet you in the lobby!

7
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,689
Hello, Professor. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,901
Don't be. I'm sorry for waking you up.

9
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,278
You have some time before the rounds.

10
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,155
-Get some more sleep.
-No, it's okay.

11
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,498
There you are.

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,416
Is this mine?

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,503
When did you get changed?

14
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,757
Hey, I can't come out to the lobby
dressed like that.

15
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,468
I also have to do my rounds,
so I went and took care of business

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,887
and got changed as fast as I could.

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,806
Is that so?

18
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,141
What you're thinking did not happen.

19
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,852
My anal sphincter is still strong.
Goodness.

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,354
What's this guy doing?

21
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,648
He's fast asleep.

22
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,108
Right, I'm exhausted every morning too.

23
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,194
Jeez, you scared me.

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,456
It's time you said goodbye to this world.

25
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,961
Leave everything you have behind

26
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,004
and come with me.

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,006
Now?

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,468
But I still have a lot to do.

29
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,263
Hey, wake up.

30
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,306
Dr. Yong, you're still alive.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,183
-Hey, stop it.
-Seriously?

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,018
What the...

33
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,272
Dr. Yong, you must be really tired.

34
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,983
Have you taken a vacation yet?
You need some rest.

35
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,235
No, not yet.

36
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,030
-But I'm taking some time off next month.
-Good.

37
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,161
Professor Chae said we should all
take a vacation for a week,

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,706
so all the residents will take turns
and go on vacation.

39
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,209
If I could,
I'd love to take a week off as well.

40
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,422
If you had to take a year off
and not work, what would you do?

41
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,300
-Me?
-She'll probably want to study.

42
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,634
No.

43
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,014
I'd move to a place like Gangneung,
Sokcho, or Tongyeong.

44
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,600
I'd love to live somewhere like that
just for a year.

45
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,479
I want to live in a place that's not
too big or too small just for a year.

46
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,772
I'll work at a hospital there.

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,108
The question was,
"What would you do if you didn't work?"

48
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,860
It'd be more boring
if I don't work at all.

49
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,739
No, it wouldn't be boring.
There are so many things you can do.

50
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,782
-Okay, you can play all you want.
-I will!

51
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,411
Anyway, I'd prefer to work
at a small hospital

52
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,704
over a big hospital like this,

53
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,915
so I can give each patient
undivided attention.

54
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,960
There was an MBC documentary
called Success Tale.

55
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,337
Gosh, stop it.

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,089
If that show was still running,

57
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,216
they'd produce
a three-episode special feature on her.

58
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:42,430
In my free time, I'll go hiking,
go to the beach, and do fun things.

59
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,683
Hospitals in small towns are even busier.
"Free time"? Gosh, I doubt it.

60
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,019
What about you, Professor Lee?
What would you do?

61
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,187
Me?

62
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,149
I've never thought about it.

63
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,485
Should I assume I have a kid?

64
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,111
No, let’s say you’re single.

65
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,240
Clubbing! I'd go clubbing, of course.

66
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,826
I'll go to a club and dance all night.

67
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,331
I'll make sure my feet don't touch
the ground for over a second at a time.

68
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,124
-Like this.
-What about during the day?

69
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,585
I'll go shopping.

70
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,423
You see, I'm a city guy.
I love Seoul so much.

71
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,635
Seeing the stars and the moon
in the countryside isn't my thing.

72
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,930
The flashing neon signs in the city

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,976
Those things... How should I put this?
They heal my mind.

74
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,727
Aren't you taking flower photos recently?

75
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,521
There are flowers at shopping malls.

76
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,691
The apartment complexes
are surrounded by flowers.

77
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,821
I'd go to the flower shop
by the food court at the department store

78
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,324
and take pictures
of the neatly arranged flowers there.

79
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,993
Let's go. It's time for our rounds.

80
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,578
Come on. I have to do my rounds too.

81
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,873
The glamorous city

82
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,083
Gosh, be quiet.

83
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,186
I'll give you my answer
within the next 72 hours.

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,069
Is this some kind of a military
operation? You can take your time.

85
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,534
Then give me about a week.

86
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,663
All right. Don't skip meals.

87
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,210
Of course!
I eat two bowls of rice for every meal.

88
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm sorry, Mom.
The baby's condition suddenly worsened.

89
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,549
I have to go to the PICU now.

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,761
You can go and get
the health checkup done by yourself.

91
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,308
Mom, the gastroscopy
will be done last anyway.

92
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,269
I should be able to make it there by then.

93
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,357
Of course, I can get it done by myself.
Am I a kid?

94
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,569
But I was told to bring a guardian
for the conscious sedation endoscope.

95
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,613
Gosh, what a nuisance.

96
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,364
So people who are single
and have no friends

97
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,366
can't even get it done or what?

98
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,746
I know that too. That's why I left the car
and took a taxi here. Anyway...

99
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,040
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

100
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,709
Where do I go for a health checkup?

101
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,420
Go to B1 of the next building.

102
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,631
You can either go outside
and find that building

103
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,092
or just head down to B1 from here.
It's all connected.

104
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,177
My gosh, you're so kind.

105
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,054
-Thank you.
-No problem.

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,766
Whatever. I don't need you.

107
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,727
I'll figure out what to do with
this damn endoscopy, so just do your work.

108
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,895
I have to go.

109
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,318
Hey, Jun-wan. Are you seeing someone?

110
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,573
You are. Talk to you later.

111
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,745
That prick, is he a psychic?

112
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,672
This morning, his temperature went up
to 37.8°C, so we gave him a fever reducer.

113
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,132
The fever has gone down.

114
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,678
I saw the chest X-ray you took
this morning.

115
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,557
Your lungs are still tight.
That's probably why you had a fever.

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,934
It's not easy, but you have
to keep doing the ball exercise.

117
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,315
I feel so weak
because all I eat is porridge.

118
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,526
You'll get rice starting tomorrow.

119
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,945
We'll give him normal meals
starting tomorrow.

120
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,029
Okay.

121
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,115
Can I eat meat?

122
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,784
I have a huge craving for bulgogi.

123
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,162
Gosh, even now...

124
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,250
I feel like I can smell bulgogi right now.

125
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,171
The Seoul-style bulgogi, right?

126
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,381
With the sweet marinade.

127
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,551
With a ton of green onions.

128
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,804
Two tablespoons of minced garlic.

129
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,933
A little bit of corn syrup and plenty of
enoki and shiitake mushrooms, right?

130
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,394
I can smell...

131
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,487
Ma'am! You can't give him that.
He's supposed to be fasting now.

132
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,781
Gosh, please. My goodness.

133
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,076
Your surgery is tomorrow.
You really shouldn't be eating this, sir.

134
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,162
Gosh, Doctor.

135
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,292
It's major surgery
where his abdomen will be split open.

136
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,336
He can't go in for the surgery
on an empty stomach.

137
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,423
He needs to eat at least one proper meal

138
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,843
for the surgery to go well. Right, Doctor?

139
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,055
No. That's not how it works, ma'am. Gosh.

140
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,935
Sir, you can eat as much as you want
after the surgery.

141
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,230
If you eat this now,
you'll have to fast one more day.

142
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,190
Just restrain yourself for today,

143
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,652
and you can eat all sorts of yummy foods
until you turn 100. I promise, okay?

144
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,239
-Great. I'll put this in the fridge.
-Gosh, all right.

145
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,659
Thank goodness you caught that,
Professor Lee.

146
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,619
He's getting his surgery tomorrow.

147
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,872
Doctor, wait! Doctor.

148
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,292
Take this.

149
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,711
My grandson bought it.

150
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,258
My gosh, it's sweet and tasty.
It's so good.

151
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,804
Ma'am, we can't accept things like this.

152
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,389
This could get us in trouble.

153
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,767
Gosh, it's just coffee though.
You really can't accept it?

154
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
You see, I just...

155
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,023
I feel bad
for causing such a nuisance today.

156
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,569
That's very sweet of you.
The gesture is more than enough.

157
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,861
I'll take it.

158
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
Thank you.

159
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,867
My gosh, it looks delicious.

160
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,746
Ma'am, I'll accept it this time,
but don't give me anything from now on.

161
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,083
Sure thing. You won't get anything from me
from now on.

162
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,086
Enjoy the coffee.

163
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,046
-Thank you for this.
-My pleasure.

164
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,384
Ms. Song! Let's go to the VIP ward.

165
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,972
Ms. Song and I will go check up
on Mr. Go Yeong-min in the VIP ward.

166
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,016
Wait.

167
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,767
What?

168
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,398
You can come too.

169
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,192
Let's go.

170
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,780
-Your kid dropped out of school?
-Yes.

171
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,074
The kid really can't stand school.

172
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,994
If the kid doesn't want to go,
you can't really do anything.

173
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,162
I mean, what can you do?

174
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,039
-Eighth grade, right?
-Yes.

175
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,206
Gosh.

176
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,418
I said, "You have
to at least finish middle school."

177
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,545
-But the kid wants to take the GED test.
-What?

178
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,423
The kid will work part-time
and buy a camera and a computer.

179
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,176
And the kid told me
to mind my own business.

180
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,221
Sometimes I feel like my kid is an alien.

181
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,351
Hello. My gosh.

182
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,480
I guess you came here
right after your shoot.

183
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,981
Yes, hello.

184
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,443
I was up all night because of the shoot.
I got here a few hours ago.

185
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,322
I didn't have a chance
to remove my makeup though.

186
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,492
Is your father asleep?

187
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,577
Yes, he just fell asleep.

188
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,580
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

189
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,374
My gosh.

190
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,503
Even for simple surgery,
the next day is always the hardest.

191
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,672
After today, it'll be much easier,

192
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
so please tell him to hang in there.

193
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,301
He actually watched TV with me
until he fell asleep.

194
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,720
He doesn't feel any pain or discomfort.
He feels great.

195
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,394
Well, I should buy you a meal sometime.

196
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,728
Sure.

197
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,272
Then how about lunch today?

198
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,817
Sounds good.

199
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,826
How are the total bilirubin
and LFT levels?

200
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,328
The total bilirubin level is 25,
and LFT is 700 over 400,

201
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,955
but it keeps going up.

202
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,875
-Still no word from the KONOS?
-No.

203
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,048
I don't think she can hold out
for more than a week.

204
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,302
Gosh.

205
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,180
Ji-a's mother is outside, right?

206
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,559
Yes, she is. But she's devastated.

207
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,565
I explained everything to her.
Often, and in detail.

208
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,985
Not like the last time. I wasn't blunt.

209
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,571
Thanks.

210
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,365
I'll tell her

211
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,285
that Ji-a might have a hard time.

212
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,659
You're a big eater now.

213
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,123
Back then,
I only ate one meal every two days.

214
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,417
-It must've been tough for you.
-Yes.

215
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,628
Sorry.

216
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,259
Well, is that why you broke up with me?

217
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,638
Me? I didn't say I want
to break up with you.

218
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,306
-Did I say it first?
-Yes.

219
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,227
You said you were stressed and tired.
You wanted a break.

220
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,937
Then you were off the grid.

221
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,608
I did. But when I called you
after a little while,

222
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,610
you ignored my calls.

223
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,696
-I called you about 30 times.
-No, you called 29 times.

224
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,741
Good for you. You have a good memory.

225
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,076
I totally made that up.

226
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,456
-Hello, I'm a fan of yours.
-Oh...

227
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,043
-Hello, enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

228
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,384
Are you uncomfortable here?
We should've eaten out.

229
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,595
Yes, I said I'd take you
to a nice restaurant.

230
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,765
Gosh, don't you know about
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act?

231
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,393
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello, Professor Lee.

232
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,983
Aren't you...

233
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,860
Yes. She's the person who you think
she is, but she's eating right now.

234
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,070
Go away, guys.

235
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,239
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

236
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,741
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

237
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,624
Would you like anything else?
This kongguksu is good too.

238
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,295
My, look who's here. I'm a fan of yours.

239
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,798
Gosh, these pricks.
Can you please let her eat--

240
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,467
My gosh.

241
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,136
Hello, sir.

242
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,430
Is everything fine, my good sir?

243
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,391
-He's the chairman of the hospital board.
-Oh, hello.

244
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,810
My gosh, you don't need to get up. Please.

245
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,146
You look much prettier in person.

246
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,064
My goodness.

247
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,482
Are you a doll?

248
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,109
Gosh, no.

249
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
What brings you by?

250
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,072
-Are you not feeling well?
-I'm fine.

251
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,115
I came for a checkup.

252
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,201
-Is she your patient?
-Well...

253
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,413
I performed surgery
on her father yesterday.

254
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,374
Can I take a picture with you?

255
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,627
-Sure.
-Let's take a selfie together.

256
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,962
Sure, I can take it.

257
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,382
Hey, I want to be in the picture too.

258
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,593
All right.

259
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,929
Here we go.

260
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,437
Oh, I was recording a video.
Sorry about that.

261
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,441
-Shall I take a picture of all of you?
-No, it's okay. I got this.

262
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,486
All right, let's try it again.
Look at the camera.

263
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,493
-What are you doing?
-Here. Let's do this.

264
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,332
-Hey.
-This is...

265
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,043
Hey, you take it. Goodness.

266
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,670
-All right, then.
-Okay, guys.

267
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,217
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

268
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,390
You're too stubborn.

269
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,226
That was embarrassing,
in front of all those people.

270
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,311
What was I supposed to do?
I can't see very well.

271
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,730
Hand me your car keys.
I'll drive you home.

272
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,732
People become more stubborn as they age.

273
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,985
-No wonder youngsters don't like you.
-Come on now.

274
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,862
I'm still young at heart.

275
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,698
Age is nothing but a number.

276
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,118
You need to be youthful physically.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

277
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,661
Jeez, give me that.

278
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,580
Maybe the battery is dead.

279
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,002
Are you sure it's on this floor?

280
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,837
I always park here...

281
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,559
I told you.
How you feel doesn't matter at all.

282
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,647
Let's move into a nursing home, Jong-su.

283
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,108
Do you know of a good one?
Frankly, I'd like that.

284
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,402
But first, let's find your car.
Give me that.

285
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,030
I took a taxi here today.

286
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,250
-Goodness.
-I took a taxi.

287
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,921
-Oh, dear.
-You think it's funny?

288
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,050
Yes, I have to laugh.

289
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,428
Goodness. You're too much.

290
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,806
Gosh. I get that you were
all over the place today, but how...

291
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,434
-Oh, boy.
-I took a taxi here.

292
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,654
MOM

293
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,500
Hi, Son. Did you have lunch?

294
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,211
No, not yet. I'm going to have lunch now.

295
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,881
What's with your voice, Mom?
Do you have a cold?

296
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,051
They say even dogs don't catch a cold
in the middle of summer,

297
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,179
yet I caught a cold. Poor me.

298
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,099
I'm okay though. I took some medicine.

299
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,184
What is it? Did something happen?

300
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,019
Oh... No.

301
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,106
I'll go to Aunt's place after work.

302
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
Yes.

303
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,069
I'll head over there now
and eat something.

304
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,654
I'll see you later.

305
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,912
When did you get here?

306
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,293
What's wrong?
Is your patient not doing well?

307
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,796
It's a six-month-old baby.

308
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,049
We performed the Kasai procedure
three months ago for her biliary atresia.

309
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,676
And?

310
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,929
Her condition seemed to be improving
after the surgery,

311
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,265
but her hepatocirrhosis
is quite serious now.

312
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,935
A liver transplant
would be the only solution.

313
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,564
But her mom's blood type isn't compatible,
and her dad has hepatitis B.

314
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,817
Have you registered her yet?

315
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,111
It won't be easy to find a donor
as she's a baby.

316
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,447
Yes, I already did.
But I haven't heard from them yet.

317
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,869
She's an infant, so a brain-dead donor
must be under the age of 40.

318
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,662
And the liver can't be too large.

319
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,498
It's honestly so difficult.

320
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,546
Her parents seem exhausted.

321
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,464
I think they've almost given up.

322
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,635
I can't give up though.

323
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,970
Oh, boy.

324
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,890
But you should try everything you can do.

325
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,310
Let's go.

326
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,355
-Let's go eat something.
-I don't have an appetite.

327
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,199
What? A hinoki bathtub?
Why do you need it?

328
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,411
Seong-beom who lives next door
got one for his mom?

329
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,872
What? Thirty million won?

330
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,127
Mom, your son is not rich.
I live paycheck to paycheck.

331
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,754
Gosh, seriously!

332
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,924
I already spoke to my friend
who's an ENT doctor.

333
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,301
Come to the hospital next week.
I'll go with you.

334
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,263
You need to get good-quality hearing aids
that fit well.

335
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,100
Gosh, I chose a cheap one.

336
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,645
Yes, seriously. It was very cheap.

337
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,607
Okay.

338
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,609
Jeong-yeon changed what?

339
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,153
She changed her name? To what?

340
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,531
Mom.

341
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,534
If she's still only getting minor roles
after 15 years,

342
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,078
it means she doesn't have talent.

343
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,623
Tell her to quit and learn
a practical skill or prepare for an exam.

344
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,167
I'll talk to her.

345
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,336
Okay, I'll call her.

346
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,964
-Jeong-yeon changed her name?
-Yes.

347
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,508
She's Yeon-jeong now.

348
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,261
-That's a pretty name.
-Pretty, my ass.

349
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,180
What a joke.
It sounds like a Chinese restaurant.

350
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,098
My gosh.

351
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,059
-She's so immature.
-You ordered eggs, right?

352
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,147
Your eggs are here. They're fresh and big.

353
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,566
You haven't eaten yet, right? I knew it.

354
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,360
Here, the lady at the cafeteria
gave me this.

355
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,320
-They're boiled eggs, right?
-Obviously.

356
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,907
Professor Chae, the flash drive. Hello.

357
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,076
-Yes, I'll take it.
-Here you go.

358
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,662
My brother, good to see you.

359
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,414
A younger sister's husband
is a brother-in-law.

360
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,124
Gosh, no.

361
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,167
Brother-in-law, have a seat here.

362
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,003
Are you busy? Sit down for a minute.

363
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,672
-I can't. I have to do something.
-Song-hwa.

364
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,675
Is he that busy?
Are you making him work like a dog?

365
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,012
Join us and have some food.

366
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,933
Yes, have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

367
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,934
Okay.

368
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,232
Well...

369
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,776
You know that you're the first, right?

370
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,738
-What do you mean?
-I'm talking about Ik-sun.

371
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,657
She's actually quite popular.

372
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,410
When you meet her,

373
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,537
you realize that she's funnier
than you thought.

374
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,623
Yes, you're right. She's really funny.

375
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,334
I know that very well.

376
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,836
Especially, the pigeon...

377
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,963
Right, the pigeon.

378
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
You must've seen it many times.
I taught her that.

379
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,052
You see, I...

380
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,512
This is what I do. The pigeon...

381
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,766
It flies like this.

382
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,730
Then it comes back like this.

383
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,857
I've been seeing that for 20 years.

384
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,068
-Gosh, I'm sick of it.
-I've seen his and his sister's.

385
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,904
That's why she's had so many guys
confess their feelings to her.

386
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,156
I'm telling you. Ik-sun has had

387
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,159
countless guys chase her.

388
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,829
Yes, Ik-sun is popular
in the unit as well.

389
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,747
Right?

390
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,750
She's used to having guys
confess their feelings to her.

391
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,504
This is my first time seeing her
being so obvious about liking a guy.

392
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,589
Me?

393
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,801
Gosh, it's not me.
We don't have that kind of relationship.

394
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,054
Seriously, we're just close friends.
She's my best friend.

395
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,640
-Really.
-That's how it begins, you know.

396
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,893
Soon, you guys will call each other
"babe" or "honey."

397
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,562
Professor Lee, we're really just friends.

398
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,064
You see, my sister...

399
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,111
She's so used to receiving love.

400
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,655
She's never liked a guy first.

401
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,366
Even if she had a crush on someone,
she never showed it.

402
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,034
But I think

403
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,496
my sister likes you.

404
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,999
Dr. Ahn.

405
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,378
I hope

406
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,215
you'll accept my sister's love.

407
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,058
Are you all right? That must've hurt.

408
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,647
-Why did you hit me? What the hell?
-Hey.

409
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,107
-Why--
-You prick.

410
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,233
-Hey, guys.
-What? Why?

411
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,442
-I didn't do anything.
-Stop.

412
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,278
-Who do you think you are?
-How embarrassing.

413
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,613
-What's your problem?
-Guys, enough!

414
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,532
Hey, what the hell?

415
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,284
I brought those eggs.

416
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,910
-How dare you smack my head--
-Seriously!

417
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,842
I thought
you guys were seven-year-old boys.

418
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,678
Why did you use his head to crack the egg?

419
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,555
Because Ik-jun kept talking nonsense.

420
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,307
Why is that nonsense?

421
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,768
I've never seen a guy
who knows so much about his sister.

422
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,438
He was talking about himself,
not his sister.

423
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,398
That's how he's always been.

424
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,276
Have you ever seen Ik-jun
fall for a girl first?

425
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,945
He married Hye-jeong
because she chased him for months.

426
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,073
He and his sister
are driving me nuts these days.

427
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,701
I'm leaving.

428
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,370
You won't stay for coffee?

429
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,372
I have to go see Mr. Instinct.

430
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,792
I have a gift for him.

431
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,545
Bye.

432
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,886
Have you seen Mr. Instinct?

433
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,387
"Mr. Instinct"?

434
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,932
Dr. Do stepped out to get coffee.

435
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,433
-Should I call him?
-No, no need.

436
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,770
He's never around
when I'm trying to be nice.

437
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,230
Why, Professor?

438
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,316
I was going to ask him
to take care of an ASD next week.

439
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,152
-Shall I call him?
-No, I can call him.

440
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,780
I was going to tell him nonchalantly
and surprise him.

441
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,075
I heard he comes here often,
so I came to find him.

442
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,328
Too bad. I suppose this is his fate.

443
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,622
Take it easy, guys.

444
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,342
What brings you here?

445
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,761
Is this Dr. Bong's salon,
where I can find out

446
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,138
everything about the professors
from their first love

447
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,182
to their health problems?

448
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,434
That's correct.
About Professor Kim Jun-wan?

449
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,394
Correct.

450
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,230
I love Professor Kim very much.

451
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,190
I want to know more about him.
What should I do?

452
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,234
Gosh, I'm so curious.

453
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,780
Dr. Ahn, I'm really jealous.

454
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,366
Professor Chae is like Mother Teresa.

455
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,450
Yes, she's great.

456
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,912
Dr. Ahn, you really don't look like
a military guy.

457
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,747
Are you sure
you're from the Military Academy?

458
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,833
Yes, I did pretty well in the military.

459
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,334
Then why did you leave?

460
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,920
You got into Korea Military Academy
and became a captain.

461
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,088
Why did you quit?

462
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,590
Rumor has it
that it was because of a woman.

463
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,843
I heard he quit because
he lacks the aptitude for it.

464
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,138
There was a big accident in his unit.
He quit because of his PTSD.

465
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,557
-I'm sure a woman was involved.
-He lacks the aptitude.

466
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,767
He obviously didn't follow
the MBTI test results.

467
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,894
It was because
of his post-traumatic stress disorder.

468
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,438
It can be very stressful.

469
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,608
Wouldn't it be more comfortable for you
to talk about this when I'm not around?

470
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,529
No, we never talk behind anyone's back.
We say it in front of them.

471
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,950
Dr. Ahn, you won't tell us anyway. Right?

472
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,371
Forget it. It's not like we're curious.

473
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,582
-All right.
-Also, the past isn't important.

474
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,250
The future is what matters.

475
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,626
Professor.

476
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,838
What does Professor Kim Jun-wan
like the most?

477
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:15,508
I've been observing him
for half a year and...

478
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,052
And?

479
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,262
I think he likes everyone but me.

480
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,598
He doesn't open up easily.

481
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,226
He has no interest in other people.
He's a selfish guy.

482
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,397
Oh, there is this one thing.
Golf. He loves golf.

483
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,525
He'd even go golfing
with his parents' worst enemy.

484
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,842
As for Jeong-won, he's from a rich family,

485
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,303
so he's dabbled in all sorts of things.

486
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,305
He has a different hobby for each season.

487
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,681
-In spring--
-He runs a marathon.

488
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,059
That's right.
He runs a marathon in spring.

489
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,811
In summer, he goes surfing.

490
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,273
In autumn, he goes hiking.
Then in winter, he goes skiing.

491
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,276
But he can't do any of that these days
because he's busy.

492
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,444
What about Professor Yang?

493
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,948
Seok-hyeong? Does he have a hobby?

494
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,325
I think he's always home.

495
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,579
Rumor has it that he has a 300-inch TV.

496
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,164
Jeez.

497
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,917
Song-hwa's only hobby is going camping.

498
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,318
As for Ik-jun...

499
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,155
That prick is...

500
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,574
He does everything.

501
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,912
He bikes, golfs,
and also likes video games.

502
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,665
He can play the guitar
as well as the bass guitar.

503
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,627
He even wrote a cheer song
for a baseball team. Also, he can cook.

504
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:19,007
Anyway, he does everything.
And he's good at all of them.

505
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,010
-He can cook?
-He sure can.

506
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,138
You know
he's been a single father for a few years.

507
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:29,184
He's adamant about giving U-ju
only organic, home-cooked meals at home,

508
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,729
so he always cooks and eats
with his son on weekends.

509
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,255
Does it need more vinegar?

510
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,827
Hands up.

511
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,497
Are Ma-ne and her dad the only ones
coming this evening?

512
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,083
-It's Mo-ne.
-Right, Mo-ne.

513
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,753
Does Mo-ne not have a sister?

514
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,505
I'm sure she does. One called Ma-ne.

515
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,424
She has an older sister, Jang Ma-ne.
They're twins.

516
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,261
See? I knew it.

517
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,305
Ma-ne and Mo-ne always go as a set.

518
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,140
Is Ma-ne not coming today?

519
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,978
I don't know. I like Mo-ne.

520
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,271
Here you go.

521
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,065
When it comes to love, you never know.

522
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,402
I made meatballs.

523
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,446
-I even made ketchup from scratch.
-I want jajangmyeon!

524
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,408
Hey, come on.

525
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,796
What's your name?

526
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,090
"Brachyscome angustifolia."

527
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,051
It blooms all year round?

528
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,972
Your life must be exhausting.

529
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,733
"Geranium"?

530
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,860
I've heard of "plutonium"

531
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,947
and "uranium,"
but I've never heard of "geranium."

532
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,408
Anyway, nice to meet you.

533
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,202
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

534
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:57,123
Gosh, I'm sick of that place.

535
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:02,003
If I fall ill, I'll just quietly move
into a temple somewhere.

536
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,383
Oh, another flower I've never seen before.

537
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,011
Hold on. What is your name?

538
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,096
Jong-su, try taking a picture of me.

539
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,309
Come on.

540
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,739
-What does it say?
-What?

541
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,951
Oh, it found a name.

542
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,369
-Really?
-Yes.

543
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,746
The name is...

544
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,540
"Your Youth Is Gone."

545
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,792
What?

546
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,128
It says your youth is gone.

547
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,048
For real? Let me see.

548
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,092
Show me.

549
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,928
Come on. Show me!

550
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,638
Gosh, no need. What's there to see?

551
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,264
-Hey!
-Goodness.

552
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,184
-Gosh, seriously.
-Ouch. Let's go inside.

553
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,812
-It's cold. Come on!
-What are you talking about? It's summer.

554
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,898
-Gosh, it's so cold.
-Hey, show me. Does it really say that?

555
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,024
Hey!

556
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,071
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

557
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,335
You look good.
You're young, so you always look pretty.

558
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh, you look a little tired today.

559
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,217
-Menstrual cramps. I get it every month.
-Oh, no.

560
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,430
-I have a question.
-Fire away.

561
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,142
Is that the only outfit you have?

562
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,144
Yes, this is my summer outfit.

563
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,401
What? What are you doing?

564
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,320
I can see my reflection on your face.

565
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,989
This is called dewy makeup.

566
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,323
It's too much.

567
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:00,246
My mom said fashion that others
don't recognize can't be called fashion.

568
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,250
My mom said I should tell my friends
right away when they go the wrong way.

569
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,004
What the heck?

570
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,060
We'll begin the ASD closure
for patient Jeong Jin-ho.

571
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,522
Lead surgeon Do Jae-hak.
First assistant Kim Jun-wan.

572
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,233
Please begin, Dr. Do.

573
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,194
Okay.

574
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,177
Don't cut that part.

575
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,971
Be very precise,
or you'll damage other parts.

576
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,223
Got it.

577
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,153
Again, be precise.
Go down to the endocardium.

578
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,574
If you only stitch up the outer layers
that are on sight, it'll bleed later.

579
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,659
Understood, Doctor.

580
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,828
For that part, don't go too deep.

581
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,915
Don't fool your eyes. Look and be precise.

582
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,750
Okay.

583
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,255
Dr. Do.

584
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,466
I got a call from the ICU,
so I can't finish this up.

585
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,427
Can I go?

586
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,596
Yes, get going. Thanks for your help.

587
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,391
All right, thank you.

588
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,186
Professor.

589
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,067
Thank you for this opportunity.

590
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,486
I'll do better next time.

591
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,238
Okay, do better next time.

592
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,327
Hey.

593
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,582
You actually did better than I thought.
What's gotten into you?

594
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,473
-Hello.
-Hello.

595
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,975
Pass me my phone.

596
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,479
-Are you guys med students?
-Yes.

597
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,523
Where do you live?

598
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,734
I live pretty far.
It takes 50 minutes by subway.

599
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,069
My gosh, that must be tiring.

600
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,448
-All right, take it easy.
-Have a nice day, sir.

601
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,542
-Hello.
-Hello.

602
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,002
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

603
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,213
She's in the OR.

604
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,465
Oh, really? Thanks.

605
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,842
Med students, right?

606
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,260
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

607
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,678
What does your father do?

608
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,264
-He's a farmer.
-I see.

609
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,352
Have a good day, sir.

610
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,317
Professor.

611
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,904
Ji-a's hourly urine output
is less than 3cc.

612
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,365
-What about her vitals?
-Her BP is okay,

613
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,825
but her heart rate is around 150bpm.
She has tachycardia.

614
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,414
Professor, we're ready.

615
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,791
Okay, I'm coming.

616
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,835
It's an imperforate anus surgery,
so I'll finish in two hours.

617
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,338
Give her more fluid
and keep me updated, please.

618
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,093
Call Professor Lee Ji-yeong
if she gets worse. I'll let her know.

619
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,469
Okay.

620
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,567
-Hello.
-Hi, who are you?

621
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,735
I'm a med student.

622
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,905
Why did you choose to go to med school?
It's a hard path.

623
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,865
-Is there a doctor in your family?
-No.

624
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,286
-What does your father do?
-He's a farmer.

625
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,537
I see. Farming is great.

626
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,626
No, the surgery wasn't that hard.

627
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,840
It was for a condition called "ASD,"
an atrial septal defect.

628
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,677
I do it all the time.

629
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,430
Yes, I got it done in no time.

630
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,474
Why would I get yelled at?

631
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,857
Professor Kim doesn't lose his temper
for no reason.

632
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,110
Honey, I'll call you back.

633
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,780
-Where are you going?
-Not telling you. Was that your wife?

634
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,866
Yes, I bragged about my first surgery.

635
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,701
I'm envious that you have a wife.

636
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,703
Professor, I signed a long-term lease.

637
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,205
No more monthly rent!
The deposit is 200 million won.

638
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,957
I'll invite you to our housewarming party.

639
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,752
Did you check everything thoroughly?
There are a lot of rental scams.

640
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,880
It's me who took the college entry exam
four times, and the bar exam six times.

641
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,632
Long-term leases are rare these days,

642
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,010
so I was wondering if I should
just extend my monthly lease.

643
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,013
But it was one of my realtor's listings,
so I signed it right away.

644
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,599
In other words,
my realtor will be my landlord.

645
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,893
So everything was very easy.
I signed it immediately.

646
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,315
Hey, realtors can be scammers too.

647
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,194
I checked a certified copy of the register
as well as his ID.

648
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,112
-You should be careful.
-Of what?

649
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,365
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae.

650
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,035
I've heard bad rumors about him.
Stay away from him.

651
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,286
"Bad rumors"? Like what?

652
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,581
-It's kind of gross.
-Gosh, enough. I don't want to hear it.

653
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,626
Be it cheating, gambling, or stealing.
I don't care what he does.

654
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,503
Get back to work.
Stop following me around.

655
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,048
-Oh, Professor.
-What? What now?

656
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,759
You're seeing someone, right?

657
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,680
You're literally glued to your phone.

658
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,644
And if she takes this long
to get back to you,

659
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,271
it's safe to assume that she dumped you.

660
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,623
-Hello.
-Hello.

661
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,252
Hi, guys. Are you two
the famous Hong-do and Yun-bok?

662
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,547
-Yes, I'm Jang Yun-bok.
-I'm Jang Hong-do.

663
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,633
We've met before. I gave you a lot of
sausages at the cafeteria that day.

664
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,094
No way. That was him?

665
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,720
The chatty cafeteria guy?

666
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,888
Be quiet.

667
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,098
Hey.

668
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,599
Yes?

669
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,936
What songs do kids listen to these days?

670
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,856
-Pardon?
-I'm talking about music.

671
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,733
Tell me the kind of songs
you listen to these days.

672
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,610
IU's songs.

673
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,655
Well, I listen to...

674
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,491
Zoo's songs.

675
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,997
Hold on. Are you talking
about the band that I like?

676
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,915
How do you know that band?

677
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,293
She always listens to old songs.

678
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,294
She's so lame.

679
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,254
No, she's not.
What's lame about old songs?

680
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,298
-You're lamer.
-No, they are lame.

681
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,757
He doesn't get romance.

682
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,135
I can see that.
Hey, don't hang out with him.

683
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,012
You know nothing...

684
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,764
Yes, I'm on my way now. Okay.

685
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,476
I'm leaving for my rounds.

686
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,561
I'll buy you a nice meal
when I see you again. Okay?

687
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,688
Oh, right. Don't stay here.

688
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,898
Go to the cafe in the lobby.

689
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,107
If you stay here,

690
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,735
whoever walks in will try to give you
advice and meddle. Okay?

691
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,695
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

692
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,030
Bye.

693
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,328
-Is he a comedian?
-No.

694
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,622
He's Dr. Romantic.

695
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,633
What's wrong with you? Are you all right?

696
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,135
What do you mean? I want Coke.

697
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,721
Your face is very swollen.

698
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,972
You should...

699
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,766
Oh, this. I have menstrual cramps.

700
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,184
I took some medicine.

701
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,186
I think the medication
caused the swelling.

702
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,606
Hello, Professor Lee.

703
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,399
What happened?

704
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,903
-Go to the ER now.
-What?

705
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,863
I'm all right. I'm just

706
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,533
feeling under the weather today.

707
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,825
No, you're not okay.

708
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,203
It looks like an allergic reaction.
What did you have today?

709
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,955
Nothing really.

710
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,583
What?

711
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
-Hey.
-Oh, no.

712
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,547
We ran a blood test,

713
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:33,300
and you have
the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

714
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,302
To maintain a healthy pregnancy,

715
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,137
your blood has to flow well.

716
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,431
But with this syndrome,

717
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,142
it's hard for your blood to circulate.

718
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,688
Forming a placenta and maintaining
your pregnancy can be difficult.

719
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,568
Then, is this similar to
having recurrent pregnancy loss?

720
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,152
Yes.

721
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,282
So, this is your third pregnancy.

722
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,367
And you had two previous miscarriages.

723
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,705
Let's see. You're seven weeks pregnant.

724
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,915
Yes.

725
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,877
Here.

726
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,298
I'd like to prescribe some medication.

727
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,384
You should get heparin shots.

728
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:19,430
This shot will prevent
the blood from clotting.

729
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,182
You can easily get these shots.

730
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,603
This is similar to the insulin shots
diabetes patients get.

731
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,605
And the needle is very thin,

732
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,773
so it won't hurt as much.

733
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,443
And our nurse will thoroughly explain

734
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,029
how to inject the shots
and take the medication.

735
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,449
Come back after two weeks,
and I'll check on your condition, then.

736
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,788
Professor,

737
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,667
you must have seen a lot of mothers
with this kind of disease.

738
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,670
So you must think
this is nothing serious, right?

739
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,674
Why is miscarriage a disease?

740
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,182
Miscarriage isn't a disease.

741
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,019
Of course, you did nothing wrong here.

742
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,440
A lot of patients
that had miscarriages ask me

743
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,777
if they did something wrong
or if they must be careful in the future.

744
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,819
That's not true.

745
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,531
This can happen to anyone.

746
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,911
And besides, you know the cause this time.

747
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,788
We can prepare for it
and help you get treated.

748
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,123
Then you may be able to
have a healthy baby.

749
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,668
So make sure you get your heparin shots.

750
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,045
And take it easy for the time being.

751
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,464
Okay.

752
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,216
Thank you.

753
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,471
-Are we done?
-Yes.

754
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,430
We're done for today.

755
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,682
Lunch?

756
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,393
It's on me. Let's go!

757
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:48,936
Okay.

758
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,234
Two pieces of chocolate cake,
to-go, please.

759
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,654
-How many forks do you need?
-One. Both of them are for me.

760
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,157
Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.

761
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,326
To the hallway in front of Room 6210.

762
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,787
-Emergency for CS, right?
-Cardiothoracic Surgery, Code Blue.

763
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,164
To the hallway in front of Room 6210.

764
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,854
-Is it Professor Park Jin-u's patient?
-Yes.

765
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,440
The patient had endocarditis,
so they performed an AVR.

766
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,400
I'll check the rhythm.

767
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,988
-His heart is beating.
-Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon.

768
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,365
Mr. Lee Jong-hyeon, are you all right?

769
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,123
What a relief.

770
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,917
-Bye.
-Bye.

771
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,587
Check if it's flowing right. Well done.

772
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,175
Professor Kim.

773
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,886
Hello.

774
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,721
I'm Cheon Myeong-tae.

775
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,265
Hi. I'm Kim Jun-wan.

776
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,059
So you're the big shot at CS.

777
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,895
I am?

778
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,981
You're in charge of the VIP Ward,
so I say you are.

779
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,735
One's talent makes
all the difference to doctors.

780
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,407
What are you doing this weekend?

781
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,701
Do you like golf?

782
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,789
Over there. There are two empty seats.

783
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,083
Professor Yang, over there.

784
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,211
Go ahead. It's all right.

785
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,546
Seon-jin, take the seat over there.

786
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,840
Professor Yang, let's sit here.

787
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,925
Okay.

788
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,477
I have a question.

789
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,104
-Can I?
-Yes.

790
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,442
Well,

791
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,820
you met a woman in a navy lace dress

792
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,907
at the outdoor garden last week.
Who is she?

793
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,285
You two

794
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,372
looked cozy together
when you were talking to each other.

795
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,748
Who is she?

796
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,714
Oh, her.

797
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,051
The mistress of Taegeon Apparel's
Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

798
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,219
What?

799
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,555
She's the mistress
of Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

800
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,348
I see.

801
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,100
It was in the news, so you know, right?

802
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,352
I think the whole hospital knows.

803
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,522
I'm all right. I've been used to it
since I was in school.

804
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,156
I see empty seats over there.
Jeong-won, look.

805
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,074
Okay.

806
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,580
Oh, right. Hey, do we have
band practice tomorrow?

807
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,417
Don't make any plans tomorrow night.
Okay, Jeong-won?

808
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,376
Okay.

809
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,964
You finished.
You didn't pick at your food.

810
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,757
I was never picky with my food.

811
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,844
Don't be picky with people, you prick.

812
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,347
My resident is here.

813
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,436
You're best friends with Dr. Jang, right?

814
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,688
Yes, I am. How do you know that?

815
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,690
I see you together all the time.

816
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,775
Right. Gyeo-ul is in the ER now.

817
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,943
My gosh, why?

818
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,362
It's gotten better after she got the shot.

819
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,489
I think she had anaphylaxis from NSAIDs.

820
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,616
SUDDEN REACTION TO THE BODY

821
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,285
Her face swelled 30 minutes
after taking the pill for cramps.

822
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,453
Then, she couldn't breathe.

823
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,705
She passed out like a scene in the movie.

824
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,249
-Oh, no. Please excuse me.
-Okay.

825
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,668
She's much better now.

826
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,086
She's probably asleep.

827
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,965
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

828
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,230
Gosh. Are you okay?

829
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,483
Are you in pain? Should I call Hui-su?

830
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,069
No. I'm not in pain anymore.

831
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,363
Did you sleep here?

832
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,989
Is it dawn now?

833
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,200
Yes, it's night.

834
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,620
But you've been getting
a lot of text messages.

835
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,497
A lot of professors came to check on you.

836
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,461
I should have chosen GS too.

837
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,922
They don't treat you like a resident.

838
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,882
You're treated like a princess.

839
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,307
I heard you were sick.

840
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,059
Are you feeling better now?

841
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,936
Get a lot of rest and feel better.

842
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,896
He sent me a smiley face, right?

843
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,858
Yes. A smiley face.

844
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,319
That's not a tilde. It's a smiley face.

845
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,447
Yes, it is. It's a smiley face.

846
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,740
What about it?

847
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,537
Could he have feelings for me?

848
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,080
What?

849
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,457
Professor Ahn likes me, right?

850
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,419
No.

851
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,254
Why not?

852
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,047
If he likes you,

853
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,174
he would have come here.

854
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,515
You like him, don't you?

855
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,894
Dr. Jang,

856
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,231
you like Professor Ahn, right?

857
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,154
Yes.

858
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,873
Yes, Song-hwa.

859
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,126
Okay. Hold on.

860
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,337
Jun-wan, Song-hwa needs to talk to us.
She wants to grab dinner.

861
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,923
-You're free, right?
-Of course.

862
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,508
Yes, he can.

863
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,553
Okay. We're on our way out, too.

864
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,513
Okay. See you soon.

865
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,935
Something sounded off about her.
Did something happen?

866
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,190
Why? How did she sound?

867
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,193
She acts as if everything is fine,

868
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,612
but I think something is up with her.

869
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,159
Why are you telling us that now?

870
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,952
When did you get tested?

871
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,539
It's been a week.

872
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,374
I got a biopsy.

873
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,126
I'll get the result tomorrow.

874
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,671
The core biopsy.

875
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,964
Yes, that.

876
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,344
The shape doesn't look good.

877
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,765
When the doctor told me that,
it did scare me a bit.

878
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,767
Hey, how could you joke about that?

879
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,603
Why did you go to Jae-an Medical Center?
If you had asked me or Ik-jun,

880
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,230
we would've taken care of it right away.

881
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,689
When does the result come out?

882
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,192
My cousin works there. I'll ask him now.

883
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,611
My gosh, stop it.

884
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,781
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd make a fuss.

885
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,160
If it's bad,
people in the hospital will talk about it.

886
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,662
I hate that.

887
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,080
What are you talking about?

888
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,665
It's not going to be bad.

889
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,125
The result must be out already.
I'll call them.

890
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,127
Stop it. Don't. Seriously, stop it.

891
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,380
I'll find out tomorrow morning.
What's the point?

892
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,757
I really don't want you to do it,
so don't.

893
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,136
This is why I had it done
at another hospital.

894
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,515
Please don't do anything. Please?

895
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,100
What time tomorrow?

896
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,227
-Seven.
-That early?

897
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,230
Yes. My schedule is full this week.

898
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,649
When I said I couldn't make it,
they bumped me up by an hour.

899
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,193
They start seeing outpatients at eight
like we do.

900
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,611
I'm very grateful for it.

901
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,031
Did you say you couldn't get the result
because of your outpatients?

902
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,909
Unbelievable.
You could've talked to the hospital

903
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,703
and rescheduled the appointments.

904
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,037
Are you that inflexible?

905
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,957
How could I do that? Some patients
made appointments months ago.

906
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,126
Many are coming to Seoul
from the countryside.

907
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,337
I'll be fine.
I'll go and get the result myself.

908
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,549
My gosh, you and your nagging.

909
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,509
But that's an excellent doctor.

910
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,970
Your doctor is coming to work
early for you.

911
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,764
Right? It's so early. I can never do that.

912
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,142
Let me know as soon as you get the result.

913
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:08,727
Okay.

914
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,105
-Should I go with you?
-Don't you dare! I'm serious.

915
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,649
I'm sure it's nothing.

916
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,985
Hey, let's eat. Dig in.

917
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,825
It's not mine.

918
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,410
Not mine.

919
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,458
Yes?

920
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,755
Are the vitals stable?

921
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,882
Is there free air?

922
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,009
Yes, I'm nearby.

923
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,846
If there are a liver laceration
and a perforated bowel,

924
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,473
I should explore that.

925
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,975
Okay. I'll be there soon.

926
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,395
Darn it. I'm leaving.

927
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,855
Good luck.

928
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,028
I got off work,
but I'm at the hospital again.

929
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,405
Do you have an emergency patient?

930
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,783
Yes, the patient was in a car accident.

931
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,494
I think the patient's liver
and bowel need surgery.

932
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,081
Oh, no. You'll probably
have to pull an all-nighter.

933
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,124
Yes, I'll probably be done in the morning.

934
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,417
And that's if I'm fast.

935
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,629
Then, you should come to my shoot
when you're done in the morning.

936
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,797
It's nearby.

937
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,049
I must be on standby
early in the morning tomorrow, too.

938
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,386
I'll buy you coffee. There are a lot
of convenience stores nearby.

939
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,180
I should buy you coffee.
You treated me last time.

940
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,518
If I finish early in the morning,

941
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,145
I'll try to visit you.
I might not be able to make it, though.

942
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,398
Okay. Good luck with the surgery.

943
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,733
I hope I can see you tomorrow morning.

944
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,151
Okay.

945
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,822
ELAPSED TIME

946
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,121
I think the repair is holding well.

947
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,360
I'll take these.

948
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,443
COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATION CENTER

949
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,208
Seriously? Why are you here?

950
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,087
Why do you think?
I came because I'm worried.

951
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,472
Look at that big yawn. Goodness.

952
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,891
You should just get some sleep at home.

953
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,686
-Why did you come?
-How could I sleep?

954
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,148
Hello.

955
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,566
Hello.

956
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,234
Thank you for seeing us this early.

957
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,445
Gosh, don't mention it.
This happens a few times.

958
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,406
-Please wait.
-Hold on. Have some of this.

959
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,241
It's really cheap. It's nothing big.

960
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,409
No, it's all right.

961
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,369
I bought way too many. That's why.

962
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,121
Please take some. I'm begging you.

963
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,832
Thank you. Please give us ten minutes.

964
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:41,916
Okay. We can wait.

965
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:59,559
Hey, what if I have cancer?

966
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,604
You can get it fixed.

967
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,400
I'll fix it no matter what.

968
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,283
-It's nice.
-What?

969
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,327
Getting a confident answer
from the doctor.

970
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:24,292
Now, I understand why doctors
shouldn't give out such answers.

971
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,214
It's so nice to hear that.

972
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,342
It makes me think
you'll fix whatever is wrong with me.

973
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:38,097
That's why I should never say things
like that to my patients.

974
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,767
What if something goes wrong?

975
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,687
If the result comes out badly,

976
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,277
I think they would be in utter despair.

977
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,748
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

978
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,085
I'm about to go in.

979
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,047
Okay. I'll tell you right away.

980
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,841
Okay.

981
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,223
-Can Seok-hyeong make calls?
-Yes. Why?

982
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,684
I thought he only texted.

983
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,769
He calls me often.

984
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,402
A long time ago,

985
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,862
Seok-hyeong liked you a lot.

986
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,155
Hey.

987
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,741
That's ancient history.

988
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:43,913
You know the day when
Seok-hyeong told you that he liked you?

989
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,666
Did you know that he slept on the street?

990
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,669
-Really?
-Yes.

991
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,131
He and I had drinks that night.

992
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:56,092
He told me that he confessed his feelings
and you turned him down.

993
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,095
We had drinks and went home.

994
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,347
But late at night,
I got a call from the police station.

995
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,849
They told me to take my friend home.

996
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,518
They called me
because I was the last person he called.

997
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,520
I was confused and went to the station.

998
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,774
My gosh. He was sleeping on the street,
and the officers brought him there

999
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,776
so he didn't freeze to death.

1000
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,031
Seriously.
That brings back so many memories.

1001
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,574
So many memories.

1002
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,663
Wait, so you knew.

1003
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,499
Why did you pretend you didn't?

1004
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,419
I only knew that Seok-hyeong liked you.

1005
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,712
I didn't know it in detail.

1006
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,298
Ms. Chae Song-hwa, please come in.

1007
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,633
Okay.

1008
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,488
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1009
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,667
We have ten more minutes, right?

1010
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,043
Yes.

1011
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,962
Should I go and get you some coffee?

1012
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,007
No. I'm good. I was just checking.

1013
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,927
Wait. Now that you ask me,

1014
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,929
I kind of want coffee.

1015
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,640
What is it?

1016
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,560
-I'm fine. It's benign.
-Okay. Great.

1017
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,443
What's the result?

1018
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,322
It's a fibroadenoma.
We'll test it again in six months.

1019
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,574
I knew it.

1020
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,993
-You did well. See you later, then.
-Okay.

1021
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,875
It's benign. Are we good now?

1022
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,465
Did everyone come?

1023
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,217
There's one more.

1024
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,970
Did you call the guys today?

1025
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,847
I saw them visit you one at a time.

1026
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,516
You know we have
band practice today, right?

1027
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,684
See you later.

1028
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,980
My brother-in-law, have a great day.

1029
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,047
You can't finish it, right? Pour me some.

1030
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,301
What if we get addicted to Coke?

1031
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:46,345
I can't drink because I'm worried
that the hospital will call me.

1032
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,640
Jun-wan, do you want Coke or Sprite?

1033
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,809
He's busy.
His mom's about to build a hinoki tub.

1034
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,479
What? You want to switch to cypress?

1035
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:59,025
Mom, hinoki is cypress.
They are the same thing.

1036
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,403
Heopa also means lung. Kongpat, kidney.

1037
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,489
Jjijimi, pancake. Jeonguji, chives.

1038
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,407
-Jeonguji means chives?
-Yes.

1039
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,409
I'm with my friends.

1040
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,371
Okay. I'll call you later.

1041
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,248
Okay.

1042
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,417
We're playing Zoo's song, right?

1043
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,919
Did you bring your guitar?

1044
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,465
You can switch back to standard Korean
right away. That's impressive.

1045
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,300
What? I don't speak with a dialect.

1046
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,219
Buddy, eat it with jeonguji.

1047
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,970
All right.

1048
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,305
Did you know

1049
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,808
you two had a huge transformation?

1050
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,853
-Us two?
-Yes.

1051
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,396
What on earth are you talking about?

1052
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,107
These guys looked worse back then.
Especially, you.

1053
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,945
What about me?

1054
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,697
You wanted to copy Leslie Cheung.
You parted your hair and got a perm.

1055
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,408
Don't distort the truth, Ik-jun.

1056
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,744
You two were worse.

1057
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,912
How did we look back then?

1058
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,179
Like this.

1059
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,597
You prick.

1060
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,766
-You prick.
-That was Jun-wan.

1061
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,977
You prick.

1062
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,521
No, they weren't that bad.
They looked like this.

1063
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,106
-You prick.
-No.

1064
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,108
-He looked like this.
-My gosh. Hey.

1065
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,486
LINE 2, EXIT 3

1066
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,488
Is this the way?

1067
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,079
Where's the school? Why can't I see it?

1068
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,748
We have to take a bus here. Bus 289-1.

1069
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,667
It's the school entrance. Why take a bus?

1070
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,296
If I knew the answer to that,

1071
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,132
why would I be standing here with you,
holding this paper like a fool?

1072
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,051
-It's freezing cold today.
-You said you'd been to Seoul. You forgot?

1073
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,263
You've been here too, man. We went to
the National Assembly on our school trip.

1074
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,849
-Did we?
-Yes.

1075
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,396
Do you have any change? A 1,000-won bill?

1076
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,317
I only have 10,000-won bills.

1077
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,444
Same here.

1078
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,528
How much is the bus fare?

1079
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,906
-It's 340 won. Seriously?
-What?

1080
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,575
Things in Seoul are so expensive.
It's no place to live!

1081
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,952
But I'm still going to live in Seoul.

1082
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,622
-Wait here. I'll go and break the bill.
-At where?

1083
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,583
I'll buy something at the cart over there
and get smaller bills.

1084
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,046
Sir.

1085
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,506
How much is it?

1086
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,676
Where are you from? Busan? Masan?

1087
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,179
That's 700 won.

1088
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,438
-What about this?
-3,000 won.

1089
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,439
Here.

1090
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,566
Here.

1091
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,568
Good luck with the interview.

1092
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,612
Thank you. Have a good day.

1093
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,822
MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERVIEW
WAITING AREA

1094
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,533
EXAM SCHEDULE

1095
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,922
Ik-jun, I don't think I did well
on my essay exam.

1096
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:11,133
You should cut
your side-swept bangs first.

1097
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,844
-What do you mean?
-I had to take a dump in the bathroom.

1098
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,888
But it was packed with people,

1099
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,015
so I used the staff bathroom downstairs.

1100
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,892
Guess what I heard there.

1101
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,896
Do you know what the most important factor
they are considering this year is?

1102
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,356
What is it?

1103
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,358
Jeonggal.

1104
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,318
Jeongal?

1105
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,030
No, I said, Jeonggal. Not scorpion.

1106
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,617
Jeonggam? You mean, "warmhearted"?
Gosh, that's my weak point.

1107
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,870
Go and clean your ears first, you prick.

1108
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,163
I saw a shovel over there.

1109
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,165
-What the heck?
-Neatness.

1110
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,960
They're going to pick neat students.

1111
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,128
Go cut your hair now.

1112
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,295
Really? Darn it.

1113
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,977
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1114
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:58,491
I saw you again in front

1115
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,161
Of the subway station at the city hall

1116
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,791
When I turned around to buy newspapers

1117
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:10,044
I saw your figure

1118
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:15,674
At the crowded newsstand

1119
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,470
When I called out your name

1120
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,891
You looked surprised

1121
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:39,615
When I was about to go to you

1122
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:43,911
I stepped on someone's foot

1123
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:48,582
I had to say I was sorry

1124
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,293
With a big smile

1125
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:57,133
We talked about our lives
And how we changed

1126
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:01,428
We even talked about the weather
Which was boring

1127
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,640
The flooding memories

1128
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:08,477
Quickly exhausted us

1129
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:12,731
That time which seemed so slow

1130
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,652
Passed us by

1131
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:21,198
You told me that you were a mother of two

1132
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,451
With a gentle smile on your face

1133
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:30,416
When you asked me how I am doing

1134
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:34,503
I just shrugged my shoulders
In disappointment

1135
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,756
And told you that I was still looking for

1136
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,594
The love of my life somewhere
In this world

1137
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:49,768
-If we run into each other again someday
-If we run into each other again someday

1138
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:57,276
-You said you'd show me your children
-You said you'd show me your children

1139
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:05,868
-But the song engraved in our hearts
-But the song engraved in our hearts

1140
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,371
-From that day
-From that day

1141
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:14,001
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday
-Is still fresh like it was yesterday

1142
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:17,189
You told me that
Things were getting tough between us

1143
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,110
That could have been
The reason you left me

1144
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,364
But I can't know for sure

1145
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,866
Sing it, everyone.

1146
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:34,873
I remember the night when you left me

1147
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:43,882
You in my memory

1148
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,678
All right.

1149
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,931
Hey, I'm sorry. No, I mean... Never mind.

1150
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,141
I'm okay.

1151
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:56,520
Song-hwa, I'm sorry for bringing up
such nonsense.

1152
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:28,886
Did you want to meet up?

1153
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,472
Okay. Where should we meet?

1154
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,018
I'm sorry. Something just came up.

1155
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,603
Let's meet some other time.

1156
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,416
DRINKS AND MEALS,
CUSTOMERS FOR A CENTURY

1157
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,335
No. Bye.

1158
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,196
Hello?

1159
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,700
Where? Who is this?

1160
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:41,059
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHAE SONG-HWA

1161
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,062
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1162
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,862
Thank you. Thank you for the coffee.

1163
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,073
You're even diligent. My gosh.

1164
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,330
If you have questions, ask Song-hwa.
She really likes that.

1165
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,706
Okay.

1166
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,584
Professor Chae is a good person.

1167
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,461
She is.

1168
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:11,798
I respect her very much and like her.

1169
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,385
Okay.

1170
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,765
Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?

1171
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,058
Yes.

1172
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,393
We talk on the phone at least once a week.

1173
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,145
She's a really close friend of mine.

1174
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,356
Just like you and Professor Chae.

1175
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,068
Right. There are times when I realize
she's a woman, not just a friend.

1176
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,402
My gosh, no.

1177
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,280
We're really not involved romantically.

1178
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:40,369
Besides, Ik-sun is still hurt
by what happened in the past.

1179
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:44,998
She said she's not ready to date

1180
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,292
someone yet.

1181
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,087
She said she can't trust anyone.

1182
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,007
I think it will take her some time.

1183
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,051
Really?

1184
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,555
Probably.

1185
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:22,035
I'm paying this month's utility bill.

1186
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,037
Jeong-won said he already paid.

1187
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,832
My gosh, I guess
he's doing better financially.

1188
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,417
That moocher paid the utility bill.

1189
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,336
Did something happen?

1190
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,338
You look down today.

1191
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,966
It's nothing really. But...

1192
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,844
My gosh, I had no idea,

1193
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,347
but Ik-sun...

1194
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,061
A NEW MESSAGE FROM IK-SUN

1195
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:49,855
Bye.

1196
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:03,619
Yes for what?

1197
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,629
Today is our first day as a couple.

1198
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,626
Hello?

1199
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,004
What are you doing?

1200
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,133
Really? Okay.

1201
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,303
I don't have any surgery today.

1202
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,763
Did you eat?

1203
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:06,890
Who?

1204
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,353
I see. I didn't know
there was a position for that.

1205
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:13,355
Are you guys close to each other?

1206
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,273
I see.

1207
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:19,528
Okay. When is your next day off?

1208
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,159
No, don't do that.

1209
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,036
I'll go pick you up.

1210
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,121
Okay.

1211
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,708
Are you sure?

1212
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,668
Yes, Ji-a will be the recipient.

1213
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:38,171
The donor is a 22-year-old female.
She weighs 49kg.

1214
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,799
And her LFT is under 40. It's all good.

1215
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,051
She stayed at Kangwoon Medical Center
for seven days.

1216
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,595
Then, we'll get the surgery ready.

1217
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:47,389
Okay.

1218
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,309
Oh my gosh!

1219
01:18:52,644 --> 01:18:53,979
Thank you, doctor.

1220
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:56,481
Thank you so much, doctor.

1221
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,108
Thank you.

1222
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,444
Thank you so much, doctor.

1223
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:05,574
The committee that confirms brain death
must still go through the protocol.

1224
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:09,286
And we must check the condition
of the liver from the donor.

1225
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:12,038
But I think this will work.

1226
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,208
We can proceed with the surgery tonight
at the earliest.

1227
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:23,008
Then, my daughter, Ji-a,

1228
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,386
can live now. Right, doctor?

1229
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,472
Yes.

1230
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:31,850
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1231
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,825
How's the liver? Are you heading here now?

1232
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,535
We have a problem, Professor Ahn.

1233
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:52,579
What's wrong?

1234
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,372
The donor's liver is too thick.

1235
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,083
It looks like it weighs over 500g.

1236
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,044
And her AP must be as thick as 8cm.

1237
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:00,754
What should we do?

1238
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,720
This liver seems too big for Ji-a.
It won't work.

1239
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,556
This is the last and only way

1240
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,015
to save the baby.

1241
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:56,935
There's a lot of bleeding, doctor.

1242
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,144
Would you like to try it

1243
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,063
for the next surgery?

1244
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,231
What?

1245
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,732
I'm going to perform the surgery.

1246
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,359
I'm so nervous.

1247
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,194
I think you should give up.

1248
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,446
It won't go badly, right?

1249
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:12,075
It's too embarrassing if others find out.

1250
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:13,869
Why is my life so hard?

1251
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,997
What? It's fall already?

1252
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,124
Gosh, is fall here already?

1253
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,959
Is something good going on?

1254
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,586
You're always in a good mood lately.

1255
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,963
-A blind date?
-Really?

1256
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,506
Who is it?

1257
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,133
Who is it that you're so crazy about?

1258
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,843
Jun-wan, do I know her?

1259
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:33,096
I'm Kim Jun-wan's friend, Lee Ik-jun.

1260
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:34,973
The golf course there is really great.

1261
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,641
The ball rolls in by itself.

1262
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,227
An anonymous letter about bribery came in.

1263
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,355
Did you go to play golf?

1264
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,608
I heard the membership for the golf course

1265
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,860
costs two hundred million won.

1266
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,445
Hey, you didn't go, right?

1267
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,113
Why? Is something going on?

1268
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:52,657
