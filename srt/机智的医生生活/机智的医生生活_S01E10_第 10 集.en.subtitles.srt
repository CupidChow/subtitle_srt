1
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,145
Ik-jun?

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,730
He went all the way to Inje?

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,481
Yes, he just left.

4
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,359
-He even gave me money.
-What's gotten into him?

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,569
That's so unlike him.

6
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,654
I almost burst into tears.

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,991
We never say things like
"thanks" or "sorry"

8
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,492
to each other.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,245
I know that, of course.
My family is the same way.

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,957
Oh, boy. I guess he's getting old too.

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,252
-By the way, have you left yet?
-Yes, just now.

12
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,505
I'll call you when I get to the rest stop.
See you soon.

13
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,896
Everything looks good.
What should we order?

14
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,107
What are you doing?

15
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,776
There's a strand of hair on your jacket.

16
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,241
Do you have to keep
taking your medication?

17
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,620
Yes, it's a pain reliever.
Just one tablet a day.

18
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,997
You're one tough cookie.

19
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,500
You've been holding out like this
for years?

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,918
But I'm okay now.

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,879
Like Ik-sun, I have to refrain
from strenuous exercise,

22
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,464
but daily activities are fine.

23
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,675
The medication is for my chronic pain.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,385
The pain isn't too bad though.

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,638
Hold out for just another year.

26
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,932
You've been working hard
to build experience.

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,810
You should wrap it up well
and pass your board exam.

28
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,978
Yes.

29
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,397
I'll stay right by your side, Professor.

30
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,193
What do you recommend?

31
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,987
Meat lovers like
our creamy pasta with tenderloin.

32
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,573
Those who like oil pasta
usually order the pollack roe pasta.

33
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,741
Why must he be so punctual?

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,994
Over here.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,335
Professor, you've slowed down
your eating pace.

36
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,712
At your old pace,
you'd be eating your dessert now.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,881
No, I eat even faster now.

38
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm trying very hard to pace myself.

39
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,428
The food here is good.
And it's nice to eat out for a change.

40
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,016
Seok-min, isn't it time for you to
to start studying? The exam is coming up.

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,685
Yes, I'm going to start from next week.

42
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,230
Professor, what will you do without me?
You'll be so bored.

43
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,774
-I'll visit you often.
-Where is the study room?

44
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,277
-Can we visit you?
-Hey, it's called a study room.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,279
Why would you visit someone
who has to study?

46
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,489
I'll visit you guys. Goodness.

47
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,285
My dear Seon-bin. When I'm gone,
you won't have anyone to mess with you.

48
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,744
You'll be so bored.

49
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,121
"My dear Seon-bin"?

50
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,707
Did you just call her "my dear Seon-bin"?

51
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,334
My dear Ahn Chi-hong.

52
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,503
My dear Heo Seon-bin
and my dear Professor Chae.

53
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,673
What else... Yes, my dear pasta.

54
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,802
Your strong denial seems suspicious.
Are you sure there is nothing?

55
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,721
What are you talking about?
Nothing's going on.

56
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,347
Professor, shall we order desserts?

57
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,766
My gosh, look at her
trying to change the topic.

58
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,228
Seriously, nothing's going on.
What do you take me for?

59
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,023
Hey, what's wrong with me?

60
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,358
My dear Dr. Yong, you're such a catch.

61
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,985
How dare I even dream of dating you?

62
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,153
My dear Dr. Yong.

63
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,865
They say that sneezing and love
can't be hidden.

64
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,033
You obviously can't hide it.

65
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,492
Something must be going on.

66
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,413
Guys, what's wrong with dating?

67
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,917
Professor, are we not allowed
to date our co-workers?

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,419
Why not? I'm all for it.

69
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,255
It's nice if you can rely on each other.

70
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,298
Right.

71
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,843
Seon-bin and I are seeing each other.

72
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,596
Hey, Seon-bin. We're dating, right?

73
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,556
We got busted.

74
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,142
As if anyone would buy that.

75
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,686
Who would believe that?

76
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,901
Dr. Yong, what are we supposed to do
in this situation?

77
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,654
What do you think?
Let's just order some desserts.

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,739
Excuse me!

79
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,460
What is this social club called again?
"I Am a Gosu" like master?

80
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,921
That's right. I Am a Gosu.

81
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,131
I see them at least once a month,

82
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,384
but I can't hold out anymore.

83
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,470
They said I must bring you today.
They really want to meet you.

84
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,598
We'll just stop by
and have dinner with them, okay?

85
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,517
Don't do this to me, Ik-sun.

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,603
I guess you really want to see
the end of me.

87
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:35,149
No. They're all nice people.
They're so naive and innocent.

88
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,069
But I'm sure they're all
fourth or fifth-degree holders.

89
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,905
Ik-sun. Even for taekwondo,
I'm only an orange belt in rank.

90
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,573
I'm on the same level as U-ju.

91
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,620
Okay. We'll go together.

92
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,414
I have to go
if my girlfriend wants me to go.

93
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,255
What is this?

94
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,008
Is this another thing you don't eat?

95
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,316
-Hello.
-Hello.

96
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,608
Hello.

97
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,486
Hello, Professor Kim.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

98
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,739
The pleasure is mine.
Thank you for inviting me.

99
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,532
This is Captain Hong, the troublemaker.

100
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,661
I totally turned over a new leaf
after that day.

101
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,873
That night,
Major Lee kicked me in the shin nonstop--

102
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,041
-Well--
-Hey!

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,421
Oh, I have something for you.

104
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,383
Please accept this gift
as a token of apology.

105
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,261
What is this?

106
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,096
It's gosu. Cilantro.

107
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,319
Oh, my.

108
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,571
Look at you.

109
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,823
Here.

110
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,951
Drink up. Good boy.

111
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,789
You said you wanted tonkatsu.
This was what you were actually craving?

112
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,959
U-ju, can I have a bite of
the pollack roe mayo sandwich?

113
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,711
No, just eat yours.

114
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,718
-Do you want a bite of mine?
-I had it yesterday.

115
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,222
You were here yesterday? With who?

116
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,890
I didn't know.

117
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,976
I'm a regular here.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,478
"A regular"?

119
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,981
Oh, my. You and your fancy vocabulary.

120
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,193
-Who did you come here with?
-Mo-ne and my mother-in-law.

121
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,197
Your mother-in-law?

122
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,866
-U-ju, do you know what that word means?
-Yes.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,535
A wife's mother.

124
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,001
I brought a genius into this world.

125
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,212
Father.

126
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,342
I would like another sandwich.

127
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,137
But you still have
half of that sandwich left.

128
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,264
Buy me another one, please.

129
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,766
Show me something cute.

130
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,938
Oh, my heart...

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,206
Order two of what you want.
Anything works.

132
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,917
Then tonkatsu, udon,

133
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,420
rice bowl with fish roe,
and cold soba noodles?

134
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,341
The other guys might join us, you know.

135
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,302
I didn't say anything.
Go ahead and order them.

136
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,846
-Why are you standing there? Come in.
-One second.

137
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,100
Were you sleeping?
You sound like you're losing your voice.

138
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,311
Do you have a cold?

139
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,231
Do you have a stuffy nose?

140
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,568
Be careful, especially during
in-between seasons like now.

141
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,944
Did you have lunch?

142
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,450
Okay, I'll make sure I eat well.

143
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,494
Bye.

144
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,496
Yes, I love you.

145
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:17,955
Jun-wan!

146
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,919
-Dude! Can't you knock?
-I knocked, dude!

147
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,296
Really? What? What do you want?

148
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,631
I didn't knock, you prick.

149
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,424
Why should I knock
to come into your office?

150
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,719
Do you have Daddy-Long-Legs' contact
number from Kangwoon Medical Center?

151
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,096
Does he help other hospitals too?

152
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,599
Yes, I reached out to him
for help recently.

153
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,852
He must have a surplus cash flow now.
He sent money right away.

154
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,479
I just sent you the number.

155
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,940
Hyeon Jeong-mi in Social Services
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

156
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,109
Only she can reach him. She'll put you
in touch with Daddy-Long-Legs.

157
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,153
-Is it an emergency?
-No.

158
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,613
It's for a long-term patient.

159
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,241
He's stuck here
because he can't pay the bills.

160
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,368
I think he's trying
to take out high-interest loans.

161
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,328
He's an old man with no family or friends.

162
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,289
But he owns the bachelor apartment
where he lives,

163
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,833
so he doesn't meet Social Services'
criteria. It's complicated.

164
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,211
First, I want to contact them
and see if it's feasible.

165
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,338
-Did you have lunch?
-I have surgery. I have to go.

166
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,257
Take it easy.

167
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,344
That's right.
The patient is a 78-year-old male.

168
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,180
He underwent a right hemihepatectomy

169
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,848
due to HCC.

170
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,643
He's been here for a while
because his liver hasn't recovered.

171
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,564
Okay. I'll summarize it
and send it to Daddy-Long-Legs.

172
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,024
He usually texts back right away.

173
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,860
-Give me about half an hour.
-Okay, thank you.

174
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:34,115
Wait, is he a doctor?

175
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,576
He's asking detailed questions
about the patient.

176
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,160
That I don't know.

177
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,997
I think he's well versed
in medical knowledge.

178
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,167
He always asks detailed questions about
the patient's situation and condition.

179
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,253
Anyway, I'll call you right back.

180
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,629
Thank you.

181
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,207
29TH
DEPARTURE

182
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,717
Hi, Mom.

183
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,303
What's my sweet, adorable baby doing?

184
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,597
-I'm going to have lunch with Song-hwa.
-Song-hwa?

185
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,933
Good. That's great. Shall I join you guys?

186
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,895
We're just ordering in.

187
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
And it's not Song-hwa.
You got it all wrong.

188
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,943
"It's not Song-hwa"?
That means you are seeing someone.

189
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,655
Who is it? Marry her. Get married at once.

190
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,532
My first pick is Song-hwa,
but I'm fine with whomever you choose.

191
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,576
Gosh, my bad. I'm not seeing anyone.

192
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,286
It was a slip of the tongue.

193
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,997
Mom, I'll be in Yangpyeong this weekend.
Make me some noodles.

194
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,000
Jong-su and I are going to see
the fall foliage this weekend.

195
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,418
Come next weekend.

196
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,005
But I don't want to see you if you are
going to talk about that. Don't come.

197
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,801
Let's talk in person.

198
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,512
Enjoy your lunch with Mr. Ju.

199
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,305
All right.

200
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,070
-Did you call everyone?
-Seok-hyeong has patients.

201
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,780
Jun-wan has surgery,
and Jeong-won needs a minute.

202
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,950
Hey, I heard Seok-hyeong is
very popular among moms-to-be.

203
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,202
Gosh, cut the nonsense.

204
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,496
He's like that with just us.

205
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,083
My friend's sister-in-law is his patient,

206
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,168
and she said
he's the sweetest guy on earth.

207
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,170
Gosh, I find that very hard to believe.

208
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,259
Jeez! I get so anxious when you do that.

209
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,177
Why you... I wish I could just punch you.

210
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,596
Just use this.

211
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,099
You're so all over the place.
Who do you take after?

212
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,978
I take after U-ju. It's all from him.

213
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,690
All right. Gosh, that hurt.

214
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,776
There.

215
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,823
-Wait.
-What? What is it?

216
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,204
The food is already here?

217
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,540
You guys ordered a lot.

218
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,960
You came in exactly one minute.
You give me the heebie-jeebies.

219
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,379
You're more impressive.
Are you the Bionic Woman?

220
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,549
-What about the other guys?
-Seok-hyeong has patients.

221
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,718
Jun-wan has surgery,
and you took a minute.

222
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,308
Hello.

223
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,228
It's been a month, right?
Please have a seat.

224
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,397
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

225
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,611
The blood stagnation is gone.

226
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,572
You had a complete ultrasound
this morning, right?

227
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,407
Yes.

228
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,661
The normal cervical length is 3cm
on average.

229
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:12,666
For where you're at, anything
under 2.5cm is considered too short.

230
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,338
But yours is under 1cm,
which is very short.

231
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,923
And I can see

232
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,510
that your cervix is slightly open.

233
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,720
In cases like this,

234
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,974
it's highly likely
that the baby will be born prematurely.

235
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,019
Then what do I do?

236
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,523
Don't worry. You're okay.

237
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,025
Yes, he's right.

238
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,736
Thankfully, you can undergo surgery now.

239
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,238
Don't worry too much.

240
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,157
Cervical cerclage...

241
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,493
It's commonly called
the McDonald cerclage.

242
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,162
It's a procedure where
we tie the cervical opening

243
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,122
so that the cervix won't open.

244
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,084
Let's get you checked in
for surgery right away.

245
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,962
The entire procedure
will take about 30 minutes.

246
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,924
If there's no infection inside the uterus
after the surgery,

247
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,009
you'll be discharged in about two days.

248
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,180
The nurse here
will walk you through the steps.

249
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,230
I see this from time to time.

250
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,151
You're not the only one,
so don't worry too much.

251
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,906
Doctor, please don't tell me
that I might have another miscarriage.

252
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,367
What should we do, honey?

253
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,371
-Stop it with the nonsense.
-Yes, don't say that.

254
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,251
I'll do my very best.

255
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,462
We must protect the baby

256
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,798
this time no matter what.

257
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,345
Let's go ahead with the surgery today

258
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,473
and make sure you get
enough rest at home for a while.

259
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,644
As for your next appointment, I'll see you
a week after you get discharged.

260
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,229
I'll have to check and see

261
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,982
if your cervical length
is being maintained.

262
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,525
My gosh.

263
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,486
Don't worry.

264
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,574
Try to think positive, happy thoughts.

265
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,159
It'll help the baby.

266
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,245
Okay.

267
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,003
Professor Cheon's engagement
got called off.

268
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,338
Yes.

269
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,258
Mr. Ju told me. The daughter was
totally against her mom marrying him.

270
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,636
Her daughter is her savior.

271
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,681
Hey.

272
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,434
Please.

273
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,354
Okay, I'll slow down.

274
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,148
I eat fast because I have three brothers.

275
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,111
He was diagnosed with DCMP
and is waiting for a heart transplant.

276
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,279
I know that.

277
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,532
He's been here for over two months.
Cut the wordy explanation.

278
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,410
What was his IO yesterday?

279
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,746
The urine output was 600 yesterday.

280
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,122
-Potassium?
-Six.

281
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,167
Then give him Lasix.
Keep checking and give him RI if needed.

282
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,086
Lasix?

283
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,089
Can you not use a diuretic?

284
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,884
I'll be in pain anyway.

285
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,680
Sir. If you have trouble urinating,

286
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,974
the heart may stretch
and cause shortness of breath.

287
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,309
The potassium level from this morning
was quite high,

288
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,644
so we have to use a diuretic.

289
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,147
Either way, I won't be able to live.

290
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,816
Just leave me in peace, please.

291
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,276
I don't want Lasix.

292
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,323
Sure, if that's what you want.

293
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,750
I've heard all sorts of bad things
about Professor Cheon.

294
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,836
How come no one complains about him?

295
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,087
Isn't it obvious?

296
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,551
All he cares about is money.

297
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,886
Why do you think he manages CS
when he's so busy?

298
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,763
The answer is obvious.

299
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,745
MY RIDICULOUS APPOINTMENT
WITH PROFESSOR CHEON MYEONG-TAE

300
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,710
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS POST?

301
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,753
POST DELETED

302
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,603
Is your headache that bad?

303
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,064
No, a mild one.

304
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,524
But you should take one right away.

305
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,776
Right, Doctor?

306
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,533
Why did it go to the medical office?

307
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,329
Jeong-won, can you come with me?
This package is quite big.

308
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,288
Sure.

309
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,415
Go. I'll clean up.

310
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,751
Hey, what did you buy this time?

311
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,669
A wood stove.

312
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,505
A wood stove?

313
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,716
Good choice.

314
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,718
Do everything you want to do
to stay healthy.

315
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,763
Great purchase. Well done.

316
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,015
See? The doctor said the same thing.

317
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,101
Don't keep it all inside. Let it out.

318
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,771
Don't let your thoughts
overload your mind. Just say it.

319
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,690
Just say whatever you're thinking.

320
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,526
Okay? Got it?

321
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,279
Okay. I heard you,
so please look straight ahead

322
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,989
and keep your hands on the steering wheel.

323
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,742
I don't want to die
on the same day as you.

324
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,662
Okay, I'll focus and just drive.

325
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,122
-Jeez.
-Hey.

326
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,792
It's so nice to hear you just blurt
things out. Even I feel much better now.

327
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,923
By the way, does Jeong-won really want
to quit being a doctor?

328
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,760
Don't tell me he wants
to become a priest as well.

329
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,178
Yes, he does.

330
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,682
He said he also wants to live
as a child of God now.

331
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,683
Oh, dear.

332
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,519
He'll work until the end of the year

333
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,896
and move to Italy to go to the seminary.

334
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,356
The ones in Korea have age limits.

335
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,109
They already accepted
his recommendation letters.

336
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,194
After an in-person meeting,
all will be set.

337
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,071
Gosh, I'm so upset.

338
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,573
My goodness.

339
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,368
What's up with your kids?

340
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,997
I mean, this is pretty crazy. Goodness.

341
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,166
You're laughing?

342
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,418
What, then? Should I be crying?

343
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,130
Rosa.

344
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,884
I have to say,

345
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,137
this is much better than having children
who are selfish troublemakers.

346
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,806
You raised wonderful, responsible kids.

347
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,309
They all have such kind hearts.

348
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,229
Just seeing them puts me in a happy mood.

349
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,856
They left their aging mother alone

350
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,734
and went on to become children of God.
If that's not being selfish,

351
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,485
what is?

352
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,321
They put you in a happy mood?

353
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,823
My blood boils whenever I see them.

354
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,243
I won't comment on other things,

355
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,290
but it'd be a shame for Jeong-won
to quit his job as a doctor.

356
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,502
There aren't a lot of doctors like him.

357
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,630
He has a strong sense of duty,

358
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,966
and the way he treats patients
is exemplary.

359
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,886
Jeong-won is the kindest one
out of all my kids.

360
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,390
He's always been very empathetic
and affectionate since he was little.

361
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,476
He's emotionally sensitive.

362
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,647
That's why I thought
he picked the best department for himself

363
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,983
when he told me he wanted
to become a pediatric surgeon.

364
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,236
Then I told myself,

365
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,030
"I can finally put my worries to rest."

366
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,200
He always talked about wanting
to be a priest even as a little boy.

367
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,038
So I thought I could finally stop
worrying about it, but...

368
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,957
Oh, boy.

369
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,127
Buddha wasn't on my side.

370
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,465
Tell me. What's your religion?

371
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,927
I'll dabble in all of them before I die.

372
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,595
Who knows, right?

373
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,556
So you're building a religion portfolio?

374
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,977
Anyway, what are you going to do?

375
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,688
Once he sets his mind to something,
he'll do it.

376
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,731
Right, there's no stopping him.

377
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,483
He takes after me.

378
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,404
What should I do?
He said he'll visit me next weekend.

379
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm afraid he'll end up persuading me
this time.

380
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,243
You should travel abroad.

381
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,160
What?

382
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,414
Just don't see him.

383
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,165
Don't give him a chance to talk.

384
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,542
Are you kidding me?

385
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,628
Should I move to a different country?
I can't avoid him forever.

386
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,214
Hey,
you're the chairman of the foundation.

387
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,550
How do you even run the foundation
with such a mindset?

388
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,093
This is how I do things.

389
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,137
Look ahead.

390
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,182
Time is key.

391
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,269
Time is the solution to some problems.

392
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,771
If you can't find a solution now

393
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,275
no matter how hard you rack your brain,

394
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,736
just avoid the problem for now.

395
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,365
If you avoid the problem
for as long as possible,

396
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,161
things could change with time.
Oftentimes, that's what happens.

397
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,166
So for now, give him whatever excuse
you can think of and just avoid him.

398
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,459
Okay?

399
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,087
-What are we eating by the way?
-Jajangmyeon.

400
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,551
I don't know why, but I've been craving
jajangmyeon since this morning.

401
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,678
Jajangmyeon?

402
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,809
I guess you don't want jajangmyeon.
What do you want?

403
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,521
Just say it.

404
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,190
Never mind.

405
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,987
Rosa, don't keep it all inside.
Let it out.

406
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,114
Just say whatever you're thinking.

407
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,075
What do you feel like eating?

408
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,118
I want a drink.

409
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,330
Let's grab a drink.

410
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,250
All right.

411
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,424
Nothing abnormal with electrolytes, right?

412
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,261
That's good. The patient can be discharged
around Friday

413
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,679
and come back next week.

414
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,770
Ji-won, are you upset
because you couldn't go camping?

415
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,233
Then I'll skip the painful shot today.

416
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,235
-Really?
-Yes.

417
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,195
-Promise.
-Promise.

418
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,782
Promise sealed.

419
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,702
He actually doesn't need any shots
from today on.

420
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,496
He'll be discharged tomorrow.

421
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,791
Oh, that kid's older brother is Ji-ho.

422
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,669
He comes by often,
and he's so adorable too.

423
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,214
Jeong-won, get married.

424
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,928
Find yourself a nice lady
and get married soon.

425
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,513
Or have a baby first.

426
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,307
Think about how adorable
your own kids will be.

427
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,310
You hurry up and get married.
You love kids too.

428
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,479
I don't love kids that much.

429
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,024
But I love my nieces and nephews.
U-ju is so cute.

430
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,318
I haven't seen U-ju in a while.

431
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,738
Oh, Ik-jun is gone.

432
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,533
He got a call from the ICU.
He messaged me.

433
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,577
He's busy today.

434
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,079
When is that prick not busy?

435
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,125
Did I leave this here?

436
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,546
Song-hwa, come have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

437
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,258
-Say it.
-Come and sit here.

438
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,260
It's something important.

439
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,184
-Come again?
-I'm Daddy-Long-Legs.

440
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,061
You're Grandpa-Long-Legs?

441
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,316
That's right. I am Grandpa-Long-Legs.

442
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,400
Hey.

443
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,487
You're really something.

444
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,075
That's why you're always broke.

445
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,746
Gosh, how can you live like that?

446
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,165
You're impressive.

447
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,336
I have to say, I have big respect for you.

448
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,004
I'm impressed.

449
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,840
Don't be. I started doing it by chance,

450
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,218
but it just became this big.

451
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,970
Song-hwa, the thing is...

452
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,264
I want you

453
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,892
to be Daddy-Long-Legs from now on.

454
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,480
I've been meaning to ask you
since the spring,

455
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,024
but it's been quite hectic
since I moved to this hospital,

456
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,151
so I couldn't tell you sooner.

457
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,738
If you're okay with it,

458
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:36,284
I'd like you to be Daddy-Long-Legs
in my place.

459
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,374
But how? I don't have that kind of money.

460
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,959
Unlike you, I don't come from money.

461
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,753
I've already figured out a way.

462
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,338
How?

463
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,966
I was given management of all the profits

464
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,885
from the VIP Ward after I renounced
the inheritance of the foundation.

465
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,679
Mr. Ju has agreed to it as well.

466
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,139
But he has no idea
where it's used, of course.

467
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,600
So that money will support the program?

468
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,522
Then why can't you keep doing it?

469
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,441
I'll do it just until the end of the year.

470
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,779
I'll leave the hospital after that.

471
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,286
Later.

472
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,747
I'll tell you guys at once
when we're all together.

473
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,545
So you'll do it, right?

474
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,213
Can I take that as a yes?

475
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,677
Thanks.

476
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,595
No problem.

477
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,603
-Jeong-won, are you really--
-Later.

478
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,773
I'll tell you everything later on.

479
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,946
But the VIP Ward...

480
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,782
Aren't the numbers up and down?

481
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,995
There are only a handful of rooms.
I know they get packed at times,

482
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,414
but the rooms can be empty for months
when it's quiet.

483
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,752
Shall I look into other ways
to fund the program?

484
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,962
No, there's no need.

485
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,424
Someone's pulling in
a lot of money for us at the moment.

486
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,221
Ik-jun, right?

487
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,351
Yes, the word has spread.

488
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,021
High-ranking officials and celebrities are
recommending us to their acquaintances,

489
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,106
so we keep getting new patients.

490
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,611
-That patient will be discharged tomorrow.
-Who?

491
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,612
The Prince.

492
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,449
The Prince of Dubai.

493
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,534
You heard about tomorrow, right?

494
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,761
He said he heard about it from Dr. Lee
and that he's very grateful.

495
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,306
He never thought his mother
would be able to go home this soon.

496
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,058
Both he and his mother are very grateful

497
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,311
for the care that the staff
and Dr. Lee Ik-jun have provided.

498
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,482
This is the balance
after deducting the prepayment.

499
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,110
The bill includes fees for your mother’s
hospitalization,

500
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,736
surgical procedure, and medical tests.

501
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,407
Since she does not have health insurance,
the bill is quite large.

502
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,910
You can pay with a credit card
or in installments,

503
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,787
whichever way you prefer.

504
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,004
He'd like to pay in full in cash today.

505
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,199
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

506
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,411
What are those roses for?

507
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,288
Are you seeing someone?

508
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,331
Hello.

509
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,000
Someone gave you roses?

510
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,835
Yes.

511
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,884
What's up? What's going on?

512
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,137
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Did someone propose to you?

513
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,348
-Well...
-My gosh, seriously?

514
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:29,976
Is everyone here?

515
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,188
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Can you scrub in today?

516
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,441
Professor, it looks like

517
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,611
our dear Gyeo-ul must be dating someone.
My gosh!

518
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,404
What? Really?

519
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,450
That means we've proved to the world
that surgeons can date too!

520
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,451
That's right.

521
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,996
She's the living proof
that shows the world we can date too.

522
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,876
Im Chang-min!

523
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,128
-Gyeo-ul is seeing someone.
-Really?

524
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,130
Congratulations.

525
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,050
See that? Look!

526
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,802
Those of us in GS can date too!

527
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,554
Seriously, dude!
Just look at the living proof.

528
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,390
We can have
a healthy work-life balance too.

529
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,017
Go tell everyone in your department.

530
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,519
A GS resident can see someone,

531
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,437
and get roses and do all kinds of things.

532
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,023
This can happen to everyone in GS.

533
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,191
-Okay?
-Gyeo-ul.

534
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,109
-Never give up.
-Thank you.

535
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,154
You must make this relationship last.

536
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,156
The future of GS depends on you.

537
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,908
All right. Let's calm down.

538
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,245
Let's congratulate her no matter
which surgery she picks today, okay?

539
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,162
Yes.

540
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,373
We'll have a ton of
new GS residents soon, you know.

541
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,959
We can suck it up a little, right?

542
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,043
All right.

543
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,003
Guys, let's all raise our glasses.

544
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,547
-Great idea.
-Here, guys.

545
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,215
-Hey, take this.
-Let's do this.

546
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,509
-My gosh, we should celebrate...
-Hey!

547
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,554
What are you doing? That's not champagne!

548
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,931
-Goodness. Here, guys.
-I opened it.

549
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,433
-It almost exploded.
-Hang on.

550
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,185
Jeong-won! Come and join us.

551
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,979
Celebrate with us.

552
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,314
Gyeo-ul's boyfriend proposed to her today.

553
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,820
I see.

554
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,740
What's with him?

555
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,493
-Cheers, everyone!
-Cheers!

556
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,245
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

557
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,707
Hey, Gyeo-ul.

558
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,128
So what's the verdict?
Which surgery will you assist with?

559
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,421
Have you decided?

560
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,258
Yes, I will...

561
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,472
I'll assist
with the thoracoscopic EA repair.

562
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,766
THORACOSCOPIC ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA REPAIR
PEDIATRIC SURGERY

563
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,733
I've only assisted
with esophageal atresia surgery once,

564
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,736
so I want to observe the procedure
one more time.

565
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,784
Hey, how could you do this to me?
After everything I've done...

566
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,579
I hate you.

567
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,292
Thank you.

568
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,085
No problem.

569
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,218
What? You sold your car?

570
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,389
Yes, I sold it
because I don't need it anymore.

571
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,849
You made money off that clunker?

572
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,437
You have no conscience.

573
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,230
Hey, I sold it for 200,000 won.

574
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,650
Whatever. Anyway, can you try
calling Seok-hyeong again?

575
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,610
-Ask him which song we're practicing.
-Okay.

576
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,781
The person you're trying to reach

577
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,282
-is unavailable.
-He's not answering.

578
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
Does he have an emergency patient
at this hour?

579
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,246
His mother is doing
much better now, right?

580
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,666
Yes, I've been checking in on her often.

581
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,921
Lee Seung-hwan's song.
Oh, I love this song.

582
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,924
He didn't answer when you called
but texted you back?

583
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,092
Yes, right away.

584
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,344
I really don't understand him.

585
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,472
I honestly have no idea
what goes through that prick's head.

586
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,182
We never see eye to eye.

587
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,517
I'd say the same about Ik-jun.

588
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,687
He's my friend, but I can't
figure him out at all sometimes.

589
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,355
Ik-jun? Don't try to understand him.

590
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,024
He's just a nutjob.

591
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,696
Gosh, that nutcase.

592
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,323
"L'ESTRO ARMONICO" BY VIVALDI

593
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,007
Jeez, you scared me.

594
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,218
-You're already here?
-I have a liver transplant.

595
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,387
-What's the song for this week?
-Lee Seung-hwan.

596
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,141
-That song?
-Yes.

597
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,643
What are you listening to now?

598
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,979
You don't know this? It's a famous song.

599
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,066
-I do know this song.
-What is it?

600
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,612
"This stop is Wangsimni.

601
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,489
Wangsimni Station.

602
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,783
The doors are on your right.

603
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,996
Passengers heading
to City Hall, Sincheon, Seongsu, Jamsil,

604
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,124
Oksu, Yongsan, Cheongnyangni,

605
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,460
and Seongbuk,

606
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,504
please transfer at this station."

607
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,484
He's crazy.

608
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,197
The potassium level is 6.5.

609
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,536
Listen. Your potassium level is 6.5.

610
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,748
This is very serious.
It may cause an arrhythmia. Okay?

611
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,376
You must get an enema.

612
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,338
I won't do it. I don't want to get one.

613
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,549
Even if you don't want it,
it would be very dangerous if you don't.

614
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,260
Worst-case scenario, you may die from it.

615
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,305
I'd rather die than get an enema.

616
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,765
Pardon?

617
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,850
I really hate getting an enema.

618
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,938
It's too painful and exhausting.

619
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:07,980
It's

620
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,109
humiliating.

621
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,903
Look.

622
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,241
Your potassium level yesterday was 6.
And it's 6.5 today.

623
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:22,078
If it reaches 7 or 8, it'd be high
enough to cause a cardiac arrest.

624
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,374
You must get an enema now
to keep yourself alive!

625
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,001
I won't do it.
I won't do it even if it means I die.

626
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,379
I'm telling you I don't want to.

627
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,466
Don't do it if you don't want to.
I've told you though.

628
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,142
Once Ji-hu discharges gas, he can eat.

629
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,893
So let me know as soon as he does.

630
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,436
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

631
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,234
Hello, Yeong-ji.

632
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,528
Hi, mister.

633
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,489
She's Post-op Day Four.

634
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,075
Her CRP is still pretty high,
so she's still on antibiotics.

635
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,787
Can I take a look?

636
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,330
All right.

637
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,418
Yeong-ji is getting

638
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,045
a new one today, right?

639
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,214
Pardon? Oh, her drip.

640
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,550
Yes, she's getting a new one today.

641
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,640
I don't want a shot today.

642
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,850
No, no.

643
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,935
-I don't want to get shots.
-It's not a shot.

644
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,146
-I won't get the shots today.
-You won't get it today.

645
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,398
Don't cry.

646
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,999
Did you succeed?

647
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,376
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,503
It's okay.

649
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,257
It's Yeong-ji's nap time soon.

650
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,342
I'll try again then.

651
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,929
I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

652
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,556
You don't have to be sorry.
It's all right.

653
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,226
You have a hard job.

654
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,936
This is harder on her mom, probably.

655
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,480
-Bye.
-Bye.

656
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,696
I have ten minutes until my surgery.

657
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,783
That's enough time to eat nurungji,
brush your teeth, and drink your coffee.

658
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,868
I'm just saying I have time.

659
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,123
-What's this about?
-Hello.

660
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,751
Can I talk to you for a second?

661
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,298
What should I do? I don't know what to do.

662
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,804
He was diagnosed with DCMP
and waiting for a heart donor.

663
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,305
His potassium level is seven,

664
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,225
so he needs to get an enema now,
but he refused to get one.

665
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,019
Right. It went up to 7 from 6.5
only over a few hours.

666
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,397
Without an enema,
he really might be in critical condition.

667
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,356
What should I do?

668
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,443
The patient says no,

669
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,320
and Professor Cheon says to follow it.

670
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,448
Professor Kim,
what should I do in this situation?

671
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,828
Should I

672
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,413
just let him be?

673
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
Do you want him to die?

674
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,042
Just go and give him an enema now.

675
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,921
Use all of your vocabulary, intelligence,
emotional intelligence, or superpower

676
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,007
to convince the patient
and give him an enema.

677
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,009
If the doctor gives up on the patient,

678
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,052
he isn't a doctor anymore.

679
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,724
Don't just stand there. Go.

680
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,934
Okay.

681
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,609
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

682
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,372
So tell me.

683
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,376
Did you give an enema
to the strawberry farmer?

684
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,545
Does he keep refusing it?

685
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,048
What now?

686
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,553
I did it.

687
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,180
That's great.

688
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,307
What a relief. How did you convince him?

689
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,893
He said he'd rather die than get one.

690
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,687
I begged him.

691
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,439
-What?
-What?

692
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,692
I kneeled and begged.

693
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,989
I racked my brain,
but I couldn't think of anything else.

694
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,326
So I kneeled in front of him and begged.

695
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,207
I told him he would die today
if he didn't get an enema.

696
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,335
And I said, if he does,
Professor Cheon wouldn't be affected,

697
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,798
but I would probably lose my job.

698
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,512
I begged him to get an enema,
so I don't get fired.

699
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,682
I kneeled and begged.

700
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,731
Aren't I really pathetic?

701
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,110
No. That's freaking cool, Jae-hak.

702
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,990
What a relief.

703
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,952
Did you just call me by my name?

704
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,746
Yes.

705
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:20,960
What?

706
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,841
See you tomorrow.

707
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,677
RESTRICTED AREA

708
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,887
This is Lee Ik-jun.

709
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,724
The one who got paracentesis
this afternoon?

710
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,893
Okay. I'm on my way.

711
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,191
His BP went down,
so I induced some fluids.

712
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,860
I was worried, so I called you.

713
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,195
Good job. You did well, Dr. Jang.

714
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,614
This happens
when you drain out the ascites.

715
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,324
His BP is rising, so let's observe him.

716
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,534
I'm sure he'll pull through.

717
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,244
-Are you on the call today again?
-Yes.

718
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,955
-Two days in a row?
-Three days in a row.

719
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,876
Why did you choose GS, seriously?

720
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,838
Let's watch him for an hour or two.
I'll be in my office.

721
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,424
Jeong-won hasn't gone home yet.

722
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,967
Do you want to get Coke all together?

723
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,637
I have to see a patient. I'll stay here.

724
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,222
Okay.

725
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,183
By the way, where is he?

726
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,352
On the 4th floor in Room 4103
at the main building's Pediatric Ward.

727
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,815
Did you put a tracker on Jeong-won?

728
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,711
You're still up, Yeong-ji?

729
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,592
You should be sleeping right now.

730
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,387
-Doctor.
-Yes?

731
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,432
I got a shot today.

732
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,518
Really?

733
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,895
My gosh, you really got one.

734
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,689
Look at this big, brave girl.

735
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:09,944
Goodness.

736
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,824
How are you so kind and pretty, Yeong-ji?

737
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,327
I can't even get one because it's scary.

738
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,081
Gosh, you're so brave.

739
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,792
Good job. Well done.

740
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,001
Great girl.

741
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,265
Kids don't lie.

742
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,810
Of course, not.
They are not like us, adults.

743
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,939
When it hurts, they say so.
When they are fine, they say so.

744
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,357
They are always honest.

745
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,278
But adults pretend
that they are not sick when they are.

746
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,363
Even if they are recovered,
they fake their sickness,

747
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,156
so they can stay a bit longer.

748
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,701
-What about you?
-What?

749
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,370
So you don't lie?

750
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,833
I'm not sure. Sometimes, I lie.
Sometimes, I don't.

751
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,959
What is it?

752
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:09,962
What?

753
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,839
Don't you like Gyeo-ul?

754
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,929
To the point that makes you
question about becoming a priest.

755
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,439
If you like her, say so.
I'll keep it a secret.

756
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,149
It's not that. What are you talking about?

757
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,319
Are you her spokesperson?

758
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,696
Yes, I'm her agent.

759
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,491
She's been handling all the tasks

760
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,577
including the chief resident's
since her first year.

761
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,203
But she never shows how hard it is.

762
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,165
We would understand
if she complains or gets annoyed.

763
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,000
She might sulk,

764
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,669
but she doesn't give up or complain.

765
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:55,049
It's just that she has a hard time
sympathizing with people,

766
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,010
but it looks like
she's trying to correct it these days.

767
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,804
Anyway, even in the OR, I've never seen

768
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,848
a resident in her year
tie as well as she does.

769
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,601
She's been practicing that by herself.

770
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,187
She cares about the patients
and tries to learn.

771
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,981
I love her mindset as a surgeon.
It's impressive.

772
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,983
-I know that, too.
-I'm not done.

773
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,362
That's why I want her to be happy

774
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,660
with my friend, Jeong-won.

775
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,336
I want her to be happy with my friend.

776
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,213
Gosh, get away from me.
What's wrong with you?

777
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,801
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Is he okay?

778
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,637
That's great news. I'll be there. Okay.

779
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,723
I'll get going. Gyeo-ul is looking for me.

780
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,059
Okay. Bye.

781
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,193
Jeong-won, I'm sure He will understand.

782
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,862
Besides, when your brain and heart
are saying two different things,

783
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,032
your heart is right.

784
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,080
Hey. Come on.

785
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:11,667
Just follow your heart,
then you won't regret it.

786
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,878
Don't make your decisions rashly
and end up like me.

787
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,838
Think carefully.

788
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,091
Thinking that you'll be fine
is asking for luck.

789
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,926
And that kind of luck doesn't happen.

790
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,387
I'll stop nagging for today. Bye.

791
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,624
I gave you

792
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,045
A beautiful bouquet of flowers once

793
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:44,176
The radiating flowers and fragrance

794
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,763
Sadly withered away

795
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:52,351
Your beauty now
Is more radiating than the flowers

796
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,397
But your beauty will also wither away

797
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:02,528
But unlike the flowers

798
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:06,240
We will have love for each other

799
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:14,039
You're my loved one

800
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:18,377
I will make a silent promise

801
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:23,924
That I will protect you

802
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,927
Until your tears run dry

803
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,181
In the distant future

804
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:37,604
When we reminisce about this day

805
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:44,361
If we can give each other a kiss

806
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,827
In the whole wide world

807
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,248
For a very long time

808
00:47:56,331 --> 00:48:00,961
Out of all the people

809
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:05,966
I will only love you

810
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,944
What does your boyfriend do?

811
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,198
What does he do for a living?
How can he drive different cars every day?

812
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,951
Is he a car dealer?
Does he sell imported cars?

813
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,080
You only got half right.
The other half is wrong.

814
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,836
Not a car dealer. Is he rich?

815
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,005
-The other way around.
-Is he a car dealer?

816
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,131
Not that.

817
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,261
He's a car dealer,
but he's not your boyfriend.

818
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,888
Yes, he's my younger brother.

819
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,643
He sells imported cars,
but he just got a job at the dealership.

820
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,770
He said he can't be late for work,

821
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,022
so he's staying at my house
for the time being.

822
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,107
His work is not far from my place.

823
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,986
He's dropping me off
because he has to test drive the cars.

824
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,198
But he's such a bother.
Taking the subway is more comfortable.

825
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,992
-But why do you ask?
-Hey,

826
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,246
you still like Jeong-won, don't you?

827
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,336
Goodness.
You'll never make a good con artist.

828
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,338
I can see right through you.

829
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,093
He lies to you
and never says anything nice to you.

830
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:32,803
Do you still like him?

831
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,437
Gyeo-ul.

832
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,400
Let people think he's your boyfriend.

833
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,943
What?

834
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,281
Let's gamble just this once.

835
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,960
Will he buy it?

836
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,462
To pull off a good con,
you must fool yourself first.

837
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,466
Pretend you didn't get dealt a bad hand.
It's a straight flush.

838
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,261
I don't know much about poker.

839
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,641
Pretend that you have a boyfriend,
not a younger brother.

840
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,602
Convince yourself the one who gave you
these roses is your boyfriend.

841
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,189
They should be here soon. Go inside.

842
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,526
Thank you.

843
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,319
If you want to thank me,

844
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,905
you can pick my surgery today.

845
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,282
MEDICAL OFFICE 1, GENERAL SURGERY

846
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,875
Go inside now.

847
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:04,770
You're my loved one

848
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:09,566
I will make a silent promise

849
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:14,488
That I will protect you

850
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,408
Until your tears run dry

851
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:23,455
In the distant future

852
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:27,918
When we reminisce about this day

853
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:35,467
If we can give each other a kiss

854
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:42,766
In the whole wide world

855
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:47,270
For a very long time

856
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,942
Out of all the people

857
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:57,197
I will only love you

858
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,409
In the whole wide world

859
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:05,914
For a very long time

860
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:10,502
Out of all the people

861
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,421
I am grateful

862
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,635
That I met you

863
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,522
Song-hwa.

864
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,566
Let's eat lunch.

865
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,943
You didn't have lunch yet?

866
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,444
Do you know what time it is?

867
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,030
I just finished seeing my outpatients.
Did you eat?

868
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,115
Yes.

869
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,617
But I can eat again.

870
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,036
-Let's go!
-Can Chi-hong join?

871
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,204
He has some questions.

872
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,622
Of course.

873
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,708
Chi-hong is great.

874
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,836
He's kind and studies a lot.

875
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,922
He would've been successful
even if he stayed in the army.

876
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,008
What?

877
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,135
I'm hungry.

878
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,803
Right.

879
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,644
Recite your spell.

880
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,566
This is all for me.

881
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,902
No one will take my food.

882
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,653
Say the last sentence.

883
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,116
I am

884
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,619
-an intellectual.
-Let's eat.

885
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,166
Chi-hong, right here. There he is.

886
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,837
Professor Chae,

887
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,881
I'm trying to write my thesis paper.

888
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,884
Which part should I tackle first?
The introduction or the method?

889
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:44,471
Draw a conclusion first
if you're done with your research.

890
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,641
Use statistics to make tables
and find figures for the thesis paper.

891
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,351
I can help you with the statistics.

892
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,354
-Thank you.
-You didn't have lunch yet?

893
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,314
No. I just finished my surgery.

894
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,943
Hello, Dr. Ahn. Everything is good, right?

895
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,069
You're having a late lunch.

896
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,654
Yes.

897
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,239
You didn't get a tangerine? Here you go.

898
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,741
Thank you.

899
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,202
-One more thing, Chi-hong.
-Yes.

900
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,495
Is Seong-yeong doing well?

901
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,040
-Yes, of course.
-Don't bully him, okay?

902
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,209
I know that you guys wouldn't do that,

903
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,586
but try to be more considerate of him.
Do it openly, okay?

904
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,296
Okay. Of course.

905
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,384
It doesn't bother us,
but I think it bothers him a lot.

906
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,687
Seong-yeong, did you have lunch?

907
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,146
Yes. I did.

908
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,236
I'll say this one last time.
And I'll stop saying it.

909
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,487
Don't do it.

910
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:46,825
Professor Chae was scolded
at the meeting with other professors.

911
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,369
No, she wasn't scolded.
She was disrespected.

912
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,788
It was disrespectful on another level.

913
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,456
They said NS residents were such tools.

914
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,876
If it weren't for Professor Chae,

915
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,045
you would've been crushed to pieces.

916
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,339
I'm sorry.

917
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,174
Dr. Yong, please stop.

918
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,259
That's enough.

919
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,805
Is the intern here?

920
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:10,974
Hello, I'm the intern.

921
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,143
I need to talk to you.

922
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,103
Okay.

923
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,816
Hey.

924
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,028
Don't be scared. Okay?
Just show him what you've got.

925
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,488
What are you saying?
You must be out of your mind.

926
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,990
Are you a kid?

927
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,037
Seong-yeong, it was your fault.
Apologize to him and say you're sorry.

928
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,997
That's the right thing to do.

929
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,665
Okay.

930
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,543
Go to him. I'll buy you a beer next time.

931
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,045
Okay.

932
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,338
Thank you.

933
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,177
Gosh.

934
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,345
Goodness.

935
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,350
Hey, Ik-jun.

936
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,061
What is it, Jun-wan?

937
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,521
Your legs.

938
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,356
What?

939
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,233
How about a drink with me tonight?

940
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:03,902
I have surgery later.

941
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,237
What surgery? You have
a lot of surgeries these days.

942
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,407
I'm doing
Professor Kwon Sun-jeong a favor.

943
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,992
I'm doing a total hepatectomy
on the recipient.

944
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,827
-At this hour?
-Why all of a sudden?

945
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,996
The recipient's blood pressure went down
this morning.

946
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,707
Cardiology had to look at the ultrasound,
so the surgery got pushed.

947
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,085
There was a brain-dead patient,
so Se-hyeok went there.

948
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,044
What is it?

949
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,088
It's nothing.

950
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,632
I just wanted us to talk about stuff.

951
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,883
How about after surgery?

952
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,134
I have a lecture today.

953
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,180
All right. I'll go over to
your house later. later. I miss U-ju, too.

954
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,351
My babysitter's daughter
came to Korea today,

955
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,770
so I gave her a day off
to be with her daughter.

956
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,271
So I'm putting U-ju to sleep today.

957
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,232
What? What's going on?

958
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,317
I'm dying to find out, too.

959
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,154
It's nothing. I just

960
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,116
wanted to talk about life.

961
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,618
Then, it's a load of nonsense.

962
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,621
Just text me. Leave me messages.

963
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,249
Dr. Ahn.

964
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,544
Have you been talking to Ik-sun lately?

965
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,628
Is she doing well?

966
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,588
Yes, we talked yesterday, too.

967
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,675
Around midnight?
Or was it early in the morning?

968
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,095
Really? You guys are really close.

969
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,638
You guys talk late at night.

970
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,932
We are both night owls.

971
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,976
So we talk about a lot of things.

972
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,727
Isn't midnight

973
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,063
too late

974
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,274
to talk to your friend?

975
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,654
That's a load of crap.

976
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,823
Are you a geezer?

977
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,074
It's okay.

978
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,827
But we always talk on the phone
around that time.

979
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,287
"We"?

980
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,039
All right, then.
Is my younger sister doing okay?

981
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,709
Yes. She's doing well.

982
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,502
You probably don't know.

983
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,672
-She got it.
-Got what?

984
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,299
The doctorate program she applied to.

985
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,009
She was the only one who got in.

986
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,304
Did you know she was preparing
to get a doctorate?

987
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,638
I guess she was.

988
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,975
Go on. What happens now that she got in?

989
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,019
It's a three-year program in England.

990
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:05,773
-Really?
-Will she be in England for three years?

991
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,067
Yes. There was only one spot,
and she got it.

992
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,029
Gosh. Seriously. She's so smart.

993
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,698
Does it mean I can't see
my sister for three years?

994
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,951
Gosh. Come on.

995
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,205
If she was planning something like this,
she should have told me.

996
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,457
We're strangers.
No, even strangers know more about her.

997
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,374
I've got to go.

998
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,754
Enjoy your meal.

999
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,609
What's wrong with this guy?

1000
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,821
This is Professor Jeon Jun-woo.
He's a psychiatrist.

1001
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,951
He's two years older than me.
We went to the same college.

1002
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,705
I'm used to his mess,
so it doesn't really bother me.

1003
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,168
This way. Come take a seat.

1004
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,711
Where's coffee?

1005
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,257
My gosh.

1006
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,760
Talk to Jeong-won and get a new office.

1007
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,679
Clearly, this guy needs help.

1008
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,516
Mom, this is why I said
we should drink coffee in the lobby.

1009
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,686
It's nice to see your office.

1010
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,855
I don't want coffee.
I drank a lot of coffee today.

1011
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:28,856
I want some water.

1012
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,404
Everything will be over tomorrow.

1013
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,323
Yes. I'm scheduled to be
at court tomorrow at 5 p.m.

1014
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,285
And you won't be attending,
so I will proceed as we talked about.

1015
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,246
If there are no changes from both parties,

1016
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,124
your divorce will be finalized tomorrow.

1017
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,792
And it will be official.

1018
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,502
Thank you for your help.

1019
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,296
I know you're busy with the hospital.

1020
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,757
Don't mention it.
I'm getting paid for this, too.

1021
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,927
I really like you.

1022
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,722
You're honest.
You remind me of myself a lot.

1023
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,642
Will you be at home tomorrow morning?

1024
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,477
I'll visit you tomorrow morning.

1025
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,479
Why is that?

1026
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,357
Before I head to court,

1027
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,694
I ought to ask her if she had
a change of heart one last time.

1028
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,821
No. You don't have to do that.

1029
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,656
You can just head to court right away.

1030
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,201
My gosh. You still don't trust me.

1031
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:26,414
I still want the divorce,
and I won't change my mind.

1032
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,584
You must be busy in the morning, too.
Focus your energy on another case.

1033
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,503
When you walk out of the courthouse,

1034
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,380
just give me a call.

1035
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,341
Okay. I'll do that, then.

1036
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,052
Thank you. Please do that.

1037
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,348
By the way, why aren't you married?

1038
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,642
Are we talking about me now?

1039
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,479
Well, I mean, you are a fine young man.

1040
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,814
Why won't you get married? You should.

1041
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,901
Mom, are you here to represent
the Marriage Support Committee?

1042
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,196
You tell that to everyone you see.

1043
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,949
Marriage is overrated. Why do you
keep telling people to get married?

1044
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,078
Marriage can be a pain in the ass,

1045
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,998
but I have a handsome
and awesome son like you.

1046
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,626
That's a blessing. Truly.

1047
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,755
So you should get married soon, too.

1048
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,925
I have a girlfriend.

1049
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,929
Right? Of course, you do.

1050
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,515
What does she do?

1051
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,350
She's a prison guard.

1052
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,899
Who? The wife of
the Minister of Education?

1053
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:40,071
Didn't she get a liver transplant
two years ago at Kangwoon Medical Center?

1054
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,825
Yes, she did.
But I guess she needs another surgery.

1055
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,661
It's completely confidential.

1056
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,578
Oh, dear.

1057
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:51,207
Minister Son is my junior alumnus
from high school.

1058
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:56,212
I think this time, he's planning
to donate a piece of liver to his wife.

1059
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:01,843
Come to think of it,
I should call him a former minister now.

1060
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,178
He resigned today.

1061
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,723
He said he wanted to be with his wife.

1062
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,933
Her liver must be failing

1063
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,978
seeing she's getting another surgery
just in two years.

1064
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,021
Her body is rejecting the liver.

1065
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,149
Her face is turning yellow again,

1066
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,902
and her health has gotten worse
than before the transplant.

1067
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,531
On the phone, he asked me to call him

1068
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,452
once we had discussed this
and made a decision.

1069
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,789
But right before he hung up,
he asked me to help him.

1070
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,041
It sounded like he was crying.

1071
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,047
Gosh.

1072
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,468
Why do people get sick when they get old?

1073
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,928
Why? Why is that?

1074
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,890
If I know the answer to that,
I would have won the Nobel Prize.

1075
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,726
Gosh. What should we do?

1076
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,145
I don't know much about her case,

1077
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,023
but as it's her second time,
the adhesion will be severe.

1078
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,150
Performing the surgery itself
will be hard.

1079
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,860
And I'm worried about complications, too.

1080
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,447
That's why Kangwoon Medical Center
is hesitant to accept her.

1081
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,658
Of course. Performing surgery on
a high-profile patient would be hard.

1082
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,452
It's a given to do well.

1083
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,913
If not, it'll harm
the hospital's reputation.

1084
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,750
If I had an excuse,

1085
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,127
I don't want to proceed
with a high-risk operation.

1086
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,629
Are you the surgeon?

1087
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,547
It's not up to you.

1088
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,425
It's up to the doctor.

1089
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,594
Who's going to do the surgery?
It'll be burdensome.

1090
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,179
Minister Son's wife

1091
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,350
wants Professor Lee
to perform surgery on her.

1092
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,560
Really?

1093
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,021
I guess she must have heard about him

1094
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,316
through a VIP patient
who was admitted to our hospital.

1095
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,652
They are saying that Professor Lee

1096
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,196
is the best surgeon
for a liver transplant.

1097
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,532
He is, but...

1098
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,244
My gosh, it's too risky, though.

1099
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:55,331
The success rate for a second transplant
won't be as high as the first one.

1100
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,794
Should I ask Jeong-won first?

1101
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,383
If you think Professor Lee
would be uncomfortable with this,

1102
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,219
I don't even want
to bring this up with him.

1103
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,640
We still have a chance to decide

1104
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,934
if we want to take this case or not.

1105
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,143
Uncomfortable?

1106
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,480
That's not like him.

1107
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,608
But I'll ask him first.

1108
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,070
Let's see.

1109
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,410
ELAPSED TIME

1110
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,622
How is it going with the recipient?

1111
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,584
Can you check how far he got?

1112
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,668
Yes.

1113
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,217
Sir, he got the liver out 30 minutes ago.

1114
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,470
He finished controlling the bleeding,
and is working on the blood vessels now.

1115
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,931
He's almost ready.

1116
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,683
-Already?
-Yes.

1117
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:58,477
We saved at least two hours
in the OR today.

1118
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,322
You're still here.

1119
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,616
I'll check out reperfusion before I leave.

1120
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,035
You're done. Why don't you get some food?

1121
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:18,164
I have to go to the ICU
to check if the donor is doing okay.

1122
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,004
I'm so touched.

1123
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,214
Give me your hands.

1124
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,428
Eat up. And if you want more,
just let me know.

1125
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:34,305
There are boxes of these
in Jun-wan's office.

1126
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,098
Thank you.

1127
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,855
I feel awake now.

1128
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,276
Why are you still here?

1129
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,446
Hi, Gyeo-ul.

1130
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,907
Hi. I'm leaving now.

1131
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,412
Do you have a minute?

1132
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,624
Yes. What is it? Hold on.

1133
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,918
You know, you just said hi to her.

1134
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:06,504
-I did?
-Yes.

1135
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:07,838
-No.
-Yes, you did.

1136
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,924
-I didn't.
-You even called her name.

1137
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,676
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

1138
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,052
No! When? What time?

1139
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,136
When did I say that?

1140
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,351
You didn't. Sure. You didn't do that.

1141
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,019
What do you need?

1142
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:23,562
Right.

1143
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:28,693
Two years ago, she got
the living-donor transplant from her son.

1144
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,404
Her condition is really bad
due to chronic rejection.

1145
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,365
She has a severe case of jaundice
and will get CRRT, too.

1146
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,075
She's not well at all.

1147
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:38,953
Let me check my schedule. Wait.

1148
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,579
You'll do it, right?

1149
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,126
I'll try to schedule it at the earliest
as soon as the donor is ready.

1150
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,670
I might have to do it on the weekend.

1151
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:53,050
But doesn't
Minister Son Tae-hwan own a building?

1152
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,343
I heard he has one in Gangnam.

1153
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,554
He's from a rich family.

1154
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,765
If his wife gets the surgery
at our hospital,

1155
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,893
he already promised the chairman
that he will make a donation.

1156
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,313
He'll pay a lot of money
for the medical bills.

1157
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,441
And he'll donate a lot of money, too.

1158
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,318
It'll help
with your Daddy-Long-Legs Program.

1159
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:14,488
You bet. These days, you're the one
making all the money for...

1160
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,282
That's for me.

1161
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:19,910
Hello?

1162
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,121
Okay. I'm on my way. Okay.

1163
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,581
Bye.

1164
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,541
Right.

1165
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,294
Hey, it's about the CUSA.

1166
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,212
Can he donate two or three of those?

1167
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,798
It's a device for dissecting livers.

1168
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,091
The one we have sucks.

1169
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,052
I like his donations,

1170
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,845
but ask him if he could buy
a few of those.

1171
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:39,972
Slide that in, will you?

1172
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,235
Go. I'll clean up.

1173
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,196
Hey, what did you buy this time?

1174
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,698
A wood stove.

1175
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,533
A wood stove.

1176
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,078
Good choice.

1177
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,913
Do everything you want to do
to stay healthy.

1178
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:06,707
Great purchase. Well done.

1179
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:13,089
Goodness. A wood stove? Oh, dear.

1180
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,675
That startled me.

1181
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,277
HYEON JEONG-MI OF SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE

1182
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,822
YULJE MEDICAL HOSPITAL, 78 YEARS OLD, MALE
DETAILS IN YOUR EMAIL

1183
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,669
Ahn Jeong-won, my gosh. This guy.

1184
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:55,047
This wicked, deceitful guy.

1185
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,385
What? Look at the time.

1186
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,928
I have a dinner appointment.

1187
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,013
Let's call it a day here.
See you tomorrow.

1188
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,265
-Okay.
-Okay.

1189
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:05,474
Professor Chae.

1190
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,978
Professor Min Gi-jun
talked to Seong-yeong earlier.

1191
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,982
Professor Min called him
and gave him an earful.

1192
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,025
When I saw him afterward,
he was out of it.

1193
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,946
Given his position at the hospital,
he could teach him a lesson.

1194
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,448
Gosh, Professor Chae.

1195
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,450
Can you curse for us just once?

1196
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,287
Hey, I can be foul-mouthed if I wanted.

1197
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,747
I've never heard you use foul language.

1198
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,499
Can you curse just this once?

1199
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:39,633
Motherfucker.

1200
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,470
You did swear at us,
but it didn't sound like that.

1201
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:46,390
That was completely therapeutic for me.
I've been blessed.

1202
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,607
By the way, I offered to buy him dinner.

1203
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,442
But he said he had plans.

1204
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,985
He's still cheerful, you know.

1205
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,570
He was depressed until the afternoon,

1206
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:02,072
but I guess he was meeting his girlfriend.
He lit up.

1207
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,408
That's me. His dinner date.

1208
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,620
I offered to buy him dinner.

1209
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,538
Professor Chae.

1210
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,498
You even care for interns?

1211
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,625
Can you buy us dinner, too?

1212
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,418
Sure. Why don't we all go?

1213
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,337
-Yes!
-Nice!

1214
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,428
What about dinner?

1215
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,014
I have a lecture. I'm late.
Enjoy your dinner.

1216
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,018
I heard this from Dr. Jang.

1217
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,021
She said Professor Lee did
eight liver transplants just this month.

1218
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,773
He does a lot of surgeries, to begin with.

1219
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:39,568
He did ten of those all by himself
at his previous hospital, too.

1220
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,617
Is it already the fifteenth?

1221
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:47,618
It's a full moon.

1222
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,788
Yes, it is.
It's the 15th on the lunar calendar.

1223
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:51,997
We should make a wish.

1224
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,041
What wish?

1225
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:58,837
Please help Seong-yeong not get hurt
and become a good surgeon.

1226
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,007
-Professor Chae.
-Please.

1227
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:05,344
Do you have
a selfish or materialistic wish?

1228
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,515
I'm going camping this weekend.

1229
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,975
Should I wish for a good deck?

1230
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,142
Something else.

1231
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,520
Well...

1232
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:16,981
None.

1233
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,482
Professor Chae,

1234
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,026
do you want to run for office?

1235
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,033
Aren't you going home?

1236
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,704
You go without me. I have some work left.

1237
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,747
Good work.

1238
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,580
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1239
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,082
-Are you Dr. Do Jae-hak?
-Yes.

1240
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,961
I see. I'm Kim Hae-beom's aunt.
He's the patient in Room 6303.

1241
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,421
I see. Hello.

1242
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,591
I just arrived in Seoul.
I'm finally meeting you.

1243
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,469
Please hold on.

1244
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:32,306
Hae-beom wanted me to bring this now.
But please wait here.

1245
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,952
My gosh, why isn't he going home?

1246
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,373
Come on, just go home.

1247
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,751
You're still here?

1248
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,044
Yes, I'm about to head out.

1249
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,632
Ms. Oh Hye-jun's baby had
a late deceleration.

1250
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,467
But the baby is doing fine now.

1251
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,094
Keep an eye on the baby.

1252
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,096
Notify me
if there's another late deceleration.

1253
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,222
Okay.

1254
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,228
Good work.

1255
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:20,562
Good work, doctor.

1256
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,364
Professor Yang, are you just getting off?

1257
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:31,698
Didn't you leave earlier?

1258
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,034
I forgot something.

1259
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:37,746
Can you give me a ride
to the subway station?

1260
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,874
Well, that's...

1261
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,042
Thank you.

1262
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,564
What are you doing?

1263
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,155
I'm just about
to get off work, too. Ik-sun.

1264
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,491
I just heard it from Dr. Ahn Chi-hong.

1265
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:15,784
So you got in.

1266
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,414
It's all right.
It doesn't matter how I found out.

1267
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:23,959
I bet you couldn't call me
because you were sorry.

1268
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:26,420
Let's talk over the weekend.

1269
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:29,131
Let's find a way.

1270
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:31,758
Okay.

1271
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,971
Okay. Let's talk in person. Goodnight.

1272
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,015
Me, too.

1273
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,537
Thank you for not giving up on me.

1274
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,207
I will remember your kindness
for the rest of my life.

1275
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,181
Jae-hak, let's grab drinks.

1276
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,247
Your car is so clean.

1277
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,708
There's nothing in the car.

1278
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,086
Anyway, you're full of surprises.

1279
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,798
Did I look like I would have a messy car?

1280
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,758
No. I know that you're neat,

1281
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,719
but I didn't know
your car would be this clean.

1282
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,888
I bet your house is spotless, too.

1283
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,140
I'm not neat.

1284
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,642
I don't do anything because
I don't want to clean up.

1285
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:47,686
I don't have a lot of stuff at home.

1286
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,771
Excuse me.

1287
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,399
What is it?

1288
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,403
I'm hanging up. I'm busy. Yes.

1289
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,281
No, go ahead. Why did you hang up?

1290
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:00,741
It's just a guy I know.

1291
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:02,326
He calls me more than ten times a day.

1292
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,119
Ten times? Goodness.

1293
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:06,079
That's too much.

1294
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:12,502
Professor, by any chance...

1295
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,631
You're not being jealous, are you?

1296
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:19,051
What? Jealous?

1297
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,764
Do you like me?

1298
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:27,893
Do I like you?

1299
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,687
My goodness, no.

1300
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:32,397
But I like you.

1301
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,782
That's the station.
Can you drop me off over there?

1302
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:42,824
Right there.

1303
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:50,791
Thank you.

1304
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,229
Professor Yang.

1305
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:16,733
Don't pretend
this never happened tomorrow.

1306
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,737
I told you how I feel about you today.

1307
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,366
Don't pretend it never happened tomorrow.

1308
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:29,162
But you don't have to give me an answer.

1309
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,997
That's not why I told you.

1310
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,459
I just

1311
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,379
wanted to share how I feel.

1312
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,842
I won't make it obvious at the hospital.

1313
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:44,302
I just

1314
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,181
want you to know how I feel. Okay?

1315
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:55,522
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

1316
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,022
Thirty-eight point two.

1317
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:42,986
There.

1318
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:50,368
There you go.

1319
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:55,415
Come here.

1320
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:13,809
-Yes?
-Professor Lee.

1321
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,393
Yu Sang-jun's BP is going down again.

1322
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,354
So I'm giving him fluids
and norepinephrine now.

1323
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:20,357
Increase norepinephrine
and keep checking if he's stabilizing.

1324
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,067
You're giving him antibiotics, right?

1325
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:23,819
I'm on my way.

1326
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,453
His fever isn't going down quickly.

1327
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,541
Did you fly here?

1328
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,147
When did you get here?

1329
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,150
Ten minutes ago. Let's eat breakfast.

1330
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,651
Did you get some sleep?

1331
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:50,572
-No.
-Then, get some sleep.

1332
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,741
I won't be able to wake up if I sleep now.

1333
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,201
You like nurungji, right?

1334
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:57,871
That's the perfect breakfast.

1335
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,006
Give me that.

1336
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,925
-Can you carry them?
-Yes.

1337
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,389
Gosh, this is nice.

1338
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,600
-Do you want more?
-After I finish this one.

1339
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,478
Did you make jangjorim?

1340
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:22,729
My mom sent me that.

1341
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,272
Didn't I cook the eggs perfectly?

1342
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,483
You added just the right amount of salt.
Nicely done.

1343
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,777
Ik-jun, you should get some sleep.

1344
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,236
I'll be fine.

1345
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,405
His fever went down, right?

1346
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,908
Yes. I checked his temperature
before I came out. It was 36.8.

1347
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:36,451
His fever is almost gone.

1348
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,412
My gosh. During the night,

1349
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:43,208
his fever wouldn't go down,
so I got so scared.

1350
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,085
I even asked my mom what to do.

1351
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:49,214
She told me to take off his clothes
and wipe him with lukewarm water.

1352
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,008
When I did that,
his fever was gone right away.

1353
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,221
She's better than a doctor.
Moms are better than doctors.

1354
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,014
I have so much respect for moms.

1355
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,808
Did you call your mom that late?

1356
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,185
What choice did I have? He was sick.

1357
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:03,269
Goodness.

1358
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,314
You should sleep.

1359
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:10,026
Okay, fine. Jeez.

1360
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:13,113
I have an hour.
I'll sleep after breakfast.

1361
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:14,572
You can wake me up.

1362
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,491
Of course. Go to sleep now.

1363
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:17,575
Okay.

1364
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,622
-Ik-jun.
-Yes.

1365
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,042
What have you done for yourself lately?

1366
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:30,422
-For me?
-Yes, you.

1367
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,673
What about you?

1368
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,055
I bought this.

1369
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:40,724
What's that?

1370
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,267
A rack for the logs.

1371
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,060
Why do you need that?

1372
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,188
I need to put logs in the wood stove.

1373
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,898
And this is where I keep the logs.

1374
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:51,860
You can just put them on the ground.

1375
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:52,986
Why did you buy that?

1376
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,030
I bought it for myself.

1377
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,950
I just treated myself with that.

1378
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,702
I was so happy when I bought that.

1379
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:04,581
Okay. Good job.

1380
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:09,461
What about you?
What do you do for yourself?

1381
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,380
What's a treat for you?

1382
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:18,678
Having a meal with you like this.

1383
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,601
Eating with you

1384
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:27,645
and drinking coffee together.

1385
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:31,900
That's a treat I give myself.

1386
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:45,538
Eat up.

1387
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:49,084
It's raining outside.
Can't you hear the raindrops?

1388
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:50,960
Really?

1389
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,213
How can you not know?
You turned out to see.

1390
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,174
-Should I open the window?
-Sure.

1391
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,196
Just leave them there. I'll clean up.

1392
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,239
It's okay.

1393
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,699
You want coffee, right?

1394
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:22,784
Yes, I'll make it.

1395
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:30,333
Did they say it will rain today?

1396
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:33,920
I don't know. Why?
Did the forecast say it would rain today?

1397
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,755
I'm asking because I don't know.

1398
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:36,840
Right.

1399
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,553
This is non-recyclable trash.

1400
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,932
What time does U-ju usually wake up?

1401
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:47,100
Whenever.

1402
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,310
He wakes up when he wants to.

1403
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,271
-What about this? Where?
-Give me that.

1404
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:52,814
-I'll put that away.
-Okay.

1405
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,315
This is food waste, right?

1406
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,067
Yes. Put it in there.

1407
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,152
Okay.

1408
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,238
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1409
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:04,075
Hello.

1410
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,369
Aren't you Ms. Song Su-bin?
Ik-jun's bestie?

1411
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:08,872
Yes, I am. Hello, Professor Chae.

1412
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,833
-Come sit down.
-Okay.

1413
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,502
I didn't know you had a grown-up daughter.

1414
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,754
She's in eighth grade.

1415
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,299
I didn't see this coming at all.

1416
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,343
All of a sudden, she said
her peripheral vision was gone,

1417
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,304
so I took her to an ophthalmologist.

1418
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,432
The doctor told me to see a neurosurgeon.

1419
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,643
But So-mi is okay, right?

1420
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,860
She hasn't had her first period yet?

1421
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:44,365
No. Is that a problem?

1422
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:48,119
I see.

1423
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,541
-Today is D-Day, right?
-Yes.

1424
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,293
Once Mr. Pyeon goes to court

1425
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,421
and delivers the final decision
this afternoon,

1426
01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:00,131
we can put this behind us for good.

1427
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,967
Goodness, we should get a drink tonight.

1428
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,844
Does Jun-wan have a symposium today?

1429
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:07,513
Yes. He said he was
at some hotel in Gangwon Province.

1430
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,098
He must have left by now.

1431
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:13,603
Are you going to get that?

1432
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:14,562
HEAD SECRETARY

1433
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,814
Why is the head secretary calling me?

1434
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,274
Whose head secretary is it?

1435
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:20,818
Chairman Yang's.

1436
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,626
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1437
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,130
-Where is he?
-It's an aortic dissection

1438
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,882
with DeBakey Type One.
His BP is 70 over 40.

1439
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,676
I'm arranging an OR now.

1440
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:47,387
Shit.

1441
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,156
I'll tell her.

1442
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:13,413
Ma'am,

1443
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:15,915
I did perform the surgery.

1444
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,418
But his aorta ruptured,

1445
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,670
so I proceeded with the surgery
while performing CPR.

1446
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,798
But his heart stopped beating for a while,

1447
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,259
so I'm not sure if he'll wake up.

1448
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,137
Let's keep an eye on him for a few days.

1449
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:31,597
And if he still doesn't wake up by then,

1450
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:37,061
he might not be able to wake up at all.

1451
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:41,441
I'm sorry.

1452
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,211
Come here and sit down.
Your legs must hurt.

1453
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:03,129
I'm okay.

1454
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,465
I have something to tell you.

1455
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:06,591
Please sit.

1456
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:11,846
Mom.

1457
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,059
Do you mean it?

1458
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:19,645
Yes.

1459
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,774
I will not divorce him.

1460
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:29,655
Don't go to court to mediate the divorce.

1461
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,701
Tell the court
that I do not wish to divorce him.

1462
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,412
I still

1463
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:40,666
love him.

1464
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,669
Professor Chae, it's my birthday today.

1465
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,295
There's a present I want.

1466
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,965
Song-hwa, I don't know
how I'm supposed to feel.

1467
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:31,175
I don't know if I'm sad or relieved.

1468
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,219
I already talked to the chairman.

1469
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:36,180
Why did you decide something
like that without talking to us first?

1470
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,932
I like you a lot.

1471
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:40,143
So I want to make
only good memories with me.

1472
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,936
What are you talking about?

1473
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,313
This is your last year here?
Did something happen?

1474
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,774
Does it mean
this is Gyeo-ul's first solo surgery?

1475
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:49,694
I'm a nobody to Professor Ahn.

1476
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,238
Professor Chae, do you remember that day?

1477
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:53,781
My first day here as an intern.

1478
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:56,200
I saw you on my first day of work.

1479
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,412
Ask me anything you want.

1480
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,039
Has there been a moment
when you considered

1481
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:05,668
Professor Chae
to be more than just your friend?

1482
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:07,753
In Hawaii? Were you crazy?

1483
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:08,754
It's a secret.

1484
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,756
Especially,
your brother can never find out.

1485
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,177
You're dating her quite long this time.
She must be a catch.

1486
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,803
What I want isn't getting married.

1487
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,763
It's to be with you for a long time.

1488
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,016
Give me your hand.
I have something to give you.

1489
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:30,109
