1
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,227
Buy me dinner, please.

2
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,235
Buy me dinner this weekend, Professor Ahn.

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,240
Sure. Let's have a get-together
with everyone.

4
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,616
Just the two of us.

5
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,247
Just the two of us, outside the hospital

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,332
and not in these scrubs,
but in our personal clothes.

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,804
I have plans.

8
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,725
I need to visit my mother in Yangpyeong.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,394
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,713
-That's awful.
-Hold on.

11
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,965
Let me get this straight.

12
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,009
The real estate agent told the owner

13
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,470
that he signed a contract
to pay monthly rent.

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,388
But Dr. Do signed
a deposit-based apartment.

15
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,934
The agent gave the owner 20 million won
and the first month's rent

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,602
and took the rest of Dr. Do's deposit.

17
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,147
Yes, that's what happened. Jeez.

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,609
What's he going to do now?

19
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,028
He spent his whole life
saving up that money.

20
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,823
He took out
a 100-million-won mortgage too.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,618
He lost all of his money
and has to pay back the interest, too.

22
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,079
-Did the police catch the agent?
-The agent already bolted.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
He reported it to the police,

24
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,625
but they told him
not to keep his hopes up.

25
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,710
Where are they going to live now?

26
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,630
They can live there and pay rent.

27
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,507
The contract is nullified anyway.

28
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,093
The house owner
just wants him to pay rent.

29
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,553
Can't they just stay there?

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,597
Seon-bin, I guess paying 900,000 won
every month must come easy to you.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,975
No. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,768
Don't. You don't have to apologize.

33
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,814
There's nothing wrong
with having rich parents.

34
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,442
Paying 900,000 won every month
is too much. He has to move.

35
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,112
As a matter of fact, they'll stay there
by the end of this week.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,781
His wife will go
to her parents' house in Paju.

37
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,868
And Dr. Do will be staying
at a cheap studio for the time being.

38
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,038
I'm not sure if he'll be able to focus
after all that has happened.

39
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,750
He's probably out of it right now.

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,129
I'm really not interested in it.
I won't do it.

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,257
Have you ever seen me take
a managerial position? I'll never do it.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,426
Do you want to leave
the CS department without a chief?

43
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,428
I'm sure a few professors
would want the position.

44
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,347
Tell Professor Cheon to do it.
He'll have an easier time getting rebates.

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,308
The chairman said
he could never be the chief.

46
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,060
He won't let Professor Cheon take over
except for the CS Department.

47
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,770
He thinks he will cause trouble again.

48
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,314
If he is bound to cause trouble,

49
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,733
he should be investigated
and punished accordingly.

50
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,526
Why would he stop midway through?

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,112
-Exactly. You should take the position.
-Exactly.

52
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,580
Did you tell the perfusionist
that the patient has a left SVC?

54
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,335
Right. I'm sorry. I forgot to check on it.

55
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,962
You didn't confirm it
with the perfusionist?

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,256
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,928
Did you even look at the ultrasound?

58
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,015
What are you doing? Get a grip.

59
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,643
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,936
Do you want the kid to die?

61
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,355
Don't bring your personal life
into the OR.

62
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,773
If you can't do that, leave.

63
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,901
No, I'm sorry.

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,198
I'll insert the vent catheter
in the coronary sinus.

65
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,951
Were you able to reach Eun-won?

66
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,954
No. She was having a hard time
when she was on the night shift recently.

67
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,415
The death of the patient, Yun Mi-seong,
must have hit her hard.

68
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,627
She was already physically tired,
but she lost a patient.

69
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,629
I think that case triggered it.

70
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,258
Of course, it's hard. There is
so much work, but we're short-staffed.

71
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,927
-And she was sleep-deprived, too.
-What happened?

72
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,304
Dr. Myeong Eun-won has been
MIA since yesterday morning,

73
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,472
no word for two days.

74
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,100
What if she never comes back?

75
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,853
-Hello.
-Hello.

76
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,480
Hi.

77
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,565
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

78
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,985
If you hear from Eun-won,
please let me know right away.

79
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,444
Okay. I will.

80
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,571
-Hello.
-Hi.

81
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,703
Let's look at the CT scan.

82
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,208
This is the right side of your liver.

83
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,627
Can you see this mass,
about two centimeters,

84
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,254
deep on the right side?

85
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,883
You have cirrhosis of the liver, too.

86
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,303
From your blood results,
your CEA level is high.

87
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,595
I think...

88
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,683
I do think it's liver cancer.

89
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,352
Oh, no.

90
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,776
It's only two centimeters.
We caught it early.

91
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,445
But for liver cancer,

92
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,239
checking if it's operable or not
is the most important, not the size.

93
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,616
First, we should take an MRI
in order to confirm

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,785
my diagnosis
that it is indeed liver cancer.

95
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,580
We also need to check
if the cancer has spread to other parts.

96
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,416
Surgeries are the best treatment plan
for liver cancer.

97
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,418
If the cancer has metastasized,

98
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,379
we may have to change
our course of treatment.

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,549
Doctor,

100
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,678
will I be able to live?

101
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,265
Of course. You have to live.

102
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,978
I am not sure

103
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,481
if this will comfort you in any way.

104
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,860
If this is operable, it will mean
a huge chance of your survival.

105
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,403
Please don't think it's the end.

106
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,199
Let's be optimistic about it
and wait for the test result.

107
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,327
Doctor, when can he get the surgery?

108
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,246
We want it done as soon as possible.

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,498
Let's get you admitted today.

110
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,375
Let's get you admitted and run tests
that will confirm my diagnosis.

111
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,378
And if it is cancer,
let's check if it spread, too.

112
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,381
Okay.

113
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:27,261
And one of my surgeries
got canceled the following Tuesday.

114
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,931
If the tests confirm that it's operable,

115
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,682
let's get your surgery on that day, then.

116
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,436
However, if the tests show that the cancer

117
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,523
has spread or is abnormal,

118
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,733
the surgery date can be changed.

119
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,611
Once you go out, the nurse will explain

120
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,822
the steps of getting admitted
to the hospital.

121
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,663
You need to stay strong
for your father to stay strong, too.

122
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,040
Okay.

123
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,459
Thank you.

124
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,806
Professor Ahn,
do you have a headache again?

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,184
-Do you want some medicine?
-No, I'm good.

126
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,062
-Did you take her abdominal X-ray today?
-Yes.

127
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,940
How much drainage did she get
yesterday from the tube?

128
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,192
It was 50 two days ago. It's 20 today.

129
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,485
It went down a lot.

130
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,903
Is that so?

131
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,321
Let's see.

132
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,284
My gosh.

133
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,495
It was really green yesterday.
It's transparent today.

134
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,549
You should visit a doctor.
Do you want me to give you a referral?

135
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,843
I'll take care of it myself.

136
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,845
You should introduce Bidulgi to me.

137
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,265
She's very busy right now.
I'll introduce you to her later.

138
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,894
So she is your girlfriend, right?

139
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,105
I'll tell you everything another time.

140
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,611
What's taking Jeong-won so long?

141
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,362
He'll get nothing if he comes late.

142
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:11,908
There he is.

143
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,704
Seeing how he's happy,
his patient must be doing well.

144
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,956
-Or his patient is about to be discharged.
-Hey.

145
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,250
Jae-i is pooping really well.

146
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,628
Is that so? Congrats.

147
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,923
The color is beautiful,
and the shape is great, too.

148
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,427
She poops right away
whenever she eats now.

149
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,930
Her poo is so beautiful!

150
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,641
What about my bread? Where's mine?

151
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,020
We finished all of it.

152
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,690
It's turning into poo now.

153
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,654
Yes.

154
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm on my way now. Bye.

155
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,954
Hey, it's right there.

156
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,292
There are valves in everyone's heart.

157
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,962
The blood flows in one direction.

158
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,130
The valves make sure the blood
doesn't flow backward

159
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
once it passes through.

160
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,511
Usually, one or two valves may leak
or shrink when babies are born.

161
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,346
We often have to perform surgery for it.

162
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,433
But your baby is a very rare case.

163
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,770
All of the valves in his heart
are leaking.

164
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,190
We didn't find anything unusual
from the genetic testing.

165
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,777
I cannot diagnose your baby
with a known name of the disease.

166
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,488
For now,

167
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,075
Hun's heart can't pump blood out of his
heart. The blood keeps flowing backward.

168
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,161
The aortic valve regurgitation
is severe with his case,

169
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,163
so I cannot put him on ECMO, either.

170
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,833
And when he was transferred
to our hospital,

171
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,336
he had brain damage due to either CPR

172
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,213
or genetic defect.

173
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,925
We must induce him with a high dosage
of diuretic to produce a bit of urine

174
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
since cardiac output has
drastically decreased.

175
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,971
He has a severe case of pulmonary edema,

176
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,098
so we can't treat him
with more medication.

177
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,266
What about surgery?

178
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,643
Doctor, if he gets surgery,

179
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,689
wouldn't he be able to live?

180
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,233
The survival rate is about 50 percent.

181
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,286
We perform heart surgery
to improve patients' health.

182
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,704
As for your baby...

183
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,583
But then, again,
surgery is the only option we have.

184
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,919
It's hard for me to tell you
what will happen during surgery.

185
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,006
But we can't let him go
without fighting for him.

186
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,592
I can't guarantee that I can fix him,

187
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,970
but there's no other way.

188
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,059
We should give it a try.

189
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,935
Okay.

190
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,688
All right, then.

191
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,211
You should lean on your back
and tuck your chin in

192
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,379
to avoid herniated discs.

193
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,256
Okay.

194
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,967
Having a sedentary job must be tough.

195
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,636
It's all done.

196
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,723
You're the one with a hard job.
You always go home late.

197
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,809
How did you know that?

198
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,269
You always look so tired.

199
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,814
I see.

200
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,065
MOM'S 70TH BIRTHDAY TRIP ACCOUNT

201
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,900
Will you make another savings account?

202
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,779
You're a long-term customer at our bank,
so you'll get a good interest rate.

203
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,782
I wanted to start a new installment
savings account for 100,000 won.

204
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,034
But I have to get going today.

205
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,537
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

206
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,793
By the way, I heard

207
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,088
that your bank gives out dolls
when the installment savings matures.

208
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,966
Wait, please.

209
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,932
Mom, Song-hwa asked
if this is good enough.

210
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,058
That's perfect.

211
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,688
My gosh, that looks beautiful.

212
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,775
Song-hwa is beautiful and smart,

213
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,152
and has wits like this.

214
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,070
-Why--
-Why isn't she married?

215
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,156
No. Why

216
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,616
doesn't she like my son?

217
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,203
If you marry a girl like Song-hwa,

218
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,248
I could join the Lord even tomorrow
and have nothing to wish for.

219
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,000
Come on.

220
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,335
My son is sensitive and delicate.

221
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,754
You're beautiful like flowers.

222
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,300
And you also easily get hurt like flowers.

223
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,887
It'd be nice if you have
a reliable life partner like Song-hwa.

224
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,806
Mom, you're turning 70 soon.
I'll send you on a trip.

225
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,308
Tell me anywhere you want to go.

226
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,269
I must book it now to get tickets.
And we'll have a birthday party, too.

227
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,438
I'll make sure you're not lonely,
even without Dad here with us.

228
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,690
Your youngest son will throw you
the biggest birthday party ever.

229
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,693
Forget it. I don't want a party.
No more throwing parties, okay?

230
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,905
I'll go somewhere close like
Southeast Asia with Song-hwa.

231
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,533
Or should we go to Jeju Island?

232
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,911
The four of us can go together.

233
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,748
-Why are there four of us?
-I must take Jong-su with me.

234
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,501
He's a lonely man.

235
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,753
What's the point of having
successful and rich children?

236
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,006
He has colorful bruises all over his body,
from his forehead to knees,

237
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,799
because he slipped in the bathroom.

238
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,013
I haven't had it for a while. It's good.

239
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,058
Stop lying.

240
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,435
You always eat ramyeon at home.

241
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,729
I haven't had cup noodles for a while.

242
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,399
Your kids must've been scared.

243
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,610
What did Geon-tae say?

244
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,320
You called him, right?

245
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,030
No, I didn't.

246
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,366
He must be busy at his new hospital.
Why bother him?

247
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,078
What about Tae-ung?
You should at least tell Tae-ung.

248
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,914
He's working on a big lawsuit these days.
He's working all night.

249
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,873
They are both busy.

250
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,919
It's a hassle when the kids come, too.
I'm better off alone.

251
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,009
Hey, Rosa.

252
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:05,970
Me?

253
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,555
I'm in Mr. Kettle's office.

254
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay. See you at the cafe in ten minutes.

255
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,562
Not the one in the lobby.

256
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,565
There's a new cafe
in front of the hospital.

257
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,857
They serve delicious drinks.

258
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,111
Yes. That's the one.

259
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,029
When have you been there?

260
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,657
Good for you.

261
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,785
You go on dates to the cafes
with your son.

262
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,453
Okay.

263
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,500
By the way,

264
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,712
did you appoint a new chief?

265
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,964
No. No one wants to take the job.

266
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,969
Golfing is more fun for old professors.

267
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,514
Young professors prefer
going home early even for a day

268
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,933
instead of getting 300,000 won
for the managerial position.

269
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,479
No one wants to be the chief
because they'll end up working more.

270
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,443
Besides, we don't have
that many professors for NS and CS.

271
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,194
So it's harder to fill in the position.

272
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,949
What about Professor Min Gi-jun of NS?
He's in charge of the Neuroscience Center.

273
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,369
He's in charge of the center,
appears on TV, and YouTube.

274
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,663
He's busy.

275
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,208
Make a young professor
take the position for CS.

276
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,793
Just order someone to do it.

277
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,714
Jong-su, why don't you retire?

278
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,634
Do you think they listen to the director?

279
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,428
They all know exactly what they want
for themselves.

280
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,389
As a matter of fact, I'm going to retire.

281
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,477
Really?

282
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,271
I'll retire after running the hospital
for three more years.

283
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,272
Jeez.

284
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,275
Mom, I have surgery. I've got to go.

285
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,611
-Get something delicious with Mr. Ju.
-Okay. Go on.

286
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,115
CHIEF PRIEST

287
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,411
Father, how have you been?

288
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,372
Jeong-won left his phone here.

289
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,292
I see.
Please relay this message to Andrea.

290
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,128
Go on.

291
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,967
They accepted their recommendation letter.

292
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,259
Congratulate him for me.

293
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,929
They accepted

294
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,849
-the recommendation letter?
-Yes.

295
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,893
I just received the email.

296
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,437
The parish in Naples received
the recommendation letter.

297
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,857
They are willing to accept him,
so they'd like to see him in person.

298
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,945
I told them I would talk to Andrea
when he could be available

299
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,948
for the interview
and call them right back.

300
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,491
I'm sorry, Father.

301
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,910
Jeong-won can't make it to the interview.

302
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,455
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry. I'm hanging up.

303
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,957
My apologies, Father.

304
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,046
Where did I put my phone?

305
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,632
Jeong-won.

306
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,801
Yes?

307
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,096
The chief priest just called.

308
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,891
They accepted your recommendation letter.

309
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
I don't need a fancy 70th birthday party.

310
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,606
I won't be sad
even if you don't throw me a party.

311
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,527
You don't have to do that.
Just stay by my side.

312
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,989
We don't have to live together
or call each other.

313
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,907
Just stay by my side.

314
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,576
Please.

315
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,874
Live a normal life.

316
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,503
That's my last wish.

317
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,105
This won't do it.

318
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,067
Stop talking back to me,
and give me some painkillers.

319
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,944
I notified the doctor,
but I didn't get the order yet.

320
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,071
Please wait.

321
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,239
Mr. Lee Jeong-bae,
I'll take your blood pressure.

322
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,658
The doctor will be here.
I'll dress your wound.

323
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,659
Okay.

324
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,954
Then, are you telling me
that I have to be in pain like this?

325
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,541
Does this hospital just let patients
suffer in pain? What is this place?

326
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,293
Excuse me.

327
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,923
-What's going on?
-I gave him his meds,

328
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,133
-but he keeps asking for painkillers.
-Which one?

329
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,135
An hour ago,
I gave him an ampoule of Tridol.

330
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,304
No, I don't want that one.

331
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,391
What was that called? Pethidine?

332
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,228
I want pethidine
or whatever that's called.

333
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,312
PETHIDINE: A NARCOTIC PAINKILLER

334
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,524
Sir, we cannot give you pethidine
unless a doctor prescribes it for you.

335
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,151
Why do you need a doctor
to give me a shot?

336
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,737
Just give me a shot of pethidine
and leave me alone.

337
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,155
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,324
Can you get me some betadine balls?

339
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,283
Okay.

340
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,746
Come on. Why are you
being so uptight about a shot?

341
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,874
Is giving me a shot that hard? Hey!

342
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,547
A patient is in pain!

343
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,216
I'm in serious pain right now.

344
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,101
You're fine.

345
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,603
The surgery went well.
And the wound is clean, too.

346
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,022
Keep an eye on him for a few hours
and get back to me.

347
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,816
Okay.

348
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,360
All you guys do is cut people open.
You know nothing.

349
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,780
I'm in pain. Okay?

350
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,076
Give me pethidine. Just give it to me!

351
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,203
Hurry!

352
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,123
Are you addicted to narcotic painkillers?

353
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,087
Are you addicted to narcotic painkillers?

354
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,677
We already gave you a drip for the pain
and Tridol an hour ago.

355
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,889
If we give you pethidine on top of this,
you might lose consciousness.

356
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,974
So I can't prescribe it.
Do you still want it?

357
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,103
Forget it. Damn it.

358
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,860
I understand that you are upset.
But you can't just say--

359
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,612
She was fine
when she went to the hospital.

360
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,573
You guys messed up.
That's why she's still stuck in bed!

361
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,451
Listen, sir. The patient,

362
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,412
your wife, had pneumonia
even before the surgery,

363
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,414
so I explained to you she would need

364
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,376
the ventilator for a long time and she may
stay in the ICU for a long duration.

365
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,086
It's okay as long as you explain it?

366
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,465
You say you're her doctor,
but how much time did you spend on her?

367
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,844
Is this how you'll treat your own mother
if she's lying in that bed?

368
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,936
Okay, sir. I'm sorry. Bye.

369
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,024
Who was that? A guardian?

370
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,862
My gosh. That was
the husband of my patient.

371
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,661
She has pneumonia and is old, too.

372
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,247
She's been on a ventilator
for some time after surgery.

373
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,833
I've had a lot of patients lately.

374
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,877
Yesterday was the only day
I couldn't check on her.

375
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,507
I can't believe
he'd just attack me like this.

376
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,552
Why did you choose CS?
There are a lot of other easy departments.

377
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,055
They said I'd get ten million won more.

378
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,600
Not a lot of doctors applied to CS.

379
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,645
They said I'd get ten million won more
on my annual salary if I applied.

380
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,022
That's why I picked CS.

381
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,360
What about you, Dr. Ahn? Why NS?

382
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,780
You're not even well.
Why did you become a surgeon?

383
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,532
I saw a documentary.

384
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,827
Only neurosurgeons did surgery
while sitting down.

385
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,456
There are more surgeries
we do on our feet.

386
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,876
Professor Chae has
a cervical herniated disc.

387
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,671
Exactly. I didn't know any better, then.

388
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,465
What should I do? I'm doomed.

389
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,884
Hello, who is this?

390
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,138
I'm the daughter of the man
that just called you.

391
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,599
I was next to my father.
I'm sorry, doctor.

392
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,684
I see.

393
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,603
My father is having a tough time
because of my mom.

394
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,107
He can't control his emotions well.
I am very sorry.

395
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,526
I see.

396
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,615
Your father was very rude on the phone.

397
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,995
Well, I understand
that this is hard for him.

398
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,581
But treating me like that...

399
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,100
What's going on?

400
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,728
Are you going to a wedding?
You're wearing contact lens.

401
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,647
Yes, one of my school friends'.
But I'm not really close to her.

402
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,234
If you're not close, why go?

403
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,320
She came to my second
and third brothers' weddings.

404
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,404
I should go to hers.

405
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,408
You don't have to go
to everyone's wedding.

406
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,910
What a weary life.

407
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,578
Jeez.

408
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,415
She must be loaded seeing that she's
getting married on a weekday afternoon.

409
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,585
Jeong-won is buying dinner later.
You can't come?

410
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,879
I should go. Father Ahn is buying.

411
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,050
I'll join you guys
straight from the wedding.

412
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,635
Hey, the kettle is hot.

413
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,350
It burns.

414
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,942
How will you do surgery
with these fingers?

415
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,736
My goodness. You should be more careful.

416
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,030
-How old are you?
-Forty.

417
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,992
Hey, hold on.

418
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,703
My pinkie is fine.

419
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,623
Come on.

420
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,128
I don't have

421
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,713
surgery tomorrow.
I have two surgeries in two days.

422
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,006
I think I can do it.

423
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,883
How will you perform surgery with these?

424
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,678
The burns weren't that bad.
Wait, hold on a second.

425
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,932
Hey, did you just turn me
into Demetan Croaker?

426
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,475
You wrapped too much.

427
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,310
You're right.

428
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,231
I wrapped it too much.
I'll fix them later.

429
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,066
Stay like that for now.

430
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,110
I'm leaving now.

431
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,028
You'll leave me like this?

432
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,780
Yes.

433
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,532
You won't die from it.

434
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,700
Bye.

435
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,997
Hey. Wait. Do you want me
to fill the Rainbow Pond with my tears?

436
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,625
Croak, croak

437
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,211
-Didn't you go to the hospital?
-I did.

438
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,297
I went there yesterday and the day before.

439
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,133
-I've been there since 8 a.m. today.
-Hey!

440
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,220
I don't need to get this checked out.
I'm totally fine.

441
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,388
No, you're not.

442
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,933
Did you break your bone?

443
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,351
What did your kids say?

444
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,061
They don't know.

445
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,439
-Why not?
-I didn't call them.

446
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,402
It's not like I'm dying.
Why would I call them?

447
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,113
What do you want? Coffee?

448
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,907
It's decaf, right?

449
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,327
My goodness. This hurts a bit.

450
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,248
You don't know your son's number?

451
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,210
My oldest son

452
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,963
moved to a new hospital in LA this summer.

453
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,258
He moved to a new house
and changed his phone, too.

454
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,679
-You can ask your second son.
-He doesn't know, either.

455
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,973
Besides, Tae-ung is busier.

456
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,310
It's been over two months since I saw him.

457
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,230
-Why do you live like that?
-What do you mean?

458
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,523
I'm living a good life
without my children.

459
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,234
Did I tell you to rely on them?

460
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,320
Did I tell you to live with them
and eat together all the time?

461
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,531
They are your children,
and you're their father.

462
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,784
You call your family when you're sick

463
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,577
and celebrate together on happy occasions.

464
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,037
That's what family does.

465
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,289
Why are you all alone? This is pathetic.

466
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,125
-This is annoying.
-My goodness.

467
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:49,130
I'm happy that they are making
good money and living a good life.

468
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,757
I'm fine.

469
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,761
After my late wife got sick,
I got better at eating alone

470
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,056
and doing laundry. I'm doing well, Rosa.

471
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,392
When your wife was sick,

472
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,310
how many times did Geon-tae
and Tae-ung come to see her?

473
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,104
They came only once.

474
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,232
Their own mother was bedridden
for seven years,

475
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,484
unable to move, but they came only once.

476
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,154
How the hell did you raise your kids?

477
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,407
You're frustrating and annoying.

478
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,243
You're such a dimwit!

479
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,958
Song-hwa, here.

480
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:31,089
Give two servings to that table
and three servings to ours, ma'am.

481
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,885
Jeong-won is buying dinner tonight,
so we're at a tteokbokki restaurant, Mom.

482
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,430
Right? Rich people are such cheapskates.

483
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,473
Okay. Goodnight.

484
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,269
Andrea, can we get jjajang tteokbokki?

485
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,355
You two soldiers, go ahead.

486
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,900
Ma'am, two servings
of jjajang tteokbokki, please.

487
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,446
What's the occasion, Jeong-won?
Did your savings account mature?

488
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,991
He did. He put in 100,000 won every month
for three years. It matured today.

489
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,993
He'll send his mom on a trip
for her birthday.

490
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,121
Then, what do you spend your salary on?

491
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,333
What's wrong with your hands?
Are you copying Inside Men?

492
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,667
He recklessly burned his fingers.

493
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,711
The director gave him an earful.

494
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,630
Jeong-won, send your mom to Mojito
and have her drink a glass of Maldives.

495
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,760
Is that funny to you?

496
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,012
I love his jokes.

497
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,018
Jeong-won, you can just tell us now.

498
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,645
-Tell you what?
-I'm sure your father

499
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,357
left something modest in your name
before he passed. Right?

500
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,444
I mean, think about it. You're
the only son left in this secular world.

501
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,487
Thank you.

502
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,282
In fact,

503
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,826
he did pass something down to me.

504
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,079
-What is it?
-What?

505
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,290
He had secretly been

506
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,961
donating two million won
to an orphanage every month.

507
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,303
-It's far from ready.
-I know.

508
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,640
You're no fun at all.

509
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,226
-You're no fun.
-Is it cooked?

510
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,811
I think it was an automatic transfer.

511
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,231
I took that over, so I've been
donating every month since then.

512
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:15,151
Jeong-won, I'll pay for the meal.
That would make me feel at ease.

513
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,029
Guys, it's on me. Eat a lot.
Order as much as you want.

514
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,406
-Will you?
-Yes, that'd be better.

515
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,324
-Do that. That sounds better.
-I saw it coming.

516
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,451
-Can I order some dumplings?
-Go ahead.

517
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,953
Ma'am, two dumplings, please.

518
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,163
Ma'am, give us Sprite and some noodles.

519
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,541
-And some Coke, please.
-I want cheese, too.

520
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:33,920
Guys, no. I can totally pay for this.
My savings account matured today.

521
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,381
-I said I was buying.
-No, that's okay.

522
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,633
It's like taking money from a poor man.

523
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,178
Ma'am, two servings of tteokbokki
for to-go, please.

524
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,305
I want my takeout cooked, please.

525
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,063
Seok-hyeong, how's your mother?

526
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,899
What do you think?
It's back to square one.

527
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,445
My goodness,
have some mercy on us, merciful Buddha.

528
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,030
I bet she won't divorce him now.

529
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,033
Exactly. She won't divorce him
no matter what.

530
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,994
I don't know what to do now.

531
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,039
She won't divorce him
even if he gives her all of his properties

532
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,666
and the entire company.

533
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,586
Seok-hyeong. Then,
will all the buildings and properties

534
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,629
be yours when your mother passes away?

535
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,631
Probably.

536
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:23,136
Hey, can you list me and U-ju
under your family register?

537
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,891
You don't have any children anyway.

538
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,144
Adopt me and U-ju as your sons.

539
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,107
It's only a ten-story building.
And a lot of stores are vacant anyway.

540
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,901
And don't you know my mom?

541
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,653
She'd rather have them vacant
than renting them out.

542
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,113
Right. That's true.

543
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,200
Right. Dad.

544
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,703
Did the resident who went MIA come back?

545
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,747
Not yet. How did you know?

546
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,832
My gosh. My son is so nosy.

547
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,460
I heard people talk.
Everyone at the hospital knows.

548
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,505
I heard that, too.
It must've been hard on the resident.

549
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,590
Be nice to her when she comes back.

550
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,092
Of course.

551
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,028
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

552
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,199
I hope you have some time for a snack.

553
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,370
Totally. Yes.

554
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,337
It's non-alcoholic.

555
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:44,592
If I don't drink this today,
I might go crazy and cause a scene.

556
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,354
I'll be on night shifts forever.

557
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,316
I was on a night shift yesterday,
and today as well.

558
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,734
I'll be on call tomorrow, too.

559
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,615
My colleague isn't helpful at all.
She's such a pain in the ass.

560
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,286
Is she the only one having a hard time?

561
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,996
Does she think I enjoy working?

562
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,331
Would I come to work shouting,
"Yes! I get to work!"?

563
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,716
Ms. Han, had I known
it would be this hard,

564
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,553
I would have stayed in the lab.

565
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,348
I was sick of staying in the lab
every day.

566
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,602
I became a doctor
since all I ever did was study.

567
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,479
Look at me.

568
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,441
The only colleague I have
is the sliest colleague ever.

569
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,486
And my professor is
the most slow-witted slug ever.

570
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,913
I'm done.

571
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:01,002
As of today,
my career as a doctor will end.

572
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,962
I'll put an end to this.

573
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,507
I'll go tell the slug tomorrow morning.

574
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,887
Look at me. I'm an excellent doctor,
I didn't run away from my job,

575
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,513
and I'm good to my professors.

576
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,099
Why? Why does he only comfort her?

577
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,602
Eun-won ran away from her job.

578
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,021
I can't reach her.
And she's not even diligent.

579
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,690
Why is he only nice to her? Why?

580
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,157
Min-ha isn't here yet?

581
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,202
Professor Yang.

582
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,205
It's already getting chilly.

583
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,083
Have a cup of hot coffee.

584
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,461
Okay. Thank you.

585
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,464
I'll bring them in.

586
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,257
Okay.

587
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,303
How much drainage?

588
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,264
No, I'll check it myself. Okay.

589
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,645
Please. Please wash my face.

590
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,231
No. I hate touching other men's faces.

591
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,276
Hello.

592
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,363
So cute!

593
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,826
Goodness. I knew I'd find you here.

594
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,703
What?

595
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,705
-Help me wash my face.
-What?

596
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,082
I couldn't wash up last night
and this morning.

597
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,335
You know, it feels like
there are bugs all over my face.

598
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,630
Should I help you take a shower?

599
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,090
What?

600
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,429
But you know that
my showers last an hour, right?

601
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,849
I'll wash your face.

602
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,101
But I'll be really thorough with you.

603
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,936
My goodness. Seriously.

604
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,816
You're my last hope, Song-hwa.

605
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,901
I have faith in you.

606
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,989
Sorry. I'll come back another time.

607
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,825
That's fine. I'm done putting them on.

608
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,494
Really?

609
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,832
What happened to you?
It looks like you didn't wash up.

610
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,588
Jeez.

611
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,097
My gosh. Whenever patients see me,

612
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,433
they always ask
when they can wash up and wash their hair.

613
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,019
Now, I get why.
I can finally breathe again.

614
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,313
Should I wrap bandages again?

615
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,398
You can take them off now.

616
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,609
I need to go see the hospital director.

617
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,070
Gyeo-ul caused some trouble.
Let's have lunch together.

618
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,780
Can you wipe my neck a bit more?

619
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,616
My gosh, that feels so nice.
This side, too.

620
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,666
You're all Dr. Jang's supervisors?

621
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,461
Right. She's in GS.

622
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,671
Yes. It's about my patient.

623
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,299
She's with my department this month.

624
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,177
-Did it all work out?
-Luckily,

625
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,930
-yes.
-Gosh.

626
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,557
It turns out he was a real drug addict.

627
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,643
He got out only a month ago.

628
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,395
He probably doesn't want trouble,

629
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,648
so the chief of the CS Department
apologized this time

630
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,151
and we'll reduce his medical bills.
This all got resolved.

631
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:20,326
Getting calls from the CS Department
is the scariest. It really is.

632
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,914
Anyway, tell the residents
to be more careful.

633
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,541
I know their job is hard,

634
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,168
but what's the point
of treating patients day and night?

635
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,921
If they say a word wrong,
we get complaints right away.

636
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,883
Then, the hospital has to comply
with all of their demands.

637
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,680
And if that happens, we really
might end up with serious problems.

638
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,893
Thank you for your effort.
I'll talk to her.

639
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,354
By the way,

640
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,775
I don't think
Dr. Jang was completely wrong.

641
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,944
I'll talk to her.

642
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,779
I've got to go.

643
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,365
I need to go. A guardian wants to see me.

644
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,416
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,210
It's all right. Have a good day.

646
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,300
You startled me.

647
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,304
-What are you doing here?
-How did things go?

648
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,889
It all worked out well.

649
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,141
He'll take down the post.

650
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,059
It's all resolved now. Don't worry.

651
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,605
Do you want some coffee?

652
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,984
I heard once I'm past 12 weeks,
my pregnancy is considered safe.

653
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,737
You said nuchal translucency
was fine as well.

654
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,991
Doctor, does it mean
I don't have to worry now?

655
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,536
Actually, there's something
that concerns me.

656
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,792
There's a lot of blood around the uterus
on your ultrasound.

657
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,921
Finding blood in the uterus at 12 weeks
isn't that common.

658
00:36:56,505 --> 00:37:00,176
This may increase the chance
of a natural miscarriage.

659
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,678
She has to rest up and be careful.

660
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,933
If you see any bleeding,
you must come to the ER at any time.

661
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,145
First, I'll prescribe you
with progesterone,

662
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,939
so it can help your uterus stabilize.

663
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,941
Don't worry.

664
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,859
I'll keep checking.

665
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,113
Let's keep this baby safe no matter what.

666
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,854
I texted Jeong-won to come over.

667
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,524
Wouldn't you rather have him
comfort you than me?

668
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,901
No, it's all right.

669
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,112
I'm sorry.

670
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,533
Don't be disappointed
in the director or the hospital.

671
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,244
There are some good days
and bad days, you know.

672
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,579
And keep your chin up.

673
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,540
And something like this happens again,

674
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,709
make a decision based on your principles.
Just do that.

675
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,295
Thank you.

676
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,756
And I don't think

677
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,009
Professor Ahn will come.

678
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,511
He's been staying in PICU these days.

679
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,852
My goodness, Jeong-won.
What's wrong with that punk?

680
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,356
I hope he can be half as nice
to you as he is to my son, U-ju.

681
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,235
You know, he loves kids.

682
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,280
He came over to my house last weekend

683
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,198
and played with my son the whole day.

684
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,120
Did he go to your house last weekend?

685
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,831
-Yes.
-On Sunday, too?

686
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,292
He came on both days. Why?

687
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,589
He told me he had to go
to Yangpyeong last weekend.

688
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,884
He told me that he was busy.

689
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,016
I think I should forget him.

690
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,519
If he's lying to me,

691
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,563
I should stop pursuing him.

692
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,319
Thank you for keeping my secret
all this time.

693
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,404
Thank you for the coffee.

694
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,205
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

695
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,297
Dr. Chu.

696
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,800
Ms. Park Seon-yeong,
the one who gave birth at dawn.

697
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,802
It was a deep laceration,
so I made lots of sutures.

698
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,346
-Is the episiotomy okay?
-Yes.

699
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,681
It was fine after the delivery
before going up to her room.

700
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,308
But I didn't check it afterward.

701
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,811
I'll check on it right away
and notify you. I'm sorry.

702
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,397
Check on patients
once they go up to the ward.

703
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,566
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

704
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,902
Hello.

705
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,368
I'm sorry.

706
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,622
Are you all right?

707
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,833
Yes. I'm sorry.

708
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,253
Don't be at other department's services
for now. Stay on mine.

709
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,629
I'll straighten it out.

710
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,802
My gosh, look at you, Eun-won.
You lost a lot of weight.

711
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,303
Go home early tonight.

712
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,890
No, I'll go home after I finish my work.

713
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,600
Okay.

714
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:41,147
I'll take over your patients who are
getting admitted today and tomorrow.

715
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,484
Dr. Chu, I'm sorry.

716
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,321
Tonight will be the last time
I'll ask you to take my night shift.

717
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,739
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,577
No, it's okay.

719
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,126
Ms. Do Jae-yeong will be coming up soon
after the admission process.

720
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,003
Right. It's today.

721
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,338
Ms. Do Jae-yeong will get admitted
this afternoon.

722
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,008
She's sensitive because
she's coming in because of preterm labor.

723
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,134
Take good care of her.

724
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,762
If the contractions are regular
and her stomach hurts,

725
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,431
check her cervix for dilation.

726
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,767
The baby is only 30 weeks old,
so check the monitor frequently.

727
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,727
Okay.

728
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm going to check on a patient
with contractions.

729
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,653
Ms. Han, this is for you.

730
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,865
-What's this?
-Ms. Do Jae-yeong wrote down

731
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,202
a list of things the medical staff
wants to follow before she gets admitted.

732
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,163
Someone delivered it to me.
You should take a look.

733
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,459
I WANT ONLY MY HUSBAND TO MASSAGE ME

734
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,627
DIM LIGHTING WITH CANDLES

735
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,837
ALL THE STAFF MUST BE FEMALE
EXCEPT FOR THE PROFESSOR

736
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,178
Who spoiled the mood?

737
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,850
He's very tired
from getting all the tests today.

738
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,979
Doctor, when will we have the results?

739
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,649
We'll have them in two days
at the earliest.

740
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,526
Sir, did you eat?

741
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,694
I don't have much of an appetite.

742
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,699
I just want to get the surgery
as soon as possible.

743
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,829
You must eat your meals and cheer up
especially at times like this.

744
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,039
Doctor.

745
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,794
If the cancer spread to other organs,
I can't get the surgery, right?

746
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,339
I heard when cancer spreads,

747
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,052
it spreads quickly,
so I won't be able to beat cancer.

748
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,889
Dad, we haven't gotten the results yet.
Why are you worried about such things?

749
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,893
Also, even if it did spread, you can get
chemotherapy and take medication.

750
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,645
We can fix it.

751
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,772
You seem to know better than me.

752
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,856
Doctor.

753
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,234
I can't seem to eat.

754
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:56,031
All of us couldn't eat at all.

755
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,161
Don't you need to go to work?

756
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,080
I took some days off from work.

757
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,916
It's her teacher certification exam soon.

758
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,876
I told her to go and study,
but she won't listen.

759
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,839
The whole family is on pause right now.

760
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,384
My gosh.

761
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,189
-How about this?
-Pardon?

762
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,651
Why don't we move the patient we just
saw, Choe Jung-won, to a six-person room?

763
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,694
Suggest that to them.

764
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,821
That's a great idea.

765
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,827
-Can you help me?
-Okay, I got it.

766
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,416
Yes, this is Kim Jun-wan. Yes.

767
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,170
My gosh. Come on.

768
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,672
Okay. I'll be right upstairs.

769
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,550
This has to be a déjà vu.

770
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,886
Something like this happened a while ago.

771
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,597
Oh, my head.

772
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,766
He said the guardian
was rude on the phone.

773
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,725
Unbelievable.

774
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,602
He should have just cursed at her.

775
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,271
I'd complain too
if I heard something like that.

776
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,607
Who'd stay quiet when someone says

777
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,567
your father is rude on the phone?

778
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,737
Why does his daughter
have to be a lawyer though?

779
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,697
And she's very well-connected.

780
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,533
I barely managed to stop her
from talking to the TV station.

781
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,328
So, what do they want?

782
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,206
An apology and a handwritten letter?
Forget that.

783
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,624
They don't even want money.

784
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,417
Then what are they asking for?

785
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,295
Proper punishment.

786
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:38,759
They want us to show them
that we're taking this seriously

787
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,429
and how much we want to mend the situation
by penalizing the resident.

788
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,556
So? What did you say?

789
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,475
A pay cut for three months.

790
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,311
A pay cut over something like this?

791
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,523
They're quiet now because I said that.

792
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,651
They said they'd think about it,

793
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,444
which means they're not unhappy with it.

794
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,280
Professor Kim.

795
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,700
Let's just go with this
and get the situation sorted out.

796
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,789
Okay. I have an emergency patient.
Please excuse me.

797
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,332
Hello?

798
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,708
Yes.

799
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,214
I think I'm not living my life well.

800
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,427
I studied for the bar exam
for six long years,

801
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,846
yet I made that ridiculous blunder
when signing my new lease.

802
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,475
And what kind of chief resident

803
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,769
spews such nonsense
to someone who is devastated

804
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,313
because of their ill mother?

805
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,733
Gosh, seriously. What is wrong with me?

806
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,113
I'm bad at my job because I'm dumb.

807
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,866
There's nothing I can do.

808
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,411
My existence is harming others.

809
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,083
Hey.

810
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,335
If you ever run into me

811
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,546
at a hospital somewhere,

812
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,257
don't pretend as if you don't know me.

813
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,218
We've been through thick and thin together

814
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,845
-for years, you know.
-Gosh, please.

815
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,722
What the heck are you talking about?

816
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,348
Have you gone mad?

817
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,184
Why are you quitting? Why would you quit?

818
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,602
I won't let you quit.

819
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,355
You're right.

820
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,816
I sure can't quit.

821
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,321
I'm working the night shift today.

822
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,450
Damn it. I have to go.

823
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,463
Patient Do Jae-yeong isn't here yet?

824
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,256
No, but she's coming up now.

825
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,384
Then I'll check her in before I leave.

826
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,594
Okay.

827
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,679
She's my patient,

828
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,223
but I have to go into the OR now.

829
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,308
Could you please have
the doctor on the night shift

830
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,393
take care of the patient for me?

831
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,271
Oh, sure.

832
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,024
What the...

833
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,321
Hello.

834
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,281
Oh, we're not even set up yet.

835
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,824
Why did you come so early?

836
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,701
The professor left just now.

837
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,453
The C-section ended
just a few minutes ago.

838
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,997
I wanted to help you with the preparation.

839
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,548
Dr. Myeong, you're scrubbing in?

840
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,174
I was expecting the chief resident.

841
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,802
I want to watch and learn.

842
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,887
I still have a lot to learn.

843
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,973
All right, sounds good.

844
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,600
I'll be in my office.
Page me when everything's ready.

845
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,227
Yes, Professor.

846
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,646
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

847
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,277
Dr. Chu.

848
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,070
Yes.

849
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,656
Everything seems okay
with the patient, Do Jae-yeong,

850
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,992
but she doesn't feel any movement.
She wants you to check.

851
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,744
Again? This is the third time,
for God's sake.

852
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,746
Gosh.

853
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,624
The baby is moving.

854
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,294
It's probably just that
you can't really feel it.

855
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,921
Everything looks good,
so we'll just wait and see.

856
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,049
Doctor, did you wash your hands?

857
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,053
Yes, I did. Just before I came here.
Don't worry.

858
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,306
I don't want to be hooked up
to that monitor.

859
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,600
It's so uncomfortable.
Can you take it off?

860
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,059
I can't sleep.

861
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,648
Without it, we can't really see
how the baby is doing,

862
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,858
so we'll be worried.

863
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,652
I know it's uncomfortable,
but we have to keep it on.

864
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,237
Why don't you just get rid of it

865
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,781
and check in on me more often instead?

866
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,586
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

867
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,971
CHIEF DO JAE-HAK

868
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,611
I'm not even the backup
for the night shift today.

869
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,321
Isn't that Professor Cheon's patient?

870
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,864
Yes, that's right.

871
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,991
And he's the backup
for the night shift today.

872
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,453
But when he was leaving,
he told me not to call him.

873
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,996
Jeez.

874
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,832
He told me to just go ahead
and make my own decisions,

875
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,293
but I'm not sure
whether I made the right decision.

876
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,836
How much epinephrine?

877
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,921
She got 0.2 micrograms.

878
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,840
But the BP keeps dropping,
and the test results aren't looking good.

879
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,551
We've been adjusting the setting,
but CO2 keeps filling up.

880
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,637
And her BP is hovering around 50 to 60
at the moment.

881
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,099
I'm wondering if we should open the chest
and do a shunt revision,

882
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,267
but I'm not sure.
What should we do, Professor?

883
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,270
All right. If the BP keeps dropping,
try using vasopressin.

884
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,605
I'll be there as soon as I can.

885
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,320
We don't need to open the chest for this.

886
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,866
You watched her well.

887
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,961
Professor Kim.

888
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,512
Professor Kim, I have to talk to you
about something.

889
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,893
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

890
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,856
This is my ex-colleague.

891
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,233
He's been asking me to set him up
with a fellow doctor.

892
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,612
You should meet him.
No more one-sided crush.

893
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,575
It's all right.

894
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,204
It's not all right.

895
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,832
I've already set a time and date for it.

896
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,838
Tomorrow at 7 p.m. Look for a black SUV.

897
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,090
He'll be waiting for you
at the entrance by the ER.

898
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,967
Just go and have dinner with him.

899
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,803
I know you're busy,
but you still need to eat.

900
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:41,932
Okay.

901
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,059
Good. That's what I like to hear.

902
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,562
All right, then. Let's get some sleep now.

903
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,574
ELAPSED TIME

904
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,170
It keeps ripping.

905
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,305
Professor,
it is better than before the surgery.

906
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,015
But it keeps leaking.

907
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,977
There's nothing more we can do.

908
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,855
The annulus is small to begin with,
so we can't tighten it further.

909
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,773
And the leaflet itself
isn't fully developed,

910
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,400
so I keep cutting through it.

911
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,402
I'm just ruining the shape here.

912
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,747
BP is still low.

913
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,166
Professor, this will be difficult.

914
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,711
What did you give?

915
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,796
Epinephrine, 0.05
and five micrograms of dobutamine.

916
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,631
For epinephrine, move it up to 0.1.

917
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,220
JO MUN-JEONG'S BABY, MALE, 3 WEEKS OLD

918
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,389
Epinephrine can go up to 0.2.

919
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,682
Got it.

920
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,910
I'm leaving for the day.

921
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,912
You must have a date.

922
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,955
No, I'm having dinner with my mom.

923
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,711
Patient Lee Su-yeon lost a lot of blood
during delivery. Is she okay?

924
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,339
Well, the bleeding has stopped.

925
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,633
I checked her hemoglobin count.
It's around nine,

926
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,052
and her pulse is around 90.
She's pretty stable now.

927
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,679
Really? She'll be okay, then.
Take it easy.

928
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,064
I'm the only one who's stuck here.

929
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,421
Honey.

930
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,384
Can we talk for a moment?

931
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,938
COMMON TEMPLATE FORMS

932
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,235
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

933
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,072
Doctor, Do Jae-yeong is experiencing
abdominal pain. Can you check on her?

934
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,159
Please?

935
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:49,911
Dr. Chu.

936
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,832
This is the second time, tonight alone.

937
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,919
Okay, I'll go check.

938
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,755
She might be my last patient,

939
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,883
so I should go check on her. Jeez.

940
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,343
DO JAE-YEONG

941
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,309
Hello, let me have a look.

942
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,029
Ms. Do, please stay with us.

943
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,905
This looks like placental abruption.

944
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:26,906
What do we do?

945
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,299
I'll let the professors know.

946
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,768
Professor, Do Jae-yeong needs surgery now.

947
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,102
She passed a lot of blood clots,

948
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,979
and the baby's pulse
is hovering around 80.

949
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,814
Hurry. We need you here
as soon as possible.

950
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,316
Get an OR first.

951
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,734
And call Pediatrics.

952
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,235
Okay, got it.

953
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,414
Professor, we have a pregnant patient
in critical condition. We need an OR now.

954
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,208
She might lose the baby. Please hurry.

955
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,626
It's a placental abruption.

956
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,752
She's bleeding a lot.

957
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,338
Yes, as soon as possible. Thank you.

958
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,591
Doctor, this is Chu Min-ha.

959
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,135
A pregnant patient in week 30
has placental abruption.

960
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,929
We'll begin the surgery right away,

961
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,347
so please come to the OR.

962
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,474
Yes, thank you.

963
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,281
Sir, I'm sorry to ask you this,

964
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,910
but my pregnant patient is
in critical condition, so I'm in a rush.

965
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,163
If you get a speeding ticket,
I'll take care of it.

966
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,208
I'm sorry.
Please drive as fast as you can.

967
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,292
Sure.

968
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,681
Min-ha, call whoever you can
get a hold of and get the baby out.

969
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,974
No one else is available.

970
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,642
The fellow is doing a C-section,

971
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,936
and the chief resident
is performing emergency surgery.

972
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,688
What do I do, Professor?

973
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,690
What if she dies?

974
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,819
I'll be there in five.

975
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,822
Seven minutes, including the time
it takes to go up there.

976
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,241
You may need to get the baby out
before I get there.

977
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,784
You can do it, right?

978
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,328
No, I can't.

979
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,539
I'm only a second-year resident.

980
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,749
Then what? Will you let
both the mom and the baby die?

981
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,002
Go! Get the baby out!

982
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,257
Put me on speaker.

983
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,925
I'll walk you through.

984
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,552
I'll tell you exactly what to do,

985
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,804
so don't worry and just get started.

986
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,308
You got this, Min-ha.

987
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,852
Stay focused.

988
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,235
PROFESSOR YANG SEOK-HYEONG

989
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,209
Hurry, her BP will drop.

990
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,200
Are her vitals okay?

991
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,785
The bleeding is ongoing.

992
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,745
We must get the baby out
as soon as we can.

993
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,913
Professor.

994
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,999
I'll take it from here.
Go to the other side.

995
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,904
The baby's coming out.

996
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,118
Thank you, sweetheart.

997
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,413
Doctor, the baby is alive.

998
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,460
First layer, please.

999
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,961
FIRST LAYER:
TOOLS FOR SUTURE

1000
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,506
Well done.

1001
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,553
You did well, Dr. Chu.

1002
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,598
Thank you, Professor.

1003
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,693
If everything else was good,
a transplant would be an option.

1004
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,322
But unfortunately, that is not the case.

1005
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,949
I'm suspecting a genetic disorder,

1006
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,535
and the brain isn't looking good either.

1007
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,290
The heart too. We can't keep depending
on the ECMO machine,

1008
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,376
so I'm afraid

1009
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,796
there's nothing more we can do.

1010
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,635
Hun must be in a lot of pain now, right?

1011
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,556
We should probably let him go.

1012
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,308
Right, Doctor?

1013
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,441
Honey.

1014
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:40,446
We should

1015
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,074
let Hun go now.

1016
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,869
That poor little thing is suffering...

1017
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,084
Don't give him more inotropes.

1018
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,293
INOTROPICS:
ALTERS MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS

1019
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:58,798
I'm sorry.

1020
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,815
Who is it?

1021
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,024
It's me, Min-ha.

1022
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,151
Come in.

1023
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,367
Have a seat.

1024
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,412
This isn't my mess.

1025
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,788
It's all his.

1026
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,665
Oh, I see.

1027
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,334
Is that a bribe?

1028
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,044
Yes.

1029
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,343
This is perfect. It doesn't look like
I can go home today anyway.

1030
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,808
I'm sorry, Professor.

1031
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,393
For what?

1032
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,604
To tell you the truth,

1033
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,983
I've been thinking
that you're kind of obnoxious.

1034
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,568
I always thought

1035
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,446
you were emotionally sensitive

1036
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:06,199
and detail-oriented
unlike how you come across.

1037
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,953
But I realized you can be
pretty slow-witted at times,

1038
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,830
so I've been bitching about you to myself.

1039
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,334
I'm sorry.

1040
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,964
I could tell what was going on,

1041
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,468
but residents have their own rules,
you know.

1042
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,094
I knew you were stressed out,

1043
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,681
but I just didn't know
how I should get involved

1044
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,934
and sort out the situation.

1045
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:34,894
Sorry.

1046
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,688
For not looking out for you.

1047
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,440
I've been a little...

1048
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:41,818
I mean, a lot.

1049
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,613
My feelings were really hurt, Professor.

1050
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,448
Right, I'm sure.

1051
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,450
I have a lot to learn.

1052
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,287
If something like this happens again,

1053
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,998
I'll step in and get it all sorted out.

1054
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,334
I'm really sorry.

1055
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,837
It's okay.

1056
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,090
I said a lot of mean things about you
to myself,

1057
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,800
so let's call it even.

1058
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,686
Min-ha.

1059
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:23,234
I prefer people who are responsible

1060
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,571
over those who are brainy and smart.

1061
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,284
On my way here,

1062
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,077
the taxi had to stop at a few red lights.

1063
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,913
But every time that happened,
I got so anxious thinking

1064
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,748
that you might quit
if we lost the patient.

1065
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,376
Do you know how worried I was?

1066
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,215
I know

1067
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,509
that you'll be a good doctor.

1068
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:55,641
You dealt with it responsibly.
You didn't run away,

1069
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,685
and you did your very best.

1070
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,812
You know what?

1071
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,106
You did an excellent job today.

1072
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,611
Thank you, Professor.

1073
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,279
Go get some sleep.

1074
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,616
I'll answer all the calls
regarding Do Jae-yeong.

1075
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,493
-Professor.
-Yes?

1076
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,747
Thank you for the tteokbokki.

1077
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,334
Ms. Han told me earlier.

1078
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,419
Oh, I see. No problem.

1079
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,714
The day when I totally lost it,

1080
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,009
you went and picked up tteokbokki for me

1081
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,678
and asked everyone
to take good care of me.

1082
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,805
You were the only one who did that for me.

1083
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,852
She told me not to hate
the sensitive slug too much.

1084
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,357
All right. Go get some sleep now.

1085
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,151
Why didn't you tell me any of that?

1086
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,695
If you did,
I wouldn't have bitched about you as much.

1087
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,698
I figured bitching about me
would help you de-stress.

1088
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,451
Anyway, go get some sleep.

1089
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,203
I'm going to wash up.

1090
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,122
Thanks, Dad.

1091
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,708
Gosh, I said I'd take care of the bill.

1092
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,834
Thanks.

1093
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:04,961
-I'd like to pay.
-Sure.

1094
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,545
-I'll pay for the to-go as well.
-Sure.

1095
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,053
Enjoy.

1096
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,014
Thank you for this.

1097
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,349
You came back because of this?

1098
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:21,018
Yes, I was worried about Dr. Chu.

1099
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,854
Please take good care of her.
She must be stressed out now.

1100
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,439
Will do.

1101
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,608
Oh, don't tell her that it's from me.

1102
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,318
-Okay.
-I'm off.

1103
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,361
-Bye.
-Take it easy.

1104
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:44,959
Hi, honey.

1105
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,294
Did you have dinner?

1106
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,590
Yes, I still have some things
to finish off.

1107
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,677
We'll lose

1108
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,930
a beautiful baby soon.

1109
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,558
I have to say goodbye to the baby.

1110
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,144
Yes.

1111
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,479
Okay.

1112
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:12,028
I'll see you on the weekend, honey.

1113
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,738
Yes, thanks.

1114
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,283
I love you.

1115
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,082
My gosh, it sounds like you two are still
in the honeymoon phase.

1116
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,422
What's going on
with your resignation letter?

1117
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,715
What did Professor Kim say?

1118
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,342
Professor Kim Jun-wan

1119
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,138
has no interest
in other people's personal lives.

1120
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,312
Even now,

1121
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,858
he went to say something very cruel
to the couple

1122
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,569
who just lost their baby.

1123
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,468
You must be devastated.

1124
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,721
I'm sorry to have to ask you this,
knowing that.

1125
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:24,850
May I ask you

1126
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,479
to donate Hun's heart?

1127
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,362
It's such a rare condition.

1128
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,866
If I get another patient like Hun...

1129
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,662
I want to save them.

1130
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:48,874
I know this is a lot to ask,

1131
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,795
but if you donate Hun's heart to us,

1132
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,256
we'll study it

1133
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,426
and make sure no other baby dies

1134
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,388
from the same condition.

1135
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,147
It'll be a difficult decision,

1136
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,232
but please

1137
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,402
kindly consider it.

1138
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,158
I'm sorry again.

1139
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:11,165
FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ONLY

1140
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,342
Jo Mun-jeong's baby

1141
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,552
expired

1142
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:26,931
at 11:05 p.m.

1143
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:33,938
Hun...

1144
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,776
Daddy is so sorry.

1145
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,237
I'm sorry.

1146
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:52,581
Daddy is...

1147
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,882
Andrea, have you decided on the date yet?

1148
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,386
Father, I have operations
booked back to back until December.

1149
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,013
The earliest would be
sometime at the end of December.

1150
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,098
Would that be okay?

1151
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,766
Yes, I think so.

1152
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,601
They know all about your situation,

1153
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,145
so they'll be able to make it work.

1154
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,315
I see. I know you're a busy man.
I'm sorry to bother you with this.

1155
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:23,946
No, I'm still trying to persuade Mom.

1156
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,198
Yes.

1157
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,659
Okay, thank you.

1158
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,918
Dr. Do, what brings you to my office?

1159
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,631
Oh, I already spoke
with Professor Kim Jun-wan.

1160
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,177
But I guess he's busy.
He hasn't said anything since then.

1161
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,637
Oh, that.

1162
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,017
It's been sorted out. You didn't hear?

1163
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,604
Oh, does that mean
my letter of resignation was accepted?

1164
01:11:58,188 --> 01:11:59,273
What are you talking about?

1165
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,319
The three-month pay cut.

1166
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,778
It's been all sorted out.

1167
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:05,696
Pardon?

1168
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,448
Really?

1169
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:08,866
Yes.

1170
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:12,202
The chief of CS turned it down.

1171
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:16,290
By "CS," I mean Cardiothoracic Surgery.

1172
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:21,712
Regarding residents, each division's
chief makes the final call.

1173
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,256
And the chief of CS turned it down,

1174
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,468
which means you don't need
to worry about it anymore.

1175
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,011
You didn't know?

1176
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,806
But the chief position for our division
is vacant at the moment.

1177
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,893
It no longer is.
We filled the position recently.

1178
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:37,686
Very recently.

1179
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,322
Hello?

1180
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:50,616
Who is this?

1181
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,660
Hello, Professor. It's Jun-wan.

1182
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,454
Why are you calling so late?

1183
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,084
I'll do it. I'll take the chief position.

1184
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:03,087
What the heck are you talking about?

1185
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,342
Hey, you... You just said you will do it.

1186
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,969
You can't take this back, okay?

1187
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,679
All right. I'm sorry I woke you up.

1188
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,181
Okay, see you at work.

1189
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,522
And Jun-wan... I mean, Professor Jun-wan
spoke with the guardian on the phone.

1190
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,274
They said they'd just let it go
if you apologized.

1191
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,986
And he apologized on your behalf.

1192
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,906
He told them you're one of the residents
he's mentoring

1193
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:34,076
and that he will make sure
it won't happen again.

1194
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,621
I think he was able
to build rapport with them.

1195
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,959
Gosh, Kim Jun-wan...

1196
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,503
He's so good to his students.

1197
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,755
If only he were this good
to his professors.

1198
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,055
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1199
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:01,770
KIM JUN-WAN
AHN JEONG-WON

1200
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:02,729
Who is it?

1201
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:04,565
It's me, Jae-hak.

1202
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,195
Do you have a black suit?

1203
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,531
-Yes.
-Then go get changed.

1204
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:13,991
I'll meet you in the lobby.

1205
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,837
Well...

1206
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,465
In conclusion,

1207
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,260
it hasn't spread.

1208
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,221
-Thank God!
-My gosh!

1209
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,265
Gosh...

1210
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:40,559
My gosh.

1211
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,478
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

1212
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,606
Dad, you're good.

1213
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:46,940
You're good now.

1214
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,152
This means that you can eat now.

1215
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,528
Yes, let's eat.

1216
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,658
No metastasis found
in your chest, brain, and bones.

1217
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,494
Everything looks good,
which is amazing news.

1218
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,455
Now, we can just perform the surgery
as planned.

1219
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,750
It's small,
and we found it at an early stage.

1220
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,419
So keep up with the treatment
after the surgery, and you'll be fine.

1221
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,838
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you.

1222
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,257
-Thank you so much.
-My gosh.

1223
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,760
-Dad, let's eat something.
-Okay, sounds good.

1224
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,137
Dad, this is such great news.

1225
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,188
Am I the only one who's eating?

1226
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,190
-That's right.
-Gosh, congratulations.

1227
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,193
-Thank you.
-I'm so happy for you.

1228
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:33,487
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1229
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:35,822
Congratulations.

1230
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,991
My gosh, thank you.

1231
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,452
Keep up with the treatment,
and you'll recover in no time.

1232
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,914
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

1233
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:47,876
Oh, have you called
your insurance company? I'll show you.

1234
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,253
Thank you.

1235
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,630
He's become much more cheerful

1236
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,007
after he moved to this ward.

1237
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,885
Thank you all for your help.

1238
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:00,597
-Thank you.
-Gosh, we didn't even do anything.

1239
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,140
All we did was chat with him.

1240
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:03,892
That's not true.

1241
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:07,354
You kept him company and cheered him up
when we were running around,

1242
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,439
and you helped us stay strong.

1243
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,818
Thanks to you, we were able
to get through the past few days.

1244
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,028
Thank you so much, all of you.

1245
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,115
-Thank you.
-Then let's have a party!

1246
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,908
-Yes!
-Yes! A party sounds great!

1247
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,869
-Let's do it.
-Let's party!

1248
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:24,121
-Let's do it!
-Yes!

1249
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,668
My gosh, it's such great news.

1250
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,461
-Honey.
-Yes.

1251
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,880
Give the doctors something to drink.

1252
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,340
Oh, okay.

1253
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,051
It's all right. No need.
We're not thirsty.

1254
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:42,180
You must've been in a lot of pain
yesterday. How are you feeling now?

1255
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:43,807
I feel fine.

1256
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,226
Much better than yesterday, for sure.

1257
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,772
Doctor, thank you.

1258
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:53,483
For saving me and my baby.

1259
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,778
Don't thank me.

1260
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,156
You should thank Dr. Chu Min-ha here.

1261
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,203
Dr. Chu.

1262
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:07,664
Thank you.

1263
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,085
I was such a handful, wasn't I?

1264
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,464
I'm sorry. I'm usually not like that.

1265
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,092
I'm really sorry.

1266
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:20,677
No, it's okay.

1267
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,348
I completely understand.

1268
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,976
I would've been the same way.

1269
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:41,239
I'm so glad that both you
and your baby are okay.

1270
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,243
I'm very grateful.

1271
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:52,459
Thank you.

1272
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:57,589
Don't cry.

1273
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:37,796
Hello.

1274
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,756
Yes, hello.

1275
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,933
You're going home early today.

1276
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,061
Yes, I have plans this evening.

1277
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,022
With Dr. Chu Min-ha?

1278
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:57,733
No.

1279
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,743
I'll be off, then.

1280
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:30,807
-Hi, Andrea.
-Hi, Andrea.

1281
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:33,977
Did you see an angel or something?

1282
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,105
Gosh, why are you all spaced out?

1283
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,648
It's cold. Get in.

1284
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,150
Okay.

1285
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,489
"He has cancer."

1286
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:48,617
As soon as I said that,
his whole family just froze.

1287
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,454
His family must've felt like
their whole world was collapsing.

1288
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:54,956
It's something you think
you'd only hear in dramas.

1289
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,044
But it didn't spread,
so his family is having a party tonight.

1290
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:00,045
My gosh, really?

1291
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,297
Yes, with other patients in the ward
and their families.

1292
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:03,757
Before his surgery?

1293
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,674
Yes.

1294
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,844
What a happy family. I envy them.

1295
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,679
Yes, they're such a happy family.

1296
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:12,516
He has two daughters.
But since he checked into the hospital,

1297
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,435
they haven't been going to work
or to the library. My gosh.

1298
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,480
His whole family stopped
doing everything else to look after him.

1299
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:20,982
Gosh. I mean,
it's unfortunate that he's ill.

1300
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,818
But it's so lovely to see.

1301
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,486
That's how a family should be.

1302
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,322
I rarely call my dad,
but they inspired me to call him.

1303
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:30,951
I went to see a patient
who's recovering from her C-section,

1304
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:33,328
and I could just see
how much her husband loves her.

1305
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:37,207
From the way he was looking at her,
I could tell that he loves her very much.

1306
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:41,211
Even I felt the warm fuzzies.

1307
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,421
-Get remarried, then.
-Right back at you.

1308
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:45,882
What about Jun-wan?

1309
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,301
He has plans.
He said we should just do it without him.

1310
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:52,013
Gosh, he's going crazy about this girl.

1311
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,099
Who is he dating?

1312
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:55,809
I'd love to meet her.

1313
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:58,186
With Ik-jun's hand like that

1314
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,563
and Jun-wan bailing on us,

1315
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,356
why don't we just practice another time?

1316
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:03,149
What are you talking about?

1317
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,484
Hey, my fingers are fine.

1318
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,864
Had you not tied them so tight,
it wouldn't have taken this long.

1319
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,991
Doctors who go overboard
are always the problem.

1320
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,242
What the hell?

1321
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,536
I got to the wedding 30 minutes late
because of you.

1322
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:16,788
Why go to a stranger's wedding
to begin with?

1323
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,039
I was late because of you.

1324
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,583
My hand is like this because of you.

1325
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,918
I shouldn't have helped you.
You're banned from my office.

1326
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,045
Jeez, then you're banned
from my office too.

1327
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,714
-Oh, gosh!
-What? What is it?

1328
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:27,173
-Nothing.
-You little...

1329
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:28,466
Jeez.

1330
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:52,449
Around the time
When the stars outside my window

1331
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:57,120
Start to fade away one by one

1332
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,374
I write a letter to the sky

1333
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:07,631
You left me for another man

1334
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:11,384
But I still can't forget you

1335
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:15,013
So I gather my tears

1336
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,517
And send them to the sky

1337
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:24,397
Even if you don't love me

1338
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:28,401
I will lie down by your side

1339
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:34,950
Whenever you need me

1340
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:39,537
Because I can't forget you

1341
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:43,333
I will just keep on loving you

1342
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:48,755
My darling, I will wait for you

1343
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:55,387
When my tear-filled letter reaches the sky

1344
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:03,812
You will come back to me someday

1345
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:08,733
Back to me

1346
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:18,910
I believe that you will, with all my tears

1347
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:19,995
"WITH ALL MY TEARS"

1348
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:34,926
Even if you don't love me

1349
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,680
I will lie down by your side

1350
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:45,103
Whenever you need me

1351
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:49,774
Because I can't forget you

1352
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,445
I will just keep on loving you

1353
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:59,159
My darling, I will wait for you

1354
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:06,249
When my tear-filled letter reaches the sky

1355
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:13,882
You will come back to me someday

1356
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:18,762
Back to me

1357
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:21,931
Doctor...

1358
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:28,897
My darling, I will wait for you

1359
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:35,737
When my tear-filled letter reaches the sky

1360
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:43,536
You will come back to me someday

1361
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,374
Back to me

1362
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:55,673
I believe that you will

1363
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,678
With all my tears

1364
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,448
What is your name?

1365
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,077
Have you been experiencing
dizziness or vomiting?

1366
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:27,205
How's your vision?

1367
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:34,254
-Let's move the patient.
-Okay.

1368
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,717
How are you feeling?

1369
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,052
Stay with us.

1370
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:54,000
I practically begged her on my knees,
in tears.

1371
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,419
I said we should be happy
even if we just had one day left to live.

1372
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,796
The situation was critical,

1373
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,299
so it's still too early to tell.

1374
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,051
Let's wait and see.

1375
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,802
I'm so worried.

1376
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:08,223
Mr. Ju has been diagnosed
with early-stage depression.

1377
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,474
What?

1378
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,060
I think he collapsed
due to ICH in the cerebellum.

1379
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:13,645
Hey, are you all right?

1380
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,689
What's the matter?

1381
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,026
-What?
-The situation isn't looking good at all.

1382
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,527
What do we do? We don't have time.

1383
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:22,528
It's my fault.

1384
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:25,573
I'll take care of it, no matter what.

1385
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:28,284
It's raining. Shall we go for a drive?

1386
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,411
You said you have plans this evening.

1387
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,121
I guess you have no interest
in getting married.

1388
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,374
The guy kept asking her to marry him,

1389
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,293
and Ik-sun liked him enough
to change her mind about it.

1390
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,255
You know that talking about this
is pointless, right?

1391
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,589
What will happen to us?

1392
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,800
Oh, Gyeo-ul is here.

1393
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,718
He lied to you,

1394
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,388
and he's always so cold to you.
You still like him?

1395
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:51,015
Just one month. In a month,

1396
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,475
it'll be all over for good.
