1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,187
Your numbers all look normal.

2
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,231
Just keep an eye on your weight.

3
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,733
But you know...

4
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,319
Strangely, I catch a cold way more often

5
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,822
-after having the liver transplant.
-I see.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,075
I had one nasty winter last year
because of the cold.

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,704
I see. I didn't know that.
Did you get the flu shot last year?

8
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,623
No way. After having the transplant,

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,542
my heart starts beating fast

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,669
whenever I see a syringe.

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,047
Even so,
you should've gotten the flu shot.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,964
I even get it.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,675
We'll call you when your shot is due.
Get it this year.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,013
But you know,
strangely, my skin gets dark spots easily

15
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,016
after getting the liver transplant.

16
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,310
Before the surgery,

17
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,189
people used to tell me that I had
glowing skin like a man in his sixties.

18
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,316
When you go out, do you apply sunscreen?

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,610
My gosh, men don't need that.

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,779
-I don't apply sunscreen.
-Goodness.

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,906
That's why you're getting tanned.

22
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,366
Besides, your skin was tanned,
to begin with.

23
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,828
Is that so? But you know,

24
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,874
after having the liver transplant,

25
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,419
walking for just an hour would make
my legs hurt these days.

26
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,964
When I'm a little bit tired,
I have pins and needles in my legs.

27
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,050
And my back hurts, too.

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,263
Sir, how old are you this year?

29
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,181
Me?

30
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,767
I turned 84 this year.

31
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,611
Come on. What can I do then?

32
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,784
Do you know Park Jong-jin,
an HCC patient who was admitted?

33
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,995
When I told him his tumor had got bigger,
he wanted to talk to you.

34
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,124
I'll go check on my sister first,
then I'll talk to him before I go home.

35
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,625
-Go get some rest.
-Okay.

36
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,468
You should take the next one.

37
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,179
-What?
-Just take the next one.

38
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,433
Third floor. Going up. Doors closing.

39
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,656
Hello.

40
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,616
Hi.

41
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,667
Gosh, this is good.

42
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,796
NAME: LEE IK-SUN

43
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,385
It's so good.

44
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,557
Are you a wild beast?

45
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,561
You should cook that.
We've been using fire for centuries now.

46
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,439
Everything is cooked except for this one.

47
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,067
-Did Mom call you?
-Yes.

48
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,279
She might be onto something.
She called me yesterday and today.

49
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,573
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No, I didn't.

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,742
If I do, I know she'll be worried.
Why would I do that?

51
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,911
I guess Jun-wan is pretty good.

52
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,829
I feel fine. My head just rings a bit.

53
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,289
My gosh, the way you talk.

54
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,750
You'll turn 40 soon.
Don't talk like a kid.

55
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,545
It's been a while since I saw him.
He's so old now.

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,339
Of course. He'll be 40 soon, too.

57
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,425
-Is he not going to get married?
-You should get married.

58
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,511
-Did he come and check on you?
-Four times.

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,182
He came to check on me four times.
He's here all the time.

60
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,351
He must think I'm still in middle school.

61
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,770
Gosh, that's gross.

62
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,106
Nice. That makes it five.

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,446
Say hello, Professor Kim. He's my brother.

64
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,698
Please take good care of her.

65
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm Lee Ik-jun,
Major Lee Ik-sun's older brother.

66
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,413
I truly appreciate the work
you did on her.

67
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,207
Just like she told me,

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,542
you're getting old
as a lonely bachelor.

69
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,004
-My gosh, yes. I am. My apologies.
-Okay.

70
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,090
Seeing how you're goofing around,
you can go home.

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,926
I got the medical certificate
and admission note ready for you.

72
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,053
-You can get discharged tomorrow.
-Okay.

73
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,516
You're not going back right away, right?

74
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,810
She's off for two weeks.
She'll rest up at my house.

75
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,895
You're not going to Changwon?
To stay with your mom.

76
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,648
Gosh, no. She doesn't know yet.
Hand me some tissues.

77
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,070
You know what? Your hospital
must be environmentally friendly.

78
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,697
There are birds here.

79
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,532
Birds? Are there birds inside?

80
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,534
-My gosh.
-Right here.

81
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,206
What should I do?

82
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,339
Being her brother is so hard.
It really is.

83
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,216
Stay still.

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,473
What was that?

85
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,642
It's buljajangmyeon. It's so good.

86
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,352
-Is it spicy?
-Yes, a little.

87
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,981
But it's the best jajangmyeon.  I've tried
it from every restaurant near my base.

88
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,276
But this restaurant
has the best jajangmyeon. It's so good.

89
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,944
You must come and try it.

90
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,406
No matter how good it is, I won't go
all the way there just for jajangmyeon.

91
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,034
How can you never come to see
your sister in Inje?

92
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,453
I visited you when you were in Cheorwon.

93
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,121
That was three years ago!

94
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,832
I'm busy trying to make ends meet.
I look after my son and patients.

95
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,877
I'm busy, too.
I have 300 soldiers under me.

96
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,587
Don't you feel sorry for your only sister?

97
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,714
I'm stuck in Inje,
only eating buljajangmyeon.

98
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,551
Field grade officers get lots of days off.

99
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,554
You're a major in the army,
but all you do is travel.

100
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,222
I didn't get to travel much.

101
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,766
I can't go beyond the border anyway.

102
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,311
No matter what, I'm stuck in Inje.
I ate all downstream trout and salmon.

103
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,980
You always liked sashimi anyway.
You're a sashimi lover.

104
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,941
You eat them because you like sashimi.
Why are you blaming it on the fish?

105
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,401
You said buljajangmyeon was great. If you
can eatÂ that delicious thing every day,

106
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,070
If you can eat that every day,

107
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,238
you'll be happy every day.
Why'd I feel bad for you?

108
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,574
Oh, my. Are you guys rapping?

109
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,743
You two should become rappers.

110
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,953
Actually, we used to practice
rapping together.

111
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,040
When I was in middle school,
and he was in high school,

112
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,501
we entered a comedy contest
as rappers. But we didn't make it.

113
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,878
-A comedy contest?
-That was a long time ago.

114
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,090
By the way, who did you want
to see from the hospital?

115
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,967
-Didn't she come to see you?
-No way. You think she'd come to see me?

116
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm sure she came here to see her friend.

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,932
I was going to see you and my friend, too.

118
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,143
It's my best friend. And my best friend
has to work on the weekends, too.

119
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,437
So I came here to surprise my friend.

120
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,564
Darn it.

121
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,361
-Wait, is it a guy?
-Yes.

122
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,279
-Is he your boyfriend?
-No, he's not.

123
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,115
He's my closest friend in the army.

124
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,243
-I don't think so.
-We're really just friends.

125
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,578
We're like you and Song-hwa.

126
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,080
Salute.

127
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,961
My gosh, Major Lee. How long has it been?

128
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,797
Are you okay now?
Sorry I couldn't come yesterday.

129
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,299
Mr. Civilian. You look great.

130
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,720
-Oh, my. Hello.
-What is this?

131
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,558
It's Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS?
Are you two friends?

132
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,561
Right. You said you graduated
from the Military Academy.

133
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,396
Why didn't I connect the dots?

134
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,022
It didn't occur to me, either.

135
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,400
Now that I know,
your names are very similar.

136
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,026
-Do you know each other?
-Yes.

137
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,904
Hey, by the way, I approve.
I approve of this.

138
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,449
-Of what?
-I like Dr. Ahn.

139
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,285
Gosh. I've got nothing to say if it's him.

140
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,203
-I approve.
-Come on.

141
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,122
Hey, stop that nonsense.

142
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,499
Song-hwa bought the gimbap you like.
Let's go.

143
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,751
-I... Wait. Hold on.
-Just go.

144
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,961
Bye.

145
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,132
Wait. Please take good care of my sister.

146
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,010
She may come across as rough,

147
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,262
but she is really funny.

148
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,347
Okay? You know?

149
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,852
Hurry. Take a seat. Cheers.

150
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,494
A large cup of  iced latte, please.

151
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,162
What do you want?

152
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,248
I'll have some tomato juice. Thank you.

153
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,084
-Who is he?
-A surgical intern.

154
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,336
I see. Hello.

155
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,421
One tomato juice, too.

156
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,217
Say hello. She's a second-year
ob-gyn resident. Dr. Chu Min-ha.

157
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,677
-Hello.
-Is he the only intern?

158
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,346
Are you the only surgical intern?

159
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,473
There's another,
but there's a liver metastasis conference

160
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,641
for a breast cancer patient.

161
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,935
So the other intern
went to the conference.

162
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,063
-I thought you had a lunch date.
-Gosh, it wasn't a date.

163
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,066
He wanted me to buy him lunch,
so I just bought him a meal.

164
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,943
-I'll pay.
-He's eight years younger than her.

165
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
-She's got games.
-Seven years.

166
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,906
-Do you want to chat for a bit?
-I have to go.

167
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,823
Gosh.

168
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,660
-Buy me a cup of coffee, too.
-What would you like?

169
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,329
I'd like an iced latte with a lot of ice.

170
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,830
One more iced latte, please.

171
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,624
You two are like besties.

172
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,293
I've been bothering him recently.

173
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,463
I really can't figure out what kind
of person Professor Yang Seok-hyeong is.

174
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,131
I'm getting a crash course from him.

175
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,425
When it comes to those five members
of the comedy club,

176
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,428
I can describe them in an omniscient
viewpoint as their colleague.

177
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,266
Everything. Their dating history,
families, and what they are really like.

178
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,976
It only takes a cup of coffee.

179
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,895
Yours are ready. You should go.

180
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,122
Hello, when did this happen?

181
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,917
It's been an hour.
He passed out in the shower.

182
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,380
Can you move this leg for me?

183
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,924
All right. And this leg.

184
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,472
He's not a Korean national, right?

185
00:09:59,098 --> 00:09:59,932
Right.

186
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,609
Right now, he's suffering
from an intracerebral hemorrhage.

187
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
If his blood pressure remains high,

188
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,071
the bleeding could get worse
and may lead to death.

189
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,159
I managed to get him a bed in ICU,
so he should stay there

190
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,411
and have surgery
this afternoon or tonight.

191
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,873
Please sign here.

192
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,173
She said she's suddenly discharging blood.

193
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,883
How long has it been?

194
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,761
It's been two to three days.

195
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,931
Is there a lot of blood or does it hurt
like during your menstrual cycle?

196
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,143
Not really. I don't think so.

197
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,355
Just tell the doctor everything.

198
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,857
She can be really shy, you know.

199
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,735
People say that kids these days
are out of control,

200
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,695
but she's so innocent. Goodness.

201
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,989
Then, let me take a look
at her ultrasound.

202
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,866
-Let's do an ultrasound.
-Okay.

203
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,078
Ma'am, you can wait outside.
After the scan, we will bring you back in.

204
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,831
-Okay. Just do it. You'll be okay.
-Mom.

205
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,717
Doctor, do you think
this is implantation bleeding?

206
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,223
Has it been two weeks
since I did it with my boyfriend?

207
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,810
Damn it. I'm totally fucked.

208
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,438
Do you think I am pregnant?

209
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,857
If I am, my mom will kill me.

210
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,695
That motherfucker.
I told him to put on a condom.

211
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,279
Damn it.

212
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,034
Well, we don't know that yet.

213
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,204
Not all vaginal bleeding
means implantation in the uterus.

214
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,123
I see...

215
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,709
Then...

216
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,878
does it mean I can still have sex?

217
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,762
You're an intern. So how old you are you?

218
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,097
I'm 26 years old.

219
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,640
-My gosh.
-My goodness.

220
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,808
He's a baby.

221
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,977
-I'm so jealous.
-Goodness.

222
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,895
Hi.

223
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,439
Hello.

224
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,773
-Sit down.
-Hi.

225
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,193
My gosh, I'm hungry.
Let's do this while we eat.

226
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,404
Here. This is yours, sir.

227
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,031
Goodness.

228
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,909
I'm sorry.
I just finished seeing my outpatients.

229
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,453
My apologies.

230
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,290
You must be Im Chang-min.

231
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,961
Age, 26. Hometown, Cheongju.
You met your girlfriend at school.

232
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,213
You like to drink Tesla, right?

233
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,342
Do you know what that is?
Not the auto company.

234
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,803
It's a cocktail thing.
I haven't eaten yet. I'm starving.

235
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,721
Seriously?

236
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,058
We have to pay for food like this?

237
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,563
My goodness, what a rip-off.
Don't you think?

238
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,570
-Pardon?
-He wants to be discharged.

239
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,322
If he does, he might die.

240
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,990
He can't afford it.

241
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,658
We have the Social Services Department.

242
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,827
They can get some help
even if they are foreigners.

243
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,705
Actually, I looked into that.
This patient doesn't have a passport.

244
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,124
And he can't get
an income certificate, either.

245
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,667
Our hospital cannot help him.

246
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,922
-What should I do?
-Hold on.

247
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,468
Let me characterize those five doctors
in one go. Listen up.

248
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,178
To sum it up,

249
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,599
they should be called Lacking Five.
I could call them that.

250
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,185
I thought you had to go.

251
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,978
What does that mean?

252
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,563
So everyone lacks something?

253
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,316
That's right. Everyone lacks something.

254
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,567
Let's start with Song-hwa.

255
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,527
The only female.

256
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,987
The only female
and their emotional pillar.

257
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,116
In a nutshell,
she doesn't have any weaknesses.

258
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,994
She's good at her job.

259
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,871
And she helps other people, too.

260
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,123
When I have some extra time,
I'll write her biography.

261
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,085
-I heard about her.
-She's better than what you've heard.

262
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,880
Song-hwa is a perfect nerd.
But she likes having fun, too.

263
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,384
She likes having meals with colleagues
and can drink, too.

264
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,678
And sometimes, she acts all crazy.

265
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,597
She's pure-hearted.

266
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,308
Is that possible at her age?

267
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,061
What's wrong with our age?

268
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,899
The Social Services Department
said they would look into it.

269
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,359
-But it may take some time.
-Right.

270
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,903
But I don't think
this patient should be discharged.

271
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,030
-I don't know what to do.
-Hold on.

272
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,494
Yes, Professor Chae Song-hwa.

273
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,621
Didn't you have Grandpa-Long-Legs

274
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,832
or something like that
at your previous hospital?

275
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,584
Jeong-won knows a lot about that.

276
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,836
No, Kangwoon Medical Center's
Social Services DepartmentÂ 

277
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,254
has someone called Hyeon Jeong-mi.

278
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,506
She's the only one
who can directly contact the sponsor.

279
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,258
Okay. Send me her number.

280
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,677
Do you have her phone number?

281
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,345
Okay.

282
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,681
If you give me her number, I'll call her.

283
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,182
Okay. Just a moment.

284
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,643
Right.

285
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,773
Yes, this patient
has an intracerebral hemorrhage.

286
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,734
The bleeding was caused
by high blood pressure.

287
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,069
He must undergo surgery
before the bleeding worsens.

288
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,863
I was wondering if you could help.

289
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,533
-Where is he from?
-He's from Indonesia.

290
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,286
-Professor, I can talk to her...
-He's from Indonesia.

291
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,622
No, we don't have much time.
I'll leave my number.

292
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,124
If you have any questions, call me.

293
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,586
By the way, do you think you can get
Grandpa-Long-Legs on the phone?

294
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,046
We really don't have time.

295
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,382
The patient is in critical condition.

296
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,886
Please get back to me
as soon as possible. Okay.

297
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,599
Usually, the sponsor gets back
to them right away. Let's wait.

298
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,685
All right, then.
We took care of the medical bills.

299
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,603
Where is he now?

300
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,438
He's still in the ER.

301
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,899
Go ahead with the CT navigation
and prep for surgery.

302
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,109
I'll call Anesthesiology
to book an OR.

303
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,527
I'm calling them now. I'll do it.

304
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,112
You go and prep for surgery now.

305
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,406
Hey, it's me.
I'm sending a patient for premedication.

306
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,991
Get me an OR.

307
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,953
All right. Next up is Kim Jun-wan.

308
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,665
Jun-wan is the best surgeon.

309
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,458
But he is...

310
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,127
He's a jerk.

311
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,801
-How's the ultrasound?
-Yes, it's fully blocked.

312
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,345
-It's not bleeding, right?
-Yes. It's fine.

313
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,721
Jae-hak.

314
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,557
Why should we be careful with the AV node?

315
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,311
Why should we be careful with that?

316
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,067
Hey!

317
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,446
Is my surgery that boring?

318
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,740
A bit.

319
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,035
No. Not at all. It's fun!

320
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,543
How could you doze offÂ when
the patient is between life and death?

322
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:48,549
Well, I'm also on the verge of...

323
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,726
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,730
Professor Kim, there's no bleeding.
The surgery went well.

325
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,898
-We'll wrap up the rest.
-Will you?

326
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,984
Yes. Great surgery, sir.

327
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,904
Good job.

328
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,907
-Great surgery.
-Great surgery, sir.

329
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,911
Don't we have footage of TOF surgery?

330
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,204
Yes, sir.

331
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,457
Give him that,
so he can reflect on himself.

332
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,257
Dr. Jang, you're drooling right now.

333
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,844
Dr. Chu, aren't your cheeks too red?

334
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,096
-Is it too much?
-Yes.

335
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,975
I applied it because I wanted
to look three or four years younger.

336
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
You look 34 years younger.

337
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,187
Damn you.

338
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,939
-Next.
-What about Professor Yang Seok-hyeong?

339
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,316
-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes.

340
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,235
Don't you know?

341
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,034
-Me?
-I...

342
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,120
I... Where I live...

343
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,164
Our house.

344
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,917
-Professor Yang.
-Our house.

345
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,128
-Our house.
-Yes, this is Yang Seok-hyeong speaking.

346
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,006
Yes.

347
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,095
He's not social.

348
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,889
One, two, three.

349
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,808
We won.

350
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,102
Don't waste your energy. We have two more.

351
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,729
-One, two, three. Two more.
-One, two, three.

352
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,441
We won, we won again

353
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,486
We won, we won again

354
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,404
We won, we won again

355
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,827
I feel bad for the younger ghosts.

356
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,706
We won, we won again

357
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,964
Who have I missed?

358
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,716
-Professor Lee Ik-jun.
-Dr. Ahn Jeong-won.

359
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,051
Lee Ik-jun, that prick...

360
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,846
He was at the top of his class
when he entered med school,

361
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,305
and graduated at the top, too.

362
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,557
-Really?
-Yes.

363
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,809
Ik-jun had the highest marks
on the medical board exam.

364
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,769
Shouldn't he be the biggest clown instead?

365
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,895
That's what I heard too.

366
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,273
When he was a med student,
he practically lived at clubs.

367
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,566
But he still came out top.

368
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,986
I'm not sure if he's just that smart
or if he studied in secret.

369
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,821
Anyway, a practicum or exam.

370
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,865
It didn't matter.
He always got the highest grades.

371
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,284
But do you know
what this punk doesn't have?

372
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,370
-Modesty?
-Sure. he's not modest, either.

373
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,789
Perhaps, it's because he got it all.

374
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,126
But he doesn't have any
inferiority complex or prejudice.

375
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,920
-He's not twisted at heart.
-Right.

376
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,464
Do they expect anyone to pay
for a thing like this?

377
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,677
This is such a rip-off. My goodness.

378
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
Sir.

379
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:45,309
You always eat meals prepared by others,
but you always seem to complain.

380
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,853
You should just eat it.
It's actually good.

381
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,021
Okay?

382
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,233
Starting now, whenever you complain,
you'll have to pay 10,000 won.

383
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,485
You have to. Okay?

384
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,654
Hey, why would I pay 10,000 won?

385
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,824
That's too expensive.
This meal probably costs less than that.

386
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,785
My gosh. Fine. All right.

387
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,039
-That punk.
-He stopped at 40,000 won.

388
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,666
-Enjoy your meal.
-My gosh.

389
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,252
-So Ahn Jeong-won is the last one.
-Yes.

390
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,588
Jeong-won doesn't have...

391
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,883
-any desire for material possessions.
-Obviously.

392
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,261
His family is super-rich.
Even I wouldn't be materialistic.

393
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,264
Yes, I just wired the money.

394
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,515
And...

395
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,977
once the surgery bill comes out,
I'll cover that, too.

396
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,896
He shouldn't worry
and just get the surgery

397
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,315
Tell him to focus on getting better.

398
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,109
Okay. I got it.

399
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,447
BILLS ARE BEING COUNTED
PLEASE WAIT

400
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,950
WITHDRAWAL: 100,000 WON
BALANCE: 305,000 WON

401
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,244
-Are you supporting a secret family?
-You startled me.

402
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,995
It's payday. Where's your money?

403
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,289
Why did you look at my balance,
you lunatic?

404
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,124
Where did the money go? You prick.

405
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,294
Where do you think?
It went to a good place.

406
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,549
Hey, by the way, we're not getting
any patients for the VIP Ward these days.

407
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,136
Why do you say that? Are you finally
concerned about the hospital now?

408
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,598
It's not about the hospital.
It's just my finances.

409
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,850
-Didn't you read the article?
-What article?

410
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,186
Congressman Sim Yeong-su
will have a liver transplant.

411
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,939
He'll be admitted to the VIP Ward
this afternoon. His surgery is soon.

412
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,816
You're right. I forgot about him.

413
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,569
Hey, I heard that he's taking up
all four of those expensive VIP rooms.

414
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,905
He only needs two rooms
for him and his son.

415
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,908
But he didn't want people to talk
about them and keep things private.

416
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,078
-He booked all four of them.
-Really? He's a VIP indeed.

417
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,539
I should buy some juice and visit him.

418
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,417
Hey, by the way...
What was his son's name?

419
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,460
-Sim Yeong-ho?
-That's right. Sim Yeong-ho.

420
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,713
Didn't he go clubbing
with Ik-jun all the time?

421
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,256
Yes, he's Ik-jun's clubbing bestie.

422
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,550
My gosh, he was such a jerk back then.

423
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,219
What a surprise. Who knew
he'd give his liver to his dad?

424
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,347
-Right? Isn't his son the donor?
-According to Ik-jun, he's a new man now.

425
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,100
Ik-jun met with him last month
for the HLA testing and the consult.

426
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,935
Ik-jun told me he's now softer.

427
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,812
I have some time left.
Shall we eat tteokbokki?

428
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,147
I have to meet with Seok-hyeong.

429
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,357
I have a meeting with him
for a gastroschisis patient.

430
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,276
Hey, don't bring it up
in front of Seok-hyeong.

431
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,404
Don't talk about Sim Yeong-su.
He'll lose it again.

432
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,614
Okay, I heard you.

433
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,085
SEXUAL PREDATOR CONGRESSMAN SIM YEONG-SU
GETS A LIVER TRANSPLANT

434
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,628
HE WAS ADMITTED TO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

435
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,761
HE WAS FINED FOR ASSAULTING A CADDIE
AT A GOLF COURSE LAST MONTH

436
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,432
MOM

437
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,809
Hi, Mom.

438
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,979
Yes. Did you have your lunch?

439
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,065
What did you eat?

440
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,319
Mom, I got paid today.
What should I do with this?

441
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,654
What do I do? Tell me.

442
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:52,120
By the way, did Professor Ahn Jeong-won
date anyone when he was a med student?

443
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,121
Jeong-won?

444
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,998
Well...

445
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,212
By the way,
you guys seem to have a lot of time.

446
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,547
When I was your age...

447
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,264
Did you study
the patient's condition?

448
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,434
Yes. It's called gastroschi...

449
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,521
It's a gastroschisis.
It means a lack of an abdominal wall.

450
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,605
Can you elaborate?

451
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,024
When a baby has its abdominal wall
undeveloped,

452
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,068
its intestines come out of the body.

453
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,612
When was the patient diagnosed
with the condition?

454
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,616
The mother was diagnosed with
gastroschisis 20 weeks into her pregnancy.

455
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,493
And she's 36 weeks into her pregnancy now.

456
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,286
You seem to know better than me.

457
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,956
Does it mean the baby is likely to die?

458
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,792
No. This is a rare condition,
but we get a few patients like her.

459
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,086
Usually, the babies have surgery
as soon as they are born.

460
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,504
They can be healthy again.

461
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,048
Because they must get the surgery
right after they are born,

462
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,467
it's better to consult
a pediatric surgeon in advance.

463
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,929
So there will be a meeting
with the surgical professor today.

464
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,764
Is it okay for us to join?

465
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,517
Those meetings in dramas
seem really serious.

466
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,690
Why not? Can't you just do the surgery?
Let's go with the C-section. Please?

467
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,608
It's not something you can decide.

468
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,944
That's what the mother wants.

469
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,869
Tell him.

470
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,164
I examined the mother.
Her pelvis is in good shape.

471
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,833
And the baby's head
is at around the pelvis, too.

472
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,751
So we think
the vaginal delivery will be easier.

473
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,421
It means she'll give birth naturally.

474
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,756
I'm glad to hear that.

475
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,050
The baby isn't that small, right?

476
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,428
No. The baby isn't too small.

477
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,140
Actually, in cases like this,
some people are concerned

478
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,977
that a vaginal delivery might increase
the chance of infection in babies.

479
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,648
But I can't guarantee that a C-section
would lower that chance, either.

480
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:48,278
More than anything, the mother strongly
wants to have the vaginal delivery.

481
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,280
Okay.

482
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,076
But we don't know
when the baby will come out.

483
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,662
What if I'm in the middle of surgery
when the baby comes out?

484
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,788
You're right.

485
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:04,002
That's why I'll observe her until week 38
and try inducing labor.

486
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,548
You punk. Why didn't you say so?

487
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
Don't laugh.

488
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,346
Hey, think about it. The mother
would also want her pediatric surgeon

489
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,765
to do the surgery on her baby.

490
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,392
She agreed to inducing labor
over a C-section.

491
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,647
With labor induction, we can usually
deliver the baby on the day we want.

492
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,901
I'm glad to hear that. Then, pick a day
when I don't have outpatients.

493
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,110
Sure.

494
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,322
It's been thirty-six weeks
and two days as of today.

495
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,491
I'll make it two weeks from today.

496
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,577
So should we wrap up the meeting?

497
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,079
Yes.

498
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,498
What are you doing tonight?

499
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,251
I don't have any plans.
Do you want to get drinks?

500
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,544
Sure.

501
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,339
What about the other guys?
What's Ik-jun up to?

502
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:53,134
Congressman Sim was admitted today,
so he'll have to stay with the patient.

503
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,849
Is his son the donor?

504
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,434
Yes.

505
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,981
I bet he's putting on a show.

506
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,453
Let's eat first. The meal boxes
just arrived. They are warm.

507
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
Okay.

508
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,875
Here.

509
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,421
All the beds are full today.
Eat when you can.

510
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,589
Thank you.

511
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,300
Jo Je-yeong in Room 6103.

512
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,343
He had a TACE in 2016.

513
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,137
Yes, but there were some lesions left.

514
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,389
So he got the RFA and TACE.

515
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,599
What's TACE?

516
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,351
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.

517
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,813
-Chemoembolization in hepatic arteries.
-"Chemoembolization..."

518
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,735
-Yes?
-This is Room 6110.

519
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,154
The patient is throwing up.
Please come now.

520
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,281
Room 6110? Okay. I'm on my way.

521
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,991
-Room 6110.
-Okay.

522
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,037
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

523
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,873
My husband can't breathe.

524
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,043
He's been having a hard time breathing
for a while. Please come now.

525
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:08,960
-Go.
-Okay.

526
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,763
Nurse, my bed is broken.

527
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,098
I keep pressing the remote,
but it won't come up.

528
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,683
I need to have my dinner.

529
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,394
We can't even have our dinner right now.
Please help.

530
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,146
I'm not the one...

531
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,651
Hold on. Let me go with you.

532
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,406
Where did he go?

533
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,745
Which room was he in?

534
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,835
Su-bin.

535
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,839
Can you tell me if Congressman Sim's son,
Sim Yeong-ho,

536
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,634
is in VIP Room Two or Three?

537
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,261
He's in Room Two,
but you can't see him even if you go now.

538
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,514
-Why not?
-He's quite sensitive.

539
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,724
Only a designated nurse can see him.

540
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,560
Even Professor Gwon Sun-jeong
only got to see him once.

541
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,979
Since he's the donor,
he doesn't have to do a lot.

542
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,523
But he's very cranky.

543
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,524
What?

544
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,901
He's not like that.

545
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,446
His son...

546
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,366
They say
that his son doesn't want to do it,

547
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,910
but he's forced to donate
to look like a good son.

548
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,745
And they say

549
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,582
some private security guards
are surveilling him in case he runs away.

550
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,668
-What are you looking for anyway?
-What?

551
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,798
A guardian came to me
because of a broken bed.

552
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,009
-But I don't know which room he's in.
-Oh, that? I fixed that.

553
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,554
-When?
-A while ago.

554
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,513
How?

555
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,391
It wasn't plugged in properly.

556
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,688
You didn't eat yet, right?

557
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,483
Jeez. You should go and eat first.

558
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,903
I'll sit here and take care
of things here.

559
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,406
No, you should go home.
Your son must be waiting.

560
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,992
Tomorrow is the weekend.
I'll play with him then.

561
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,702
This feels nice. How nice.

562
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,080
What should I watch?

563
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,207
You really look like a single father now.

564
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,792
Right.

565
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,003
Before, I lived the life
of a single father,

566
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,504
but it's even true on paper, too.

567
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,506
I'm really a single father now.

568
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,091
Raising is a kid hard, isn't it?

569
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,093
Being a doctor must be hard enough.

570
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,472
It's hard. But my son...

571
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,852
But I love my son to pieces.

572
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,154
Father, lift me, please.

573
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,532
What should we get?

574
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,327
You get ham and cheese.

575
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,120
So ham and cheese for me. What about you?

576
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,872
I'll get Avoholic.

577
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,876
You'll get Avoholic. And I'm U-ju-holic.

578
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,045
Then, I'm Dad-holic.

579
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,927
Are you a genius? Did I make a genius?

580
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,554
Give me a kiss.

581
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,104
-Have you been here before?
-Yes.

582
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,274
-Who did you come with?
-With Jang Mo-ne. My girlfriend.

583
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,197
-Your girlfriend's name is Mo-ne?
-Yes.

584
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,158
Was it just the two of you?

585
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,703
No, we came here with Mo-ne's mom.

586
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,122
I see. Is that so?

587
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,881
-U-ju.
-Yes?

588
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,801
If you miss your mom,

589
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,303
tell me anytime.

590
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,349
You say the word,
and I'll take you to her right away.

591
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,060
No, I'll tell her to come to you. Okay?

592
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,401
If she doesn't miss me,
I don't miss her, either.

593
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,281
What do you mean she doesn't miss you?

594
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,908
You're wrong. She misses you a lot.

595
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,870
She called me yesterday
and asked how you were doing.

596
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,538
She calls me every day.

597
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,042
I just need you, Dad.

598
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,545
You're my favorite person
in the entire universe.

599
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,470
Dad, are you not going to eat that?

600
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,893
I'm going to.

601
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,440
Father.

602
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,903
Can you buy me one more sandwich, please?

603
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,246
Father, you have a visitor.

604
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,249
Oh, him? It's my younger brother.
He said he'd come see me.

605
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,460
-I don't think it's him.
-What?

606
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,921
He's handsome.

607
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,380
I see.

608
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,683
Were you playing baseball?

609
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,894
No. I came from home.

610
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,980
Do you not have anyone
to spend your weekend with?

611
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,441
I'll go see Mom later.

612
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,819
You are not going on a date? You punk.

613
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,948
You're wasting your best days.

614
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,867
What are you talking about?
Why would I go on a date?

615
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,161
I'm not interested.

616
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,999
By the way,
I still haven't gotten an answer yet.

617
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,836
I sent the recommendation letter
almost two months ago.

618
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,089
You'll get it soon. Just wait.

619
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,507
Oh, that reminds me.

620
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,217
Did you...

621
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,386
Did you tell Mom?

622
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,224
I'm planning to tell her today.

623
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,309
She'll pass out today.

624
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,395
I'm sure she'll understand.

625
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,188
What?

626
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,859
She encouraged all of you
when you were called by God.

627
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,029
I believe in Mom.

628
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,282
She's not like the others.

629
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,035
What?

630
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,038
Mom!

631
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,331
Mom!

632
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,001
Please hear me out.

633
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,502
Mom!

634
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,568
Mom.

635
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm fine.

636
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,744
There are stairs all the way down.
Get on my back now.

637
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,419
All right. Hold on tight.

638
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,387
Mom, should we have
spicy noodles for dinner tonight?

639
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,681
Call Song-hwa.

640
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,141
Ask her to come for dinner.

641
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,852
I really like her.

642
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,979
She's calm and kind.

643
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,731
Why would she join us for dinner?

644
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,608
I told you she's just a friend.

645
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,069
Besides, she's not calm at all.

646
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,488
She is a wild one.

647
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,117
"REJOICE IN THE LORD"
CHURCH MEMBER CHAE SONG-HWA

648
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,579
I didn't know "Rejoice in the Lord"
was such a fun song.

649
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,707
The professor is doing a good job with it.

650
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,919
Here comes the highlight.

651
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:14,839
My dear U-ju. I wonder
where you get your good looks from.

652
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,091
-Lee Ik-jun.
-My gosh.

653
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,969
The micro-dust level is high today.
Will there be outdoor classes?

654
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,471
Okay. If you go outside this afternoon,

655
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,766
use the mask I put in the front pocket
of U-ju's backpack.

656
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,603
And if you have any sunscreen,
please gently apply it to his face.

657
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,937
Okay.

658
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,065
-Dad.
-I'll see you after work.

659
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,160
That startled me. Darn it.

660
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,083
Goodness.

661
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,961
My gosh, you're the queen of parking.

662
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,424
If I have to quit,
I'll work as a chauffeur.

663
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,056
Someone, park my car, please.

664
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,813
My gosh.

665
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,441
My gosh. Hello. Are you back for good?

666
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,609
Goodness.

667
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,694
She came back to work today.

668
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,155
-She's already delivered a baby.
-I see.

669
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,908
-Do you know who she is?
-Yes.

670
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,494
We heard she's the goddess of delivery.

671
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,913
You bet she is.
She's been working for 15 years

672
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,165
as a nurse in the delivery room.

673
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,709
She had to deliver her own baby,
so she was on leave.

674
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,296
As long as we have her,
we're not needed here. We can all go home.

675
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,840
You're just as I remember.
You haven't changed at all.

676
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,342
My gosh, people shouldn't change.

677
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,136
But we got new professors
while you were away.

678
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,681
Just one. A young doctor who seems sullen.

679
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,017
-I've never met him before.
-You mean Professor Yang Seok-hyeong.

680
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,729
He's the only one I haven't met.
The others are all the same.

681
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,565
We have a delivery scheduled
for a baby with anencephaly.

682
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,692
Whose case is that?

683
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,318
Mine. I'm assisting the delivery.

684
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,736
Do a good job.

685
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,989
What's anencephaly?

686
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,783
A baby without a brain.

687
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,663
We suspected the baby had anencephaly
during an ultrasound at 13 weeks.

688
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,082
We're not allowed to induce abortion.

689
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,626
And the mother wanted
to give birth anyway.

690
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,838
She's now 32 weeks pregnant.
Her waters broke at dawn.

691
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,673
And she's having contractions now.

692
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,801
I think the baby will come out
this afternoon.

693
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:29,056
The baby can only live for a few hours,
or several days, at most.

694
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,268
That's enough. The rest is for us
to worry about and prepare for.

695
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,271
Professor Yang will take the patient?

696
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,648
Actually, he wanted to see me.

697
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,610
Who's in my anencephaly case today?

698
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,113
-I'm assisting you.
-I see.

699
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,198
Min-ha, I need to talk to you then.

700
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,617
Me? Okay. Sure.

701
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,163
You want me to cover the mouth?

702
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,623
Don't block the nose or the airway.

703
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,918
Just cover the mouth gently,
so we don't hear the baby cry.

704
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,297
Eun-won can't
because she has to assist me.

705
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,467
So, you come in
and cover the baby's mouth.

706
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,511
Do it as soon as the baby's born.

707
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:08,929
Understood?

708
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,273
The X-ray shows no problem.

709
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,525
He also has no fever.
Maybe I called you for no reason.

710
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,361
I even called you last night.

711
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,364
She's just worried since
it hasn't been long since his surgery.

712
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,324
We'll just have to deal with it.

713
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,618
Why did Jin-yong return?
What's the matter?

714
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,454
He's fine now. I'm sorry, Professor.

715
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,456
Jin-yong kept throwing up last night

716
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,875
so he was brought to the ER.
But he's okay now.

717
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,294
Then... Is there any other problem?

718
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,546
What about his fever
and abdominal distention?

719
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,590
His fever broke
after I gave him a fever reducer.

720
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,050
He's better after vomiting once.

721
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,302
He has no other problems
and we explained everything.

722
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,514
But his mother insisted
on seeing you, so...

723
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,723
I'm sorry.

724
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,725
No, it's okay.

725
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,314
Dr. Bae, a patient with a fracture
came in. You should come.

726
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
Sure.

727
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,025
Let's see.

728
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:08,697
Ma'am, his intestine is fine,
so you don't have to worry too much.

729
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,702
Jin-yong, you think
you can eat something now?

730
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,747
Oh, my. You look haggard.
Your cheeks are hollow.

731
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,376
It hurts, doesn't it? I'm sorry.

732
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,461
What happened?

733
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,755
He was playing on a dining table
and suddenly fell.

734
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,216
Since then, he hasn't been able
to move his arm.

735
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,635
He fell on his right side.

736
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,595
I think he broke his arm.

737
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,931
Please do something. Please.

738
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,435
How do you feel
when I press here and here?

739
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,061
Do they feel the same?

740
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,105
Is your head okay?

741
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,357
Does it hurt here too?

742
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,901
Take a deep breath.

743
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,320
Does it hurt when you breathe?

744
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,658
I think we should X-ray his chest too.

745
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,995
Did he fall on his arm?

746
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,039
Didn't he hit his chest hard on something?

747
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,417
-Okay.
-I'm not sure.

748
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,671
But I heard a really loud sound
when he fell from the table.

749
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,882
He fell really hard on his right side.

750
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,553
I think his arm is broken,
and there must be a chest problem too.

751
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,138
So we should X-ray him first.

752
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:19,226
But I heard...
X-rays are bad for children.

753
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,520
Is it really necessary?

754
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,397
It's okay
since there's very little radiation.

755
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,066
I see... All right, then.

756
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,153
Goodness, Doctor. Whatever you do,

757
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,238
please hurry and stop his pain.

758
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,948
I will. Don't worry.

759
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,743
Let's get the X-ray done.
And give him some painkiller.

760
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,785
Yes.

761
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,293
Professor, they say the Kasai's
operation's ready. You should go.

762
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,294
Okay.

763
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,007
You haven't received an enema, right?

764
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,009
He'll get it later this evening.

765
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,054
That's all he needs to do
before surgery, right?

766
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,682
Why are there so many things to do
for preparation?

767
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,976
He'll be exhausted
even before the surgery.

768
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,979
A transplant recipient
usually needs a lot of preparation.

769
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,564
The surgery takes a long time as well.

770
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,276
So... Did you say it'll take
about ten hours?

771
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,905
We'll only know for sure
after the surgery begins.

772
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:16,200
But you're right.
It usually takes nine to ten hours.

773
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,371
But as for your son,

774
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,207
if I take out the time
for anesthetizing and closing his chest,

775
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,793
the surgery will onlyÂ take
about four hours. So it's better.

776
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,629
He won't have any side effects
after his surgery, right?

777
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,424
I mean, he's getting a liver transplant
to get better after all.

778
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,009
Well...

779
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,054
It's not that
he's getting it to get better.

780
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,599
The liver transplant is the only way
for him to live.

781
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,394
Your son is doing a great thing.

782
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,565
You should know that not everyone does it
for their family or parents.

783
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,693
Not doing it is also understandable.

784
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,610
I see...

785
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,738
We took an X-ray because of your cough.

786
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,782
-How does it look?
-It looked fine.

787
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,909
Then it's all good.

788
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,411
See you tomorrow.

789
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,830
Okay. Have a good rest today, Professor.

790
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,541
Don't drink tonight,
and just go home and rest, okay?

791
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,959
Yes, ma'am.

792
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,045
Yes. He really told me
to cover the baby's mouth first.

793
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,340
Clearly, he doesn't even
want to hear the baby crying.

794
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm telling you, he's a total psycho.

795
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,306
Did he really say that?

796
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,849
Did Dr. Yang Seok-hyeong say that?

797
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,476
He told me that just a while ago.

798
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,648
I didn't think he was that kind of doctor.
He has a different side.

799
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,943
What do you mean?
He does look like that type of doctor.

800
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,155
He has no consideration
or affection for pregnant women.

801
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,699
He's a simple, ignorant,
and selfish loner.

802
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,868
He's exactly that kind of doctor.

803
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,623
Dr. Chu, how long
have you been a resident?

804
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,916
It's my second year.

805
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,585
I see...

806
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,296
Listen carefully.

807
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,552
The patient with gastroschisis
went into labor and is in the ER now.

808
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,970
Hurry up, Professor.

809
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,895
DELIVERY ROOM
RESTRICTIONS FOR VISITORS

810
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,569
I think it's going too fast.

811
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,571
The interval is too short.

812
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,532
Eun-won, he's here.

813
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,035
Jo Mi-hyeon, a primi mother
at 37 weeks pregnant.

814
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,621
We planned to induce labor next week,

815
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,914
but she has labor pain now.

816
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,083
Her husband's pretty shaken up.

817
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,669
It's okay. You don't have to worry.

818
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,630
The cervix is dilated
to three centimeters,

819
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,882
and she's just received an epidural.

820
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,303
VIP ROOM TWO

821
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,723
BED REST
VISITORS ARE RESTRICTED

822
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,197
I'm worried.

823
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,991
He's mentally unstable.

824
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,952
He refused all visitors.

825
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,496
He had a blood test and an X-ray, right?

826
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,789
Yes, of course.

827
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,418
But since then,
he hasn't come out of the room.

828
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,753
He seemed fine
when I talked to him last time.

829
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,133
You don't think he'd run away, do you?

830
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,177
I don't think so.

831
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,602
It's three centimeters,
so we still have some time.

832
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,479
-You called the Pediatrics, right?
-Yes.

833
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,814
What about Pediatric Surgery?

834
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,608
You haven't called Jeong-won yet, right?
We still have some time.

835
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,609
No, not yet.

836
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,737
I talked with their chief doctor
on the phone.

837
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,407
Dr. Ahn's surgery that started
this morning has just finished.

838
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,950
He hasn't eaten anything all day,

839
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,577
so he'll come after eating something.

840
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,620
That's good. I'll be in my office then.

841
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,793
-I heard it's still three centimeters.
-Yes.

842
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,087
Then she still has a long way to go.

843
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,174
Don't tell me you already called PS?

844
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,092
Of course not.
I'm a second-year now, you know.

845
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,761
I know that much.

846
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,597
Hello?

847
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,891
This is bad.

848
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,351
What's going on?

849
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,895
The cervix is fully dilated.

850
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,942
RESTRICTED AREA

851
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,370
It's okay.
Take your time before coming in.

852
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,371
Yes, sir.

853
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,001
What do I do? I told PS they could go eat.

854
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,587
What should I tell them?

855
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,923
You don't have to call them.

856
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,257
Pardon?

857
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,176
He's already in there.

858
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,471
Dr. Ahn came ten minutes ago
and is now in the delivery room.

859
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,389
Has he eaten already?

860
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,975
"Is eating important?
We are delivering a baby."

861
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,687
That's what Dr. Ahn said.

862
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,442
He said he should be on standby
since Dr. Yang's delivering the baby.

863
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,520
Jeong-won.

864
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,024
-Thanks.
-Sure.

865
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,620
-Yes?
-Professor, it's ready.

866
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,705
Okay.

867
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,293
What about Jeong-won?

868
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,753
He's been doing surgeries
since this morning.

869
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,047
-Seok-hyeong, too?
-Yes.

870
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,258
He had an emergency delivery

871
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,634
and has an anencephaly case soon,

872
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,760
so he can't eat now.

873
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,761
What was it again?

874
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,388
A baby without a brain?

875
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,598
You're right.

876
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,391
Oh, dear.

877
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,733
Okay. Please take a deep breath.

878
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,110
Good. You're doing a good job.

879
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,488
It's almost done. Just a bit more.

880
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,034
Good. You're doing a good job, ma'am.

881
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,579
Okay, with all your might,
push one last time.

882
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,915
Good. One more time.

883
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,501
One more.

884
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,587
More.

885
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,505
More.

886
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,551
Hang in there. You're doing a good job.

887
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,015
Good. The baby has come out.

888
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,717
You did a good job.

889
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,928
You've really done well.

890
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,889
Doctor...

891
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,102
I feel...

892
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,437
so sorry for my baby.

893
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,940
My baby...

894
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,653
Ma'am,

895
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,406
You didn't give up on the baby
until the end.

896
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,951
That alone is amazing.

897
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,789
You really did your best, ma'am.

898
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,173
You've done a great job.

899
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,441
Dr. Chu, how long
have you been a resident?

900
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,735
It's my second year.

901
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,862
Listen carefully.

902
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,699
I've been worried
about that mother for a while,

903
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,784
so I went to see her a little while ago.

904
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,747
I asked her if she wanted to see the baby
when it's born.

905
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,167
I told her I can show her if she wants to.

906
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,795
She thought it over and told me that...

907
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,256
she doesn't want to...

908
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,886
because if she sees the baby,
it might be too hard for her.

909
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,558
She didn't have an abortion.

910
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,976
That alone is great.

911
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,898
But when I was coming out of the room,

912
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,984
I saw Dr. Yang standing outside the door.

913
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,570
He came to ask me a favor.

914
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,199
He said, "When the baby's born later,

915
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,078
if it starts crying,

916
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,248
could you play really loud music?

917
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,044
I asked another person a different thing,

918
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,838
but I'm asking you too, just in case."

919
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,258
Yes.

920
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,511
Come further inside.

921
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,012
Yes.

922
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,598
I understood what he meant right away.

923
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,810
But it was so unlike him,

924
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,436
so I asked him as if I didn't get it.

925
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,146
"Why should I play loud music?"

926
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,484
He said,
"The mother already knows about it

927
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,569
and has prepared herself.

928
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,990
But still, if she hears the cry

929
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,326
when the baby is born,

930
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,621
she'll be traumatized for life."

931
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,212
Mom.

932
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,465
Did you see the doctor?

933
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,259
I told them to take good care of you.

934
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,136
Yes, it went well.

935
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,637
They said everything's fine.

936
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,889
It's just that my legs feel weak.

937
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,350
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Sure.

938
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,687
He said he didn't want
to make her traumatized

939
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,939
after all she's been through.

940
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,526
The mother is aware of everything
about the baby

941
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,403
and has prepared herself.

942
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:40,782
But he thinks
she'll be traumatized for life.

943
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,450
Oh, my.

944
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,662
He looks quite dull,

945
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,415
so I didn't think he'd care
about small things.

946
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,916
That was unexpected.

947
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,502
You know, it's not easy
to be thoughtful like that.

948
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,882
Then he should've told me
the reason first.

949
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,925
Does he really have to say it out loud?

950
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,219
You should've gotten it right away.

951
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,680
Oh, no...

952
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,604
You even eat green onion kimchi now?

953
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,022
You didn't like it before.

954
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,231
I suddenly like it.

955
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,860
I crave cold bean soup noodles these days.

956
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,236
I never liked it before.

957
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,281
-Our taste in food changes as we grow old.
-Yes, but not gradually.

958
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,325
It changes overnight. All of a sudden.

959
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,577
I suddenly became allergic to cats.

960
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,621
I was never allergic to anything.

961
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,457
I suddenly developed presbyopia
on Christmas morning last year.

962
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,083
My girlfriend asked me if I liked

963
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,419
something on her phone,
but I couldn't see it at all.

964
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,712
I just said I liked it.

965
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,798
Two days ago, I went to the park with U-ju

966
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,468
and took 6,000 photos of flowers.

967
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,595
I'm serious. I took 6,000 photos.

968
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,972
Don't laugh.
I took them without realizing it.

969
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,474
And U-ju was...

970
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,517
They were selling bean soup there.

971
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,355
So U-ju was eating it, and I was suddenly
immersed in those flowers.

972
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,523
-I'll show you.
-No, thanks.

973
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,317
-Look at them.
-I'm okay.

974
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,195
Well, Seok-hyeong's worse.

975
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,864
-Of course. He's the worst.
-He's the worst.

976
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,326
He never talked with his mom,
but now he's a mama's boy.

977
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,954
He was really brusque with his mom.

978
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,830
He talked behind her back a lot,

979
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,166
saying she was so spiteful and scary.

980
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,127
You never know how people turn out.

981
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,213
Anyone would be like that

982
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,632
after going through all of that at once.

983
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,344
He was close to his little sister,
but she suddenly died.

984
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,013
And his father had an affair
with a young woman.

985
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,598
His mom then had a stroke.

986
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,561
Gosh... I think only Seok-hyeong
could endure all that.

987
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,646
If it were me...

988
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,731
How's his mom doing these days?

989
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,025
I heard she'd come here today.
Didn't she go to you?

990
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,652
She came to see a neurologist today.

991
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,280
She is a lot better.
She can go out by herself now.

992
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,659
So he was going to see his mom
if he has time after the delivery.

993
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,744
I wonder if he met her.

994
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,998
I'm okay.

995
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,589
Excuse me.

996
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,091
I'm sorry, but...

997
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,052
The woman who just went in is my mother.

998
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,305
She has trouble moving around
after having surgery.

999
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,432
-I see.
-I'm sorry, but...

1000
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,976
I'm just worried
that she might collapse in there.

1001
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,980
If it's not too much trouble for you,
could you keep an eye on her?

1002
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,525
If you could just check her
once or twice if she's okay...

1003
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,569
I'd appreciate it. I'm sorry.

1004
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,155
No, don't be. I'll go check on her now.

1005
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,542
Seok-hyeong's father
is beyond our imagination.

1006
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,960
He doesn't deserve to be a father.

1007
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,212
Even Seok-hyeong doesn't call him
his father anymore.

1008
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,882
They didn't get a divorce yet, right?

1009
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,177
Right. His mom's absolutely against it.

1010
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,554
She'll never do it.

1011
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,639
You should go in now. I know you're busy.

1012
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,099
I will after I see you get a cab.

1013
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,517
I know how to get a cab.

1014
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,312
I called a cab.
I'll go back after you get in.

1015
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,814
What about Song-hwa? Is she busy?

1016
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,149
Why don't you call her?

1017
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,861
Tell her to come down and get some coffee.

1018
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,613
Mom, we're really just friends.

1019
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,199
There's nothing going on between us,
so stop that.

1020
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,533
I didn't say anything.

1021
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,579
I just want to see her
since I'm at the hospital.

1022
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,748
Why are you getting so worked up?

1023
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,583
Is there really something going on?

1024
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,168
The cab's here. You should go.

1025
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,342
-Bye, mom.
-Bye.

1026
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,474
Seok-hyeong, come home right away.

1027
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,975
What's the matter, Aunt?

1028
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,894
Ji-eun is dead...

1029
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,231
-What?
-They said she accidentally fell and died.

1030
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,233
How did something like this happen?

1031
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,484
You should hurry.

1032
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,862
Take the earliest flight
and come here as soon as possible.

1033
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,865
Your mom collapsed
and was taken away in an ambulance.

1034
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:54,536
And your father went hiking
with his new employees,

1035
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,496
so he can come tomorrow night.

1036
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,957
So you should hurry, okay?

1037
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,544
How could something like this happen?

1038
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,860
Father.

1039
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,295
JANUARY 2019

1040
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,754
Can he call himself human?

1041
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,550
What about your mom?
Have you told her about this?

1042
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,594
I will tell her tonight.

1043
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,928
Are you sure about this?

1044
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,391
He's not even human.

1045
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,393
He really isn't.

1046
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,771
-Do you want me to tell her?
-No, I will.

1047
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,608
It's drizzling. It'll pour soon.

1048
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,194
Come inside. Let's talk inside.

1049
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,533
I knew.

1050
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,913
I've known all along that he's having...

1051
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,581
an affair.

1052
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,918
But... But then, mom.

1053
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,212
Why didn't you do anything?

1054
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,088
I tried everything.

1055
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,466
I went to him and cursed him.

1056
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,384
I even pulled his hair.

1057
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,386
But...

1058
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,764
he said we should get a divorce.

1059
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,934
He said he only wants a divorce.

1060
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,562
Then he'd give me this house
and all his buildings.

1061
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,398
He begged me for a divorce.

1062
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,109
So I said no.

1063
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,488
I said we should live together

1064
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,282
and die together.

1065
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,956
I won't get a divorce. For whose sake?

1066
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,753
Hiking with his new employees?

1067
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,630
I know...

1068
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,092
I know he goes on a trip abroad
at the end of each year.

1069
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,429
Even on the day Ji-eun died,

1070
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,557
I'm sure he was with her.

1071
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,059
I know that.

1072
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:26,521
But I won't divorce him.

1073
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,606
It would just make him happy.

1074
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,651
Why would I divorce him
when he'd live happily with that wench?

1075
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,153
Just divorce him, Mom.

1076
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,155
You can live happily with me.

1077
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,949
It's okay if I become unhappy.

1078
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,036
But I can't let your father become happy.

1079
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,835
Even on the day we buried Ji-eun...

1080
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,629
your dad slept...

1081
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,799
with that wench in the same room.

1082
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,387
I'm okay.

1083
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,557
I'll bear everything by myself.

1084
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,851
So you focus on your job.

1085
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,769
For me...

1086
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,689
your happiness is everything.

1087
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,948
Mom...

1088
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,828
Take me, Mom.

1089
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,915
Mom...

1090
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,960
Take me with you, Mom.

1091
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:17,340
Take me, Mom.

1092
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,551
Mom...

1093
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,682
Take me, Mom.

1094
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,979
Mom...

1095
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,068
Take me, Mom.

1096
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,655
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1097
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,074
Who's this?

1098
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,118
This is Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS.

1099
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,411
He's also from graduate school.

1100
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,122
He's quite old.
He's a third-year resident like me.

1101
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,624
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome to Dr. Bong's Salon.

1102
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,334
Thank you.

1103
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,045
This gathering is popular among residents.

1104
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,090
Since we can get a lot
of information about our professors,

1105
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,675
everyone wants to come.

1106
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:04,804
So Dr. Ahn here has been selected today
out of ten candidates

1107
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,140
because he treated us to a lot of pizza.

1108
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:11,060
By the way, Dr. Bong's not here yet?

1109
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:11,978
I'm here.

1110
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:16,566
Hey, if you have time for this,
just go home or get some sleep.

1111
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,817
What would you like to drink?

1112
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,404
Well, should I have
a cold one or a hot one?

1113
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,948
You can have both. I'll go buy them.

1114
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,867
I'll just pick drinks for you guys, okay?

1115
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,118
Okay.

1116
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,996
Who is this new guy here?

1117
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,874
Hello. I'm Ahn Chi-hong,
a third-year resident from NS.

1118
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,584
Dr. Ahn from NS.

1119
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,545
Who are you curious about?

1120
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,964
About Professor Chae Song-hwa.

1121
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,090
-Song-hwa?
-Yes.

1122
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,426
What do you want to know about her?

1123
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,928
Maybe, her hobbies?

1124
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,472
Ahn Jeong-won for me.

1125
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,265
I want to know about his hobbies.

1126
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,185
You guys know they're in
a band together, right?

1127
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,521
The five of them formed a band.

1128
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,274
Well, they were considered a gag club
when we were in school.

1129
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,901
They didn't play officially,

1130
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:02,278
but they always practiced together.

1131
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,031
Oh, right.
I heard they're practicing tonight.

1132
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:10,495
Good. I totally mastered this song.

1133
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,997
After the break,
how about we make this part longer?

1134
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:13,956
You finished early.

1135
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,083
-How about some ramyeon?
-No.

1136
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,044
I have to go watch my kid,
so sit down now.

1137
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,379
Let's play it once properly
and call it a day.

1138
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,883
This is my favorite song.

1139
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,218
No, it's mine.

1140
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,177
No, it's mine.

1141
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,264
A band? Dr. Yang too?

1142
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,351
-Thanks. Seok-hyeong plays the keyboards.
-What?

1143
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,686
-Who plays what?
-He said Seok-hyeong plays the keyboards.

1144
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:40,024
Ik-jun and Jun-wan were in a band
when they were in high school.

1145
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:43,528
They were the best in Changwon.
Well, they were, according to Ik-jun.

1146
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,656
Anyway, Ik-jun's good
at playing the guitar and bass guitar.

1147
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,865
Jun-wan plays the guitar.

1148
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,117
They joined a med school band,

1149
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,578
but they left
because things weren't right for them.

1150
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,248
Then they started their own band for fun.

1151
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,251
Luckily, Seok-hyeong was good at piano,

1152
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,711
and I think Jeong-won started
the drums then.

1153
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,713
And Song-hwa's the vocalist.

1154
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,340
She's the vocalist?

1155
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:05,716
Yes, she is.

1156
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,260
But she can't sing

1157
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,012
That's right. I know that.
Actually, everyone knows that.

1158
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,430
But Song-hwa lied to them.

1159
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,433
-Sorry?
-She's really good at lying.

1160
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,602
When she sets her mind
on something,

1161
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,813
she'll get it by any means.

1162
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,399
That's an unexpected charm.

1163
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:22,817
A vocalist?

1164
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,443
Are you saying you're good at singing?

1165
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,611
Yes.

1166
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,071
SPRING 1999

1167
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:30,908
I'm a little hoarse right now,

1168
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,494
but I'm really good at singing.

1169
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,121
I'll be the vocalist.

1170
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,081
But you were fine until yesterday.

1171
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,541
This morning...

1172
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,835
I suddenly got hoarse.

1173
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,550
Oh, I need more coffee.

1174
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,138
Okay, then. Song-hwa can be the vocalist.

1175
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,600
And you're good at piano, you said?

1176
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,351
-Yes.
-Really?

1177
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,270
I'm pretty good.

1178
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,606
Can't you tell? Look at this place.

1179
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,483
I'm from a musical family.

1180
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,362
Then, show me.

1181
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,263
Are you...

1182
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,729
Any other songs?

1183
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,872
-When did he learn it?
-Be quiet.

1184
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,292
Continue playing. I want to listen more.

1185
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,248
Well... This guy...

1186
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,292
This jerk...

1187
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,587
Wait.

1188
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,341
Wow, how much is it?

1189
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,718
It's 300,000 won.

1190
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,054
You really are rich.

1191
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,682
You can write thirty-five
Korean characters up to five lines.

1192
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,933
-Wow, this is so light.
-Right?

1193
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,186
The technology has advanced a lot.

1194
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:47,354
Maybe it'll have a camera on it too.

1195
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,981
-That's nonsense.
-Or we will be able to

1196
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,941
buy things and pay the bus fare with it.

1197
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,735
-What?
-You've gone too far.

1198
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,445
Why not watch TV on it then?

1199
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,405
Why not recharge it like this?

1200
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,240
They say all that will be possible.

1201
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,950
It will. But after we all die.

1202
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:03,287
But there's one thing I can play
until the end.

1203
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,455
-"Beyer"?
-"Canon."

1204
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,040
"Canon"?

1205
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,709
-You can play "Canon"?
-Yes.

1206
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,213
I'm not as good as George Washington,
but I can play it until the end.

1207
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,924
-I learned it from my sister.
-It's George Winston.

1208
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,344
You.

1209
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,555
This is your last chance.

1210
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,692
What a show-off.

1211
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,032
Like this.

1212
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,743
And then, the second line...

1213
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,998
Song-hwa, you've improved a lot.

1214
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,245
He's a TA patient.

1215
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,332
He's been X-rayed because of
a rigid abdomen and rebound tenderness.

1216
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,459
Seems he has a pan-peritonitis
from bowel perforation.

1217
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,835
He needs surgery so I called you.

1218
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:02,795
Okay.

1219
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,006
-Did you give him a painkiller?
-Yes.

1220
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,842
Okay, let's see.

1221
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,346
My, it hurts a lot, doesn't it?

1222
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,056
What?

1223
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,686
He looks just like him, right?

1224
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,441
I was surprised too,
so I was thinking about how it's possible.

1225
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,903
-Maybe they're twins.
-Yes, they're twins.

1226
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,615
Jae-hun got hurt yesterday,
and today, his brother...

1227
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,867
Jae-yong.

1228
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,327
Dad's here. It's okay.

1229
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:38,163
Doctor, he's going to be okay, right?

1230
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,624
It was a car accident, right?

1231
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:44,169
Yes, I dozed off while driving
and hit a lamp post.

1232
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,297
He was in the back seat.

1233
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,049
I don't know what I was thinking.

1234
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,093
I need to check some things,

1235
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,387
so could you leave us for a moment?

1236
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,265
Why? Why should a guardian leave?

1237
01:13:56,723 --> 01:14:00,060
Before surgery, I need to prepare him.

1238
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,437
I see.

1239
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,485
Jae-yong, let me see.

1240
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,655
What's wrong with the patient?

1241
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:14,491
He was in his dad's car
and got a pan-peritonitis from TA.

1242
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,827
What kind of father would let that happen?

1243
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,454
It can happen when you drive.

1244
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,913
But the father seemed totally fine.

1245
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,958
Jae-yong, let me see.

1246
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,254
He's covered in bruises.

1247
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,717
Jae-yong, lie on your stomach.

1248
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:33,802
Good.

1249
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:36,680
My goodness.

1250
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:47,900
What kind of sick son of a bitch
does this?

1251
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,366
We still have a lot of time left
before surgery.

1252
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,578
But I don't know
why I'm already so nervous.

1253
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:02,206
That's natural.

1254
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,750
Your son...

1255
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,587
His surgery will begin soon.

1256
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,838
If it goes well,

1257
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,343
my husband will be able to play golf

1258
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,887
and go on a trip abroad again, right?

1259
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:20,098
Yes.

1260
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,977
He will.

1261
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,105
Can we have a word?

1262
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,416
This is the VIP Ward on the tenth floor.
Please send four men now. Hurry.

1263
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,834
Yes, right now.

1264
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,712
-Why did you call the security guards?
-Listen.

1265
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,047
Yes?

1266
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,550
Didn't you notice anything strange
when you checked on Mr. Sim?

1267
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,097
His wife is with him all the time.

1268
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,226
-What's wrong with that?
-She never goes to her son's room.

1269
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,813
Her son is giving her husband his liver,

1270
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:10,440
but she always stays with her husband.

1271
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,111
Even the most unmotherly mother

1272
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,447
would be worried about her child
more than she is.

1273
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:26,832
Who are you?

1274
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,418
Well... I...

1275
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,169
Who are you?

1276
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,346
Ik-jun.

1277
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,190
THE CENTER OF DEFENSE
THE SECOND BATTALION

1278
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:03,619
What brings you here?

1279
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,965
Did you come here to see me?

1280
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,259
No, I came to eat jajangmyeon.

1281
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:21,845
What?

1282
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,307
I said I came to eat jajangmyeon.

1283
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,645
I'm thinking of confessing my feelings.

1284
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,897
Do you like me?

1285
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,525
Hey, Ik-jun.

1286
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,693
Did you see this?

1287
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,111
It's about a girl.

1288
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,655
I knew it. He's been single for too long.

1289
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:23,156
Seok-hyeong,
is it a crime to get a divorce?

1290
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,159
Just drink some beer, man.
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

1291
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,912
Hey, you got nothing?

1292
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:30,872
Just tell me.

1293
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,042
Is there anyone you're interested in?

1294
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,043
There is.

1295
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,086
Who?

1296
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,380
I forgot that Jeong-won
has been staying at my house.

1297
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,091
Really? Invite me to your home.

1298
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,801
Yes, let's pick a day. Today?

1299
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:46,722
There's nothing wrong with her, right?
Is she okay?

1300
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,223
Yes, everything looks good.

1301
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:50,350
I'll make sure
her surgery doesn't hurt at all.

1302
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,685
Don't worry about it.

1303
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:52,644
I'll do my best.

1304
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,771
She was fine when I checked
during my afternoon round.

1305
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,148
I need your help, sir.

1306
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,233
-I brought three bags of RBC.
-Spread this part.

1307
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,610
-Great. Keep suctioning.
-Bring more blood.

1308
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,238
You must save him.
If you don't, I'll kill you.

1309
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,741
Please save him, doctor.
