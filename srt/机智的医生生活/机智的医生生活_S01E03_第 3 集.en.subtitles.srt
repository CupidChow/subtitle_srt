1
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,659
Dr. Ahn, Sang-u is here.

2
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,288
My goodness. Sang-u is here.

3
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,915
Sang-u, say hello to the doctor.

4
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,334
All right. There you go.

5
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,296
Sang-u, you came with a shark today.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,050
Should I take a look
at what's inside the shark's mouth?

7
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,094
Oh, no.

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,765
Sang-u, why are you crying?

9
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,226
The doctor is going to ease
your stomachache.

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,771
He's trying to ease your stomachache.
Why are you crying?

11
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,855
Don't cry now.

12
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,816
If you keep crying,

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,779
this scary doctor is going to scold you
and give you a shot.

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,906
Right, doctor?

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,242
Bad boy! Where's the syringe?

16
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,871
Nurse, where is the big syringe
Sang-u is going to get?

17
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,290
Sang-u, be quiet. Stop crying.

18
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,711
If you keep crying, the doctor
is going to bring a big syringe.

19
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,713
Stop.

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,849
Let's see. I have some snacks
for Sang-u right here.

21
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,894
Oh, my goodness. Who scared Sang-u?

22
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,814
Who scared my sweet boy, Sang-u?

23
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,273
Was it the doctor?

24
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,318
It was the doctor, right?

25
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,445
I'll scold him for you.

26
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,155
There.

27
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,325
I scolded a bad doctor for you.

28
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,080
Doctor, why did you scare Sang-u?

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,499
He's such a nice boy.

30
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,545
Doctor, you won't scare Sang-u
anymore, right?

31
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,130
Right, doctor?

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,010
I am sorry, Sang-u.

33
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,972
I'll give you this snack
instead of a shot.

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,432
Eat this when you're all better.

35
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,017
-Yes.
-Professor Ahn.

36
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,020
Ji-su needs her PEG tube changed now.

37
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,649
-Excuse me for a second, Sang-u.
-Yes.

38
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,904
Hello.

39
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,242
I took a look at your ultrasound.

40
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,038
It will be difficult to treat
with antibiotics.

41
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,541
What does he exactly have?

42
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,043
He has infective endocarditis.

43
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,296
There's an infection in his endocardium.

44
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,382
If we treat it with antibiotics,
you may suffer from embolism.

45
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,552
I'm concerned an infected mass
might block your vessels.

46
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,346
You must get surgery as soon as possible.
Did you find him a bed?

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,140
Yes, he can get checked in after 6 p.m.

48
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,018
Check in today and let's book
the surgery as soon as we can.

49
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,270
-Is it serious?
-Yes.

50
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,816
If the infected mass is small,

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,985
antibiotics can be used to break it down.

52
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,155
From your ultrasound, the infected mass
is big and dangling.

53
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,907
We can't tell when it will fall off.

54
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,326
If it goes to the brain,
it causes a stroke.

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,161
If it goes to the heart,
it causes a heart attack.

56
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,121
You need to get surgery soon.

57
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,832
Do we have an opening for a surgery
in two or three days?

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,710
No, we're full.
There's no opening this week.

59
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,629
We'll do it in the morning if we must.

60
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,880
Call Anesthesiology

61
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,674
and ask them to help me
with the surgery in two or three days.

62
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,176
Okay.

63
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,722
Doctor, my daughter
is getting married in three days.

64
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,225
Can postpone the surgery to next week?

65
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,851
No, we cannot.

66
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,604
It's only for a couple of days.

67
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,024
-Wouldn't that be okay?
-No.

68
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,068
Only if you want to end your life.

69
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,529
Dad, what are you talking about?
Don't be foolish.

70
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,698
My wedding isn't what's important now.

71
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,117
You can look at the wedding photos.

72
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,827
Ask her to take lots of photos.

73
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,164
Then I'll see you tomorrow
during my rounds.

74
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,377
Let me go over what you need to do.

75
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,756
First, head to the left
and have your blood sample drawn.

76
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,716
Why is that doctor so rude?

77
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,095
I am sorry. We are well aware of that.

78
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,139
Second, get an EKG from the room

79
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,934
right next to where you had
your blood sample drawn.

80
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,310
-And third.
-Well...

81
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,938
Aged 78. His name is Im Gi-yeong.

82
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,607
He underwent coiling a month ago
due to an SAH.

83
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,944
He showed symptoms of leg weakness
and dementia three days ago

84
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,487
so he was readmitted.

85
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,864
His CT scan revealed that
he has hydrocephalus.

86
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,619
It seems the IVH that was accompanied
by SAH is gone for now.

87
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,620
EVD...

88
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,541
That's not it. I'm sorry.

89
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,545
I think we should perform a VP shunt.

90
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,089
Shouldn't you have that memorized by now?

91
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,924
You're right.

92
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,885
-Are you sure he needs a VP shunt?
-Yes.

93
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,597
No.

94
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,435
-Is he wrong?
-Yes, I think so.

95
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,354
Really? I think he's right.

96
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,609
You have until my next round.

97
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,029
Prepare a summary of relevant papers
and surgical cases.

98
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,113
Okay.

99
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,740
-You, too.
-Okay.

100
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,914
Professor Chae, have you had lunch yet?

101
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,708
We got a new restaurant to deliver to us.

102
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,877
-Which one?
-A seafood stew restaurant.

103
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,628
That's too much for delivery food.

104
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,922
They also do a wonderful haemulpajeon.

105
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,008
Join us. We'll set it up in the office.

106
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,469
Go ahead without me.
I'll eat with the guys.

107
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,678
The guys?

108
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,721
GONGNYONG RIDGE

109
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,139
SONG-HWA: LUNCH?
SEOK-HYEONG: OKAY

110
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,600
GIVE ME A MINUTE

111
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,812
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT OF MY LIFE

112
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,668
Gyeo-ul, residents rarely get to see
a mesocaval shunt in person.

113
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,712
-What are you doing?
-I told you not to talk.

114
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,506
-Get out of here.
-Let's play fair.

115
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,924
-What are you doing?
-Don't do anything.

116
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,884
-Should I start talking, too?
-Well,

117
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,552
I...

118
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,809
-I decided--
-It's seafood stew.

119
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,269
-I'm allergic to--
-Song-hwa wants seafood stew.

120
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,189
We're waiting for Gyeo-ul
so you come here and be quiet.

121
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,899
Gyeo-ul?

122
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,612
It's all right. There's no pressure.

123
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,447
Take your pick.

124
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,658
-Of course.
-We understand.

125
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,244
-We're all fine.
-We understand everything.

126
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,079
Then,

127
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,335
I choose HPD.

128
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,087
-Come on!
-My gosh.

129
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,465
Come on. A hemicolectomy
is a great choice, too.

130
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,634
-My gosh.
-Darn it.

131
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,761
The guardians must be here too.

132
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,265
-Goodness.
-I mean... Why is it you again?

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,519
Let's go. Song-hwa ordered
some big-eyed herring too.

134
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,478
And Jun-wan?

135
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,189
He's in PICU now.
I guess he won't be joining us.

136
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,151
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

137
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,697
What's Hui-dong's weight today?

138
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,115
It's 3.0kg.

139
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,837
I can close him up now. Let's get ready.

140
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,424
Where's Jae-hak?

141
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,218
He went out to get
the med students earlier.

142
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,221
Right. I guess he's more suited for that.

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,431
Let's get started.

144
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,894
CS has a lot of emergency surgeries.
And our cases are the most dramatic.

145
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,730
Someone who was fine in the morning

146
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,315
could be dead by the afternoon in CS.

147
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,235
Do you know
who the best cardiothoracic surgeon is?

148
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,988
Ji Sung.

149
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,158
-Who?
-Ji Sung from New Heart.

150
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,910
I watched medical dramas since I was ten.

151
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,703
Not him.

152
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,663
Teacher Kim from Dr. Romantic?

153
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,501
Were your names Cheol and Mi-ae?

154
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,669
-We're Hong-do and Yun-bok.
-Hong-do and Yun-bok.

155
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,004
Guys, listen up.

156
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,090
Great doctors like them
don't exist at this hospital.

157
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,052
There's only Thanos here.

158
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,887
You'll meet him soon.

159
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,601
-Yes, sir.
-Where are you now?

160
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,561
I'm on my way.

161
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,158
-Will they perform the surgery here?
-Yes.

162
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,621
It's more dangerous to move the patient
to an OR with that many drips.

163
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,132
Are you Gyeon-u and Jik-nyeo?

164
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,593
We're Hong-do and Yun-bok.

165
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,055
-Third year in med school?
-Yes.

166
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,350
-Pay attention.
-Okay.

167
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,227
Professor,

168
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,646
-is this surgery difficult?
-The baby will live, right?

169
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,524
Four days ago, he had a TGA,
transposition of the great arteries.

170
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,943
His heart swelling was too severe.
I couldn't close him up.

171
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,157
Seeing his heart today, I might
be able to close him. So, I'll do it now.

172
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,451
He will live, right?

173
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,412
I'm closing him up
because he's doing better.

174
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,498
Jae-hak, bring them in.

175
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,458
Pardon?

176
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,335
I see. Okay.

177
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,635
What do you think you're doing?
You'll contaminate him.

178
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,139
Do you have a death wish?

179
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,600
He means the guardians.

180
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,528
Sir, Chan-hyeong has a slight fever.

181
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,865
Since when?

182
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,743
When I checked at 8 a.m., it was 36°C.

183
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,787
I checked again just now and it's
38.3°C. His nose is a little runny, too.

184
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,125
-Can we perform the surgery today?
-Let me see him.

185
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,805
His lung doesn't sound good, either.
We can't operate on him like this.

186
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,017
Give me five minutes.
Remove the membrane for me.

187
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,519
Can I touch the baby?

188
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,063
-I disinfected my hands.
-Okay.

189
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,615
What's wrong with this baby?

190
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,576
Jae-hak, get Chan-hyeong's guardians now.

191
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,871
He has Tetralogy of Fallot.
It's a congenital heart defect.

192
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,332
He has a ventricular septal defect,
pulmonary stenosis,

193
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,085
right ventricular hypertrophy,
and overriding aorta, altogether.

194
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,587
We were scheduled to operate
this afternoon.

195
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,256
His oxygen saturation
is a little low, though.

196
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,051
He's showing symptoms of pneumonia.

197
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,180
He needs this surgery as soon as possible.

198
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,307
They are here.

199
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,821
I have bad news.

200
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,532
We need to postpone the surgery
by a day or two.

201
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,284
He has a fever
and his lung doesn't sound good.

202
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,496
I plan to reschedule after taking
an X-ray of his lungs.

203
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,416
He's still finding it hard to breathe.

204
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,377
He might be in more pain
if we rush into surgery.

205
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,671
We'll do that, then.

206
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,217
If it's a mild case of pneumonia,
he'll recover in two to three days.

207
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,010
We'll observe him for a few days.

208
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,556
Do you have any questions?

209
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,433
No.

210
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,604
You'll reschedule the surgery
and let us know, right?

211
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,190
We know. You explained before.

212
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,484
Okay, then.

213
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,324
My gosh, they seem so composed.
Their son's life is at stake.

214
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,995
They are just immature.
Did you see how young his mother is?

215
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,121
She was born in 2000.

216
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,331
I like that she's calm.

217
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,043
Do you think it's possible that
she's not herself right now

218
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,046
because of the pressure she's under
and she needs to escape from reality?

219
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,506
She's still very young.

220
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,843
Maybe she's having trouble
coming into terms with her situation.

221
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,760
-Jae-hak.
-Yes?

222
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,847
Why do you talk so much?

223
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,517
Mind your own business.

224
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,936
Okay.

225
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,151
Let's get going.

226
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,031
Hey, little baby.

227
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,658
Don't be sick.

228
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,851
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

229
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,688
I feel dizzy.

230
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,032
-It's Ik-jun's favorite song.
-It's my favorite song.

231
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,910
-No, it's my song.
-If you lie down after eating,

232
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,245
you'll get reflux esophagitis.

233
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,956
Song-hwa. Did your eyes get worse?

234
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,250
We had the same eyesight
but now I can't see.

235
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,709
Try removing your contacts.

236
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,378
What's taking Jun-wan so long?

237
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,713
Guys, I haven't told you this yet,

238
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,090
but I sing this song really well.

239
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,884
I kept quiet until now
because of the fuss you guys make.

240
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,637
Do you want to go to a karaoke?
Is that it?

241
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,306
What do you say?
Should we go tonight? Oh, good.

242
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,351
-Anything for me?
-Of course. Come, sit down.

243
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,980
-That was quick.
-Yes.

244
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,607
It was a delayed sternal closure.
Do you have ketchup...

245
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,859
You have all sorts of stuff.

246
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,320
It came with the food.

247
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,410
Please, stop wiping the table.
You should see a shrink.

248
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,120
Otherwise, there will be flies.

249
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,414
Put that down before I smack you.

250
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,500
Hey.

251
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,378
-Did you guys know?
-What?

252
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,796
What?

253
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,673
I can sing this song really well.

254
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,092
Isn't this "Aloha" by Cool?

255
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,595
I made a lot of girls cry with this song.

256
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,722
Right. In Hawaii.

257
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,391
-This is good.
-Hawaii?

258
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,101
-Don't.
-What about it?

259
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,019
-What?
-What?

260
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,857
-Something happened in Hawaii, right?
-You bet.

261
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,442
Hey, he...

262
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,111
He was in Hawaii for a month
after his medical board exam.

263
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,779
Stop moving about.

264
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,364
-Ouch.
-You're all over the place.

265
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,534
He was famous for that since high school.

266
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,536
He was friends with everyone
in ten different classes.

267
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,997
He was noisy, easily distracted
and moved about constantly.

268
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,708
I don't know how he always got
the top grades in school.

269
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,045
That's what kids today call
being "on fleek."

270
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,338
And he's "unfleek."

271
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,674
I'm trying to listen to the song.

272
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,343
You annoying prick.

273
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,596
Did you pick
Professor Lee's surgery again?

274
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,890
-Yes.
-Gyeo-ul.

275
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,893
Do you like Professor Lee?

276
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,478
Yes.

277
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,189
I like Professor Lee.

278
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,651
He has a kid.

279
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,195
So what?

280
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,865
Nothing.

281
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,997
Have we ever performed "Aloha"?

282
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,625
No, we have not.
We never performed a show.

283
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,335
At least, we had a conscience.

284
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,753
Hey, do you remember?

285
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,131
We practiced all night
to perform a show with this song.

286
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,426
But that jerk registered our band
as a comedy team.

287
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,429
And that jerk told us
on the day of the festival.

288
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,099
He said we weren't on the poster
because we were a secret weapon.

289
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,684
Gosh, that idiot.

290
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,103
He's lucky he's a doctor.
Otherwise, he'd be a fraud.

291
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,355
Our band was closer
to a comedy than a music show.

292
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,775
I saved you guys from getting
beaten up by the audience.

293
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,568
-Come on.
-But still,

294
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,320
we improved a lot in three to four years.

295
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,697
We did well given our situation.

296
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,949
Besides, you guys were scared.

297
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,910
When you found out about the show,
your hands shook for a week.

298
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,621
-I thought he had hand tremors.
-Gosh.

299
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,873
I was worried he might not be able
to finish his internship

300
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,793
-with those shaky hands.
-Stop making stories up.

301
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,505
Did we suck that bad?
I thought we were pretty good.

302
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,633
Performing on stage is
a different matter altogether.

303
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,218
It was like Gag Concert.

304
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,388
Ik-jun got so mad while he tried
to teach you to play the bass guitar.

305
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,807
Damn it. I'm still angry about that.

306
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,560
Hey, I wasn't that bad.

307
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,894
Besides...

308
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,356
He's good but he was a terrible teacher.

309
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,527
Even so, I like Ik-jun's voice.

310
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,653
There you go. Good one.

311
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,905
I'll sing for you guys today.

312
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,616
Let's go to karaoke after work.

313
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,745
If we had time to go to karaoke,
we wouldn't be here eating seafood stew.

314
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,663
I have VSD surgery.

315
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,415
I have a conference with the PED tonight.

316
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,791
I'm grocery shopping with Mom.

317
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,376
What about this weekend?

318
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,045
I'm golfing
with the director and chairman.

319
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,714
-A half-marathon. It's been a while.
-I'm going camping.

320
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,217
I'm getting my nails done with Mom.

321
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,053
Fine, we won't go.

322
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,306
You guys are ridiculous.

323
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,643
Do you think I've got nothing better
to do than go to a karaoke with you?

324
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,854
I'm busy, too.

325
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,523
I need to watch a movie
and do some coloring with U-ju.

326
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,901
We need to eat loach soup, too.

327
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,987
I won't go. I'm not going! Gosh.

328
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,240
-He'll probably go, right?
-100 percent.

329
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,161
SU KARAOKE

330
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,955
-Guess where we are, U-ju.
-Is that a nightclub?

331
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,501
-Who taught you that word?
-Aunt did.

332
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,504
Aunt Terminator told me

333
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:12,508
that you lived at a place called
nightclub a long time ago.

334
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,384
Nightclub Rat.

335
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,806
That's true.

336
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,476
Your dad used to live in an apartment
named "Nightclub."

337
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,603
But this isn't that apartment.

338
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,440
This place is...
You know that I'm in a band, right?

339
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,693
Like in Super Wings,
I sing, dance, and put on shows.

340
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,028
I'm just like them.

341
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,532
And this is the first place
I ever performed.

342
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,536
You can say that I spent my youth here.

343
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
U-ju.

344
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,789
Suddenly,

345
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,084
I feel a bit overwhelmed.

346
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,091
Dad. Please buy me one more corn dog.

347
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,054
The corn dog...
Did you finish that already?

348
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,097
Yes.

349
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,725
Okay. Let's go before the stall closes.
All right.

350
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,562
-Is the corn dog that good?
-Yes.

351
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,857
Hey, U-ju.

352
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,568
You only say "please"
when you want something from me.

353
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,945
No, that's not true. That's news to me.

354
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,322
What? Where did you learn that?

355
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,408
-Mom.
-My gosh.

356
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,411
I stayed up all night

357
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:28,208
Seeing you smile makes me happy

358
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,753
Even if you're just joking

359
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,422
Hey.

360
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,341
Sorry. I was trying to reserve a song,
but I ended up canceling it.

361
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,677
-Liar.
-That's right. I lied.

362
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,764
Hey, wake up.

363
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,684
What's wrong with him?

364
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,228
He took three calming pills this morning.

365
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,063
Because of the show?

366
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,900
Seok-hyeong is a shut-in and
a sociophobe, who lives in isolation.

367
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,277
-My gosh, what was the last one?
-A coward.

368
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,905
Yes. With that, he was known
as the Grand Slammer.

369
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,325
Hey, it's my turn!

370
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,077
I was requested something.
Give me a second.

371
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,413
Listen. It should be me, Seok-hyeong,

372
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,249
Ik-jun, Jun-wan, then Song-hwa.
So it's my turn to sing.

373
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,835
Are you actually keeping count?
Are you some kind of a pervert?

374
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,503
Where's Ik-jun?

375
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,881
We're here because of him.

376
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,926
My goodness. What is this song?

377
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,843
"ALOHA" BY COOL

378
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,846
-Did you pick this song?
-No, I didn't.

379
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,640
Then, who did?

380
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:32,439
A candle in the dark

381
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,985
A wineglass filled with our promise

382
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:42,616
I will always stay by your side
And protect you

383
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,078
After all, you believed in me

384
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,333
I'll ask only one thing from you

385
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,879
I'm dreaming
To be eternally happy with you

386
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:01,301
It doesn't have to be fancy
I don't need a perfect life

387
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,138
The only thing I want is you

388
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,515
Don't worry

389
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,892
Always

390
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,439
I will always remember this moment

391
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,816
In my arms

392
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,442
Sit down, guys.

393
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,319
Don't get too excited. Sit down.

394
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:24,324
I will make sure
Your smile lights up forever

395
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,582
I am not saying this because I am happy

396
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,544
To spend our first night together

397
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,255
I will not change

398
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,717
I will only have eyes for you

399
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,685
-Even if I lose everything
-Even if I lose everything

400
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,146
-I won't regret this
-I won't regret this

401
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,190
-I will always love you
-I will always love you

402
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:02,279
-With my everlasting love for you
-With my everlasting love for you

403
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,864
"From this moment on,

404
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,451
the most important person
in my life isn't me but you.

405
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,203
I cannot show my determination with words,

406
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,205
but I love only you.

407
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,458
-Like friends
-You said he's shy.

408
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,084
-or like couples,
-Too much medication.

409
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,047
until my last breath,
I will only love you."

410
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,468
As we believe we are of one

411
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,722
And as we always trust one another

412
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,059
-Stay on beat.
-I hope we will comfort each other

413
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,394
In misery and celebrate

414
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,565
-Happiness together
-Hey, slowly.

415
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,691
I promise you

416
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,652
When things get hard

417
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,574
-I'll be your protector
-I'll be your protector

418
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,242
When you smile in my arms

419
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,080
I will make sure

420
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,334
-Your smile lights up forever
-Your smile lights up forever

421
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,009
-I am not saying this because I am happy
-I am not saying this because I am happy

422
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,929
-To spend our first night together
-To spend our first night together

423
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,556
-I will not change
-I will not change

424
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,976
-I will only have eyes for you
-I will only have eyes for you

425
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:25,237
-Even if I lose everything
-Even if I lose everything

426
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,531
-I won't regret this
-I won't regret this

427
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,575
-I will always love you
-I will always love you

428
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,122
-With my everlasting love for you
-With my everlasting love for you

429
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,353
-At seven o'clock, let's meet up!
-Let's meet up!

430
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,855
Hello, this is Lee Soo-geun.

431
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,398
Hey, Ji-won, say hello.

432
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,567
Hello. I'm Hey, Ji-won.

433
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,903
Ji-won, I looked at the calendar
for May today.

434
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,780
I noticed there are
so many holidays in May.

435
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,199
-There's a holiday for you, too.
-Children's Day!

436
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,994
That's right. There's Children's Day
and there's Parents' Day.

437
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,204
And Teachers' Day as well!
There are so many!

438
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,873
Are you trying to sell something?

439
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,292
We're discussing holidays.
You sound like a street peddler.

440
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,378
But there's one thing that disappoints me.
There's no holiday for myself.

441
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,006
Come on, Soo-geun.
You do whatever you want every day.

442
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,632
-What do you mean?
-Every single day.

443
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,511
What if you can do only the things
you want to do for one day?

444
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,055
How about we try to live today like that?

445
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,099
May is the perfect month for that.

446
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,936
Here's our first song.
It's a song by Cool. It's in English.

447
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,854
Ji-won.

448
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,665
Over here!

449
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,545
-One, two.
-One, two.

450
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,298
-Let's do this!
-Let's go!

451
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,303
-Good luck.
-Let's complete the run!

452
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,352
You have one minute before we start!

453
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:26,816
I try to get rid of your scent in the wind

454
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,280
Get going, it doesn't matter where

455
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,199
Hello, sir. I'm here.

456
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,077
You can park your car in B-104.
It's empty now.

457
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,703
Okay. Thank you.

458
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,427
Good luck with your records!

459
00:25:54,511 --> 00:26:00,058
Five, four, three, two, one.

460
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,465
Shouldn't we send him
to a mental hospital or something?

461
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,343
-You are right.
-Goodness.

462
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,556
HYEON-HO MIGHT HAVE SURGICAL BLEEDING
ELEVATED LACTIC ACID LEVEL, NO URINE

463
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,431
RESIDENT YONG SEOK-MIN

464
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:44,204
YEONINSAN CAMPSITE, B-104

465
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,213
Look at that.

466
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,258
He's good.

467
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,763
Isn't it hard to handle VIP patients
on top of your regular patients?

468
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,265
No, it's doable.
There are other doctors, too.

469
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,268
It's nice to see a young doctor like you.

470
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,853
I envy your friendship, too.

471
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,272
Jong-su, the tenth hole is too far.

472
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,899
Let's take the cart.

473
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,698
He's my cousin.

474
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,493
-That's supposed to be a secret.
-Everyone knows.

475
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,954
-Everyone at the hospital knows.
-No.

476
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,081
Not everyone knows.

477
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,375
Hey, you know what?

478
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,255
People know even the things
you assume they have no idea about.

479
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,594
Hey, I'm tired too. Let's take the cart.

480
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,972
-Let's just walk.
-Take the cart.

481
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,682
Let's walk.

482
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,392
Are you upset?

483
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,321
How much did you prescribe?

484
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,198
What about the IO?

485
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,326
Okay. I'll be there soon.

486
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,039
Thank you.

487
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,294
-You and me.
-A scamming phone call.

488
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:20,008
"Sir, I need you
to go to an ATM right now."

489
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,510
Professor Yang.
What a surprise to see you here.

490
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,637
I thought you weren't eating?

491
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,266
My schedule suddenly freed up.

492
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,517
I see.

493
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,104
-Professor Yang, why didn't you tell us?
-Yes?

494
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,981
About what?

495
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,233
You were in a comedy club during pre-med.

496
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,445
I was so surprised.
I didn't see it coming.

497
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,489
I thought you were a loner,
but you're pretty cool.

498
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,324
No, I wasn't. Who said that?

499
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,493
Dr. Jang told us.

500
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,245
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul who is
a third-year GS resident.

501
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,414
Hello.

502
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,999
Dr. Jang. It's true, isn't it?

503
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:57,045
You said those five professors who were
born in 1980 were in a comedy club.

504
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,589
-That's what I heard, too.
-From whom?

505
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,341
Professor Lee Ik-jun
of Hepatopancreatic Surgery.

506
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,300
I see.

507
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,846
Weren't you in the middle of your meal?

508
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,057
Try some bread. It's really good.

509
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,851
Okay. Dig in.

510
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,395
Professor Yang,
we'd love to have a meal with you.

511
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,272
I hear Dr. Jang buys them beef.

512
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,526
Sure. Eat up.
I'll treat you to beef some other time.

513
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,819
Right?

514
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,863
My gosh. I should get going.

515
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,408
I just got a text message that they have
the result of the MRI I requested.

516
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,743
Bye, then.

517
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,286
-Okay.
-Okay.

518
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,205
-Bye.
-Bye.

519
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,873
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

520
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,791
Goodness. Bye.

521
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,172
Tae-in, did you get any MRI requests
from ob-gyn today?

522
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,424
No, there's none.
I just checked before I came down here.

523
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,219
Gosh, what is with him?

524
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,304
How does he get along with other people?

525
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,724
Professor Yang is good
at what he does, though.

526
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,978
He's not authoritative,
and he always does his work.

527
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,897
-I like him.
-Is that how things work in America?

528
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,067
I heard he did
his fellowship in the States.

529
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,819
Is it the merit of individualism?

530
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,988
Tell me how that's considered merit.

531
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,990
He's just a frustrating sloth.

532
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,826
I just wish he would talk at least.

533
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,578
I can never read what he's thinking.

534
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,084
Dr. Jang, who's that? Your boyfriend?

535
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,544
Even his photo makes you that happy?

536
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,923
-Yes. It does make me happy.
-My gosh.

537
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:24,966
I'll get going now.

538
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,767
An ambulance brought her in
due to a severe stomachache.

539
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,769
According to the X-ray scan,
it could be an ileus.

540
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,272
We called you because
she had a liver transplant before.

541
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,774
She released gas and had diarrhea
while waiting.

542
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,444
Good work. Can you bend your knees for me?

543
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,031
I'm sorry, doctor. It's the weekend.

544
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,034
Gyu-bin, you know I'm always on call.
Give me a second.

545
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,497
You had diarrhea and released gas, right?

546
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,084
Yes. But it doesn't hurt at all now.

547
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,296
I thought I was going to die
in the ambulance.

548
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,008
As soon as I saw your face,
the pain disappeared completely.

549
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,178
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay. You're recovering.

550
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,307
But Gyu-bin, I'm really sorry
about the scar.

551
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,518
That's nothing. I'm just glad
to be back in school.

552
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,103
Goodness.

553
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,566
Can I take a scan quickly?

554
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,817
-Yes.
-Okay.

555
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,570
I knew it. See?

556
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,491
I knew you would be here.
Is this the golf course?

557
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,034
Jeez. Take a look at this.

558
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,912
What is it? I don't have much time.

559
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,374
I've had revision surgery. They're
closing up now, so I need to get back.

560
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,750
It won't take long.

561
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,544
This teenage patient had an LDLT.

562
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,713
It's not as visible with steroids,

563
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,925
but the hypertrophy on the vertical scar
is a bit too noticeable.

564
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,344
Can you refer this case to a scar clinic?

565
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,637
Sure.

566
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,349
Send her to my department.
I'll take a look.

567
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,852
My gosh.

568
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,564
Ik-sun also has biliary atresia.

569
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,442
She still has a big scar on her stomach
from Kasai's operation.

570
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,027
Ik-sun's still alive?

571
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,697
What? Why would she be dead?

572
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,031
Wasn't that your dog's name?

573
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,742
-That's Micky.
-Micky is your sister.

574
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,703
-My sister is Ik-sun.
-That's your dog.

575
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,870
My dog's name is Ik-sun.

576
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,914
No, my dog's name is Micky.
Micky is Ik-sun.

577
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,624
Damn it. You confused me.

578
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,293
My younger sister's name is Ik-sun.

579
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,837
Hey, what is this?

580
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,968
This is a recommendation letter
for priests.

581
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,011
Right?

582
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,887
-It's for real this time, right?
-Yes.

583
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,681
I feel bad for Jeong-won's mother.

584
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,766
Same. That jerk.

585
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,936
-Is it Jeong-won?
-No, it's my wife.

586
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,479
Your wife? You have a wife?

587
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,315
Yes, I have a wife.

588
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,276
The ambitious Ms. Yuk Hye-jeong?

589
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,361
She's so busy, I'll forget her face
pretty soon.

590
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,279
That's enough.

591
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,948
Hey, honey. It's been so long!

592
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,617
What time is it over there?

593
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,536
Okay.

594
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,080
Is your marathon course here?

595
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,042
-Tell me which hole this room counts as.
-Yes.

596
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,755
-It's his wife.
-Okay.

597
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,381
-Really?
-Okay. Sure.

598
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,300
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

599
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,719
She's coming back tomorrow.

600
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,596
She's coming straight to the hospital
because she misses me.

601
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,347
It's because it's Children's Day
in two days.

602
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,392
-Has it been a year since you saw her?
-A year and a half.

603
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,020
She should've been here
for her mom's death anniversary at least.

604
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,773
Whatever! That's not my business.

605
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,441
Gosh, Yuk Hye-jeong.

606
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,069
She's my friend
and I was the one who set him up with her.

607
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,447
I have never seen anyone
who is as ambitious as she is.

608
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,866
I've never seen you
badmouth anyone either.

609
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,118
Stop it. She's my wife.
And she's U-ju's mother.

610
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,037
The virgin and the bachelor
should shut it.

611
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,039
That's such an outdated term.
A "bachelor."

612
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,583
Hey, Jeong-won. What is this?

613
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,048
Are you really going to quit
to become a priest?

614
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,134
-Did you RSVP?
-Is that important right now?

615
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,261
Listen. If you...

616
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,514
Hey, Gyeo-ul.

617
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,309
Of course.
I collected a lot of those. Yes.

618
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,436
-Okay. I got it.
-When is it?

619
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,313
-Did you talk to the director?
-Okay.

620
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,148
I'll tell him next week.

621
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,193
I won't be leaving right away.

622
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,904
I'll stay until the end of the year
and resign then.

623
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,824
I'm going to go see Gyeo-ul.

624
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,951
Seriously. Wait.

625
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,539
Look over here. Look at the camera.

626
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,791
One, two, three.

627
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,252
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

628
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,755
Jeong-won will leave us soon.
We should leave many photos behind.

629
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,882
-Bye.
-What the...

630
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,346
Is he having an affair with Gyeo-ul?

631
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,993
Don't you have a photo of him alone?

632
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,204
Give me some time.
I'm looking for the right time.

633
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,623
But Jeong-won catches on really fast.

634
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,793
Did you ask him about me?
What does he think of me?

635
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,171
-Not yet.
-Why not?

636
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,840
It'll be too obvious. Is that okay?

637
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,092
Yes. I don't mind.

638
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,511
So, please ask him how he thinks of me.

639
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,763
Why don't you tell him you like him then?

640
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,142
That's too...

641
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,854
-I'm too shy to do that.
-Gosh.

642
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,481
-But you're not shy talking to me?
-No.

643
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,737
Okay, fine. I'll be extra sneaky

644
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,864
and ask him what he thinks of you.

645
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,491
I'm doing this
because I think highly of your courage.

646
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,374
This is yukjeon. It's from Gwangju.

647
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,669
Oh, my. Are you serious? Yukjeon?

648
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,093
Why do you like Jeong-won so much?

649
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,679
Everything.

650
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,598
Do you need water?

651
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,683
I'm fine.

652
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,186
Gyeo-ul.

653
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,940
I think you have this fantasy
about Jeong-won.

654
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,735
The way he treats people at the hospital

655
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,029
and the way he behaves around us
are very different.

656
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,823
What is he like?
I want to hear everything.

657
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,034
He's so sensitive.

658
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,412
He loses sleep for a month
if something goes wrong with his patient.

659
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,414
He's so humanitarian.

660
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,042
And he's extremely stubborn.

661
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,210
He is a man of principles.

662
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,629
And he's not rich. He's dirt poor.

663
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,297
He mooches off Jun-wan.

664
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,299
Isn't that noblesse oblige?

665
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,510
Are we playing a game of antonyms?

666
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,597
What else? Tell me everything.

667
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,184
Most importantly, he...

668
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,603
Gosh.

669
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,897
Dating...

670
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,024
No. He's not interested in women.

671
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,528
I have never seen him with a girl, ever.

672
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,491
This is for your ears only.

673
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,411
Jeong-won is interested in something else.

674
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,413
Is he a sexual minority?

675
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,000
Jeez. Not like that. I mean
he wants to be a man of God.

676
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,793
Not bride. A priest.

677
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,837
I doubt that.

678
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,172
I hope so, too.

679
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,177
I know that Professor Ahn
is a devout Catholic.

680
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,014
All his brothers are priests,
and his sisters are nuns.

681
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,309
But he's not a priest yet.

682
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,269
He just wants to be one.

683
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,981
Then I still have a chance.

684
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,191
Ik-jun, give me a cigarette.

685
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,537
Not with Gyeo-ul of all people.

686
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,917
You prick, you'd better come
to your senses before I beat you up.

687
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,795
What are you thinking? You're married.

688
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,676
What?

689
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,470
What do you think about Gyeo-ul?

690
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,515
-What?
-What do you think about her?

691
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,151
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

692
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,197
SURGERY STATUS, IN WAITING

693
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,048
Hey.

694
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,217
Dad just came down.

695
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,729
Before we move you to the OR,
let me check a few things.

696
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,565
-What's your name?
-It's Jeong Su-beom.

697
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,776
Let me check your ID bracelet.

698
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,237
You are here today to be operated
by Professor Kim Jun-wan

699
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
of Cardiothoracic Surgery?

700
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,948
Yes.

701
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,497
Dad. Be strong in there, okay?

702
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,958
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.

703
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,543
My sweetheart.

704
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,838
I am sorry.

705
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,552
I can't come to your wedding
because I am sick.

706
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,013
I am so sorry, sweetie.

707
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,934
Why are you sorry? I am sorry, Dad.

708
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,938
How could I get married when you're sick?

709
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,357
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,792
Hello.

711
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,880
We're going to move
the patient into the OR now.

712
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,966
How have you been?

713
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,218
How are you feeling?

714
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,971
Let me explain about the surgery.

715
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,098
As I told you,
I'll remove the infected mass

716
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,184
and mold the area
with the leftover tissues.

717
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,519
It will take about five hours.

718
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,980
But it could be longer
if there's a complication.

719
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,942
Doctor, you've done
this surgery many times, right?

720
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,152
Yes.

721
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,155
Then, we don't have
to worry too much, right?

722
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,283
This surgery isn't life-threatening
or anything, right?

723
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,743
I cannot guarantee that.

724
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,287
There are a lot of variables
during surgery.

725
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,289
Oh, no.

726
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,624
However, I will do my best.

727
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,716
Jeez.

728
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,471
You should have just told them
that he's going to be fine.

729
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,724
The patient's daughter
is getting married today.

730
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,477
The whole family
must already feel bad for each other.

731
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,063
You should have been nicer to them.

732
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,815
You could have just told them

733
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,319
that the surgery will be successful,
so they have nothing to worry about.

734
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,404
Can't you just say that?

735
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,242
This surgery isn't that difficult for you.

736
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,621
What if the patient has
periannular abscess?

737
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,375
What if he has brain damage
from an embolism during surgery?

738
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,002
But the chance of that happening
is very low.

739
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,547
He has no feelings.

740
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,757
How do feelings help with surgeries?

741
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,842
I'll be emotional if it helps,
but it doesn't.

742
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,386
It doesn't help at all.

743
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,429
I'm sorry.

744
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,265
Never talk to the patients
like that again.

745
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,267
"It's a simple surgery. You will live.

746
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,019
This surgery will go well.
Don't worry about anything."

747
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,648
Don't. Got it?

748
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,025
Yes.

749
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,206
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

750
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,421
One ice Americano
with three shots, please.

751
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,172
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hello.

752
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,301
You guys are here early.
A piece of chocolate cake, too.

753
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,554
We've been here
since eight in the morning.

754
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,557
Is that so? That's impressive.

755
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,183
-Pay with this.
-What?

756
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,144
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

757
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,481
Dr. Do is good to you, right?

758
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,275
Yes, he's really nice.

759
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,402
Goodness. I'm glad to hear that.

760
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,280
Can I ask you
why you chose Cardiothoracic Surgery?

761
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,575
It's our assignment to do an interview.

762
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,868
We asked another professor as well.

763
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:41,785
Who?

764
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,289
We just started,
so we only interviewed one professor.

765
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,499
It's Professor Chae Song-hwa
of Neurosurgery.

766
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,293
What did she say?

767
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,504
She chose Neurosurgery
because she wanted to study.

768
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,465
There is still a lot to study
in her field.

769
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,884
I know. No one knows it better than I do.

770
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,302
What about you, sir?

771
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,723
Me? I went to an Internet cafe

772
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,309
and a cardiothoracic surgeon I sat next to
told me to choose CS.

773
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,314
-Professor, please.
-I'm serious.

774
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,524
I was asked whether
I wanted to make money or teach.

775
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,526
I said I'd prefer to teach

776
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,736
and he told me to choose CS.

777
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,446
That's why I'm here.

778
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,323
I see.

779
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,035
May I have this chocolate cake?

780
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,119
No, you may not.

781
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,165
Just get one more.

782
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,291
Okay.

783
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,886
Irrigation is very important.
You know that, right?

784
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,347
-Yes.
-Why is it important?

785
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,602
Well...

786
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,021
Through the microscope,

787
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,941
you can see
that it's close to the optic nerve.

788
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:58,654
So, a bipolar cautery
can cause a thermal injuries,

789
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,782
which can result in loss of vision
after the surgery.

790
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,670
Ms. Nam, we should operate
on Chan-hyeong tomorrow.

791
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,715
Yes. His lung sounds have improved,
and the X-rays look much better.

792
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,009
Yes. It will be hard for him
if we keep putting it off.

793
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,719
His guardians are here, right?

794
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,346
Yes, I'll go bring them.

795
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,310
Jae-hak, do you happen
to have a suit here?

796
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,479
Yes, I always keep one at the office.

797
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,939
Can I borrow it?

798
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,443
-They went home.
-What?

799
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,362
They went home,
when their child is that sick?

800
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,864
How can that be possible?

801
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,491
Chan-hyeong's mom went home for a bit.

802
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,286
Both of his grandmothers are here though.

803
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,996
They should be in the lounge.

804
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,957
Shall I go bring them?

805
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,250
Yes, please.

806
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,462
We've been postponing the surgery
due to pneumonia,

807
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,797
but the fever has gone down,
and so has the CRP.

808
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,424
I think now would be the best time.

809
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,178
Is the operation dangerous, doctor?

810
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,180
-Are you his grandmother?
-I'm his maternal grandmother.

811
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,890
-This is his paternal grandmother.
-I see.

812
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,268
For now, please be informed that
we will operate tomorrow afternoon.

813
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,605
When his parents are back,
I'll walk them through the details.

814
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,858
You can just tell us instead.

815
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,568
His mom is only 20.

816
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,403
She's clueless because she's so young.

817
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,197
The same goes for my son.

818
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,449
That's right.
You can just tell us, doctor.

819
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,242
Then I'll speak to all of you later.

820
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,077
His mom is still his legal guardian.

821
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,120
I'll see you then.

822
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,878
You can talk
to the grandmothers, professor.

823
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,632
I'll go over everything with his
mom and get the consent form signed.

824
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,258
Don't overlook a single detail.

825
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,927
-Your suit is at the office?
-Yes.

826
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,345
-What color is it?
-Color?

827
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,555
Yes, what color is your suit?

828
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,350
Are you worried that it might be silver?

829
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,215
Jun-wan, are you...

830
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,217
Oh, boy.

831
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,094
Don't say anything.

832
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,178
Okay.

833
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,517
Are you not going to have lunch?
I'm hungry.

834
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,018
How about braised hairtail fish?

835
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,189
I suddenly got a craving for it
for some reason.

836
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,358
I have to go out. I'm meeting someone.

837
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,943
What are you going to eat?

838
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,278
Steak.

839
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,196
Gosh, I don't like steak.

840
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,871
Shall I eat out too? It's been a while.

841
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,085
Hello. This is Ahn Jeong-won.

842
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,754
Okay, I'll be right there.

843
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,548
Gosh.

844
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,009
Chi-hong, can you wrap this up for me?

845
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,051
Sure.

846
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,228
You have to insert the Hemovac first.

847
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,521
Yes.

848
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,944
Are you going to keep breaking it?

849
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,530
Control your strength. Be gentle with it.

850
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,116
Okay. I'm sorry.

851
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,744
I'll stop talking.

852
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,370
You should focus. I'm sorry.

853
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,747
It's okay.

854
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,750
Mr. Yuk Hui-gwan.

855
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,127
-Congratulations. You can go home now.
-Thank you.

856
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,254
Your surgical wound has been disinfected

857
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,839
and wrapped in waterproof bandage.

858
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,591
You can take a shower right away.

859
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:51,428
As for food, you can eat normally
but please try not to overeat.

860
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,472
Mom, can you transform this?

861
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,183
In a bit, Won-jun. Give me a minute.

862
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,477
You have an appointment booked
in a week from now.

863
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,187
The biopsy results will be available then.

864
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,814
If you need the diagnosis
for your insurance, just let us know.

865
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,608
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

866
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,028
Hurry, Mom. I want this
transformed into the robot.

867
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,074
Is Dr. Lee Ik-jun doing rounds today
by any chance?

868
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,326
I haven't had a chance
to thank him properly.

869
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,619
He did such an excellent job.

870
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,537
Won-jun!

871
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,290
-Hello, Dr. Lee.
-Yes, hello.

872
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,917
Give me that. I'll do it for you.

873
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,794
My gosh.

874
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,506
Mr. Yuk, you don't even
look like a patient without your IV drip.

875
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,632
You're handsome.

876
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,758
Gosh, I'm flattered.

877
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,802
You remembered his name.

878
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,387
You must have a lot of patients.

879
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,555
My wife's surname is also Yuk.

880
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,016
Other than her, you're the only one
I know with that surname.

881
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,853
Actually, there's my father-in-law,
brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and niece.

882
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,772
Gosh, there are so many.

883
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,649
You're going home today, right?

884
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,651
Yes. Tomorrow is Children's Day,

885
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,736
so I'm happy I can be home for that.

886
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,779
Yes, you're right.

887
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,280
I can't go anywhere far.

888
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,117
We're just going to eat
at a Chinese restaurant near our place.

889
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,702
Won-jun loves jajangmyeon.

890
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,538
My kid loves jajangmyeon too. All kids do.

891
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,124
You had a simple
laparoscopic cholecystectomy,

892
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,334
so don't worry about
post-surgical complications.

893
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,044
Don't overexert yourself

894
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,088
but try to walk as much as you can.

895
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,965
Exercise will help you, okay?

896
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,718
All right. Here you go.

897
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,178
Wow, who are you?

898
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,346
Won-jun.

899
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,432
You silly goose, what do you think?

900
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,976
I'm the one who got rid of the ouchy
from your dad's tummy.

901
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,645
Goodbye.
I'll see you at your next appointment.

902
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,522
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

903
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,857
Say goodbye properly.

904
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,234
-Thank you, Dr. Lee!
-My pleasure!

905
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,737
Oh, my. Look at this.

906
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,196
-Hello.
-Hello.

907
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,617
Hello.

908
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,620
Did Song-hwa scold you again?

909
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,372
-Yes.
-No.

910
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,124
I guess it was you then.

911
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,418
It was Chi-hong this time.

912
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,627
But he said no.

913
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,589
He's a tough cookie
because he has a military background.

914
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,426
It happened because
I couldn't answer her questions.

915
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,052
Even I thought I sounded dumb.

916
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,680
You graduated
from the Korea Military Academy, right?

917
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,433
-Yes.
-I know someone from...

918
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,768
Hello?

919
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,895
Yes, where are you?

920
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,564
Okay, I'll head over there now. All right.

921
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:11,943
Yes, Professor.

922
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,612
Right.

923
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,614
Yes, I got it.

924
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,366
You know the emergency patient
from the traffic accident yesterday?

925
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,743
-Yes.
-We haven't operated

926
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,037
because of unstable vitals
and severe bleeding.

927
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,455
But it seems Professor Chae

928
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,415
-will perform the surgery tonight.
-I see.

929
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,751
-There will be a meeting later.
-Okay, great.

930
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,670
-"Great?" Really?
-Yes.

931
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,464
She totally put you on the spot earlier.

932
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,050
She was just asking questions.

933
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,260
I wanted to work on that case anyway.

934
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,386
I was hoping to be assigned

935
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,764
in assisting Professor Chae for the case.

936
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,224
This is perfect.

937
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,518
-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.

938
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,853
Why don't you get a cranial CT scan?

939
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,482
Sure, if there's an employee discount.

940
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,461
Sounds good. We'll do that.

941
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,006
You should take a nap

942
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,383
and I'll see you guys tonight.

943
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,467
Okay.

944
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,723
She was going to do that
with the surgery anyway.

945
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,100
You know that's not what matters.

946
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,227
What matters to her
is whether we knew it or not.

947
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,401
There are roses.

948
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,611
Is it already the season for roses?

949
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,156
Dr. Yong, you're very observant.

950
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,700
My family has a flower shop.

951
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,660
Everyone knows what roses look like.

952
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,911
Not really. These days,

953
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,747
many people don't know
the names of plants and flowers.

954
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,630
Are they fake flowers?

955
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,016
That's just wrong.

956
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,148
I'm just realizing that it's been long
since I saw real flowers.

957
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,359
Professor Chae,
are you going camping again this weekend?

958
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,485
Yes, why do you ask?

959
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,945
Can we join?

960
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,406
You can come, right?
You're not working this weekend.

961
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,450
Can we join?

962
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,536
Yes, you can.
But do you guys really want to come?

963
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,704
Yes.

964
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,415
You keep us on our toes,

965
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,417
but you don't make us uncomfortable.

966
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,545
Gosh, Seok-min. My goodness.

967
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,589
I just can't hate you.

968
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,007
You annoy me here and there,

969
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,675
but you don't make me uncomfortable.

970
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,846
Okay, let's do it.
There, you can see real roses

971
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,556
as well as butterflies.

972
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,474
I'm off.

973
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,065
Did you order?

974
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,775
The coffee here is very good.

975
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,276
Do you want some cake?

976
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,279
Can we go somewhere quiet?

977
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,991
-What?
-I have to talk to you about something.

978
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,414
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

979
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,544
Ho-jun.

980
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,880
Go get changed.

981
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,883
I brought a T-shirt
and a pair of pants for you.

982
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,593
The visiting hours will begin shortly.

983
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,261
I'll get changed after I see Dad.

984
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,807
Gosh, you still have 20 to 30 minutes.

985
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,727
Hey, I see some chairs over there.
Let's go sit down.

986
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,020
Okay.

987
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,648
She must be out of her mind.

988
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:42,070
I can't believe this.
Did she cancel her honeymoon?

989
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,364
Eun-bin! We're here.

990
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,745
Hey, don't be like that.

991
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,288
Everything went well.

992
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,211
Jin-hui is a good photographer.

993
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,963
No, it's my camera.

994
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,257
Downloading all the photos
would be a nuisance,

995
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,050
so I told her to use my phone
to take photos.

996
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,721
Oh, your uncle was there too.

997
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,348
He said he won't be able to make it.

998
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,892
Oh, who's this?

999
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,813
Isn't he the doctor
who performed your dad's surgery?

1000
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,773
Eun-bin,
Dad's doctor came to your wedding?

1001
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,066
Yes.

1002
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,484
When?

1003
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,487
He was the first one
to stop by the bride's room.

1004
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,740
What's with that face though?

1005
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,451
He didn't even take a picture.
He just ate and left.

1006
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,869
Come on. Be grateful that he came.

1007
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,288
He asked me about the main course.
I told him it's galbitang.

1008
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,332
Then he got excited
and rushed to the diner.

1009
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,334
He obviously came to my wedding
to have dinner.

1010
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,587
Come on. Galbitang is nothing.

1011
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,715
I'd love to take him out
for a steak dinner.

1012
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,342
He'd say no to that anyway.

1013
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,053
Doctors can't say yes to things like that.

1014
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,180
I didn't think he'd be like this,

1015
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,848
but he's actually very charming.

1016
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,726
The ICU is open now. Come on in.

1017
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,853
Oh, okay. Thank you.

1018
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,188
Thank you.

1019
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,193
Hey, don't cry.

1020
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,487
Are you going to cry in front of Dad?

1021
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,657
Seriously, don't cry.

1022
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,910
Why are you crying? His surgery went well.

1023
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,079
Dad will be so sad to see you cry.

1024
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,665
Stop crying.

1025
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,543
You will break Dad's heart.
You know that, right?

1026
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,836
Right.

1027
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,049
Smile.

1028
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,513
Give me a bigger smile.

1029
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,520
Aren't you leaving?

1030
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,856
Hey. I have surgery tomorrow
as well as patient appointments,

1031
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,067
-so I have a lot to do.
-Then reschedule the surgery.

1032
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,027
I can't do that.

1033
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,570
How many appointments?

1034
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,655
Twenty.

1035
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,281
I have to go through their charts.

1036
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,200
Why are you still here?

1037
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,077
Everyone did a good job with the surgery,

1038
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,578
so I want to stop by the office.

1039
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,414
-Go check in on Ik-jun.
-Why?

1040
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,792
I think something's up,
but he won't tell me.

1041
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,002
-Really?
-I think it's a family matter,

1042
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,963
so I didn't want to pry.

1043
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,423
But that doesn't sound like him.

1044
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,009
Well, I'm sure he'll sort it out.

1045
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,010
Bye.

1046
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,229
What did you just say?

1047
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,565
I said I want a divorce.

1048
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,194
I wouldn't call this a normal marriage.

1049
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,363
Let's just go back to being friends.

1050
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,742
We're like this because this was
what you wanted.

1051
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,954
When you got transferred,

1052
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,040
I told you I'd follow you to Germany

1053
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:41,958
and you refused.

1054
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,543
You wanted me to keep working.

1055
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,753
Also, you wanted to raise U-ju in Korea.

1056
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,339
That's why we're living like this.
So were we...

1057
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,343
Were we separated?

1058
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,887
No, we weren't.

1059
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,973
I like that you have a career.

1060
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:01,102
And I can totally look after U-ju
by myself.

1061
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:05,565
I know that we've been living apart
for quite a while,

1062
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,650
but we made that decision together.

1063
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,943
Why are you saying...

1064
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,321
What's going on?

1065
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,824
What's the real reason?

1066
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,993
There's no such thing.

1067
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:22,165
I just felt that it was meaningless

1068
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,375
to maintain this kind of marriage.

1069
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,922
Do you mistrust me?

1070
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,381
No.

1071
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,177
I'm going to have lunch
with U-ju tomorrow,

1072
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,637
just the two of us.

1073
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,180
It's a special day, you know.

1074
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,349
You should work.

1075
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,267
I'll stay with him tomorrow.

1076
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:46,022
And about what I said...

1077
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,318
I hope you take it seriously.

1078
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,802
Dr. Ahn, do you want to go for coffee?

1079
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,679
Sure.

1080
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,767
How many questions did I ask you today?

1081
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,313
I'm not sure.

1082
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,191
There were many. So many.

1083
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:31,776
I'm sorry.

1084
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,403
No, it's okay.

1085
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:37,407
Chi-hong, do you know how many operations
I perform on a weekly basis?

1086
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,785
Jeez, I'm asking you a question again.

1087
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,288
I have a problem, don't I?

1088
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,039
I'm really sorry.

1089
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,667
I think you do more than five a week,
on average.

1090
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,711
That means, in a year...

1091
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:53,381
I probably do about 250, roughly speaking.

1092
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,841
Right.

1093
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,051
I want you to be on your toes.

1094
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,265
When you're performing surgery
or treating patients.

1095
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,268
Both you and Seok-min

1096
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,187
should stay alert and focused
at all times. That's why I do it.

1097
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,274
Yes.

1098
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,319
You see, this job is hard.

1099
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,653
But you get used to it quickly.

1100
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:21,701
The thing is though, we should never get
too comfortable doing this.

1101
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,161
That's why.

1102
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,122
Right.

1103
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,751
It's not because I don't like you,
so don't get me wrong.

1104
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,754
And you'd better not give up
halfway through.

1105
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,422
Okay.

1106
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,549
Just trust me and follow my lead.

1107
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:40,678
-Do you understand, Captain Ahn?
-Yes, ma'am.

1108
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,317
-Hey.
-Professor, Chan-hyeong is doing great.

1109
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,902
I checked everything just now.

1110
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,905
Really? There's no need for me to check?
All his ABGA and PaO2 results look good?

1111
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,032
Yes. Everything looks good,

1112
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,534
so just go home already.

1113
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,577
All right.

1114
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,630
Dr. Do walked you through
the surgery procedure, right?

1115
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,383
Chan-hyeong's condition has improved,
so we'll perform surgery...

1116
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,219
Oh, my.

1117
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:26,224
Doctor, please take good care
of Chan-hyeong.

1118
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,436
My gosh, you've been staying
so strong until now.

1119
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,272
Please save Chan-hyeong.

1120
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,319
I wish it was me instead of him.

1121
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,743
Don't cry.

1122
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,955
You've been holding out so well.

1123
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,542
I've been barely keeping it together.

1124
01:01:55,837 --> 01:02:00,758
Both my mom and my mother-in-law
think that we're still kids.

1125
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,679
Everyone says that we're immature.

1126
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,433
So I've been acting all tough on purpose.

1127
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,185
I wanted to cry, but I was afraid

1128
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,689
that they'd say we're too young
to deal with this.

1129
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,983
They would tell me to go home
if I burst into tears.

1130
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,819
What if they wouldn't even let me
see Chan-hyeong?

1131
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:23,156
That's why I've been forcing myself
to act all tough.

1132
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,827
But I can't do it anymore.

1133
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:33,458
Doctor, Chan-hyeong will be okay, right?

1134
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,835
We've performed this surgery many times.

1135
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,587
We'll make sure he'll be okay.

1136
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:41,215
Then, it will go well, right?

1137
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,222
Yes, we'll do our best.

1138
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,933
Thank you.

1139
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,274
By the way, why did you go home
in the morning?

1140
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,154
Oh, Hui-dong's Mom

1141
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,741
-is a shaman.
-Oh, I see.

1142
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,120
She said putting a crock lid upside down
and filling it with water

1143
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,664
can help Chan-hyeong recover soon.

1144
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,128
I'm sorry. I heard that
doctors don't like such superstitions.

1145
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,880
Gosh, don't be sorry. It's okay.

1146
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:25,259
If it helps you worry less,
you should do it. By all means.

1147
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,095
Then...

1148
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,269
Just this.

1149
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,359
I'm sorry.

1150
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,987
Don't be.

1151
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,832
Uncles and Aunts.

1152
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,417
Chan-hyeong is here.

1153
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,309
His CRP levels have gone up a little.

1154
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,186
Yes, but his CBC level

1155
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,105
and chest X-ray from this morning
look good.

1156
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,398
All right.

1157
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,694
Wakanda.

1158
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,239
You don't know what it is? Black Panther.

1159
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,620
Don't say "Forever."
Just stay still like that.

1160
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,541
KIM CHAN-HYEONG

1161
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,544
Pump on, please.

1162
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,005
Turning the pump on.

1163
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,930
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
SURGERY DURATION

1164
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,252
Is the color of the drainage okay?

1165
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,921
What about the AC?

1166
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,967
Okay. Call me when you have
the per-hour urine output.

1167
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:30,968
All right.

1168
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,430
Professor,
why didn't you answer your phone?

1169
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,308
-I was on the phone.
-My gosh.

1170
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,896
They said they couldn't get a hold of you.
That's why I'm here. The thing is...

1171
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,065
It's about Mr. Yuk Hui-gwan.

1172
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,608
What about him?

1173
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,193
He was discharged yesterday.

1174
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,695
They were going through the records

1175
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,741
and found out that he is
the brain-dead organ donor.

1176
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,826
He came in as a TA victim.

1177
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,746
His GCS score was five, which indicated
a high probability of brain death.

1178
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,957
His family has consented
to organ donation,

1179
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,084
so they've already done an EEG.

1180
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,544
The committee will meet soon
to confirm the diagnosis.

1181
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,006
Initially, I was just notified
that it was a traffic accident victim.

1182
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,718
They wanted us to let you know
as soon as possible

1183
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,762
because he's your patient.

1184
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,015
The organ is going to another patient
at our hospital,

1185
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,267
so we'll have to take care
of the procurement as well.

1186
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:25,272
Gosh, I feel bad.

1187
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,363
His tricuspid valve is very small,
so it's hard to see.

1188
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,658
No, not that way.
Pull it toward the patient's head.

1189
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,451
Yes.

1190
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,539
Pull harder,
or we'll have to make a bigger incision.

1191
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,124
Okay, I'm sorry.

1192
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,586
You see that monitor, right?

1193
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,589
The line is flat now,
which means the heart rate is zero.

1194
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,174
That means he's dead.

1195
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,342
No.

1196
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,595
It just means that Chan-hyeong's
current heart rate is zero.

1197
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,640
His heart isn't beating at the moment.

1198
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,101
They can't operate on him
while the heart is beating.

1199
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,520
That's why the cardioplegia solution
is administered

1200
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,814
every 30 minutes to induce cardiac stasis
when performing

1201
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,149
any cardiac surgery procedures.

1202
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,568
And during cardiac stasis,
that machine over there

1203
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:13,112
acts as the patient's heart and lungs.

1204
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,239
It supplies blood throughout the body

1205
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,742
while doctors are operating on the heart.

1206
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,910
All right. Let's go over it again.

1207
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:23,289
Stop Chan-hyeong's heart,
which is replaced by the machine.

1208
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,167
While the machine's working,
the doctors quickly fix the heart.

1209
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,293
When everything's fixed,

1210
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,212
they get rid of the tubes
that hook him up to the machine.

1211
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,798
You're telling me all this
so that you can remember the steps.

1212
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,633
You're doing it to memorize the steps.

1213
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,676
That's right.

1214
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,429
-You understand the procedure, right?
-Yes, totally.

1215
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:50,858
Gwang-hyeon.

1216
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:53,527
The brain-dead TA patient, Yuk Hui-gwan.
Where is he?

1217
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,197
Oh, they've finished
doing all the tests on him in the ICU.

1218
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,449
The committee will meet soon
to finalize the diagnosis.

1219
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,118
He's a TA victim, but I heard
the organs are in good condition.

1220
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,789
They're probably negotiating
the time frame with the other hospital.

1221
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:07,541
Why? Do you know that patient?

1222
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,001
He was my patient.

1223
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:12,129
He was totally fine
when he was discharged yesterday.

1224
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,131
Really? My goodness.

1225
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,093
It must've been a very difficult decision.

1226
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,096
You should say a proper goodbye.

1227
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,806
All right.

1228
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,766
Have you seen his family?

1229
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,684
No, I don't know that much.

1230
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,977
Okay.

1231
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,896
Hello.

1232
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,564
Should I head home now?

1233
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,024
No, there's no need.

1234
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,485
The emergency medicine worked like magic.

1235
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,487
It's already looking much better.

1236
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,155
-He's asleep now.
-My goodness.

1237
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,533
If you come home now,
you'll just wake him up.

1238
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,159
It won't be good.

1239
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:46,705
I called to let you know that he's okay,
so don't worry.

1240
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,583
But I have to say, how could U-ju's mom

1241
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,461
not even know
about her son's peanut allergy?

1242
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,504
My goodness.

1243
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,131
Do you know which restaurant it was?

1244
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,674
I'll call them.

1245
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,552
I should find out exactly what he ate.

1246
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,053
Okay, hold on.

1247
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,351
Yes.

1248
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:14,233
-Okay, thank you.
-Mom.

1249
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,403
How come Daddy isn't here yet?

1250
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:23,325
Where's Daddy? Where did he go?

1251
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,912
Mom!

1252
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,041
Mister!

1253
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,128
Can you buy me jajangmyeon?

1254
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:36,672
Sure, I'll buy you jajangmyeon.

1255
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,324
ANESTHESIA DURATION

1256
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,785
We'll stop the ventilation.

1257
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,162
Stop the ventilation.

1258
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,081
Anesthesiologist.

1259
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,459
Position the patient head down
and hook up the Ambu bag.

1260
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,169
Is it all over now?

1261
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,588
They did everything they could in surgery.

1262
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,798
Now, the question is whether
his heart will beat or not

1263
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,259
even without the machine.

1264
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,594
If it does, then it's a success.

1265
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,512
His heart isn't beating though.

1266
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:26,805
Just wait.

1267
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,725
Now, the aorta.

1268
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,484
Hey, don't look at that.

1269
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,195
You should be looking
at the number on top in green.

1270
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:45,199
His heart rate is zero at the moment.
That number needs to go up.

1271
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:50,871
It's going up.

1272
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,361
-Good job, guys.
-Thank you.

1273
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,696
I'll finish up.

1274
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:24,947
Of course, you should.

1275
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,704
Can these guys get the surgical gowns?

1276
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,505
You hear his heartbeat, right?

1277
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,090
-Yes.
-Yes.

1278
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,092
You should know better
as med school students.

1279
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,177
You're probably hearing
your own heartbeat.

1280
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,848
-I see.
-I see.

1281
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,851
I'll let you touch it once.
Be very careful though.

1282
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,479
While touching it,
thank Chan-hyeong for staying alive.

1283
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:00,065
Okay.

1284
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,701
What's wrong?

1285
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,788
It's very strong.

1286
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,126
The heartbeat feels very strong,
Professor.

1287
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,266
YEAR 2003

1288
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:48,614
Doesn't the heartbeat feel so strong?

1289
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,076
It's quite amazing, isn't it?

1290
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,789
It's the size of a plum.

1291
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,460
I didn't know it'd feel this strong.

1292
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:04,088
This kid's heart stopped beating.

1293
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,424
You made it beat again, Professor.

1294
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,346
Professor.

1295
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,352
I'll choose Cardiothoracic Surgery.

1296
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:24,733
Professor,
I'll choose Cardiothoracic Surgery.

1297
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:26,026
Me too.

1298
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,446
I'll apply
to Cardiothoracic Surgery as well.

1299
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,535
Sure, good choice.

1300
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,702
Good work, guys.

1301
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,371
Well done, everyone.

1302
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,631
Make them sign a pledge
before they change their mind.

1303
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,971
Kim Chan-hyeong's guardian.

1304
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:56,348
Please come to the operating unit.

1305
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,981
-Are you Kim Chan-hyeong's guardians?
-Yes.

1306
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,482
-Come in.
-Thank you.

1307
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,455
Doctor, did Chan-hyeong's surgery go well?

1308
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:30,340
Chan-hyeong's surgery went well.

1309
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:33,343
We patched up the ventricular hole.

1310
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,596
As for the pulmonary trunk,
it took longer than expected

1311
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,097
because we wanted to save the valve.

1312
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:41,059
But that went well too.
so it's closed nicely now.

1313
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,855
His surgery went well,
so please don't worry.

1314
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:47,524
We'll move him to the ICU
in about half an hour.

1315
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:48,567
I'll see you then.

1316
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,906
His surgery went well,
so please don't worry.

1317
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,201
-My gosh.
-Thank you, Doctor!

1318
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,256
Hello?

1319
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,549
Yes, hello.

1320
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,511
Well, my son had lunch
at your restaurant earlier today

1321
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,596
and had an allergic reaction.

1322
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,515
He's allergic to peanuts.
He probably ate some.

1323
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,725
Gosh, I'm sorry. Is he okay?

1324
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,143
Yes, he's okay now.

1325
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,187
But I'd like to find out
exactly what he ate.

1326
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,146
He's five years old.

1327
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,940
I think he ate there with his mom.

1328
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,066
I remember him.

1329
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,151
I took their order.

1330
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,569
Just a moment, please.

1331
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:37,991
Oh, right. Sir, the salad you took to go
to have for dinner.

1332
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,827
It probably had peanut dressing.

1333
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,621
Did I get...

1334
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:46,333
Right, I did.

1335
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,002
Yes, you did, sir.

1336
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:53,423
I remember you because you and your wife
looked so lovely together.

1337
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,217
Your kid was so cute too.

1338
01:15:56,593 --> 01:16:01,306
I'm pretty sure I asked you to let me know
if you have any food allergies.

1339
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,518
I apologize. I guess
I didn't communicate that properly.

1340
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,575
-Hello?
-Professor.

1341
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,660
This is Ham Deok-ju,
a transplant coordinator.

1342
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,288
The chairman is coming from the airport
due to a conference,

1343
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,291
so the committee meeting
will be held after 10 p.m.

1344
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,208
Okay.

1345
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:31,587
We want to arrange a time for you
to see him as soon as the meeting is over.

1346
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,339
We've already let the other hospital know.

1347
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,466
I'll call you when we're ready.

1348
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,551
Okay.

1349
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,265
What's with him?

1350
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,103
It's taking longer than we expected,

1351
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:50,022
but it'll be over soon.

1352
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,567
You should wait in the waiting area.

1353
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,277
Let's go.

1354
01:16:56,111 --> 01:17:00,407
FAMILY WAITING ROOM

1355
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,159
Thank you.

1356
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,664
So what's happening next?

1357
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,166
If you'd like,

1358
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:12,836
we'll arrange a time for you to see him
before the surgery begins.

1359
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,422
Once he's in the OR,

1360
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:18,425
the doctors will check
the condition of his organs

1361
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:20,469
and conduct biopsies.

1362
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,596
If everything looks good,

1363
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:25,682
they'll start preparing him right away
for organ donation.

1364
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,436
This process is usually carried out
by fellows,

1365
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:33,523
but Professor Lee Ik-jun
will oversee the entire process.

1366
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:37,611
He's even concerned about
the surgical wound.

1367
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,323
Hello?

1368
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,450
Okay.

1369
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,954
The committee meeting just ended.

1370
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,249
I'll get ready, then.

1371
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,387
Where are you?
You said you'd be here right away.

1372
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,471
I'm almost there.

1373
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,764
Okay.

1374
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,141
Is he having a bad day or something?

1375
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,353
Are you from
Kangwoon University Medical Center?

1376
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:12,396
Yes.

1377
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,606
I had to speak with his family,
so we're running behind.

1378
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,149
I'm sorry. Do we have enough time?

1379
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,485
The donor's vitals are good.

1380
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,570
Yes, we're early.

1381
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:22,531
It's not that urgent, so it's fine.

1382
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,039
We'll get started.

1383
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,749
-Okay.
-All right.

1384
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,179
Is the patient stable?

1385
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:47,848
Yes, everything looks good.

1386
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:03,697
Professor Lee, everything's ready.

1387
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,705
-Kangwoon University Medical Center?
-Yes, Professor.

1388
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,960
Well, can I ask you a favor?

1389
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:18,712
Sure.

1390
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:22,048
Could we postpone the heart removal
by just ten minutes?

1391
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,846
Call the hospital
and find out if it's okay.

1392
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,223
If it's urgent,
we can get started right away.

1393
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,602
Ten minutes should be okay.

1394
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:34,811
We got here early.

1395
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:38,315
Okay. It's 11:50 p.m. now,

1396
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:41,109
-so we'll start in ten minutes.
-Okay.

1397
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,320
We'll begin at midnight
with a silent prayer.

1398
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,155
-Got it.
-Wait.

1399
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:48,408
Can't we just do it now?

1400
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,952
We've pulled two all-nighters in a row.

1401
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,997
Today is Children's Day, you know.

1402
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,457
Pardon?

1403
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:00,462
It's because today is Children's Day.

1404
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:09,930
He has a five-year-old son named Won-jun.

1405
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:13,308
Today's Children's Day,
so he was supposed to have...

1406
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,480
jajangmyeon with his dad.

1407
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:22,609
But Won-jun...

1408
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,904
He'll never get to do that,
for the rest of his life.

1409
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:53,807
Let's wait.

1410
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,101
Just ten minutes.

1411
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,812
We'll begin in ten minutes, okay?

1412
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,231
We can't have his son cry

1413
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:04,734
on every Children's Day
thinking about his late father.

1414
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,445
Okay, no problem.

1415
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:08,864
Sure, Professor.

1416
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,824
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1417
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:38,894
Your late husband decided
to donate his organs to help others.

1418
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,729
Thankfully,
his organs are in good condition,

1419
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:44,983
so he'll be donating
his heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver.

1420
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:50,780
The surgery began just now,
at 12:05 a.m. on May 6,

1421
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:56,161
which means he has expired.

1422
01:21:57,787 --> 01:21:58,955
Thank you.

1423
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,406
I have to work the night shift anyway,
so I came to work.

1424
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,367
Yes, Mom.

1425
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,535
You're feeling okay? Any health issues?

1426
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,454
What about Dad?

1427
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,124
All right.

1428
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,794
I'll buy her food, coffee, and everything.
Don't worry.

1429
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,464
But it's not like she's here to see me.
That girl...

1430
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,051
Okay, bye.

1431
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:00,100
It's raining a lot.

1432
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,645
We can't go camping in this weather.

1433
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,147
I won't force you guys.

1434
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,733
You don't have to come.
Do whatever you want.

1435
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,197
You'll go camping in this weather?

1436
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,868
I love going camping on a rainy day.

1437
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,662
Anyway, I'm totally fine with going alone,

1438
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:21,830
so do whatever you want.

1439
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:26,418
NEUROSURGERY TEAM CHAT ROOM

1440
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,712
But you'll be bored if you go alone.

1441
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:36,553
I'll go somewhere really far

1442
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:40,890
I'll travel until the sun goes down

1443
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,728
I'll start afresh

1444
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:48,356
For myself

1445
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,083
Professor, you beat me.

1446
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,127
Is Dr. Do in an emergency surgery?

1447
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,129
Yes. It looked like
a tension pneumothorax,

1448
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,464
so I called you right away.

1449
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:13,673
Good. I was in the area.

1450
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,884
But why was a soldier
transferred to a regular hospital?

1451
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,428
The one had an accident
across the street and has a broken rib.

1452
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:19,763
No other external injuries.

1453
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,848
-Where's the patient?
-Here

1454
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,427
LEE IK-SUN

1455
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:08,686
YEONINSAN CAMPGROUND

1456
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:20,406
I said it's fine. You don't have to come.

1457
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:23,827
Where are you?

1458
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,580
Here? B-104.

1459
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,291
Where's 104?

1460
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,417
I'm here!

1461
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,044
Over here.

1462
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,722
What's up? What are you doing here?

1463
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,059
What do you mean? I promised to join you.

1464
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,811
I never said I couldn't come.

1465
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:51,938
Anyway, sit down.

1466
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:53,898
-Have some coffee.
-Okay.

1467
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,576
You're wearing that again.

1468
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,660
What?

1469
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,663
The shoes I gave you.

1470
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:11,207
What?

1471
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:17,463
I got you those shoes, Professor.

1472
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,472
Their dating history, families,

1473
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,850
and what they're really like.
I can tell you everything.

1474
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:12,769
-Jun-wan is...
-Hey!

1475
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:14,938
Where did the money go? You prick.

1476
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:16,648
Seok-hyeong. Don't you know?

1477
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,107
He was going to see his mom.

1478
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,026
Mom, I got paid today.
What do I do with this?

1479
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,695
-Lee Ik-jun, that prick...
-I'm busy trying to make ends meet.

1480
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,405
I look after my son and my patients.

1481
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,865
Song-hwa was a perfect student.

1482
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,951
If I have to quit,
I'll work as a chauffeur.

1483
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:28,993
She's pure-hearted.

1484
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,412
Who are you curious about?

1485
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:33,915
Dr. Ahn Jeong-won.

1486
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,294
Hey, don't bring it up
in front of Seok-hyeong.

1487
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,754
He'll lose it again.

1488
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,005
Okay, I heard you.

1489
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,675
-He's very cranky.
-What? He's not like that.

1490
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:47,387
I'm worried.

1491
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:50,682
Anyone would be like that
after going through all of that at once.

1492
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:51,975
My baby...

1493
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,061
He's mentally unstable.

1494
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,479
Why didn't you do anything?

1495
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,993
