1
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,938
It's me, Jae-hak.

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,691
-Hey, go ahead.
-Bae Jun-seong's pulmonary edema is severe

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,193
and he can't urinate.
He's on a ventilator now.

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,863
Really? What's his urine output?

5
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,990
The last time we checked,
it was only 10cc.

6
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,993
-I'm coming.
-When do you think you'll get here?

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,995
Sorry to rush you, but we need you.

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,788
See you in a minute.

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,165
Okay.

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,374
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,751
Thank you.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,793
No problem.

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,812
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,399
Did this patient leave?

15
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,735
Ik-jun's sister? Do you know her?

16
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,946
Yes. Did she leave?

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,282
She left earlier.
The IV was done a while ago.

18
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,660
I guess your families are super close too.

19
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,224
My fever's gone,

20
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,602
and I feel much better,
so I'm heading home now.

21
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:46,064
I'll call you, Jun-wan.

22
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,442
But not for a while
because I'll be busy with my training.

23
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,697
I'll make sure I'll call you soon though.

24
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,076
I wanted to text you
as you're probably busy now.

25
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,747
APRIL 18, SUNDAY

26
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,191
It's nice to take a quick break like this.

27
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,443
Look at us chilling
and enjoying this ice cream.

28
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,197
Get this. I'm even going out
for dinner with my wife later.

29
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,450
We're busy with surgeries
but don't have any primary care patients.

30
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,995
And the number of
emergency calls has dropped.

31
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,373
With a schedule like this,
I actually have time to do things.

32
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,625
I can take half of the weekend off.

33
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,503
You guys are saying that
because you have no idea.

34
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,630
Just wait and see. It'll only get worse.

35
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,801
Come to think of it, they're amazing.

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,929
They must be busy with work,
but they still have band practice.

37
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,180
They still do it, right?

38
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,808
Yes. They're practicing again
after work today.

39
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,685
None of them is on duty for once,

40
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,770
so they'll have dinner together
and practice.

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,522
How do you know so much?

42
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,275
Of course, I should know this much.
You didn't know?

43
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,485
Come on. Why should I know those things?

44
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,571
They're taking Professor Chae's car.

45
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,240
They'll be rushed,
so they'll pick up dinner on the way.

46
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,579
But why did they name their band
Gongnyong Ridge?

47
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,997
I'm curious too.

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,458
They started as a hiking club.

49
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,461
Jeong-won loves hiking
and likes the Dinosaur Ridge.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,463
He wanted to take them there,

51
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,465
hence the name.
"Gongnyong" as in "Dinosaur."

52
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,508
I heard that trail is very tough.

53
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,844
Yes. That's why
they still haven't gone there.

54
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,932
They always just go to the entrance
and come back after taking pictures.

55
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,559
Professor Chae is going
to Mount Seorak next month.

56
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,436
Yes. Not past the entrance though.

57
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,313
It's a hiking club.

58
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,898
They're not a band.

59
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,858
They just eat bibimbap together.

60
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,783
I said I'm not going to go there.
Don't even think about it.

61
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,118
My eyes get dry so easily.
I can't go hiking!

62
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,079
Mountains should be admired, not climbed.

63
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,872
I'm not going. Never!

64
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,625
But we named our band "Gongnyong Ridge."

65
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,210
Shouldn't we go at least once?

66
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,461
-No.
-No.

67
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,880
Let's just go up
to the Biseondae Peak, then.

68
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,465
Even kids go there.

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,633
We're not dumb.

70
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,427
Don't you dare suggest trails
that only pros take.

71
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,720
Just give up already.

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,640
Seriously, I swear.
That trail is super easy.

73
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,684
My sister went there in her cancan skirt.

74
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,851
Look it up!

75
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,646
He doesn't know
how to look things up on the Internet.

76
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,731
Don't offend Jun-wan.

77
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,651
"Biseondae Peak"?

78
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,320
Even the name sounds scary.

79
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,614
Oh, there she is.

80
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,332
I'm hungry! Get in, quick.

81
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,129
What? What is it?

82
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,715
-What are you doing? Hey!
-Let's just go!

83
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,383
-Hey!
-Come on. Let's go.

84
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,343
-No! Hold on.
-Just get in.

85
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,178
I don't want to sit in the middle.

86
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,722
Hey, you go ahead.

87
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,640
-You get in first--
-Hey, seriously!

88
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,939
Do we have enough time?
It'll be almost 9 p.m. after dinner.

89
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,941
Then we won't be done until 11 p.m.

90
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,485
We'll pick up dinner
at the drive-through on the way.

91
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,737
What are we getting?

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,821
Burgers.

93
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,871
We'll be there in seven minutes.

94
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,248
Tell me what you guys want.

95
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,208
-Ik-jun.
-What was the name of the burger?

96
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,960
-The new one.
-I know what I want!

97
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,504
-I want…
-I want the 1955 Burger.

98
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,006
Me too! The 1955 Burger.

99
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,883
-Don't copy me.
-I'm getting the combo.

100
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,176
-I want a VS too.
-Me too.

101
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,552
And a bulgogi burger combo.

102
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,636
-What's "VS"?
-Vanilla shake.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,764
-I want an SS!
-How clever.

104
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,433
And one Spicy Shanghai Burger combo
with large fries.

105
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,018
-I want large fries too.
-Me too!

106
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,520
-What about chicken nuggets?
-Of course! Order 30.

107
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,190
Order me an extra burger
on top of my double bulgogi.

108
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,567
-What about you?
-No! I want an egg bulgogi burger.

109
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,069
What are you getting, Song-hwa?

110
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:01,986
-Song-hwa--
-Hey!

111
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,909
I don't want to
hear you guys say another word.

112
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,496
I see the sign now.
I'll give you a minute.

113
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,500
Figure out what you want. Then take turns
and tell me exactly what you want.

114
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,503
No changes are allowed.
Don't babble away, okay?

115
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,755
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

116
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,596
Hello, what would you like to order?

117
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,642
Hello, it'll be a big order.
I'm sorry. I'll speak slowly.

118
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,435
Don't worry. It's okay.

119
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,979
We'd like three 1955 Burger combos,

120
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,483
one Spicy Shanghai Burger combo,
and one egg bulgogi combo.

121
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,652
All with large French fries.

122
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,571
Can we get Sprite instead of Coke
for just one of the combos?

123
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,948
Sure. Anything else?

124
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,867
We'd also like two vanilla shakes
and one strawberry shake.

125
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,871
And two chicken mozzarella burgers.
Just the burger, not the combo.

126
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,667
We'd also like
five of the six-piece nuggets. That's it.

127
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,211
Let me make sure I got everything.
Three large combos…

128
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,588
That took me back to our resident days,

129
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,632
when she used to
notify the others. My gosh.

130
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,967
Do you know what's crazier?

131
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,095
Jeong-won's been holding the credit card
like that for five minutes.

132
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,597
That's a huge improvement.

133
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,892
He used to pull out the card
in the parking lot at Yulje.

134
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,270
Be quiet.

135
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,688
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

136
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,819
All right.

137
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,322
Did we order seven burgers?

138
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,659
Yes. The piggies ordered two burgers each.

139
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,208
You know it's my birthday
next month, right? It's very soon.

140
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,295
Of course, we remember.
It's pretty close to Song-hwa's birthday.

141
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,005
-Is it a weekday?
-Yes.

142
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,508
Can we get together on the weekend prior?
I'm busy on weekdays.

143
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,177
Sure, no problem. I prefer that too.

144
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,013
But what about it?
Do you also have a song you want to sing?

145
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,347
Yes, I do.

146
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,477
I'll choose the song
because it's my birthday.

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,353
Practice hard, okay?

148
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,439
-Which song is it?
-What's the title?

149
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,943
It's my life

150
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,196
-Hey!
-We can't play that.

151
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,280
No way.

152
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,658
Andrea. You're on board, right?
I know you'll do it.

153
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,411
Well, I think…

154
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,374
I don't think it's a terrible idea.

155
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,376
-Yes!
-Hey!

156
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,177
Hey, let's use your phone.

157
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,054
-For what?
-The reservation.

158
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
Right, sure.

159
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,019
Jeong-won, I washed them twice
and put them in a strainer.

160
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,313
Good job. Take a seat.

161
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,356
Okay.

162
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,818
-Have we booked a place to stay?
-We're doing it now.

163
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:52,573
Jun-wan, you can book accommodation
right away using your phone like this.

164
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,825
No need to physically go
to a travel agency.

165
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,161
Really?

166
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,790
Just like booking those bus tickets?

167
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,219
Well, I guess?

168
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,348
Hurry up. It's only a few days away.

169
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,350
-Should I do it?
-No, I got it.

170
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,103
-Are we having a barbecue?
-Of course!

171
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,729
Let's book a guesthouse or a B&B.

172
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,190
Yes. We need at least
two rooms and two bathrooms.

173
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,360
Sure thing.
I'll find the most perfect place.

174
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,112
HOTEL, SOKCHO

175
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,031
This is nice.
By the entrance to Mount Seorak.

176
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,075
Nice. Let's book it. It's by the entrance.

177
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,912
But it says
it's 7km away from Mount Seorak.

178
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,997
Really?

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,251
It is in front of the entrance,
but it's 7km away from the mountain.

180
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,460
It's written right here.

181
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,754
I appreciate the honesty. Let's book it.

182
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,922
Check the reviews.

183
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,426
It's good.

184
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,428
FACILITIES ARE OLD BUT WELL-KEPT AND CLEAN

185
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,554
I'll book it, then.

186
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,059
By the way, what are they doing?

187
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,357
This one's nice.

188
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,820
Shopping for leather pants.

189
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,784
Check the cart.
I bet there's a ton of stuff there.

190
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,746
Jun-wan, I'm not talking
about an actual shopping cart.

191
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,456
I meant the virtual one.

192
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,666
You prick.

193
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,835
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

194
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,712
Yes. She's doing much better now.

195
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,050
I visited her last weekend.

196
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,471
Why don't you call her now
if you're that worried?

197
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,521
Hey, I'm busy now. I have to go.

198
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,606
All right.

199
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,028
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

200
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,157
My siblings have been calling me nonstop
since my mom's health scare.

201
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,785
They're worried
but can't look after her now,

202
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,454
so they keep calling
and bombarding me with questions.

203
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,457
Why did they enter the convent, then?

204
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,963
How is your mother doing?

205
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,091
She's doing much better now.

206
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,053
-She can go out alone now.
-I see. I'm glad to hear that.

207
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,139
Isn't your brother's wedding
just around the corner?

208
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,849
Yes, it's next month.

209
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,727
Ask him if he needs anything.

210
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,396
Maybe some home appliances.

211
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,524
I want to get him a nice gift.

212
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,359
I'm sure they already have everything.

213
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,486
There must be a thing or two
they still need.

214
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,947
I have surgery.
You're meeting up with Dr. Chu?

215
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,156
Yes.

216
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,576
Nice, that's great.
Make sure you ask Ga-eul, okay?

217
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,661
Okay.

218
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,621
See you later.

219
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,261
So your friend
has agreed to be your donor?

220
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,595
-Yes.
-Yes.

221
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,561
I see, okay. Well…

222
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,649
Mr. Kang Chan-dong,
you have liver cirrhosis

223
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,944
on top of your cancer recurrence.
Your liver is barely functioning,

224
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,738
so a liver transplant
is the best solution now.

225
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,784
I'm very glad that your friend mustered up
the courage to do this for you.

226
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,953
It truly is great news, but…

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,376
In this case,
since the donor is not your family,

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,629
you'll have to go through
a lengthy screening process

229
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,591
to rule out any financial incentives
or other ulterior motives.

230
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,262
Hospitals used to handle it
at their own discretion,

231
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,932
but to prevent illegal activities
such as organ trafficking,

232
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,686
a governmental organization called KONOS
manages this process now.

233
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,355
We'll have to prepare
all the materials they need

234
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,524
to get your application approved.

235
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,902
I really am his friend, Doctor.

236
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,279
Of course, I believe you.

237
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,366
But you need to go through this process
and get it approved to be his donor.

238
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,453
How long will it take though?
He's on the verge of death.

239
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,917
Our coordinator will go through
the details with you.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,585
But I'm just wondering…

241
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,838
How do we prove

242
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,216
that we're close friends?

243
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,014
Where are you going?

244
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,934
-To see Hwang Du-na.
-At the physical therapy room?

245
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,145
Yes. Last time I saw her,
she still couldn't walk well

246
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,939
and was struggling to get words out.

247
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,816
But it's been a while,
so I want to check in on her

248
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,735
and also talk to Professor Jang.

249
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,201
Professor Chae! Hello.

250
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,119
Hello.

251
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,579
This must be hard for you.

252
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,914
No, it's okay.

253
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,168
Du-na is doing much better now.

254
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,004
She can sit down
and stand up on her own now.

255
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,506
Really?

256
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,635
She's relying on a walking cane,
but it's still a huge improvement.

257
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,805
She couldn't even stand up a month ago.

258
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,516
Has she been
practicing speaking in her room?

259
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,018
Yes. I keep talking to her
to help her practice.

260
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,480
That's great.
Then I'll go see how Du-na is doing.

261
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,523
Sure.

262
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,592
She's doing much better
compared to the last time I saw her.

263
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,803
She couldn't walk
or even stand up on her own.

264
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,764
Her right leg
is recovering fairly quickly,

265
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,143
but the fine motor skills
of her right hand aren't back yet.

266
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,937
And language skills
are the slowest to recover.

267
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,814
Right.

268
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,818
That said, we're going to focus
on speech therapy from now on.

269
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,736
Okay.

270
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,293
I'm going to count from one.

271
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,963
One, two.

272
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,181
Three.

273
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,229
Four.

274
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,129
Let's step out for some fresh air.

275
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,386
So you still have one more chance?

276
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,056
But I think you'll succeed this time.

277
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,933
Just go for it.

278
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,269
It's the last chance I have.

279
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,022
I really need to succeed this time.

280
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,902
And since this is my last chance,
I don't want to do it here

281
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,654
looking like this.

282
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,241
I want to look decent and presentable
when I confess my feelings.

283
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,200
I really do.

284
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,537
Hold on. What happened to you today?

285
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,832
I look like a mess, don't I?

286
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
Yes.

287
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,090
I had two night shifts in a row.

288
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,803
I had to wash my hair for the first time
in two days but had no shampoo.

289
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,933
So I used the soap I found
by the cleaning supply cabinet,

290
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,562
and my hair now has a life of its own.

291
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,480
The cleansing power was something else.

292
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,527
I really don't want
to run into Professor Yang today.

293
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,657
Starting this week,
it's Professor Yeom Se-hee's turn anyway,

294
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,325
so if I'm lucky,

295
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,954
I may not bump into him at all today.

296
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,330
Yes.

297
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,833
Hello.

298
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,126
Hello.

299
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,878
Hey, Jang Gyeo-ul!

300
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,715
-Hi, Chuchu.
-Hello.

301
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,633
-Have you eaten yet?
-Yes.

302
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,136
I had lunch with Professor Ahn.

303
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,096
Good. What about you, Dr. Chu?

304
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,724
I ate with my juniors.

305
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,518
Why didn't you have lunch with Chuchu?

306
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,229
I ate with you because
you wanted to have lunch with me.

307
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,400
We'll let you get back
to your conversation. See you.

308
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,277
Okay, see you.

309
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,452
Gyeo-ul, let's go
to the convenience store.

310
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,620
What do you need?

311
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,126
His friend wants to donate his liver?

312
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,920
That's unheard of.

313
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,005
It's rare but does happen
from time to time.

314
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,260
He has cirrhosis in addition
to his liver cancer recurrence.

315
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,470
He has no children.

316
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,100
His wife got the test done but can't do it

317
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,935
due to her cardiovascular condition.

318
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,938
He has one brother,

319
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,607
but he's a hepatitis B carrier,
so he can't do it either.

320
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,820
So knowing none of his family members
can be a living donor for him,

321
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,073
both he and I were very worried.

322
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,950
But he brought his friend

323
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,410
to his appointment today
and said he'd do it for him.

324
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,957
Do you think the donor is
perhaps being forced to do it?

325
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,625
No, not at all.

326
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,586
I had a talk with the donor.

327
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,505
He said that wasn't the case at all.

328
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,590
They grew up together
and are best friends.

329
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,344
They still need to go
through the screening process,

330
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,346
but I think

331
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,807
they really are best friends.

332
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,185
Won't the process be more complicated
since they're not family?

333
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,314
Yes, totally. It'll be very difficult.

334
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,485
Some donors die during the surgery.

335
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,740
In Korea, the surgery is
considered safe for donors,

336
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,785
but there have been cases abroad
where the donor died.

337
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,246
In some cases,
the remaining liver fails to function

338
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,249
even if the donor had
no prior health conditions,

339
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,043
so the donor also ends up
receiving a liver transplant.

340
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,797
That gives you an idea
of how difficult and risky the surgery is.

341
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,719
Would you still like to be a living donor?

342
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,140
Yes, I want to. If I don't, he'll die.

343
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,768
Is it very risky?

344
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,188
I'm just telling you
what the possible risks are.

345
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,151
Our professors always pay extra attention
to the donor surgery

346
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,403
to make sure it's safe.

347
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,073
And most living donors are able to go back

348
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,701
to their normal daily activities
after the surgery.

349
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:07,039
But I can't say you'll feel exactly
the same as you did before the surgery.

350
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,708
You may feel some discomfort.

351
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,380
Okay. I still want to do it.

352
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,682
Hey.

353
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,985
What?

354
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,655
You broke it off?

355
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,366
Your wedding is next month,

356
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,159
and you broke off the engagement?

357
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,619
It wasn't me.

358
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,454
She broke it off.

359
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,213
The thing is, I saw it coming.

360
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,841
When I told her about our family,

361
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,179
she said she didn't care

362
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,889
but seemed pretty shocked.

363
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,934
I think she told her parents
about it last week.

364
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,146
I mean, she had to.

365
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,817
With the wedding coming up so soon,
they obviously wanted to know

366
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,194
why her future father-in-law
wouldn't be attending.

367
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,321
They probably grilled her about it.

368
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,491
So she told them everything.

369
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:30,038
That her future father-in-law
hit her future mother-in-law

370
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:35,002
to the point that she ended up
with a broken nose, a rib fracture,

371
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,586
and a ruptured eardrum.

372
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,590
And that

373
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,427
he's in jail now.

374
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,764
Honestly, I get it.

375
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,891
Who'd be okay with that?

376
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,270
I'd disapprove of it too.

377
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,443
It's actually a relief.

378
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,030
I really saw this coming.

379
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,993
Things haven't been that great between us

380
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,412
since I told her about Dad.

381
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,000
The way she was looking at me…

382
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,338
I felt like she was wondering

383
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,591
if I was like Dad too.

384
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,641
I guess I'm just insecure.

385
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,062
I'm such a loser.

386
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,610
Maybe I shouldn't have told her.

387
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,865
I should have just kept it from her.

388
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,909
You had to tell her.

389
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,120
She was bound to find out anyway.

390
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,710
Ga-eul.

391
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,588
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,425
I feel bad that there's nothing I can do.

393
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,511
Why are you sorry?

394
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,555
I'm okay. Like I said, I saw it coming.

395
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,852
I feel much better now that I've told you.

396
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,944
Well, I'll figure out
how to handle the situation.

397
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,532
I'll just tell Mom
that we had a big fight.

398
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,078
I'll tell her I got sick of Min-jin

399
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,413
and called off the wedding.

400
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,875
Just keep that in mind.

401
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,796
Okay, I'm sorry.

402
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,631
Why do you keep saying sorry?

403
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,759
I know how busy you are at work,

404
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,179
and you barely have time to sleep
because you've been looking after Mom.

405
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,848
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,689
I'll try to take better care of Mom too.

407
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,655
When did you grow up so much?

408
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,408
I'll be promoted
to assistant manager soon. I'm an adult.

409
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,540
Ga-eul.

410
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,836
I can't think about anything else
but Mom now.

411
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,425
I knew about it.

412
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,597
When Mom called me once in a while,

413
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,225
I could tell right away from her voice.

414
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,688
But I ignored it.

415
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,737
"That can't be. I'm worried for nothing."

416
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,741
I turned a blind eye to it.

417
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,204
I avoided dealing with her situation.

418
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,172
I feel so bad for doing that to Mom.

419
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:16,932
It must have been like hell,
but I left her alone in that situation.

420
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,559
I feel so terrible.

421
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,939
I can't forgive myself for it.

422
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,866
Ga-eul.

423
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,245
I know that you're really hurt too,

424
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,373
but I'm only going to
think about Mom for now.

425
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,334
I'm sorry.

426
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,174
Hurry up, Jong-su.
The noodles will swell up.

427
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,134
Wait!

428
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,512
Let me put this on top.

429
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,640
All right.

430
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,726
There.

431
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,021
Here you go.

432
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,069
Let's see how good you are, Mr. Ju.

433
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,280
The color looks good.

434
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,457
Hey.

435
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,128
It's so delicious.

436
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,589
Isn't it great? I'm so surprised.

437
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,010
Jong-su. I mean, Mr. Ju.

438
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,886
It's so good.

439
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,514
My gosh. Who knew
you were such a good cook?

440
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,351
-You should try it too, Jong-su.
-Okay.

441
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,230
Did you make the sauce too?
You didn't buy it?

442
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,983
I followed Mr. Paik's recipe.

443
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,319
No wonder it's so good.

444
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,571
Still, it's not easy
to make it this tasty.

445
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,072
You have the talent, Mr. Ju.

446
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,034
What will you make next?

447
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,245
Next time, I'll make
rice topped with fried eggplant.

448
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,580
Really?

449
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,041
Rosa, can I come over again next week?

450
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,876
Of course. Come over every weekend.

451
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,669
Don't stay home alone and order in.

452
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,755
Come and eat with us every weekend.

453
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,632
Cook for us every weekend. Please?

454
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,676
You're such a good cook.

455
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,845
Sure, I'd love to. It'll make me happy.

456
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,643
I had a big fight
with my eldest son yesterday,

457
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,021
so I've been depressed all day.

458
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,232
But cooking the noodles
and making this sauce

459
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,236
helped me get it off my mind for a moment.

460
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,239
What happened? You were excited
that he was returning to Korea.

461
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,326
He's opening a clinic with his friends.

462
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,411
He said they'll co-own the clinic.

463
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,247
And he outright asked for money.

464
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,540
Not just to help out.

465
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,544
He demanded again that I give him
the money he'll inherit down the road.

466
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,338
I was speechless.

467
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,883
I said no right away

468
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,469
but couldn't sleep all night.

469
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,679
It made me angry

470
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,516
and sad.

471
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,478
Again? Gosh, that must have
really hurt your feelings.

472
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,774
I'd rather have him stay there
and never move back.

473
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:17,654
I'd feel more at ease
if he and his family stayed in the US.

474
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,243
But he's your son. It'd be better
to keep him close and see him often.

475
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:28,206
So your son is coming back,
while Seok-hyeong might be leaving soon.

476
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,666
What do you mean?

477
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,418
What should I do, Rosa?

478
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,254
Seok-hyeong might have to move to the US.

479
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,424
Jeong-won didn't say that.

480
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,051
I don't think he has told his friends yet.

481
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,637
He brought it up at our dinner last night.

482
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,808
There's a great training opportunity
in the US, so he applied for it.

483
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,894
-He said he'll most likely get it.
-My goodness.

484
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,397
But I can't live without Seok-hyeong.

485
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,357
We don't live together,

486
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:58,987
but we have a meal together every weekend.
It's my only joy in life.

487
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:03,116
What should I do? Is there
anything I can do to make him stay?

488
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,409
I'm not sure.

489
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,746
Once he sets his mind on something,
he does it.

490
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,087
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

491
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,051
Who are you going to
have lunch with today?

492
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,887
With my friends, probably. Why?

493
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,555
Oh, okay.

494
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,141
Join us. You know them too.

495
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,477
I have plans for lunch.

496
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,022
My wife is stopping by to see her friend,

497
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,440
so I'll have lunch with her.

498
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,858
Then why did you ask me?

499
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,530
I was going to ask you to join us
if you were going to eat alone.

500
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,824
Jeez, mind your own business.

501
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,371
-You're the only person. Do you know that?
-What do you mean?

502
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,917
You're the only person who didn't ask me
why we don't have children.

503
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,377
Why should I be curious?

504
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,670
Exactly.

505
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,923
I don't even have time
to deal with my problems.

506
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,050
To each their own. Why should I care?

507
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,052
My wife and I are the same age.

508
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,013
We got married
after dating for over three years.

509
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,431
I was still in school,

510
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,935
so we had to live off her single income
and also send money to our parents,

511
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,812
which was very tough.

512
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,358
So at the beginning,
we said we'd hold off on having kids.

513
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,321
Then about five years into the marriage,

514
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,326
we decided to have a baby
because we both love kids.

515
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,996
But once we made up our mind,
we struggled to conceive.

516
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,166
We tried so hard.

517
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,503
It was very stressful for my wife.

518
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,256
Then last year,

519
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,260
on her 40th birthday,
she announced that she decided…

520
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,805
that she won't have a baby.

521
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,184
She said she was exhausted
physically and mentally.

522
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,690
She told me she wanted to live
a fun life with me, just the two of us.

523
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,941
I agreed right away.

524
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,320
I always wanted a kid,

525
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,407
but I'd hate to see my wife

526
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,826
stressed out.

527
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,832
Professor, do you know
what I enjoy the most?

528
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,167
I'm supposed to be curious, right?

529
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:25,466
Having a beer at home with my wife
after work and chatting with her.

530
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,680
I'd complain about my co-workers
and talk about the surgeries I did.

531
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,181
We'd talk about her co-workers

532
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,642
while bad-mouthing our families together.

533
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,020
We talk about all sorts of stuff.

534
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,731
It'd be nice to have a kid,

535
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,110
but I also enjoy this life
with my wife who's like my best friend.

536
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,113
When I'm with her,

537
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,242
I feel so comfortable,
and we have so much fun together.

538
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,414
I'm sorry. I totally babbled away.

539
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,584
I envy you.

540
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,672
I envy you two.

541
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,312
We have the results from the first test.

542
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,649
Based on the results,
you are a good match.

543
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,195
Then can we proceed with the surgery?

544
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,531
No. There are many things
we need from you.

545
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,451
But first, I want to let you know

546
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,829
that my job is to suspect your motives.

547
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,540
I understand you two are close friends,

548
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:44,712
but I'm in the position
where I must suspect your motives.

549
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,048
I hope you understand.

550
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,800
Sure.

551
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,761
I'm going to ask you
for many different documents.

552
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,723
Once you see the list,
you'll probably think,

553
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,520
"Why must you ask for documents
that we can't get?"

554
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,608
But KONOS needs all those documents.

555
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,864
Here's a list of documents
we need from you within a week.

556
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,246
LIST OF REQUIRED DOCUMENTS

557
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,081
How many do you have?

558
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,165
Twelve.

559
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,836
My gosh. I have six.

560
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,506
And I heard you've been friends
since high school.

561
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,757
-Yes.
-Yes.

562
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,051
Then in addition
to your graduation certificates,

563
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,096
we'll also need proof that
you were actually close even back then.

564
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:41,185
We'll need a photo of you together
back in your high school days.

565
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,813
I'm not sure if we've kept…

566
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,691
our old photos.

567
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,820
And if you've been friends
for 30 years since high school,

568
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:54,741
I'm sure you attended each other's wedding
and other celebratory occasions.

569
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,117
Yes.

570
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,662
We need photos or videos
that can prove your attendance.

571
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,331
Some may suspect

572
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,168
that you reconnected recently
because of this

573
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:10,381
even if you can prove that you two
knew each other back in high school.

574
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,135
So we'll need it as evidence
to rule out such suspicion.

575
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:18,181
I see. But I didn't have anyone
film my wedding.

576
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,475
Then just submit photos from your wedding.

577
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,853
I got married just a few years ago,
so I have it recorded on video.

578
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,272
I can bring it.

579
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,233
Thank you. Please check
that you have the correct amount.

580
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,280
Don't tell me
you only took out 10,000 won.

581
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,283
No. I took out 100,000 won.

582
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,661
Why are you trying
to pick a fight with me again?

583
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,122
Why do you need cash?
10,000-won bills at that.

584
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,209
-We have a team dinner this evening.
-Right, we do.

585
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,462
We'll be out until late,
so it's for the residents' taxi rides.

586
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,757
Jeong-won.

587
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,095
-Isn't it exhausting being you?
-No, not at all.

588
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,223
Isn't your head about to explode
because of all your thoughts?

589
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
No.

590
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,605
I do think a lot, but my thoughts are
compartmentalized in an organized manner.

591
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,566
Why? What are you trying to say?

592
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,569
Nothing. I was going to
make fun of you but gave up

593
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,114
because you're so serious.

594
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,866
Thanks.

595
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,537
"Withholding tax"?

596
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,790
Yes. We need to know
your total income for the previous year.

597
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,502
If you've filed your income taxes,
we need documents that prove it.

598
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,131
If you're an employee,
you can submit your statement of earnings.

599
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,718
It'll help if I make more
than Chan-dong does, right?

600
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:42,890
Yes. It'll certainly reduce
the chance of misunderstandings.

601
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,144
Hey, how much do you make?

602
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,563
Gosh, my income…

603
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,818
I wanted to keep it from this chump
until the day I die.

604
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,404
Why? Do you not make that much?

605
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,240
Clearly, I make more than you do.

606
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,578
My income is higher, so don't worry.

607
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,791
Last year, my property taxes alone
came to ten million won.

608
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,503
I make about 200 million won a year.

609
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,215
Hey.

610
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,177
Pay for all my meals.

611
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,721
Whatever.

612
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,983
-What's wrong?
-My stomach's been upset since last night.

613
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,694
I think it's getting worse.

614
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,504
Let me take you to the ER.

615
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,883
Okay. I threw up everything.
My stomach hurts so much.

616
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,178
Gosh, it really hurts.

617
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,137
Let's go.

618
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,516
My gosh.

619
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,736
You'll feel better in no time
once it kicks in.

620
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,490
Okay. Thank goodness this happened
when I was at the hospital.

621
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,616
I was lucky, right?

622
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,619
"Lucky"? You're in the ER now
because you were in pain.

623
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:30,039
It's nothing serious. I'd call this lucky.

624
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,085
Hey. This must have been
stressful for you.

625
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,796
Sorry. You're so busy
but even have to look after me now.

626
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,172
Thank you.

627
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,385
No problem. We've been getting
a few acute enteritis patients lately.

628
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,888
It was probably caused by something
you ate, so watch what you eat.

629
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,557
And…

630
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,603
we have your urinalysis results.

631
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,401
What is it?

632
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,862
Is it something bad?

633
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,239
No, it's not that.

634
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,368
It came back positive for HCG.

635
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,331
What does that mean, honey?

636
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,378
You mean, she's pregnant?

637
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,299
Yes. You tested positive for pregnancy.

638
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,848
You both had no idea, right?

639
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,103
Yes. We didn't think

640
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,564
we'd conceive a baby.

641
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,693
Book an appointment
while she's getting the IV

642
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,944
so she can see an OB-GYN.

643
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,158
Is Seok-hyeong available today?
You should see him.

644
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,077
No, it's okay. I can call him.

645
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,997
-Thank you, Professor.
-All right. Get some rest.

646
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,767
I don't want to drive.
Let's take your car.

647
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,227
Sure. Let's take mine
and Seok-hyeong's car.

648
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,104
Hey, why are you here?

649
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,940
This is my office.

650
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,985
I know that, but you said
the surgery would take long.

651
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,905
We managed to get the bleeding
under control pretty quickly.

652
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,365
What was that about the cars?

653
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,534
I asked him whose cars we were taking
to Mount Seorak this weekend.

654
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,244
We'll take mine and Seok-hyeong's.

655
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,206
What time should we leave?
We'll discuss it in the group chat.

656
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,541
There's no need.

657
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,546
We're going on a package tour,

658
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,298
so don't worry about any of that.

659
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,926
MOUNT SEORAK ITINERARY

660
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:47,968
What's that?

661
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,181
"Gongnyong Ridge's Mount Seorak Itinerary"
made by Jeong-won.

662
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,725
From whose cars we're taking

663
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,270
to which rest areas we'll stop at,
when we'd need to fill gas,

664
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,273
and which restaurants we'll eat at,
everything's here.

665
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,151
I'm getting a little scared.

666
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,570
At least he didn't make
a list of public restrooms.

667
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,531
Gapyeong and Naerincheon.

668
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,450
We'll stop at those two rest areas,

669
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,285
and underneath it,

670
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,539
it says, "Use the restroom here,"
with an asterisk.

671
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,042
Should we tell Gyeo-ul to run away?

672
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,880
I'm not young,

673
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,466
and I wasn't expecting
to get pregnant at all.

674
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,593
This was totally unexpected,

675
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,431
so my husband and I will need to discuss

676
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,600
whether or not we want to keep the baby.

677
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,857
First, let's talk about
your ultrasound results.

678
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,024
Okay.

679
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,444
You got a positive result
in your urinalysis.

680
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,864
But sometimes, it can be a false-positive,

681
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,408
so we did the ultrasound to make sure.

682
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,954
You are pregnant.

683
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,252
Everything looks good with the baby.
It's all settled in the womb.

684
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,754
Judging from the size of the baby,

685
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,757
I think you're
a little over ten weeks pregnant.

686
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,095
You had no idea?

687
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,141
My periods are very irregular,
so I didn't know.

688
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,393
When I missed my period,

689
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,314
I just thought it was premature menopause.

690
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,942
I never even thought I could be pregnant.

691
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,279
Your uterine walls
are on the thicker side,

692
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,907
but we'll see how it goes.

693
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,993
They recorded this video for you.

694
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,081
That's how your baby is moving
inside your womb now.

695
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,426
Babies move quite a bit even at week ten.

696
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:57,056
This is the baby's head,
and this is the torso.

697
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,184
You see the arms here
and the legs over here.

698
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,813
We checked the fetal heart rate too,
and it's within the normal range.

699
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,316
Just right for week ten.

700
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,737
The fetus is still quite small,
measuring about 3cm in length.

701
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,824
But you can see its tiny hands and feet,

702
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,912
and its heart and other major organs
are formed in this stage.

703
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,041
It must be difficult for you,

704
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,587
but I have to say your baby looks

705
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,924
very healthy and active.

706
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,847
Professor Yang,
my wife and I will have to discuss--

707
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,559
When should I start taking folic acid?

708
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,729
Do you think I can have a vaginal birth?

709
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,898
A C-section would be fine too.

710
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,276
Then when is our baby due?

711
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,737
December 2.

712
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,949
As for deciding between
a vaginal birth and a C-section,

713
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,577
we'll have to wait
to check the baby's position,

714
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,869
so we'll decide later.

715
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:06,292
Start taking folic acid right away.
At least 400 micrograms a day.

716
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,793
I'll prescribe you some today.

717
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,424
You're not young, and your uterine walls
are on the thicker side,

718
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,261
so don't miss your appointments
and take good care of yourself.

719
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,555
I will, Professor.

720
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,640
Do you have any other questions?

721
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,184
Actually,

722
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,355
I feel a lump in my breast.
It's been a few months.

723
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,026
Do you think
that's caused by the pregnancy?

724
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,278
Does it hurt?

725
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,989
Only one side?
Or do you feel them on both sides?

726
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,282
Just the right side.

727
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,496
It can happen mid-pregnancy

728
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,958
because the cells in the mammary gland
start proliferating rapidly.

729
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,962
But you're still in the early stage,
so I don't think it's that.

730
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:57,801
Why don't you see
a breast surgeon just in case?

731
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,306
Dr. Do, she should see a breast surgeon
today since she's already here.

732
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,891
I think that'd be the best.

733
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,100
Okay, I'll make sure.

734
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:26,205
DOVE

735
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:40,052
I'm going to Seoul to attend
my friend's wedding this Sunday.

736
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,680
I'm taking Monday off.

737
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,015
Are you free for dinner on Monday?

738
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,355
I have one surgery,
but I'll be done before 6 p.m.

739
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,482
It should be fine.
How does 6:30 p.m. sound?

740
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,948
Sure, sounds good.
I'll meet you in front of the hospital.

741
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,994
Actually, Ik-jun told me there is
a good steakhouse across the street.

742
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,539
Shall we just meet there?

743
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,333
Feel free to suggest a place.
Anywhere is fine by me.

744
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,669
It's "The Steakhouse
in Front of the Hospital."

745
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,505
It's literally across the street.
You won't miss it.

746
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:19,967
Then I'll see you there
on Monday at 6:30 p.m.

747
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,389
Sure, sounds good. See you next week.

748
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,699
Dr. Jang.

749
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,243
-You're coming with us, right?
-What?

750
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,164
The team dinner. We're leaving now.

751
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,667
You guys go ahead.
I'll leave right after I make this call.

752
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,836
We'll wait for you.

753
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,713
It's okay. Go ahead and have dinner.

754
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,474
Mom. You called me, right?

755
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,518
Is Ga-eul there yet? Did you have dinner?

756
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,270
Yes, I did.

757
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,815
Ga-eul picked up some galbitang,
so we had that together.

758
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,108
Great.

759
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,443
Gyeo-ul.

760
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,364
I'm just going to go back
to Gwangju next week.

761
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,951
I'm okay now. I'm fully recovered.

762
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,705
Sweetheart, I know
how hard you had to study

763
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,958
to become a doctor and make it this far.

764
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,377
You can't focus on work
these days because of me.

765
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,214
I'm sorry.

766
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,716
I'm fine,

767
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,803
so just focus on your work now.

768
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,224
I'm afraid you'd get on the wrong side
of your higher-ups.

769
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,271
I am staying focused,
and I'm doing a good job at work.

770
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,483
I'm no longer a resident,
so I have more time now.

771
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,903
And I've gotten the hang of it,
so I'm more relaxed these days.

772
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,739
So please don't worry about me.

773
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,118
Think only about yourself, Mom.
You haven't fully recovered yet.

774
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,870
I'm fine now.

775
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,582
I can eat on my own,
and I sleep just fine now.

776
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,167
I can do everything on my own.

777
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,171
Why should I bother my busy daughter
when I can do everything myself?

778
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,423
I don't want to be a burden.

779
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:29,096
Gyeo-ul, your so-called family…

780
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,810
is just bogging you down.

781
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,314
Don't worry about me, sweetheart.

782
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:44,111
I'll be fine on my own,
so just live your life.

783
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,240
That will make me happy enough.

784
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,537
Okay, Mom.

785
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,124
So you're adamant about
going back to Gwangju.

786
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,380
Then I'll hand in my resignation tomorrow
and go with you.

787
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,966
Gyeo-ul, please.

788
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,343
If you go back to Gwangju,

789
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,680
I'll quit my job and move to Gwangju too.

790
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,395
If you want your dear daughter

791
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,398
to keep working at the hospital,

792
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:28,614
don't ever say again
that you'll go back to Gwangju alone.

793
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,162
I can't be happy if you're not happy, Mom.

794
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,084
So please…

795
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,713
If you truly care about me,

796
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,051
stay with me.

797
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,222
Stay with me and Ga-eul.

798
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,184
Just live with us, Mom.

799
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,479
Okay?

800
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,815
Okay, Mom?

801
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,286
I haven't eaten yet.
I'm going to head out now to have dinner.

802
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,624
I won't be home late.
I'll head home right after dinner.

803
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,168
All right, Mom.

804
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,808
Where were you?
I called you a bunch of times.

805
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,019
Let's go. Everyone else has left already.

806
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,041
Has the other car left yet?

807
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,669
Yes. He picked up Jeong-won
at Yulje just now.

808
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,712
Yulje? Why?

809
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,630
He had to pick up a package.

810
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,468
What about U-ju? Is Auntie
staying with him the whole weekend?

811
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,719
Why didn't you bring him?

812
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,345
Someone else took him.

813
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,055
-Who?
-Mo-ne's dad.

814
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,224
Mo-ne's dad? Are they going camping again?

815
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,184
Yes.

816
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:07,522
He goes camping so often
that I was curious where he worked,

817
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,316
but my curiosity has been answered.

818
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,567
What does he do?

819
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,152
He's a TV producer.

820
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,989
Hello.

821
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,700
Thank you, every single time.
I owe you another one.

822
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,744
Hello. Hi, U-ju.

823
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,412
-Hello.
-Hi.

824
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,080
It's no problem at all.

825
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,083
Mo-ne and Ma-ne love playing with U-ju,

826
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,210
so this helps me.

827
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,630
Well, if you don't mind me asking,

828
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:35,425
where do you work? I'm just curious.

829
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,635
-Me?
-Yes.

830
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,720
What do you do? You go camping every week.

831
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,974
Right, U-ju also told me
that you're an amazing game host.

832
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,560
I'm a producer.

833
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,855
A TV producer.

834
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,068
Hold on. I thought you looked
familiar the last time.

835
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,821
Are you Na Young-seok? You are, right?

836
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,990
I'm Jang Young-seok.

837
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,910
Right, your surname is Jang.
Sorry about that.

838
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,537
Jang Mo-ne, Jang Ma-ne. Right.

839
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,205
It's all right.

840
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,499
But you look so much like him.

841
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,001
You look just like Na Young-seok.

842
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,920
I'm offended.

843
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,048
I'm sorry.

844
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,008
It's okay.

845
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,344
Come on, U-ju. Let's go.

846
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,221
Today, I brought a squeaky toy hammer.

847
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,514
I'm really sorry.

848
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,351
No need to apologize.
You already offended me anyway.

849
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,688
You just look so much like…
I'm so sorry. That was rude of me.

850
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,692
Will we make it to Sokcho today
without any issues?

851
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:35,944
I'd say it's 50-50.

852
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,362
Do you want me to drive?

853
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,655
No, it's not that.

854
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,535
Chances are, at least one of us
will get a call from work on the way.

855
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,165
-Hello?
-Professor, patient Hyun Byeong-mo

856
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,793
received catheter drainage
due to ICH four days ago.

857
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,378
His mental status is stupor now,

858
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,714
and his right pupil has dilated to 0.5.

859
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,299
What about vitals and breathing?

860
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,259
The patient keeps vomiting bile.

861
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,387
It's an ER patient that came in
due to severe abdominal pain.

862
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,557
I think it's volvulus. We need you here.

863
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,226
I'll head back right away.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

864
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,270
Book an OR first.

865
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,272
Okay.

866
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:28,413
It's a TA patient with a liver laceration.
An angio was done to stop the bleeding,

867
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,082
but they're transferring
the patient to us now

868
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,751
as the transplant was done here.

869
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,794
Okay, I'm coming now.

870
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:10,163
CHEOL-U'S GUESTHOUSE

871
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,790
Let's go eat something first.

872
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,500
We should check in first.

873
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,135
Make yourself at home.
Call us if you need anything.

874
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,762
-Okay, thank you.
-No problem.

875
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,055
This is for you.

876
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,724
They're from our garden.
Help yourself if you need more.

877
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,477
-This looks great. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

878
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,397
By the way,
I guess Cheol-u isn't here now?

879
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,860
Did he go out with his friends?
This place is called Cheol-u's Guesthouse.

880
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,238
I'm Cheol-u.

881
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:47,617
My gosh, I'm sorry.
I assumed you named it after your kid.

882
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,328
It's okay. Many people think that.

883
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,331
Our family has been running
a guesthouse for two generations.

884
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,833
I see.

885
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,379
You guys are our last guests of the year.

886
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,256
We're closing soon for renovations.

887
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,758
But it's nice and clean here.

888
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,512
Apparently, this isn't
the type of decor the young people like.

889
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,181
Our daughter has been
pestering us about it.

890
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,309
She sent us a big chunk of money,
so it'll start next month.

891
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,312
She works at a big hospital in Seoul--

892
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,940
Honey, please. You're too chatty today.

893
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,483
-What?
-Let's go. Sorry! Rest up.

894
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,609
-Go.
-Goodness.

895
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,819
Have a good day.

896
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,446
-You too!
-Keep the door closed.

897
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,530
Okay.

898
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,660
Where's the meat?

899
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,204
I'm hungry. Let's have some ramyeon first.

900
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,497
Just have the meat.

901
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,416
It'll take forever to set it all up.

902
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,960
Let's have ramyeon now. The meat can wait.

903
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,049
Why are you staring
at their family portrait?

904
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,594
-Are you jealous?
-No, it's not that.

905
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,055
She just looks so familiar.

906
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,349
-Who?
-This high school girl.

907
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,394
I've definitely seen her somewhere before.
She looks familiar.

908
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,255
You really didn't know when you booked it?

909
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,467
No, we had no idea.
Is it really owned by Dr. Chu's parents?

910
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,428
Yes. Her photos are
everywhere in the house.

911
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,015
The noodles will swell up. Come and eat.

912
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,185
What a coincidence. I should tell Gyeo-ul.

913
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,978
Does Dr. Chu know yet?

914
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,565
I don't think so. There's no way
that bear already called her.

915
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,111
Hey, the noodles are getting all soggy.

916
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,279
I like soggy noodles.

917
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,619
You do? Why?

918
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,751
We never see eye to eye.
We're just so different.

919
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,379
-Do we have any pickled radish?
-Eat kimchi.

920
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,593
Professor Yang is there now?

921
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,179
Yes. They booked it randomly

922
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,056
but just found out your parents own it.

923
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,392
-Cheol-u's Guesthouse, right?
-Yes, that's right.

924
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,893
Is that your brother's name?

925
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,103
No, it's my dad's name.

926
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,604
I see.

927
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,567
Hey, Gyeo-ul. I'll call you back. Okay.

928
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,905
Please…

929
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:37,328
My love, you're working on the weekend.
You must be tired. Love you, sweetie.

930
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,664
-Mom, the guests who just arrived.
-Yes.

931
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,209
-They're professors from Yulje.
-Really? Seriously?

932
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,546
One of them is my professor,
the one who's advising me on my thesis.

933
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,465
He's the professor I admire the most.

934
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,008
Who? Which one of the two?

935
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,885
The one who looks like a bear.

936
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,636
A bear?

937
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,138
You'd know right away.

938
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,016
That was 263m.

939
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,483
-That sound was just amazing, wasn't it?
-Yes.

940
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,153
All right. On the left…

941
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,155
-Hand over the remote.
-Why?

942
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,782
-Let's watch New Journey to the West.
-I'm watching golf.

943
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,202
-That's not even live.
-You'll be watching a rerun too.

944
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,787
How did you know?

945
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,165
I didn't know. You fell for my trick.

946
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,001
Watch it on your phone.
You do it all the time.

947
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,795
Why would I, when there's this huge TV?
You use your phone.

948
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,714
No, this is perfect.

949
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,306
The distance was good,
but it curved to the right.

950
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,686
You see, the sound of the drivers…
That resonance.

951
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,230
-It sounds incredible.
-Right.

952
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,191
It'll help you enjoy the match even more.

953
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,613
Professors, sorry to bother you.

954
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,574
You should try this,
if you're not in bed yet.

955
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,076
-Okay!
-Okay!

956
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,745
You're in Sokcho,
so you should have some sashimi.

957
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,330
-My gosh, thank you.
-Thank you.

958
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,999
It was caught today,
and we made this just now.

959
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,794
You can't have sashimi like this in Seoul.

960
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,796
This is too much. Why don't you join us?

961
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,632
Gosh, no. We eat this often.

962
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,802
Please join us.
We can have a drink together too.

963
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,265
Well, shall we? Let's join them, honey.

964
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:24,060
What are you talking about?
I need antacids for my indigestion.

965
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,437
Thank you, but it's okay.

966
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,024
Thank you so much
for visiting our guesthouse, Professors.

967
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,652
-Gosh, thank you.
-We're so glad to be here.

968
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,699
Please take good care of Min-ha.

969
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,494
Of course, but she's very good at her job.

970
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,038
Min-ha told me over and over

971
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,542
that you can rarely take time off.
She told me not to bother you.

972
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,044
Well, get some rest.

973
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,505
-Thank you for this.
-You're welcome.

974
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,425
Enjoy. It's… Good night.

975
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,051
-Let's go. Come on!
-What?

976
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,344
Come on!

977
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,317
I want a drink. Beer?

978
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,484
Soju, obviously.

979
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,865
-Isn't it hot? Should we open the window?
-I'm cold.

980
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,662
Let's just go to bed.

981
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,583
We should finish this. You can go to bed.

982
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,634
Hey!

983
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,431
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

984
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,145
DO JAE-HAK

985
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,650
Hey, Jae-hak. Where are they at now?

986
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,110
They just started working
on the wiring, Professor.

987
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,029
I think we can start in about an hour.

988
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,364
Oh, really?

989
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,950
Yes. We'll start at around 2 p.m.
at the earliest.

990
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,035
Okay.

991
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:12,293
The surgery before mine got delayed,
so I'll be delayed by an hour too.

992
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:17,131
I'm sorry, but can we push it back
by an hour? To 7:30 p.m.

993
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,216
Sorry.

994
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,681
Sure, no problem.

995
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,061
What's wrong?

996
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,190
Did you find something suspicious?

997
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,483
No.

998
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,402
They've submitted most of the documents

999
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,780
along with interviews of witnesses
attesting that they're close friends.

1000
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,200
And the donor's wife
has consented to it as well.

1001
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,618
Really?

1002
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,455
Yes. She told me in tears

1003
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,959
that she was initially against it.

1004
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,628
But her husband was so adamant about it
that she ended up

1005
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,088
giving him the go-ahead.

1006
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,300
She's not sure
whether they're "best friends,"

1007
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,052
but they fight all the time.

1008
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,887
She said they fight every single day.

1009
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,767
Then isn't it good to go?

1010
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,937
The thing is…

1011
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,232
I can hand over the documents
and request an approval,

1012
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,110
but I'm a little…

1013
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,237
Obsessive?

1014
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,323
I am obsessive.

1015
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:28,578
From doctors to medical coordinators,
every hospital employee is.

1016
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,455
We're obsessive in a good way.

1017
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,124
What's bothering you though?

1018
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,959
Just one thing.

1019
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,300
That is a little odd.

1020
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:46,179
Such a close friend would emcee
the reception or stay by the groom's side.

1021
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,930
He's nowhere in the two-hour video?

1022
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:53,978
That's right. Then he suddenly shows up
right before the group photo session.

1023
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,313
After two full hours.

1024
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,733
I know it's not a big deal,

1025
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:02,403
but I need to solve this mystery

1026
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,407
to hand over the application
and documents in full confidence.

1027
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:10,369
Perhaps he was collecting
cash gifts at the wedding.

1028
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,793
You'd put someone you trust the most
in charge of that.

1029
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,838
Maybe he was manning the cash gift table.

1030
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,133
Wedding videos are centered around
the bride and groom,

1031
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,469
so it's not too odd
that he's not in the video.

1032
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,471
Instead of asking them,

1033
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,808
you should try asking
their friends or relatives

1034
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,643
who attended the wedding.

1035
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:34,644
I have to go.

1036
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,523
All right.

1037
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,579
-Hello.
-Hello.

1038
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,540
-Ju-won is here.
-Yes, hello.

1039
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,124
Hello.

1040
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,001
Hello.

1041
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,713
You're early, as always.

1042
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,049
We're short-staffed, so I should help out.

1043
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,736
We'll start with 5cm.

1044
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,532
If we can't see the site well,
we'll extend it by 0.5cm on each side.

1045
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,284
-Yes, sir.
-Got it, Professor.

1046
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,451
Scalpel.

1047
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,212
Suction.

1048
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,300
I'm sorry, Professor.

1049
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,094
Right now, it's okay.

1050
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:55,975
But unlike you guys,
I'm wearing three times magnifying loupes,

1051
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,687
so even a slight shake
looks like an earthquake to me.

1052
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,941
Had it happened
during a vessel dissection,

1053
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,443
it would have been bad.

1054
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,322
You're doing a great job,
but try to be more careful.

1055
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,991
Yes, sir. I apologize.

1056
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,118
Irrigation.

1057
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,328
Sure.

1058
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,500
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

1059
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,711
Professor, can we use the Bovie?

1060
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,671
No, we'll tie it.

1061
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,964
Okay, got it.

1062
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:36,098
When performing the Kasai procedure,
make sure you tie off everything,

1063
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,267
including the small vessels
of the portal vein.

1064
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,393
Yes, Professor.

1065
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,563
You may be wondering why
you have to tie off such small vessels,

1066
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,484
but this is often
where the bleeding begins.

1067
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:51,197
It may feel like a hassle,
but it'd be upsetting to see

1068
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,784
the kid's condition getting worse
because we neglected this 1mm.

1069
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,536
So hang in there.
Let's wrap this up nicely.

1070
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,788
Yes, sir.

1071
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,881
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1072
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,260
The opening is 4mm.

1073
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,681
As for the annulus, 7mm at the most.

1074
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,892
Isn't it too small?

1075
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:25,481
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

1076
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,778
How does the TEE look?

1077
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,615
As for the muscle,
we can't go any further.

1078
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,993
The small annulus is the problem.

1079
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:42,039
The pressure gradient is too high.

1080
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:42,957
Who is he?

1081
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:44,959
A professor in Pediatrics.

1082
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,168
I see.

1083
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,976
It doesn't look like
we can save the valve.

1084
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,687
This won't do.

1085
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,857
Call Nurse So I-hyeon
and tell her to prepare a homograft.

1086
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:08,941
Sure.

1087
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:19,827
HOMOGRAFT SHEET

1088
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,707
The available leaflet lengths
are 23, 24, and 25.

1089
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,419
This one is too old.

1090
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:29,795
Show me the next one.

1091
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:33,799
Thanks.

1092
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,969
Great. We'll go with this one.

1093
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,846
Sure, I'll get it ready.

1094
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,105
-Hey, Gyeo-ul.
-Professor.

1095
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,567
We extubated Han Yeong-sik,
the transplant patient from two days ago.

1096
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:55,112
But his saturation has dropped,
so I think we should intubate him again.

1097
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,907
Explain the situation
to his guardian and proceed with it.

1098
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,075
Do you want me to come?

1099
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,827
I'll monitor him
and call you if anything happens.

1100
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,871
Okay, call me if it looks serious.

1101
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,248
Wait, you're not on duty tonight.

1102
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,959
I'll monitor this patient for a bit
and get going.

1103
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,253
Gosh, all right.

1104
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,220
My gosh.

1105
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,152
Have some coffee, Professor.

1106
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,117
And it's raining outside.

1107
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:42,993
Really?

1108
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,840
Look at that.

1109
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,015
Gosh.

1110
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,566
What do you want for your birthday?

1111
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:17,278
Gosh, I'm not a kid.
Don't get me anything.

1112
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,905
Three, two, one.

1113
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,283
A dryer. A fridge would be good too.

1114
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,122
I need a new dryer and fridge.

1115
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,376
This is your last chance.

1116
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,087
Three, two, one.

1117
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,298
Anything.

1118
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:41,177
If it's from you, I don't care what it is.

1119
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,726
All right. I'll figure it out, then.

1120
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,159
If all night shifts were like this,
it wouldn't be so bad.

1121
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,876
Hey, Seong-yeong.

1122
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,174
Okay, I'm coming.

1123
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,098
Thanks for the coffee.

1124
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:30,684
Take it easy.

1125
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:43,864
Eureka!

1126
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,326
The recipient's wife found
a photo of him on her phone.

1127
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,412
The relatives who attended
the wedding also confirmed it.

1128
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,248
I owe you a meal, Professor Lee.

1129
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,492
I have the homograft here.

1130
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,202
You can put it here.

1131
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,086
Professor Kim, the homograft is here.

1132
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,796
Let me have a look.

1133
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,344
Good. We'll use this.

1134
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,429
Okay.

1135
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,146
Did you just finish the surgery?

1136
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,773
How's Dr. Do?

1137
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,740
You're still here? I thought
you were having dinner with your mom.

1138
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:10,909
Today, I want to have dinner with you.

1139
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,042
Is the pressure gradient better now?

1140
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,296
Yes. The velocity is under 2m as well.

1141
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,839
And no regurgitation.

1142
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,550
-Well done.
-Okay.

1143
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:28,302
It looks good.

1144
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,512
-Thank you for staying late.
-Good job.

1145
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,681
-Well done.
-Thank you, Professor.

1146
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,350
CURRENT TIME 21:26

1147
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,186
Gosh, the parents must be worried.

1148
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:38,604
-Close it up well.
-Will do.

1149
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,235
The surgery went well.

1150
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,364
-Gosh.
-My gosh. Thank you.

1151
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,615
Thank you, Professor Kim.

1152
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,450
As I explained to you before,

1153
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:55,496
I wanted to save the valve
at all costs but couldn't.

1154
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,083
Ga-ram's pulmonary annulus is small,
and the pressure gap is big.

1155
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:02,002
In such cases, we often
have to perform follow-up surgery.

1156
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,256
Anyway, we unfortunately
had to use a transannular patch

1157
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,927
and inserted a homograft,
which I have explained to you in the past.

1158
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:13,472
Everything went well,
and the valve is functioning well now,

1159
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,391
so don't worry too much.

1160
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:19,019
We'll move Ga-ram
to the ICU in about an hour.

1161
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,021
We'll make sure you can see Ga-ram then.

1162
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,191
-Thank you, Professor Kim.
-Thank you, Professor Kim.

1163
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,401
-It was the best meal I've had recently.
-Me too.

1164
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,785
Professor.

1165
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,870
Yes.

1166
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,748
How come you're not asking?

1167
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:27,546
About my family.

1168
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,759
Why my mom was hurt

1169
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,139
and what is going on with my family.

1170
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,101
You've never asked me about it once.

1171
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,272
It didn't seem like
you wanted to talk about it.

1172
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:51,528
I figured there must be a reason,
so I was waiting for you to tell me.

1173
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,500
My dad is abusive.

1174
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:10,923
Whenever he drinks, he hits my mom.
It started when I was little.

1175
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,551
When he gets angry, he loses it.

1176
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,429
He throws everything that catches his eye.

1177
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:22,434
Once, he threw a glass bottle at my mom,
which hurt her.

1178
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:29,107
And once,
I broke my arm while trying to stop him.

1179
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,029
He was abusive to me and Ga-eul too.

1180
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,407
He kicked and hit us all the time.

1181
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,082
Our home felt like hell.

1182
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,881
On my way home from school,

1183
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,344
I was always terrified.

1184
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:07,271
I studied hard because
I wanted to escape our miserable home.

1185
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,148
Both Ga-eul and I slept comfortably
for the first time

1186
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,860
when we moved to Seoul for college.

1187
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:18,073
Just knowing Dad wasn't there,

1188
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:23,328
I wasn't scared to go home
for the first time in my life.

1189
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,502
I did worry about my mom…

1190
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:35,674
but I only thought about myself.

1191
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,761
From time to time,

1192
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,265
I thought my mom sounded upset
on the phone,

1193
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,728
but she said everything was fine

1194
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,814
and that she was okay,

1195
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,485
so I believed her.

1196
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:03,452
But about a month ago,
I got a call from a hospital in Gwangju.

1197
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,579
They said my mom was badly hurt.

1198
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:12,044
A ruptured eardrum, a rib fracture,

1199
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:16,298
and a broken nose.
They said she needed surgery

1200
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,760
and asked for my consent.

1201
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,557
When I arrived in Gwangju and saw her,

1202
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,228
I realized how badly hurt she was.

1203
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,402
My dad beat her up, so there were bruises
all over her face and body.

1204
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:43,200
The surgery went well,
and she recovered quickly.

1205
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,287
But I was still so worried about her.

1206
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,086
She didn't talk

1207
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,547
or eat anything all day.

1208
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:02,636
She just laid in bed all day
like a dead person.

1209
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:09,726
She looked as though
she had given up on life.

1210
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:16,608
Professor.

1211
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,321
I want to see you every day too.

1212
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,241
I want to be with you all the time,

1213
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:30,372
but my mom needs me now.

1214
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,628
I want to only think about my mom
at the moment.

1215
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,673
I'm sorry.

1216
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,011
Don't worry about me.

1217
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:49,933
Just being able to see you
at the hospital makes me happy enough,

1218
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:55,147
so you should stay by her side
at all times for a while.

1219
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,240
And Gyeo-ul.

1220
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,953
Don't beat yourself up.

1221
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:15,751
I get it.

1222
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:21,047
If I were in your situation,
I would have done the same.

1223
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,844
It's not your fault,

1224
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,557
so don't torture yourself
with such thoughts.

1225
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:42,444
And once a week…

1226
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:47,407
Let's have dinner together like this
at least once a week.

1227
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,703
That's all I ask for.

1228
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,877
You can do that for me, right?

1229
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:28,198
THE STEAKHOUSE IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

1230
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,609
Why didn't you call me?

1231
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:09,489
I would've texted you if you were late
because of something else,

1232
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,908
but I didn't hear from you,

1233
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,495
so I just assumed the surgery
was taking longer than expected.

1234
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,586
How are you feeling?

1235
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:25,589
Good. I'm okay now.

1236
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,222
Jun-wan.

1237
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,393
Well…

1238
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,731
Saying this now

1239
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:48,320
is probably pointless,

1240
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,117
but about lying to you

1241
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:58,288
and breaking up with you…

1242
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,918
I'm really sorry.

1243
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:10,008
I thought you were stressed out
because of me.

1244
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:16,556
Your job is stressful
and exhausting enough.

1245
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:21,061
I thought I was
just adding to your stress.

1246
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,110
I didn't want to be hurt…

1247
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,239
so I hurt you instead.

1248
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,954
I was selfish. I'm sorry.

1249
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:45,585
And…

1250
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,427
I still have feelings for you.

1251
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,390
That's why I kept that photo of you.

1252
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,188
But that's just how I feel.

1253
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:11,152
I'll deal with it,
so you don't need to worry about it.

1254
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:21,746
You know…

1255
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,417
we'll run into each other

1256
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:28,086
from time to time.

1257
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:34,342
Can you act like nothing ever happened
whenever we run into each other?

1258
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,352
I don't think I can do that.

1259
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,577
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1260
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,503
Hey.

1261
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,256
Tomorrow's dress code
is "black and chain."

1262
01:24:13,339 --> 01:24:14,174
Do you have that?

1263
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:20,430
No. Black's fine, but I don't wear chains.

1264
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:24,684
Gosh, Lee Ik-jun.
That prick is always happy-go-lucky.

1265
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,270
I envy him.

1266
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,857
Jae-hak must be done
with the appointment by now, right?

1267
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,942
They're seeing
a breast surgeon first, right?

1268
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:34,652
Yes.

1269
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,364
We have your biopsy results.

1270
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:42,744
We couldn't do the other tests
because you're pregnant,

1271
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:47,373
but we believe that you have
stage two breast cancer.

1272
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:51,878
We'll find out more
should you decide to undergo surgery,

1273
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:55,882
but the size of the tumor
is about 3cm at the moment,

1274
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:58,343
and the cancer has spread
to the lymph nodes.

1275
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,471
You can undergo surgery
in your current stage of pregnancy,

1276
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:03,515
but you have
triple-negative breast cancer.

1277
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,768
Considering that,

1278
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,062
I think it'd be best

1279
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:12,565
to shrink the tumor
through neoadjuvant chemotherapy

1280
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,276
and treat the micrometastasis

1281
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,071
prior to the surgery.

1282
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:21,658
And I'd also have to consult
our specialists in Hemato-Oncology.

1283
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:25,870
Well, the problem is
that you're pregnant now.

1284
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:30,708
You are in the 11th week of pregnancy,

1285
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:35,672
which means we can't get you started
on chemotherapy right away.

1286
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:41,010
We'd have to wait until Week 14
to make sure it won't affect the fetus,

1287
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:42,679
but at the moment…

1288
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:47,517
If you decide to keep the baby,

1289
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:51,479
we'll have no choice
but to delay the chemotherapy.

1290
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,150
The tumor might grow while we wait,
or it might not.

1291
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,068
We have no way of knowing.

1292
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,697
If you wish to be treated sooner,

1293
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,533
you can choose
to terminate your pregnancy.

1294
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:07,829
Then we can get you started
on chemotherapy immediately.

1295
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,750
The two of you should decide
what you'd like to do.

1296
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:16,880
We'll give up the baby, Professor.

1297
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:21,342
We'll give up the baby and get her started
on chemotherapy right away.

1298
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:24,721
Book us an appointment
with the Professor of Hemato-Oncology.

1299
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,893
Hold on, honey. Just a moment.

1300
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,352
What?

1301
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,982
Don't worry about a thing.

1302
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:37,442
It's just stage two.

1303
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,819
Start your chemotherapy now.
With that and surgery,

1304
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,696
you'll be cured in no time.

1305
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:43,531
Trust me.

1306
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,453
Professor, let's start this week.

1307
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:52,415
We'll start the chemotherapy
right after her internist appointment.

1308
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,461
We'll receive chemotherapy

1309
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,339
as soon as we terminate her pregnancy.

1310
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,514
Can we let you know
after giving it some thought?

1311
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,016
Yes, of course.

1312
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,644
It's still early in the pregnancy,

1313
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:17,273
so I suggest you consult the doctors
in OB-GYN before making your decision.

1314
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,651
Okay, I'll do that.

1315
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:22,278
Let's go, honey.

1316
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:42,298
Gosh, you said you didn't want a baby.

1317
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,593
You told me to trust you.

1318
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,514
Please, just listen to me.

1319
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:54,352
YANG SEOK-HYEONG

1320
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,188
You should answer it.
I'll go sit over there.

1321
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:02,610
Yes, Professor.

1322
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,321
What did you decide to do?
Did you manage to persuade her?

1323
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:09,033
No. I told her I'd follow her decision.

1324
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:12,245
She's so adamant about it.
Nothing I say will persuade her.

1325
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:16,874
We'll keep the baby
and undergo chemotherapy.

1326
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:18,710
I see.

1327
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:24,757
Jae-hak,
I don't think it's a bad decision.

1328
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,552
We'll fix her. We can do it.

1329
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:32,557
But I get the feeling
that she'll end up forgoing chemotherapy.

1330
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,225
That would be insane.

1331
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:36,728
What should I do?

1332
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,814
But I feel like she will.

1333
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,358
Jae-hak, you haven't seen
Seok-hyeong yet, right?

1334
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,485
No, I'm waiting for him now.

1335
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,654
What should I do?

1336
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,866
What if she refuses
to undergo chemotherapy too?

1337
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:51,326
Let Seok-hyeong handle it.

1338
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,078
He'll talk to her.

1339
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:55,580
Trust me.

1340
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,167
Well…

1341
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:04,047
Have you made your decision?

1342
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,133
Yes.

1343
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,721
I still think it's crazy,

1344
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,895
but my wife is adamant about it,
so we decided to keep the baby.

1345
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:26,527
But I don't want to undergo chemotherapy.

1346
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:32,325
I'll get started on it after I give birth.

1347
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:35,495
What are you talking about?
You won't undergo chemotherapy?

1348
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:37,705
We talked about this earlier.
What's with you?

1349
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,624
Who knows what drugs they'll use?

1350
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:41,959
And they'll run
all sorts of tests on top of that.

1351
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:46,297
I'll start my first chemotherapy session
after I give birth.

1352
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:49,717
We don't know…

1353
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:55,640
what it could do to the baby.

1354
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:59,644
I want to give birth
without undergoing chemotherapy.

1355
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,646
Please let me do that, Professor.

1356
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,192
I don't care if I die.

1357
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:09,487
I just want to make sure
my baby will be born healthy.

1358
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,492
PATIENT DIAGNOSIS CHART

1359
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:21,541
Both the mother
and the baby should be healthy.

1360
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:23,417
What's the point if it's just the baby?

1361
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,547
What if you're gone when
the baby comes out to see you?

1362
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,591
That's very irresponsible.

1363
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,473
You can still undergo chemotherapy
even if you're pregnant.

1364
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:41,853
It can be done, and many people do it.

1365
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,232
If your condition was very serious,

1366
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:50,653
neither the breast surgeon nor I
would've given you this option.

1367
01:30:50,736 --> 01:30:54,282
We would've terminated your pregnancy
and put you on chemotherapy.

1368
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,909
But you can make a choice.

1369
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:00,746
Your health comes first,

1370
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:04,500
so you can choose to give up on your baby

1371
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:09,797
and focus on treating your breast cancer.
That's one option.

1372
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:15,720
Or you can delay the chemotherapy
by three weeks to keep the baby

1373
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:18,806
and treat your cancer at the same time.

1374
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,351
You only have these two options.

1375
01:31:29,108 --> 01:31:30,776
There are times

1376
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:35,156
when I tell my patients
that they must make a choice.

1377
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,993
When I do that, I ponder on it too.

1378
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,540
"What would be the best decision?

1379
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:47,460
What choice should they make?"

1380
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:53,466
And oftentimes,
this helps me answer that question.

1381
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:56,677
"What would I do
if the patient were my family?

1382
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,599
What would I do if she were my sister?"

1383
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:08,731
If you were my sister,

1384
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:11,651
I'd tell you to wait a few weeks

1385
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:14,487
to keep your baby,
then focus on your chemotherapy.

1386
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:22,161
"The doctors seem positive about it,
so why would you forgo chemotherapy?

1387
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,749
Just wait three weeks
and start your chemotherapy."

1388
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:29,085
I'll probably say that to her.

1389
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:36,425
Then every weekend,

1390
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,137
I'd go to the temple alone in secret

1391
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:46,060
and pray that your tumor wouldn't grow.

1392
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,864
I'll pretend I never heard
what you said earlier.

1393
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,911
I'll book you Hemato-Oncology
and OB-GYN appointments.

1394
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:07,873
And we'll discuss your case
with the breast surgeon as well.

1395
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:12,837
Thank you.

1396
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,548
You're welcome.

1397
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:17,717
Thank you, Professor.

1398
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,052
No problem.

1399
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,309
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1400
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:33,983
How did it go?

1401
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:36,068
She's agreed to undergo chemotherapy.

1402
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:39,030
We decided to keep the baby
and get chemotherapy.

1403
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:42,074
Initially, she said she wanted
to wait until the baby was born.

1404
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:43,868
But Professor Yang helped me.

1405
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,203
He managed to persuade her.

1406
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:49,665
Thank God. I'm glad you got it sorted out.

1407
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:53,002
I owe Professor Yang, big-time.

1408
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:54,879
I'll repay him for the rest of my life.

1409
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,839
Leave that to me.

1410
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:59,383
Don't worry about it.
Just take good care of your wife.

1411
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,053
Okay. Thank you, Professor.

1412
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,430
Go home. You're done for the day.

1413
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,642
Did Seok-hyeong manage to persuade her?

1414
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:09,935
Yes, sounds like it.

1415
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:12,521
That's great.

1416
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:16,067
I knew we could count on the bear.

1417
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,443
You're right.

1418
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:20,571
Gosh, I'm annoyed.

1419
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:27,453
I heard the coordinator has sent in
all your documents. Am I right?

1420
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:32,249
Yes. She said our case was processed
faster than most cases.

1421
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:38,089
Doctor, what if they say that
the documents we submitted aren't enough

1422
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,926
and that they still think it's suspicious?

1423
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:44,887
Then do we have to get
everything ready again and wait?

1424
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:46,764
Well…

1425
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,393
There's a very slim chance
that they'll say that.

1426
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,649
The coordinator wouldn't even have
sent in your application in that case.

1427
01:34:57,858 --> 01:35:00,194
She thoroughly checked everything
and vetted you.

1428
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:03,030
I'm sure she requested an approval
because she's confident

1429
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:04,573
you meet all the requirements.

1430
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:06,450
-I see.
-My gosh.

1431
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:12,289
By the way,
how did you two become friends?

1432
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,417
Your personalities are very different.

1433
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:18,421
It's been ages,
so I don't really remember.

1434
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,840
How did we become friends?

1435
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:22,466
We were classmates in tenth grade.

1436
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:24,760
Did I sit in front of him?

1437
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:27,555
Or did we sit next to each other?

1438
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:30,641
Anyway, the seats were assigned
based on our grades.

1439
01:35:30,724 --> 01:35:32,518
I came in 63rd place. Him, 64th.

1440
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:36,355
No. It was the other way around.
I came in 63rd place.

1441
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:41,902
Anyway, neither of us really studied.
We just hung out all the time.

1442
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,822
I'd go over to his place,
and he'd come over too.

1443
01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:50,995
We've been busy hanging out like that,
and 30 years have passed already.

1444
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:54,373
Gosh, I'm sick of you now.

1445
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,335
Then why are you donating
your liver to him?

1446
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,174
Because I'd have no one
to hang out with if he's gone.

1447
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:06,385
If he dies,
I won't have anyone to play with.

1448
01:36:07,344 --> 01:36:08,804
I'll be bored out of my mind.

1449
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,806
That's why.

1450
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,849
This prick…

1451
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:15,769
I'd never do it for his sake alone.

1452
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:19,023
That's definitely more than enough reason.

1453
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:23,027
May I ask you for a favor, Doctor?

1454
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:29,033
If our application gets approved,
and if we can undergo the surgery,

1455
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,828
-could you…
-Of course.

1456
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,788
I'll make sure

1457
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:38,209
your friend's surgery is painless
even if yours isn't.

1458
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:42,129
No. Could you make sure
mine is painless if it's possible at all?

1459
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:44,590
I don't care if his hurts.

1460
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:53,682
-My goodness.
-Gosh, you're such a prick.

1461
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:55,309
Goodness.

1462
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,229
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1463
01:36:58,312 --> 01:36:59,647
-Cool sneakers?
-Sneakers?

1464
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,190
-I see.
-Sneakers?

1465
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,358
-All black.
-Yes, black.

1466
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,567
Yoon-hee.

1467
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:08,030
Kim Eun-su might have some spotting,
so keep track of the pads.

1468
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:09,615
Sure.

1469
01:37:09,698 --> 01:37:10,699
Professor.

1470
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:14,411
What are you doing tomorrow night?

1471
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:19,166
We're going clubbing to celebrate
one of the fellows' birthday.

1472
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,585
We'll throw a birthday party at the club.

1473
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,254
You should come with us.

1474
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,380
Me?

1475
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,382
You want to go clubbing with me?

1476
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:28,676
-Yes.
-I'm going too.

1477
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:30,219
Come with us, Professor.

1478
01:37:30,302 --> 01:37:34,807
Thanks, but please count me out.

1479
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:37,893
Have fun without me. I'm no fun.

1480
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:40,938
If I go, all the residents
will be uncomfortable.

1481
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:42,523
No, we won't be uncomfortable.

1482
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:43,983
Everyone will be, but you.

1483
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,903
Anyway, I'm off. Take it easy.

1484
01:37:48,487 --> 01:37:49,321
-Bye.
-Good night.

1485
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,864
Get home safely.

1486
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:53,701
-Right, Min-ha.
-Yes?

1487
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:56,287
Your thesis draft you emailed me.
The file is corrupted.

1488
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,622
I see.

1489
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,040
Can you send it again?

1490
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,292
Sure.

1491
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:13,012
I think you can go do rounds like that.

1492
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,014
There it is.

1493
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,017
No way.

1494
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,019
I should put on socks at least.

1495
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,108
Let's go.

1496
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,611
You should take the cap off.

1497
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:29,695
Right!

1498
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:31,322
Let's go.

1499
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:35,451
The director will be there,
so I'm not sure what I should wear.

1500
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:36,952
Everyone else is asking too.

1501
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,996
I should wear a proper shirt at least.

1502
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,832
Like a dress shirt? No.
Just wear comfortable clothes.

1503
01:38:41,915 --> 01:38:44,084
You can even wear slippers. Goodness.

1504
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:45,794
You'd be coming from work,

1505
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,963
and he just wants
to treat you guys to a meal.

1506
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,757
You don't need to dress up.

1507
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,761
Tell everyone to wear comfy clothes
so I'll be the only one dressed up.

1508
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:55,346
All right, thank you.

1509
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:58,557
By the way, I heard
you're practicing a rock song this week.

1510
01:38:58,641 --> 01:38:59,516
How did you know?

1511
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:04,730
Professor Ahn bragged
about his new leather pants.

1512
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:17,107
You took photos?

1513
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,901
Gosh, I told you not to bother them.

1514
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:21,278
Just one. I only took one photo.

1515
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:24,448
Mom! Send me the photo. Goodness.

1516
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:39,922
Nice photo, right?

1517
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:44,009
-Is the one wearing blue your professor?
-Hold on.

1518
01:43:44,092 --> 01:43:49,765
That's why I put four boxes
of sweet and crispy chicken in his trunk.

1519
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,850
-I hope he enjoyed it.
-Mom.

1520
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:55,812
It's the one in white, not blue.
The one in white is my professor.

1521
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:58,023
-You said he looked like a bear.
-That's right.

1522
01:43:58,106 --> 01:44:00,067
The one in blue is a bear, a polar bear.

1523
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:04,947
A polar bear? What are you talking about?
Just a regular bear!

1524
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,657
Seriously? Honey.

1525
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:09,326
Honey. Turns out,
it's the guy in white, not blue.

1526
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:10,452
-Really?
-Yes!

1527
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,788
The one who came back
to drop off antacids for me.

1528
01:44:12,871 --> 01:44:14,831
He's the bear.

1529
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,167
I mean, he is Min-ha's professor.

1530
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:19,378
Oh, no!

1531
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:21,004
Whatever, I have to go!

1532
01:44:22,589 --> 01:44:23,799
Gosh, seriously!

1533
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:28,053
I did bring it up,
but it's a bit much financially.

1534
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:30,639
-Jeong-won, Professor Ahn.
-Yes.

1535
01:44:30,722 --> 01:44:32,391
Do you have Daddy-Long-Legs' number?

1536
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,309
It's a social services department.

1537
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:36,353
Yes, I'll send it to you now.

1538
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,188
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Dr. Jang.

1539
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:39,648
Yes, Professor.

1540
01:44:39,731 --> 01:44:42,442
Did you break up with your boyfriend
by any chance?

1541
01:44:47,406 --> 01:44:48,657
Why do you ask?

1542
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:51,618
Well, you've been seeing him for a while,

1543
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,662
but no news about you getting hitched,

1544
01:44:53,745 --> 01:44:56,498
so I was just wondering
if you were still with him.

1545
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:57,791
Yes, I am.

1546
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:01,003
You see… Maybe I'm being too nosy.

1547
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:03,880
If you two break up,

1548
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,842
just tell us, okay?

1549
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,886
I want to set you up with someone.

1550
01:45:10,887 --> 01:45:11,847
Professor.

1551
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:17,019
Oh, boy.

1552
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,022
Geon says you're his type.

1553
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,356
Professor.

1554
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:26,695
We grabbed a bite to eat
with the residents when you weren't here.

1555
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:29,406
-Okay.
-While talking about their ideal types,

1556
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:32,451
Yu-ri, Se-hoon, and Ji-woo
all named an idol singer,

1557
01:45:32,534 --> 01:45:34,745
but Geon said Dr. Jang was his type.

1558
01:45:37,372 --> 01:45:39,916
I'm sorry. I apologize.

1559
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:45,005
Hey, why are you sorry?
It's nothing to apologize for.

1560
01:45:45,088 --> 01:45:46,965
Don't apologize unless you really--

1561
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:49,217
What?

1562
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:51,511
Hey, Professor Ahn.

1563
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:55,015
You called me by mistake.

1564
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:56,808
Yes, I know I called you.

1565
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:01,188
I sent you a phone number.
Call that number now.

1566
01:46:01,271 --> 01:46:04,775
Okay, I'll do it later.
This is just starting to get interesting.

1567
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:06,401
No, do it now.

1568
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:08,195
It's now or never. Call now.

1569
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:10,822
-Now?
-Yes, right now.

1570
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:14,284
-Go for it.
-Okay.

1571
01:46:14,367 --> 01:46:16,328
-You wrap it up.
-All right.

1572
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:22,501
-Ahn Jeong-won speaking.
-Professor.

1573
01:46:22,584 --> 01:46:25,796
A baby in the NICU is showing
symptoms of abdominal distension

1574
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:27,297
with a bruised-looking stomach.

1575
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:28,757
Okay, I'm coming now.

1576
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:43,063
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1577
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:45,440
I'll leave your birthday gift
in your office.

1578
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:47,150
Pick it up after the team dinner.

1579
01:46:48,026 --> 01:46:51,321
-Wait, should I give it to you tomorrow?
-No, my birthday is today.

1580
01:46:51,404 --> 01:46:54,199
Just leave it in my office.
I'll pick it up afterwards.

1581
01:46:55,408 --> 01:46:57,869
Too bad I'm in Gangnam now
for this team dinner.

1582
01:46:57,953 --> 01:47:00,413
Your office is open, right?
I'll leave it on your desk.

1583
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:02,374
It was cheap, very cheap.

1584
01:47:02,457 --> 01:47:05,168
I just got you something
you'd like and use often.

1585
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:06,962
Okay, thanks.

1586
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:08,213
I'll see you tomorrow.

1587
01:47:08,296 --> 01:47:09,673
All right, good night.

1588
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:10,757
Thanks.

1589
01:47:14,594 --> 01:47:16,221
-You stayed late again.
-Gosh.

1590
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:18,014
Going home?

1591
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:20,851
No, I'm going to have some fun.
I'm going out for drinks.

1592
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:22,269
-Where?
-In Itaewon.

1593
01:47:22,352 --> 01:47:25,772
My cousin called.
We're meeting up for a beer.

1594
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:27,399
-You're on duty, right?
-Yes.

1595
01:47:27,482 --> 01:47:28,567
Take it easy.

1596
01:47:29,442 --> 01:47:30,443
Good night.

1597
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:53,550
PROFESSOR YANG SEOK-HYEONG

1598
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:58,180
Min-ha.

1599
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,724
Oh, hello.

1600
01:48:01,391 --> 01:48:04,186
What are you doing next weekend?
Do you have plans?

1601
01:48:05,854 --> 01:48:09,274
Me? Are you asking me?

1602
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,694
Yes, you.

1603
01:48:13,528 --> 01:48:15,655
I've got no plans.

1604
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:17,365
Why do you ask?

1605
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,910
Let's grab a bite to eat.

1606
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,581
It'll be my treat.

1607
01:48:34,382 --> 01:48:38,303
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1608
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:42,515
Yulje Emergency Center.

1609
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:44,976
We have a trauma patient.
A male in his 40s.

1610
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,854
Mental status, drowsy. BP 150 over 90.

1611
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:49,856
Heart rate is 80, 12 breaths per minute.

1612
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,275
And his temperature
is 36.7 degrees Celsius.

1613
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:53,652
He collapsed

1614
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:56,655
after getting hit by someone
in the back of the head.

1615
01:48:56,738 --> 01:48:58,698
We checked his ID
while checking his mental status,

1616
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:00,742
and he's a doctor at Yulje.

1617
01:49:00,825 --> 01:49:02,160
He's a doctor here?

1618
01:49:04,829 --> 01:49:06,039
What's his name?

1619
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:05,307
How did you even become a doctor?

1620
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:07,809
You're not smart and are slow-witted.

1621
01:50:07,892 --> 01:50:10,812
Why would he scold me so much
when I made a tiny mistake?

1622
01:50:10,895 --> 01:50:13,231
I took her out to lunch
and even went to drink together

1623
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:15,608
because she didn't seem to get along
with others.

1624
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:17,485
What do you mean?

1625
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,112
Is he still not answering?

1626
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:23,533
I didn't see him in the ICU this morning
and his phone is still off.

1627
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:28,330
Gosh, Dr. Chu will be blamed
for everything.

1628
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:31,624
Just hang in there.
You've been through so much.

1629
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,001
Was it a robbery?

1630
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:36,004
According to the witnesses,
he was hit with a rock from behind.

1631
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:37,255
Can you hear me?

1632
01:50:37,339 --> 01:50:40,216
-How did they catch the culprit?
-There was a surveillance camera.

1633
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,301
The police called us.

1634
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:44,304
Right. Is Seok-hyeong really
going to the US?

1635
01:50:44,387 --> 01:50:46,848
What? He didn't tell me about it yet.

1636
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:49,059
He would have told us if he's leaving.

1637
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:52,228
I have a date with him this weekend.

1638
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:53,480
Could it be…

1639
01:50:53,563 --> 01:50:56,358
Finally, my dream has come true!

1640
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:59,361
You didn't break up with Ms. Jang, right?

1641
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:15,001
