1
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,022
Thank you. What's your name?

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,691
I'm Ko Se-gyeong.

3
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,610
Ik-sun and I live in the same building.

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,654
I'm her closest friend here.

5
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,910
Hello?

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,997
Yes, Se-gyeong.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,586
I know I said this earlier,
but when Ik-sun's out…

8
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,171
It doesn't matter how late it is.

9
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,507
Can you please tell her
to call me right away?

10
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,176
Yes, I will.

11
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,137
But you really don't need to worry.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,805
Her injury isn't serious.

13
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,973
Okay, thank you.

14
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,572
This is nuts…

15
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,147
Why are you still up?

16
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,733
My girlfriend is supposed to call me.

17
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,613
Do you need a drinking buddy?

18
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,866
No, thanks. Just do your thing.

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,452
All right.

20
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,386
Hello? Are you okay?

21
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,763
Thank goodness you're not seriously hurt.

22
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,682
What about the driver?

23
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,726
Everyone's fine. That couple's already
at the place we're staying.

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,103
You're not "fine."

25
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,397
Your brain CT scan showed
bleeding in the brain,

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,774
and you hurt your arm too.
How's that "fine"?

27
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,693
It's not like my skull is broken.

28
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,113
And it's only a tiny bit of blood.
The doctor said it's negligible.

29
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,241
They told me I shouldn't be worried.

30
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,953
I'm really okay, babe. I'm totally fine.

31
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,371
Can't you tell from my voice?

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,456
Even if the CT scan looks okay now,

33
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,917
you could experience
delayed injury symptoms.

34
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,253
The bleeding could get worse
in the next two days.

35
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,921
Rest up and monitor it carefully.

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,174
If you have a headache, vomit,
or feel dizzy, go to the ER right away.

37
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,509
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,472
Professor Kim, stop worrying about me
and go to bed.

39
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,183
-Isn't it really late there now?
-Yes, it's 2 a.m.

40
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,811
They want you to stay there today, right?

41
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,439
Yes, they want
to monitor my condition tonight.

42
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,734
Gosh, I feel totally fine though.

43
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,153
I've wasted an entire day,
so I'm going to check out

44
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,155
Bournemouth Pier tomorrow
and take it easy.

45
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,033
What are you talking about?
Rest up for the next two days

46
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,784
and just head back to London.

47
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,579
You should rest up tomorrow

48
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,040
and just head back home the next day.

49
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,167
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
at home?

50
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,085
I don't want to head back right away.

51
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,046
I'll step out for just a couple of hours.

52
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,007
I can take care of myself.

53
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,718
You can stop worrying about me, okay?

54
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,471
They're looking for me.
I'll call you later.

55
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,307
No, I'll call you when I'm leaving
the hospital tomorrow.

56
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,725
Go to bed.

57
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,937
I feel so bad
that you stayed up because of me.

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,063
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,150
I love you. Feel better soon.

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
Okay, I will.

61
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,154
I hate it when I don't feel well.

62
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,241
Sweet dreams, babe. I love you.

63
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,242
Bye.

64
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,686
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

65
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,026
Shall we go see Ba-da now?

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,612
-Sure.
-Hello, Professor Ahn.

67
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,739
Hello.

68
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,910
Professor Ahn, we were only going
to keep Seo-a on antibiotics until today.

69
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,413
Should we stick to the plan?

70
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,582
Yes, we'll take her off it as of tomorrow.

71
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,154
Dr. Do Jae-hak,
please do a good job with the surgery.

72
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,488
Don't worry, Professor.

73
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,949
You can count on me.

74
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,703
Jeez, I feel like all you've learned
is to be a smooth talker.

75
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,958
This will take long
if you two have it easy.

76
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,877
But if I have it easy, it'll be quick.

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,255
Please make sure I can have it easy today.
You can do that, right?

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,257
Well, I'll do my best.

79
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,258
Hey!

80
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,513
Professor Ahn,
Ba-da's mother is very worried.

81
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,348
We told her it'll be a simple surgery,

82
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,185
but she's worried about
the general anesthesia and scarring.

83
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,313
Of course, she's worried.

84
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,774
To a mom, there's no such thing
as a simple surgery.

85
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,609
Professor Ahn.

86
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,486
Do you have a kid?

87
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,990
Me? Yes. Many, in fact.

88
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,326
I think of all the kids I've treated
as my own.

89
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,207
Hello.

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,917
He really is like a saint.

91
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,337
I agree.

92
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,218
I read the draft for your thesis.

93
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,637
I know it's a complex topic.
You did a great job.

94
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,058
I know you're saying that because
you don't want to hurt my feelings.

95
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,352
I want your honest opinion.
I won't be hurt.

96
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,231
Well…

97
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,859
How about we have some coffee?

98
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,237
Sure, I'll go make some now.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,947
Do you like it mild in the morning?

100
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,075
Yes, thanks. No, I'll do it.

101
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,993
Just print the draft, Seon-bin.

102
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,954
-Let's look at it together.
-Sure.

103
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,215
Professor Chae,
are you going back to Sokcho tonight?

104
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,969
No, tomorrow morning.
I only have appointments in the afternoon.

105
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,348
-You want dark roast, right?
-Yes, thank you.

106
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,766
No problem.

107
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,104
We'll perform the surgery
early tomorrow morning.

108
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,524
She can eat anything she wants
until bedtime tonight,

109
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,570
but she shouldn't eat or drink
anything tomorrow, including water.

110
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,323
Is Ba-da a big eater?

111
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,534
Yes, she is. She gets so greedy with food.

112
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,743
Oh, no.

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,664
You can give her food
four hours after the surgery,

114
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,041
so just be careful until tomorrow morning.

115
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,211
Do you have any questions
about the surgery tomorrow?

116
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,422
How long will it take?

117
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,341
The surgery itself
will take about an hour.

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,262
But including the time we need
to move her to the OR and put her under…

119
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,514
I'd say three hours at the most.

120
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,643
We'll be performing a procedure called
"thyroglossal duct cyst excision."

121
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,355
We'll make an incision
of about 3 to 5cm on the neck

122
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,024
and remove the cyst.

123
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,652
It'll leave a noticeable scar, right?

124
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,572
Well, the incision will be about this big.

125
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,991
Even if we try to make it smaller,

126
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,327
it'll be about this big.

127
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,542
She's been doing that
to everyone she sees.

128
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,132
Yes, pinky swear.

129
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,802
The surgery will go well,
and you'll recover in no time, Ba-da.

130
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,887
Okay!

131
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,981
Did anything come up with Sim Eun-yeong?

132
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,900
We checked her cervix.

133
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,945
It's about 1cm,
so it hasn't dilated further.

134
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,198
But she is having regular contractions,

135
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,201
and her pulse has increased to 120.
She is having a hard time,

136
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,954
so we took her off ritodrine
and switched to atosiban.

137
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,372
She's also on betamethasone.

138
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,667
What about a chest X-ray?
Any signs of pulmonary edema?

139
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,878
No, we checked.
No signs of pulmonary edema.

140
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,214
But the patient is very worried.

141
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,466
You'd like me
to have a look at her, right?

142
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
Yes.

143
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,136
All right.

144
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,973
-Min-ha.
-Yes?

145
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,683
Ask away.

146
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,728
How did you know?

147
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,982
Can you read my mind?

148
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,238
No. Of course, I can't.
I saw what you were writing down.

149
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,448
TO ASK OR NOT TO ASK
THAT IS THE QUESTION

150
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,366
Are you Hamlet?

151
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,120
What's your question?

152
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,456
Can patient Kim Ye-ji be discharged?

153
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,292
That's what I wanted to ask you.

154
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,044
She's not nitrazine positive, right?

155
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,964
No, she's not. And no pooling is detected.

156
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,257
That's a relief.

157
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,342
I'll let her know when I'm doing rounds.

158
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,679
-Let's go. She must be waiting.
-Okay.

159
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,812
Your liver somatic index looks good.

160
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,565
The immunosuppressant levels
look good too.

161
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,652
And your kidneys are working fine too.
Everything looks good.

162
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,863
Any other concerns?

163
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,490
It's nothing serious,

164
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,660
I can't digest food as well as I used to.

165
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,746
My stomach gets upset often.

166
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,122
As I've explained before,

167
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,833
the gallbladder is removed
during a liver transplant,

168
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,378
which can cause
digestive problems temporarily.

169
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,422
Try to stay away from greasy foods

170
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,924
and make sure you exercise regularly.

171
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,470
Yes, I took your advice
and have been exercising regularly.

172
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,140
Don't you worry, Doctor.
I'll make sure she never becomes lax.

173
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,600
She's finally healthy.

174
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,562
Don't worry about
her exercise routine and diet.

175
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,982
My gosh, okay. Keep up the good work.

176
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,485
Then I'll see you in a month.

177
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,944
-Okay.
-Oh, right.

178
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,323
-You live in Jinhae, don't you?
-Yes.

179
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,034
It must be tiring
to come all the way here.

180
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,369
What time did you leave?

181
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,039
-We got here last night.
-My gosh.

182
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,457
We got here in the wee hours

183
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,293
and slept on the bench in the lobby.

184
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,463
We used to get a motel room in the past,

185
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,382
but it's hard to get a room these days.

186
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,218
And we'd have to check out
early in the morning anyway,

187
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,136
so we didn't want to waste money.

188
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,765
Still, it's important
that you get enough sleep.

189
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,018
Don't you also have an appointment
with our neurologist?

190
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,104
You were treated
for a cerebral infarction.

191
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,400
That's right! You're so smart.

192
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,692
My gosh.

193
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,030
So I've been told.

194
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,284
When is that appointment?
You'll have to come back for it.

195
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,286
Can you find out?

196
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,579
Just a moment, please.

197
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,792
It's on March 25.

198
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,294
Yes, March 25.
It's with Professor Yoon Mi-hye, right?

199
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,879
Yes, that's right.

200
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,425
Hold on. Does that mean

201
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,302
I have an appointment with Professor Lee
in a month,

202
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,972
and I have to come back
about a week after that?

203
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,225
Sure, we'll come back.
It'll be nice to spend more time in Seoul.

204
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,228
What are you talking about?
This is exhausting for me.

205
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,605
I'll work around your schedule.

206
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,608
I'll see you when you're here
for your neurologist appointment.

207
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,861
I take outpatient appointments
for Wednesdays.

208
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,905
Are you sure? Is that really okay?

209
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,241
Yes. You're recovering quickly,

210
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,202
and all the numbers look good,
so we can push it back by a week.

211
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,037
I'll prescribe you enough meds.

212
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,331
You live far away, so this is no problem.

213
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,710
-Thank you so much, Doctor.
-Thank you, Doctor.

214
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,087
No problem at all. Have a safe trip home.

215
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,006
-Thank you.
-See you in a month.

216
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,632
-Yes, I'll see you then.
-Let's go.

217
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,509
Thank you.

218
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,886
Okay, take it easy.

219
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,305
Kim Jun-wan speaking.

220
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,725
Okay, I finished my surgery.
I can come now.

221
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,226
Okay.

222
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,528
You can come in now.

223
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,114
Let's check if everyone's here
and go in together.

224
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,492
Kang Dong-hyeon's guardian?

225
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,202
-Here.
-Great.

226
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,953
Is Choi Han-na's guardian here?

227
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,413
-Yes.
-Okay.

228
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,499
-Is Lee Won-u's guardian here?
-Yes.

229
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,376
Great. Bae Min-jin's guardian?

230
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,837
-Here.
-Okay. Lee Hye-ri's guardian?

231
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,007
So I should take out the results
concerning other variables, right?

232
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,927
Yes, you included the results

233
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,930
that aren't statistically significant,

234
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,640
-and I find it distracting.
-Okay.

235
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,475
And lastly…

236
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,686
In the conclusion,

237
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,274
you wrote that
the meningioma volume threshold is 14cc.

238
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,611
So I think the discussion
should be focused on the mechanism

239
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,073
of how growing meningiomas
cause cerebral edema.

240
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,701
I wrote down some key points for you.

241
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,496
But why don't you rewrite this part
and send it to me?

242
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,666
Then I'll email you what I wrote
so you can refer to it.

243
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,210
Okay, will do. Thank you.

244
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,796
I'll work on it and send it over quickly.

245
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,880
Sounds good.

246
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,427
This is good coffee.

247
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,013
You made the coffee.

248
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,226
I was talking to myself.

249
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:20,526
You like studying and enjoy it, don't you?

250
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
Me?

251
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,157
Well, no. I don't find it fun.

252
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,244
How can studying be fun?

253
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,329
Professor.

254
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,624
Yes.

255
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,878
I do enjoy it.

256
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,172
Isn't it fun to learn new things?

257
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,511
I chose to study the brain
because the more you learn…

258
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,929
-It's hard.
-…it's fun.

259
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,434
Don't you know how interesting
the human brain is?

260
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,978
There are still things
we don't know about the brain.

261
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,273
I do enjoy treating patients,

262
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,151
but I wish I could read and study
all my life.

263
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm weird, right?

264
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,292
I changed the ventilator setting.

265
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,294
Run an ABG analysis again
in 30 minutes.

266
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,378
Got it.

267
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,963
Hello.

268
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,718
You said hello earlier.
Why are you doing it again?

269
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,265
-Jang Hong-do.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,727
Where should the heart-lung machine
be connected to during heart surgery?

272
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,022
The aorta and…

273
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,359
Well…

274
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,821
The aorta and…

275
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,491
And…

276
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,326
The aorta and…

277
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,829
You need to study harder so you can
answer these questions right away.

278
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,123
I may ask you the same question again,

279
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,708
or I may not.

280
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,418
Take it easy.

281
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,913
STAFF ONLY

282
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,378
-Is Ru-bin out of the OR?
-Yes, we're in the PICU now.

283
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,463
Okay, I'm coming now.

284
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,841
The surgery went well.

285
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,844
As we had expected
based on the test results,

286
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,346
there was a big hole
between the two ventricles.

287
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,808
We fixed it using the pericardium,
which is a thin sac

288
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,143
that surrounds the heart.

289
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,229
We also found a small hole
between the two atria,

290
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,814
and we fixed that too.

291
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,526
The surgery went smoothly
without any issues,

292
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,030
so I don't think we need to be worried
about the recovery.

293
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,451
Don't worry.
We'll keep monitoring Ru-bin carefully.

294
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,286
-Thank you, Professor Kim.
-Thank you.

295
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,623
Ru-bin got through the surgery.

296
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,707
I know.

297
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,252
Min-chan's parents are here, right?

298
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,505
They're outside.
Should I tell them to come in?

299
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,131
No, I'll go talk to them.

300
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,138
-Where are you going?
-I'm following you.

301
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,350
-Why?
-Because you're off to deliver good news.

302
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,768
I need a cheerer-upper.

303
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,603
When will you cheer me up?

304
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,981
You always cheer me up.

305
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,818
I already feel so much better.

306
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,572
Jeez, you always have something to say.
My goodness.

307
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,037
The ultrasound looks good,
and the heartbeat is solid.

308
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,165
Min-chan's body is working hard
to get used to the new heart.

309
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,835
We should be able to move him
to a regular ward tomorrow.

310
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,672
I can't believe this day is finally here.

311
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,010
There are a few things
you need to keep in mind.

312
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,595
I'll go over them with you later.

313
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,850
It's lunchtime. You should have lunch.

314
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,103
Yes, you too. Enjoy your lunch.

315
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,650
We want to treat you to dinner
at the most expensive restaurant,

316
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,071
but we can't do that, right?

317
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,781
That's right. I'll get fired.

318
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,451
Thank you for the offer though.

319
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,412
It's the thought that counts. Talk soon.

320
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,503
-You'll have lunch with me, right?
-Gosh, whatever.

321
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,630
Leave me alone, will you?

322
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,891
About Yoo Gyeong-jin, the violinist.

323
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,059
Did you hear how much she paid us?

324
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,936
I don't care. Mind your own business.

325
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,772
Hey.

326
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,442
Oh, hello!

327
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,485
Yes, hello.

328
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,113
Here for lunch, right? It's on me.

329
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,824
Really? But I have company.

330
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,743
I'll pay for them too. How many?

331
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,412
-Hello.
-Hello.

332
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,085
Thanks. Lunch is on Jun-wan.

333
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,630
-Nice.
-Thank you.

334
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,928
This is the best lunch menu
I've seen here.

335
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,804
This is why I can't eat elsewhere.

336
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,182
Hey, put that down.
Is that the Olympic torch?

337
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,517
It looks too perfect,
like a plastic food model.

338
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,729
It is real.

339
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
Professor Kim, can I get more of this?

340
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,401
Sure, go for it. Eat as much as you want.

341
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,616
Do you not have much of an appetite?

342
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,497
-No.
-I've never seen you eat so little.

343
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,998
You always devour your food.

344
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,043
I can't really eat.
I feel like I'm chewing sand now.

345
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,629
Oh, no. Then give me your drumstick.

346
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,507
No, I'm going to eat this.

347
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,384
You just said you can't really eat.

348
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,885
It feels like chewing sand.

349
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,470
Just the rice, not the chicken.

350
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,390
I was saving it for last.

351
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,268
-Mind your own business.
-That, again?

352
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,571
-Ik-sun loves drumsticks too.
-"Ik-sun"?

353
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,407
-Ik-jun.
-"Ik-sun."

354
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,825
-Ik-jun.
-You said "Ik-sun."

355
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,743
No, Ik-jun! I said Ik-jun!

356
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,581
Let's eat.

357
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,417
Okay.

358
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,344
But there must be someone named "Ik-sun"

359
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,014
somewhere in the world, right?

360
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,059
Yes, probably.

361
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,770
Maybe on the other side of the planet.

362
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,528
Hey, Song-hwa. Speak.

363
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,989
Hey, they're serving drumsticks today.
Hurry!

364
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,867
Really? Darn it. What a bummer.

365
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,286
I have a lunch meeting today.

366
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,621
What's it for? Do you have a conference?

367
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,791
It's an important tteokbokki meeting,
which was scheduled last week.

368
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,168
They're all waiting for me.

369
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,463
I thought you had a conference
or something. Okay.

370
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,424
I'll stop by your office for coffee.
Are you staying late today?

371
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,968
Yes, you should hurry. Enjoy your meal.

372
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,219
Thanks, enjoy your lunch.

373
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,309
All right, let's eat.

374
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,311
This looks delicious.

375
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,606
Try these potatoes too.

376
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,192
Here's a spoon for you.

377
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,741
This one's for me.

378
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,790
Honey, eat before it gets cold.

379
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,957
Okay.

380
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,068
Nice!

381
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,782
Don't tell me you got one for each person.

382
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,408
We don't do that here.

383
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,911
My gosh, what is all this?

384
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,123
Hello.

385
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,541
Is the tteokbokki here already?

386
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,460
Gyeo-ul,
Does Chuchu always order this much?

387
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,005
-Why?
-Min-ha ordered three full servings!.

388
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,007
I can finish one by myself.

389
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,260
I see.

390
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,679
This is half and half.
The original flavor.

391
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,975
That one is quite spicy.

392
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,643
I love spicy food.

393
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,272
Oh, no. Jeong-won can't handle spicy food…

394
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,363
She knows.

395
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,703
Dr. Chu knows. I told her.

396
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,955
She's the only one at Yulje
who knows about it.

397
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,792
I congratulated her for beating God.

398
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,879
That's right! Gyeo-ul beat God.

399
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,260
-What did you get for us?
-The mild flavor.

400
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,096
By the way, didn't you say
you invited one more person?

401
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,931
Yes, I did.

402
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,767
I got it right this time.

403
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,646
Where's this prick?

404
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,778
Hey! Don't you dare barge in here!

405
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,536
Hello.

406
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,705
Hi.

407
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,709
I thought this was the GS Medical Office.

408
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,588
-What are you guys doing here?
-We're eating tteokbokki, obviously.

409
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,883
Have some tteokbokki.
The steamed eggs too.

410
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,510
The steamed eggs are mine.
I'm going to eat all of it.

411
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,889
Well, okay.

412
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,683
It's fine.
That petty jerk can have it all.

413
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,021
-Is this one spicy?
-It's the mild flavor.

414
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,650
-Can you not eat spicy food?
-I can. I like spicy food.

415
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,617
This one's good too.

416
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,827
Dig in.

417
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,586
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

418
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,046
You should have some too.

419
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,506
-Sure.
-Here.

420
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,093
Have some rice balls too.

421
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,346
-You too. Eat up.
-Okay.

422
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,648
-Gyeo-ul.
-Yes?

423
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,326
-Hello.
-You made it.

424
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,787
Hello. Hey, you.

425
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,747
Andrea, what took you so long?

426
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,749
You do all the pediatric surgeries here?

427
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,293
Yes, I actually do.

428
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,544
Right, you do.

429
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,796
It was an exclamation, not a question.

430
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,926
This is pretty spicy.

431
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,553
It's probably too spicy for you.

432
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,517
Gosh, seriously.

433
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,145
How could you do this to me?

434
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,398
Is this how you treat your Cupid?

435
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,777
Hey, where are you?

436
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,238
I'm fine with anything.

437
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,866
Okay, I'll see you there.

438
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,368
Bye! I will starve myself.

439
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,911
Professor Lee.

440
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,332
Was that Song-hwa? Do you want
to take this unopened box of rice balls?

441
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,710
It's okay. I had enough food.
Enjoy your lunch. Bye.

442
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,427
-Professor Kim.
-Thanks.

443
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,101
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week.

444
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,645
-Are you taking his patients?
-Yes, just three.

445
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,440
Including Lee Gyeong-mi?

446
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:34,527
Yes, but I don't even know
if I can say I'm taking her on

447
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,613
because there isn't much
we can do for her.

448
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,450
That's true.

449
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,372
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week,

450
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,208
so Professor Kim Jun-wan will fill in
and look after you.

451
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,338
He's great. You don't need to worry.

452
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,009
He can be curt,
but he cares a lot about his patients.

453
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,969
And he checks in on his patients often.

454
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,809
Oh, you already know that, right?

455
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,148
Aren't you lonely?

456
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,366
Oh, dear.

457
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,871
We'll check in on you often.

458
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,561
Still, she always sends way too much.

459
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,730
I can never finish it.

460
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,067
-I'd hate to throw it out.
-I know.

461
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,778
I tell her to only send a little
but always get a huge box.

462
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,406
It's so heavy
that I can never carry it on my own.

463
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,576
Now, she sends stuff to Sokcho.

464
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,287
Gosh, she sends me way too much food.

465
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,291
My mom's the same way.
I moved to Seoul over 20 years ago,

466
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,418
and we fought a lot about it
at the beginning.

467
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,797
"Mom, please! Don't send me
too much food this time, please!"

468
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,341
But that didn't work. She never listens.

469
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,471
She sends me 50 million perilla leaves
when she's feeling energetic.

470
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,853
What did she send you this time?

471
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,813
Pickled vegetables.

472
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,107
Sounds delicious.

473
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,194
Garlic, chili, and water celery.
One container each.

474
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,157
Gosh, it'll take me forever to finish it.

475
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,201
I might go back to Sokcho tonight.

476
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,077
To eat my pickled vegetables.

477
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,204
Give me some.

478
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,541
Great idea. Take some.
There's no way I can finish it on my own.

479
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,961
Yes, your mom probably sent you extra
so you can share them with friends.

480
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,214
Give me some. Jun-wan and Jeong-won too.

481
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,841
Jeong-won's a good cook,
so it'll make him happy.

482
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,511
Yes, I should do that.

483
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,637
Yes.

484
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,890
On one condition though.

485
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,311
Take my perilla leaves.

486
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,233
I have about 20 million of them at home.
Just take 10 percent.

487
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,070
Okay, I like perilla leaves.

488
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,455
That looks nice.

489
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,960
What do you think of this table lamp?
Isn't it nice?

490
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,837
#MY HUBBY'S THE BEST
#THANK YOU, JAE-HAK

491
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,463
Yes, it's nice.

492
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,841
Why are you looking at a stranger's post?

493
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,009
She's my wife.

494
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,930
My wife posted this.

495
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,182
She bought this lamp today.

496
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,810
Why didn't you tell me it was your wife?

497
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,481
Look at these hashtags.
"My hubby's the best.

498
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,608
Thank you, Jae-hak." See?

499
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,616
Your cup is empty. What are you drinking?

500
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,913
Everyone goes on social media
to look at other people's photos.

501
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,584
I know you're on social media too,
but your account is private.

502
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,712
That's right. I have an account too.

503
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,089
I'm on social media too.

504
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,886
Why are you on it
if you're not even posting anything?

505
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,472
There's nothing. Nothing at all.

506
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,599
I rarely go on.

507
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,311
My girlfriend created the account for me
before she left for the UK.

508
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,730
I only use it
to look at my girlfriend's posts.

509
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,774
Don't just look.
You should post some photos too.

510
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,943
That way, your girlfriend can also see

511
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,947
what you're up to and how you're doing.

512
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,865
We talk every day.

513
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,743
Talking on the phone isn't the same

514
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,746
as sharing your day-to-day life with her.

515
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,416
My day-to-day life? I have no life.

516
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,043
I work and go home, on repeat.

517
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,421
Well, it'd be nice to share that.

518
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,593
You should post some photos
so your girlfriend can see them.

519
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,387
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?

520
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,682
Oh, please. What's there to teach?
I can just take a photo and post it.

521
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,810
Give me your phone for a moment.

522
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,023
Why?

523
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,692
Let's see.

524
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,528
Don't move.

525
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,073
-Hey.
-Nice!

526
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,159
Oh, my! This is a great photo.

527
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,828
You could even use this
as your passport photo.

528
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:37,997
Delete it.

529
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,542
-What should the caption be?
-"Kim Jun-wan"?

530
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,963
Everyone knows that you're Kim Jun-wan.

531
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,673
Then…

532
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,051
"Kim Jun-wan, the Professor
of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Yulje"?

533
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,011
Why would you write your position?

534
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,722
Let's just say…

535
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,559
"This is for my girlfriend."

536
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,021
Forget it. My girlfriend will freak out.

537
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,690
What about the hashtag?

538
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,566
Well…

539
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,402
What's that for?

540
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,864
You want many people to see it, right?

541
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,617
If you post with various hashtags,

542
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,036
your photo can be discovered
by more people.

543
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,956
I don't want other people to see it.

544
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,542
I just want my girlfriend to see it.

545
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,378
Then I won't use any hashtags.

546
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,798
Okay, don't use any.
I just want my girlfriend to see it.

547
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,927
Done.

548
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,933
Let me know if you want to learn more
about social media.

549
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,727
That won't happen.

550
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,397
Just in case though.
If you ever want to learn more,

551
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,232
just come to me and say this.

552
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,737
"Jae-hak, do you have a minute?"

553
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,865
I told you that won't happen.
I'm going to get some rest.

554
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,579
FIRST SELFIE IN A LONG TIME

555
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,997
#THE BEST LATTE EVER

556
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,214
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU GUYS
#SE-GYEONG #DA-SOM #PERFECT IELTS SCORE

557
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:03,976
SET UP A BLIND DATE FOR SE-GYEONG
AND GOT THIS AS A GIFT #THANKS SEGYEONG

558
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,793
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

559
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,173
Hello, did you have a good weekend?

560
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,758
Something's wrong with Eun-ji.

561
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,802
She woke up but can't move her left arm.

562
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,845
What?

563
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,227
You've been doing a lot of surgeries.

564
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,438
Yes, I'm all booked up this week.
You're early.

565
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,150
Yes, I want to have some coffee
before I go in.

566
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,486
Professor Kim, a call for you.
It's Dr. Do Jae-hak.

567
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,116
-What's up?
-We have a bit of an emergency.

568
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,994
-What is it?
-Eun-ji's left-side motor control is poor.

569
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,497
I'd say her arm is at about Grade 2.
Her leg, Grade 3.

570
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,791
-What's her PT?
-Her INR is 2.8.

571
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,669
We can't do an MRI because of the VAD.
Let's do a CT scan.

572
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,796
Call Neurology
and ask them to have a look.

573
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,090
Talk to Eun-ji's mother

574
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,676
and keep me updated.
I'll be there after my surgery.

575
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,764
Thank you.

576
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,646
Do you handle all the VIP surgeries?

577
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,316
Can't the other professors
take care of some?

578
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,776
You can't commute from Sokcho every time.

579
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,905
It's not for every surgery.
It's only once every two weeks.

580
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,740
Thanks for the coffee.

581
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,535
-Are you bribing me?
-No, it's a gift.

582
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,956
I feel so reassured when you're in Seoul.

583
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,126
How's Seok-min?

584
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,173
Haven't you guys made up yet?

585
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,925
No.

586
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,302
Was it a big fight?

587
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,931
I told him I chose Neurosurgery
because I wanted to study the brain

588
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,683
and that I don't understand
how he could give up so easily.

589
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,980
And Seok-min said, "This is why people say
those who have had it easy in life

590
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,483
are inconsiderate."

591
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,450
So it was a big fight.

592
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,534
Yes.

593
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,288
Just call him first.

594
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,874
I did, but we ended up
having another argument.

595
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,085
I haven't seen him for two weeks.

596
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,963
I'm afraid we'd break up at this rate.

597
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,510
Just wait.

598
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,929
Something will come along.

599
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,600
My ex-boyfriend and I fought a lot too.

600
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,646
Every time we fought,
I wanted to patch things up quickly,

601
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,357
so I took time out of my busy schedule
to call and see him,

602
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,150
and have long discussions.

603
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,947
It was exhausting.

604
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:08,619
But there's something
I learned naturally with age.

605
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,374
As long as you both want to make it work

606
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,960
and aren't too far apart,

607
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,420
just wait and see.

608
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,046
Then something will come along.

609
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,343
So many things can happen
even in the span of a day, you know.

610
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,805
Things happen,
whether they're good or bad.

611
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,892
And sometimes, you have to call and
meet up because of something that happens.

612
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,317
He's probably very busy at the moment,

613
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,695
learning new things
and meeting people at his new job.

614
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,322
And you're busy too.

615
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,118
The best thing to do now would be
just keeping busy.

616
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,995
Just focus on your life,

617
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,788
and naturally,

618
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,374
something will come along,

619
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,127
and you'd have to call and see each other.

620
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,758
You're right. Maybe I'll get in trouble
and end up calling him.

621
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,010
It could be the other way around too.

622
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,891
So relationship-wise,
just let nature take its course.

623
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,269
Let's get some work done.
I think I'll be late for my surgery.

624
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,813
I'm sorry, Professor Chae. And thank you.

625
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,819
Looks like we have
all the paperwork we need.

626
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,405
The loan will be issued
as early as this week.

627
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,866
-Thank you.
-Professor Ahn.

628
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,869
We want to give you a small gift
when you find a house you like.

629
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:36,082
The branch manager wants to help out
because it's for a good cause.

630
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,666
My gosh, really?

631
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,128
A gift, on top of taking care
of my loan application so quickly?

632
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,005
I won't decline.

633
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:49,220
By the way, do you not give that doll
to your loan clients?

634
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,222
I even have two savings accounts with you.

635
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,432
Oh, sure. I'll give you one.

636
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,852
Do you have a kid?
I thought you were single.

637
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,354
No, I'm not married yet.

638
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,023
Just give me one.

639
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,276
I'll give you two.
You can give one to your girlfriend.

640
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,862
Thank you.

641
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,449
Kisses.

642
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,911
Hello.

643
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,129
-Hello.
-Hi.

644
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,551
Dolls? What are they for?

645
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,303
How adorable!

646
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,763
What are those little ones?

647
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,598
They're so cute.

648
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,725
My kid would love it.

649
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,312
And I see that you have two.

650
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,899
My kid's birthday is coming up

651
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,527
and my kid loves dolls like that.

652
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,696
I'm just saying. It's very soon.

653
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,322
-Can you…
-Hello?

654
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,117
I'm coming now.

655
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,038
There's an emergency. I have to go.

656
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,123
Okay.

657
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,424
Hey, I'm coming now.

658
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,010
Thankfully, no hemorrhage was detected.

659
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,680
I showed it to the radiologist.

660
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,434
There's no hemorrhage, but we're not sure
whether or not an embolism has occurred.

661
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,937
And Eun-ji has almost fully regained
her motor function.

662
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
Thank goodness, seriously.

663
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,109
How much warfarin did she get?

664
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,903
She got 1ml yesterday.

665
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,071
Give her 1.5ml today,
but it'll take a while,

666
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,448
so give her enoxaparin too.

667
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,159
Eun-ji's mother is very worried.

668
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,830
I did explain to her
that Eun-ji is okay now,

669
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:44,251
but I think you should talk to her.

670
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,003
It'll help her calm down.

671
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,464
Yes, I was going to talk to her anyway.

672
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,132
Thanks. I'm here now.

673
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,639
Blood clots can occur
even if we use blood thinners.

674
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,642
This condition is called a microembolism.

675
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:04,396
I think a tiny blood clot had traveled
to the brain and caused blockage.

676
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,107
Thankfully, the blockage has been cleared.

677
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,444
Then what if we give her
more blood thinners?

678
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,781
I've explained this before,
and we've also experienced it.

679
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,660
Too much blood thinners
can lead to bleeding.

680
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,746
If it happens inside her brain,
it'll be very serious.

681
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:27,127
We kept checking Eun-ji's blood work
and were careful with the blood thinners,

682
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,256
but this still happened,
which means it can happen again.

683
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,513
In a way, it's like having a time bomb
in your chest.

684
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,391
I feel like time's running out.

685
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,603
She should get the surgery
as soon as we find a donor.

686
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,775
Professor Kim.

687
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,698
Every day feels like torture.

688
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,829
My daughter, Eun-ji…

689
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,630
I'm…

690
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,677
beyond exhausted,
and I struggle to get through the day.

691
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,138
When I wake up in the morning,

692
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,016
I anxiously wonder what's going to happen.

693
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,477
My heart races like crazy.

694
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,773
I really can't live like this.

695
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,282
I wonder if we should just give up.

696
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,205
Honey.

697
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,916
You've been doing so well.

698
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,169
You've been staying so strong.

699
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,254
Don't be like this.

700
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,143
I'm sorry, Professor Kim. I apologize.

701
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,561
It's okay.

702
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,691
Ma'am.

703
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,154
You've been doing so well.

704
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,157
Eun-ji is staying strong too.

705
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,995
As long as you don't give up,

706
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,748
we won't be the ones to give up first.

707
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,839
We will find a heart donor for Eun-ji…

708
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,385
and she'll get a transplant.

709
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,554
Please cheer up

710
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,141
and do not give up, okay?

711
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,272
Okay.

712
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,611
Thank you.

713
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,292
Well…

714
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,837
-So we'll sign the lease next week,
-Yes.

715
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,341
and the hospital will take care
of the monthly maintenance costs.

716
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,511
Can we sign the lease next week for sure?

717
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,180
Yes, the loan was approved today.

718
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,265
We'll get the money as early as this week.

719
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,643
Then, let's make a list of the things
we need to buy.

720
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,482
-Did you guys have dinner?
-Yes, we did.

721
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,901
Me too.

722
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,780
A fridge, TV, couch, washer…

723
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,491
We won't need a bed, right?

724
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,994
A bed? Wouldn't it be good
to just get one?

725
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,204
Single beds, right?

726
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,000
Are you guys moving in together?

727
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,878
Yes, we are indeed.

728
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,466
What's going on?
What are you two up to this time?

729
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,515
Jeong-won wants to set up
a patient guardian shelter,

730
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,017
for patients who live far away

731
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,853
and those who visit us
for anticancer therapy or hemodialysis.

732
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,023
He's buying a house near the hospital.

733
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,192
-No, it's a long-term lease.
-That's right.

734
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,027
We'll start with a lease.

735
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,657
Can you run Daddy-Long-Legs
and the shelter with the revenue

736
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,200
from the VIP Ward?

737
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,410
It'll cost quite a bit to manage it.

738
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,289
I cut a deal with Director Ju.

739
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,710
I asked him for his support
on my personal project

740
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,547
in return for me staying here.

741
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,425
He doesn't know about Daddy-Long-Legs,

742
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,388
so I asked him to help me launch my dream.

743
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,808
And this guardian shelter
is the first project?

744
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:33,725
Yes.

745
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,397
I figured that this is what
the patients need the most.

746
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,276
For the other stuff,
we'd have to change our policy,

747
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,528
and it'll take us a while
to tackle the issues.

748
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,739
That's why I want to start
with the patient guardian shelter.

749
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,534
What is your ultimate dream?

750
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,997
A children's hospital.

751
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,123
What?

752
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,544
My ultimate dream is to build
a children's hospital.

753
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,549
I want to build a children's hospital

754
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,509
that offers comprehensive pediatric care.

755
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,928
That will cost a fortune.

756
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,890
It'll cost about 400 billion won.

757
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,225
What?

758
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,435
WOW

759
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,315
You've been fiddling with that
because you thought it was funny?

760
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,733
What did you do?

761
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,984
WOW

762
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,782
-You like his lame jokes.
-It's so funny!

763
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,619
Ahn Jeong-won, you really are something.
One more time!

764
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,703
WOW

765
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,246
Let's do it together.

766
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,456
WOW

767
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,541
-Gosh.
-Hey, your phone.

768
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,460
Oh, it's Gyeo-ul.

769
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,965
-Hey, Gyeo-ul.
-Choi Han-na's lab results looked good,

770
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,968
so we were going to move her
to the regular ward tomorrow.

771
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,430
But she's not eating
and hasn't had any bowel movements.

772
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,391
-Can we do an enema?
-Wait for me. I'm coming now.

773
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,893
You only did a chest PA, right?

774
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,937
Take an abdominal X-ray too. All right.

775
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,232
I have to go. Have a fun meeting.

776
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,486
I'll buy you a housewarming gift
when you sign a lease.

777
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,780
What would be good? A coffee machine?

778
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,949
The bank branch manager
is getting that for us.

779
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,494
Really? Then let me think about it.
I'm off.

780
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,870
Hey, one more time.

781
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,373
Get going already!

782
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,041
OKAY

783
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,961
My goodness.

784
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,757
Don't we need a microwave?

785
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,676
-It'd be good to have one.
-Yes.

786
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,053
She's very alert,

787
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,223
so she's been holding it in intentionally
because she's not used to

788
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,141
having someone help her relieve herself.

789
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,351
I see.

790
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,062
Don't just monitor the physical condition.

791
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,856
Try to observe how the patient
might be feeling too, okay?

792
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,068
Okay, got it. I'm sorry, Professor.

793
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,529
Don't be sorry. Keep up the good work.

794
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,455
Hey, do you want to have coffee with me?

795
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,833
Have you eaten?

796
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,086
I'm not sure.

797
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:17,723
Hey, you've been practically living
in the OR, the ICU, and the PICU.

798
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,392
Try to cut down on surgery
or take in less patients.

799
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,353
Talk to your chief.

800
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,939
I'm the chief.

801
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,780
I always perform surgery,
so I'm used to it.

802
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,242
But a bunch of things are stressing me out
these days.

803
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,535
I have a lot on my mind.

804
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,620
Was the surgery today a difficult one?

805
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,914
No, it went well.

806
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,917
But the patient's heartbeat
was very unstable

807
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,378
after the surgery,

808
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,881
so we had to use the ECMO.

809
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,884
I'm sure the patient will recover soon.

810
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,928
And Eun-ji--

811
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,139
Yes, you told me about her a few times.

812
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,808
The kid who's been hooked up to a VAD
the longest.

813
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,061
That's right. She's been depending
on the VAD for almost five months,

814
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,315
waiting for a heart transplant,
but we can't find a donor for her.

815
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,109
We were careful with the meds,

816
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,528
but she's experienced blood clots
and even bleeding.

817
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,323
We keep running into problems.

818
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,162
I'm worried. She needs a transplant
as soon as possible.

819
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,622
You'll find a donor soon.

820
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,463
And? What else?

821
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,596
It's my father's birthday today.

822
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,517
-Right!
-I only remembered it earlier.

823
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,352
-Call him.
-I already did.

824
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,062
He was asleep though.

825
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,605
Oh, boy.

826
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,609
I didn't even get to wish him
a happy birthday.

827
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,570
Just go home and get some sleep.

828
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,490
I think you're sleep-deprived.

829
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,866
I'm on duty tonight.

830
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,662
-Me too.
-At least I won't be lonely.

831
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,791
I'll stop by later.

832
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,335
Hey, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

833
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,587
I'm not worried.
I just want to eat your snacks.

834
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,257
I saw that you have a lot of new ones.

835
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,515
Let's go. Gosh, it's cold in here.

836
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,228
Yes, let's go.
I feel cold, physically and mentally.

837
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,989
Close it up and take care of the rest.

838
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,199
Check for bleeding even in the ICU.

839
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,201
-Yes, sir.
-Keep it up.

840
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,412
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

841
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,798
Cut the Gelfoam for this size
and pass it over.

842
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:57,924
Yes, sir.

843
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,724
You've been having headaches
and a fever too?

844
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,225
You need to see a doctor.

845
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,977
I did, last week.

846
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,063
I also got a blood test
and a chest X-ray while I was there.

847
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,065
I bet it's that accident.

848
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,817
I took some meds, so I'm okay now.

849
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,486
Are the test results out yet?

850
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,114
No, of course not.
This isn't Korea, you know.

851
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,909
They won't get the results back
until next week.

852
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,494
-Okay.
-You sound a little down today.

853
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,955
Did something happen?
Is your patient not doing well?

854
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,750
No, I'm fine. The patients are fine too.

855
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,085
I'm on duty,
so I was reading a book in my office.

856
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,047
-By the way, that test.
-Yes.

857
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,965
I got the highest score.

858
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,427
Really? Congratulations, seriously.

859
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,262
You said you bombed the test.

860
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,556
I lied. Everyone in my family does that.

861
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,017
My goodness. Congratulations.

862
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,895
The highest score in your class
or in the entire school?

863
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,441
What? Then you deserve
some serious congratulations.

864
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,318
Well done, seriously.

865
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,570
Yes, sure.

866
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:04,407
Oh, hello.

867
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,410
I've heard so much about you.

868
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,372
No, right.

869
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,332
Of course.

870
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,711
I see.

871
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,424
No, I'm not busy at the moment.

872
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,509
Right.

873
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,470
I see.

874
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,834
Sir, I need to talk to you
about something.

875
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,544
Okay, what is it?

876
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,464
We performed a navigation-guided biopsy
on Won Jin-hwan earlier

877
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,842
because we were suspecting
a diffuse astrocytoma.

878
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,263
We just did a CT scan
and detected ICH around the biopsy site.

879
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,143
Professor Min told me
to discuss it with you first.

880
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,520
Considering where the tumor is,

881
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,356
I'm concerned that the biopsy needle

882
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,859
might have touched the MCA distal branch.

883
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,239
I'm not too sure,
but it looked like the needle

884
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,492
had gone in a bit too deep
on the screen in the OR.

885
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,079
Why don't we do a TFCA
and find out the exact location?

886
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,582
It's unlikely that you guys poked it
with the needle.

887
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,419
No way. What are the chances?

888
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,212
Right.

889
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,633
A tumor biopsy can cause bleeding,
so just monitor the patient for now.

890
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,554
We'll wait a bit

891
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,599
before we take another angiogram
and check, okay?

892
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,270
His right pupil is dilated
to about 0.4 now.

893
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,813
That's okay.

894
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,815
Oh, I see.

895
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,695
I'm going to get some sleep
in the on-call room.

896
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:06,988
Take it easy.

897
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,073
Thank you.

898
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,712
Hey, good timing.

899
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,299
Jae-hak, do you have a minute?

900
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,013
Let's go.

901
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,524
So you want to post a photo?

902
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,651
No, just a caption.

903
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,153
You can't do that.

904
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,617
You can't post a caption on its own.

905
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,453
Just post whatever photo you have
and write the caption here.

906
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,579
What about a hashtag?

907
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,916
You want to use a hashtag?
I like that attitude.

908
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,711
Here, press the pound sign
and list the related words.

909
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,840
Does that mean my photo will come up
if people look up those words?

910
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:11,094
Yes! The more hashtags you use,
the more people it'll reach.

911
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,763
But first,
you need to make your profile public.

912
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,978
All right, let me give this a shot.

913
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,507
Mr. Won, can you try lifting
your right arm?

914
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,346
Now, your left arm.

915
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,154
CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE

916
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,157
You should have called me.

917
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,867
I did, just now.

918
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,076
Really?

919
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,537
Why? What's up?

920
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:24,667
I think patient Won Jin-hwan has a bleed
in the MCA distal branch.

921
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,837
His motor function is lower
on the left side, at Grade 3.

922
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,756
Can't we do a CT scan?

923
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,966
We did one not long ago.

924
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,969
How do you know
if the bleeding is caused by a tear

925
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,972
in the MCA distal branch
or something else?

926
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,808
If an artery in the distal branch
is ruptured,

927
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,102
the bleeding will continue.

928
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,523
Then can we do a CT angiogram
along with the CT scan later?

929
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,108
He can obey commands, right?

930
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,693
Right?

931
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,655
He can raise his hands and blink.

932
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,615
Yes.

933
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,827
Let's wait and see.
Continue to monitor him carefully.

934
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,165
We'll do a CT angiogram
if he seems to get worse.

935
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,835
We'll do it
and check how bad the bleeding is,

936
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,796
then call Professor Min, okay?

937
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,675
And Dr. Heo,

938
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,262
we shouldn't be so quick
to open up the head.

939
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,851
The biopsy probably caused minor bleeding.

940
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,021
It'll stop soon.

941
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,067
Let's give him mannitol
and see how it goes.

942
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,778
Okay? Do you understand?

943
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,405
Yes, sir.

944
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,240
Good.

945
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,088
Hi, sister! How's it going?

946
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,049
Hey, you. How's everything? How's U-ju?

947
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,551
U-ju's doing great.

948
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,845
You don't look so well.

949
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,722
I'm just tired from all the studying.

950
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,267
Looks like you're still at work.
Are you on duty too?

951
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,645
I sure am. Wait, you know someone else
who's on duty tonight?

952
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,106
Oh, my friend.

953
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:13,067
My roommate also has a night shift today.

954
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,237
How's everyone? How's Song-hwa doing?

955
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,739
Song-hwa is doing great.

956
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,450
Are Jeong-won and Seok-hyeong
doing well too?

957
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,995
Everyone's well. Since when
did you care so much about my friends?

958
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,789
They're all doing great.
Just take care of yourself.

959
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,499
Is everything well with you?

960
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,043
Yes, I'm happy and healthy.

961
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:35,298
Right, how's Jun-wan?
Professor Kim is doing well too, right?

962
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,551
No, not really.

963
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,139
He's stressed out.
Too many surgeries. He's overworked.

964
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,392
I've never seen him so stressed out.

965
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,977
Did something happen to him?

966
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,981
No, but it seems like
a bunch of things are stressing him out.

967
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,818
And I think his girlfriend is adding
to his stress.

968
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,780
Looks like his girlfriend
is quite selfish.

969
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,826
I see, his girlfriend…
Why do you think that?

970
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,703
I don't really know much,

971
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,581
but I think she's very inconsiderate.

972
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:12,627
She's self-centered. Jun-wan is
under a lot of stress these days,

973
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,881
but he's so busy walking on eggshells
around her that he can't even vent.

974
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,592
Sounds like she's always busy
talking about herself.

975
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,886
Hey, I'm running late
for my study session.

976
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,973
All right. Watch out for cars
and don't skip breakfast.

977
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,434
Call me right away
if you run out of money, okay?

978
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,938
All right. You take care of yourself too.

979
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,148
-Bye.
-Bye.

980
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,316
-You checked in on him five minutes ago.
-Has it already been five minutes?

981
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,664
Mr. Won Jin-hwan.

982
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,957
Mr. Won!

983
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,634
Patient Won Jin-hwan's right pupil
has dilated further. It's 0.6 now.

984
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,095
Mental status, stupor.
And the left-side motor is worse.

985
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,597
I'm calling Professor Min now.

986
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,474
Hey, hang on. I'm coming now.

987
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,142
We don't have time!

988
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:54,771
If something bad happens to the patient,
will you take responsibility for it?

989
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,233
I'll order a CT scan right away
and call Professor Min.

990
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,112
-Please get ready for intubation.
-Okay.

991
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,033
Is the BP okay?

992
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,494
Yes, it's 140 over 80.

993
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,120
We need to open him up now. Focus.

994
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,663
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

995
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,332
Have you been monitoring him carefully?

996
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,667
Yes, we checked in on him
every ten minutes.

997
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,711
As soon as we confirmed his mental status,

998
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,215
we checked the bleeding
with a CT scan and called you.

999
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,513
If anything bad happens to this patient,

1000
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,640
it's all on you guys.

1001
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,308
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1002
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,067
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1003
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,207
Dr. Heo.

1004
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,211
Get some sleep.
That bed over there is available now.

1005
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,213
Take a nap. I'll wake you up.

1006
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,799
It's okay. I can just doze off here.

1007
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,801
I'm good at sleeping while seated.

1008
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,265
-It's not morning yet, is it?
-The sun is about to rise.

1009
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,687
The fellow must have given you an earful.

1010
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,231
I haven't seen him since the surgery.

1011
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,151
If he does, I'll listen.
I was too rude to him.

1012
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,823
Just let it go in one ear
and out the other.

1013
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,369
We were able to operate
on the patient right away

1014
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,454
because you kept monitoring his condition.

1015
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,248
And the surgery went well.

1016
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,959
I'm on your side.

1017
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,963
Thank you. I'll take you out for a drink
when we can move Mr. Won

1018
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,340
to a regular ward once he's stabilized.

1019
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,385
-Sure, I'll be looking forward to it.
-All right.

1020
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,135
I heard too.

1021
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,555
Everyone at the hospital knows.

1022
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,432
I'm sorry.

1023
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,560
How's the patient?

1024
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,729
I checked in on him again just now.

1025
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,731
His pupil size is normal now.

1026
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:47,652
His left-side motor function is still low,
but he's better overall,

1027
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,987
so I think
he'll regain consciousness soon.

1028
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,199
When you were informing the fellow,

1029
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,410
what was the patient's
neurological assessment like?

1030
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,579
Was he exhibiting
any neurological symptoms?

1031
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,832
He was able to obey commands
when we moved him to the ICU.

1032
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,419
But his right pupil was slightly dilated,

1033
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,631
and his left-side motor function
was significantly reduced

1034
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,801
compared to the right side's
even considering the anesthesia.

1035
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,011
Then within an hour or so,

1036
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:17,556
his mental status dropped to stupor,
and his pupils opened up.

1037
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,934
It's good that you questioned
the fellow's opinion.

1038
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,228
But…

1039
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,149
other than that, you are at fault.

1040
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,693
It was your fault.

1041
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:33,030
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have been so rude to him.

1042
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,534
I will politely apologize to the fellow.

1043
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,161
I didn't mean to argue with him.

1044
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,998
I raised my voice
without even realizing it.

1045
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,082
I'm sorry.

1046
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:44,834
No.

1047
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,923
You should have fought him earlier.

1048
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,885
You should have pushed ahead with
your decision if you believed so.

1049
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,097
You've been closely monitoring
the patient.

1050
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,725
That means you know best
when it comes to that patient.

1051
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,395
So you should have trusted your judgment
and fought for it.

1052
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,859
Had anything bad happened to him,

1053
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,736
it would have been all on you.

1054
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,448
His condition worsened
because you wasted time

1055
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,450
being hesitant and indecisive.

1056
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,164
You've been working hard
to study the case and monitor him,

1057
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,874
so fight hard.

1058
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,129
That is the only way…

1059
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,757
you can save your patients.

1060
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:48,189
The nurses will go over how to take care
of the wound to minimize scarring.

1061
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,233
I'll see you again in a month.

1062
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,485
Keep it up.

1063
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,236
Will do. Thank you, Doctor.

1064
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,367
-Was that my last appointment?
-Yes, well done.

1065
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,869
Thank you.

1066
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,712
Hey, isn't it still early there?
Did you stay up all night?

1067
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,380
Can you talk now?

1068
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,051
Yes, I just finished my last appointment.
What's up?

1069
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,596
When you're in your office…

1070
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:24,558
Go to your office and call me.
I'll wait for your call.

1071
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,897
Sure, okay. I'll call you right back.

1072
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,205
Hey, I'm in my office now.
What's going on?

1073
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,624
Well…

1074
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:56,006
Ik-sun. Something's happened, right?

1075
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,469
I've fallen for someone else.

1076
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,059
I'm sorry.

1077
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,236
What do you mean?

1078
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,947
I'm sorry.

1079
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,496
Is it Se-gyeong?

1080
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,272
I'm sorry, Jun-wan. I have to go.

1081
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,713
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1082
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,881
Where's Jun-wan?

1083
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,050
He doesn't feel like eating.

1084
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,803
Is something up with Jun-wan?

1085
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,472
He's lost so much weight.

1086
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,557
Could he have broken up
with his girlfriend?

1087
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,854
I don't know everything about Jun-wan.
Do you guys know what's going on?

1088
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,607
You should know
because you two live together.

1089
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,442
Still, I don't know everything.

1090
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:42,696
Jeong-won, it's about time
you got your own place.

1091
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,991
I mean, Yulje pays you.
Can't you afford to rent an apartment?

1092
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,203
Of course,
I can definitely afford to do that.

1093
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:52,539
Guys, I've told Jun-wan multiple times
that I want to move out.

1094
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,708
-And?
-But the thing is…

1095
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:59,213
he looks so sad every time I say that.

1096
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,049
Jun-wan gets lonely very easily.

1097
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:03,300
Totally.

1098
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,177
-Really?
-Yes.

1099
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,472
I told him I'd move out
even when we were moving two years ago.

1100
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:09,890
Did his eyes well with tears?

1101
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,935
I had never seen anyone
with such sad eyes.

1102
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,731
He gets lonely so easily.

1103
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,945
I'm not mooching off him.
He's just not letting me go.

1104
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,572
We know that.
Jun-wan can never live alone.

1105
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,910
He may look tough on the outside
but is soft on the inside.

1106
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,581
-You mean, he's a paper tiger?
-Bingo.

1107
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,054
AHN JEONG-WON

1108
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,615
Hurry. The sun will set soon.

1109
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,371
-Are you a scarecrow?
-Does it look bad?

1110
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:17,124
-Are you wearing it to look nice?
-No, to block UV rays.

1111
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,959
-Okay.
-Should I keep it on or not?

1112
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,046
-It looks ugly.
-You little…

1113
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,173
Who cares?
I'm wearing it to protect my face.

1114
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:25,507
Does it have to look nice?

1115
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,176
No, as long as it blocks the sun.

1116
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,302
Then I'll keep it on.

1117
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:34,767
I look like a scarecrow, don't I?
Is this ugly?

1118
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,145
No, it's pretty. You look pretty.

1119
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,108
The prettiest scarecrow I've ever seen.

1120
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:44,610
Hey!

1121
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,613
Come on, let's go. The sun will set soon.

1122
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,490
-Yes, we should hurry.
-Okay.

1123
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,750
Mugwort is already out
all along the hiking trail.

1124
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,502
Yes, they sprouted a while ago.

1125
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,587
Do you want mugwort soup? Shall I make it?

1126
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,255
-Mugwort soup?
-Yes.

1127
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:08,175
Mugwort soup

1128
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:12,596
-Mugwort soup
-Mugwort soup

1129
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,349
-Mugwort soup
-Nice!

1130
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,395
-Mugwort soup
-Oh, dear.

1131
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,688
Mugwort soup sounds great.

1132
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,317
This is my favorite time of day.

1133
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,777
When the sun is about to set.

1134
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,862
It'd be even better if it was raining now.

1135
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:32,408
Totally.
Hey, does U-ju like rainy days too?

1136
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,617
No.

1137
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,912
There's only one thing in the world
that he likes.

1138
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:39,039
-His dad?
-No, his girlfriend.

1139
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:43,544
He's head over heels for his girlfriend.
They're so in love.

1140
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,129
My gosh, U-ju has a girlfriend?

1141
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:48,590
Yes, they've been going out for a while.
Her name is Mo-ne.

1142
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,176
"Mo-ne"? That's a pretty name.

1143
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,512
She is Hong-do and Yun-bok's cousin.

1144
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:55,931
Yun-bok and Hong-do at Yulje?

1145
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,642
That's right. Our Hong-do and Yun-bok.

1146
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:00,936
-You didn't know?
-Of course, I had no idea.

1147
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,521
What a coincidence.

1148
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:08,193
By the way, don't Hong-do and Yun-bok
remind you of us in the old days?

1149
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,741
I think I was smarter than Hong-do.

1150
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,661
Right, maybe.

1151
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,955
But you were such a loser.

1152
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,958
-Hey, what are you talking about?
-What?

1153
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,294
Come on. I was a fashionista,

1154
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,713
-the most stylish guy in Changwon.
-Sure, sure.

1155
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:35,888
You're probably better now than before

1156
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,057
-What is this song?
-You have fulfilled

1157
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:44,771
This void in my heart

1158
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:51,987
I used to feel so lonely
In this beautiful world

1159
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,780
No way. Is this "Couple"?

1160
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:57,367
And wander around
Looking for my other half

1161
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,458
What took you so long to find me

1162
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:12,090
Drowning in my loneliness?

1163
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,681
I love you

1164
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:26,772
Now, you can spend every moment with me

1165
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,357
Finished. Well done.

1166
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:53,799
-Are you done?
-Yes.

1167
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,008
-You're done now?
-Yes.

1168
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,219
-Then shall we?
-Let's go.

1169
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:59,680
Well done.

1170
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:04,810
This is nice.

1171
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,854
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1172
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:33,088
-Yes, hello?
-Professor Kim, we have a donor.

1173
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,340
-We've found a suitable donor for Eun-ji.
-What?

1174
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,634
KONOS just called,
asking if we need the heart.

1175
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,721
But Jae-an Medical Center
had priority over us.

1176
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:42,556
They don't need it.

1177
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,309
They declined
because the patient has an infection.

1178
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,060
How much does the donor weigh?

1179
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:49,229
Well, he weighs 40kg.

1180
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,399
A 11-year-old boy. His weight is 40kg.

1181
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,735
Should we accept the heart?

1182
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,570
Yes. We'll get it, no matter what.

1183
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:58,530
This could be Eun-ji's only chance.

1184
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,949
-Okay, we'll get ready.
-Okay.

1185
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,252
-Hello, sir!
-We've found a donor for Eun-ji.

1186
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:13,879
-Where are you?
-Seriously?

1187
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,423
Finally! Eun-ji can live!
We can save Eun-ji!

1188
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:18,967
-I'm in the on-call room now.
-Where is her mother?

1189
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:22,554
Probably in the hallway
in front of the PICU. She's always there.

1190
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,682
Okay. Get Eun-ji off warfarin immediately
and get ready for surgery.

1191
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:26,683
Got it!

1192
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,327
Ma'am.

1193
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,454
Professor Kim.

1194
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,956
You're still here?

1195
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,167
I don't think I can go home tonight.

1196
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,961
-Why not? Are you on duty again?
-No.

1197
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,840
I have to perform
Eun-ji's heart transplant.

1198
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:03,095
There's a donor.

1199
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,347
We're getting the heart.

1200
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:13,814
We're waiting for the second brain death
assessment. The first one is done.

1201
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:17,067
Eun-ji will get the heart
if there are no major issues.

1202
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,657
You've waited so long for this.

1203
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,910
Many things happened
in the past five months

1204
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,371
since she got the VAD,

1205
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,833
but thanks to your resilience
and patience,

1206
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,043
this day has finally come.

1207
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,087
Professor Kim.

1208
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:40,632
This really isn't a dream, right?

1209
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:43,677
Is Eun-ji really getting the heart?

1210
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:47,723
Yes, Eun-ji is getting it.

1211
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:08,285
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1212
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,717
What are these flowers for?

1213
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,223
I found them at home.

1214
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:32,934
I see.

1215
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:37,230
Are you all right?

1216
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,151
Yes, I'm fine.

1217
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,739
You did the right thing.
You did nothing wrong.

1218
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,700
What's wrong with yelling
at a senior colleague?

1219
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,869
Well done. Don't be discouraged.

1220
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:55,373
Did you come all the way here this late
to say that?

1221
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,128
No.

1222
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,674
I'm sorry.

1223
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,010
I was out of line.

1224
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,848
I know you said it because you care.

1225
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,480
I guess I'm just insecure.

1226
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:20,649
I'm sorry.

1227
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,203
Do you know what that flower symbolizes?

1228
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,164
No, what?

1229
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:40,919
Forgiveness and reconciliation.

1230
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,466
How do you know that?

1231
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,011
Your parents must really own
a flower shop.

1232
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:54,808
We have tulips in every color.

1233
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:57,811
Just tell me what you like.
I can bring any flower you want.

1234
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:02,691
Aren't you hungry?

1235
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:06,444
The gimbap place is still open…
Right, you're on duty.

1236
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,406
I'll go pick some up. Just stay here.

1237
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:40,770
Because she's been hooked up
to the VAD for a while,

1238
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,856
the adhesion will be pretty severe,

1239
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:45,483
so it'll take us a while
to dissect the adhesion.

1240
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,111
The heart might be a bit too big,

1241
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:50,822
so she may leave the OR
with the chest open.

1242
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,200
But you know…

1243
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:56,953
no matter what happens,

1244
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,873
I want to save Eun-ji today.

1245
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:07,631
The two of you and Eun-ji endured so much
for today.

1246
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:11,843
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1247
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,555
I don't want to be the one to ruin it.

1248
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,604
I will do my best.

1249
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,440
I will save Eun-ji.

1250
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:47,420
SURGERY PATIENT FAMILY
WAITING ROOM

1251
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:38,972
I'm…

1252
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,058
so happy for you.

1253
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,604
Congratulations,
from the bottom of my heart.

1254
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:49,691
Thank you.

1255
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:53,069
The surgery will go well,

1256
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:55,864
so don't worry about a thing.

1257
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,452
Thank you.

1258
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,414
My goodness.

1259
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,792
Oh, dear.

1260
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,561
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1261
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,413
Are you not feeling well?
You look like you've lost a lot of weight.

1262
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,707
No, I'm totally fine.

1263
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:53,171
-Hello.
-Hello.

1264
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,632
Hey! It's been a while, Professor Kim.

1265
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,551
Can you spare me a moment?

1266
01:24:58,635 --> 01:24:59,928
Sure.

1267
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,600
SISTER

1268
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:09,604
Hey, what's up? You rarely call me first.

1269
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:11,439
Ik-jun.

1270
01:25:13,316 --> 01:25:14,317
Are you okay?

1271
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:16,569
I wasn't feeling well last week,

1272
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,156
so I went to see a doctor
and got some tests done.

1273
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,493
I just found out
my liver somatic index is over 300.

1274
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:29,415
The doctor said it's over 300,
and my bile ducts look a bit swollen.

1275
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,626
What should I do?

1276
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:33,294
Come home at once.

1277
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,799
You know this is serious, right?

1278
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:46,683
My gosh. Don't cry, Ik-sun. It's okay.

1279
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:49,519
I'm going to fix it,
so don't worry about a thing.

1280
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:50,895
Come home immediately.

1281
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,898
I'll send you money for your flight…
Actually, no.

1282
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:58,611
I'll book your flight for you,
so come home tomorrow, okay?

1283
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:02,657
All right, but…

1284
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,785
make sure you keep this to yourself.

1285
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,620
I don't want anyone to find out.

1286
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,541
Is that important now?
You may need a transplant.

1287
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:13,960
Just don't tell anyone.

1288
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,340
All right.
For now, let's focus on treating you.

1289
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,051
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it to myself.

1290
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,803
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

1291
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,889
-Okay, I won't.
-And…

1292
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,892
Jun-wan too.

1293
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,152
Don't tell Jun-wan, no matter what.

1294
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,029
Okay?

1295
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:32,747
Let's now forget

1296
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:37,669
We must forget

1297
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:45,218
The day we prayed on our knees
In the empty cathedral

1298
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,553
Let's forget it now

1299
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:52,433
Let's now forget

1300
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,522
We must forget

1301
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:04,946
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gifts to you

1302
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,490
Let's forget it now

1303
01:28:08,574 --> 01:28:15,373
The day we prayed on our knees
In the empty cathedral

1304
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,583
Let's forget it now

1305
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:25,383
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gifts to you

1306
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,469
Let's forget it now

1307
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:35,310
The night I got drunk
And confessed my feelings for you

1308
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,478
Let's forget it now

1309
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:45,153
Walking together on the snowy day
It felt like a romantic movie scene

1310
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,364
We must forget it now

1311
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:11,804
-Hello. I'm your hallucination.
-Let's now forget

1312
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:16,726
We must forget

1313
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:23,775
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gift to you

1314
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:31,366
Let's now forget

1315
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:36,496
We must forget

1316
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:44,003
The night I got drunk
And confessed my feelings for you

1317
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:51,219
Let's now forget

1318
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,265
Let's now forget

1319
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,640
Patient Lee Gyeong-mi has a visitor today.

1320
01:30:37,723 --> 01:30:41,769
She's been getting visitors twice a day,
one at a time since yesterday.

1321
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:45,690
You didn't know?

1322
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,861
The social media post looking
for volunteers to keep her company.

1323
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,195
Who posted it?

1324
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,201
Here, look.

1325
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:05,918
THIS IS PROFESSOR KIM JUN-WAN
OF YULJE MEDICAL CENTER…

1326
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:12,508
Professor Kim posted it
using his social media account.

1327
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,720
Of course, we talked to Ms. Lee about it
in advance.

1328
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:20,016
She's so happy.
She said she doesn't feel lonely anymore.

1329
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:23,853
Gosh, why hadn't I thought of that?

1330
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,230
So many people have applied.

1331
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,901
The social services team is going through
the list to arrange everything.

1332
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,863
Professor Kim is really…

1333
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:34,947
I really…

1334
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,909
can't figure him out.

1335
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,815
Let's now forget

1336
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:15,655
We must forget

1337
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:24,747
Next song.

1338
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:27,768
Tell us, Song-hwa.

1339
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,062
Why did you call us here
in the middle of the day?

1340
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,898
I'm going to take a break.

1341
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,358
I need to recharge myself.

1342
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:35,818
Aren't you coming to Seoul anymore?

1343
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:37,778
Forget that I exist, okay?

1344
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,488
Professor. I have a question.

1345
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:41,324
Why am I like this?

1346
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:44,618
I think of running away the moment
I'm faced with hardship.

1347
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,203
Why bring your son into this?

1348
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,373
Don't meddle in his life again
and make things harder for him.

1349
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,959
I have no regrets left in life.

1350
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,337
You've only just turned 70,
how could you say that?

1351
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:57,965
We can see the ocean and go for a drive.

1352
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,468
-We'll spend a few days like that.
-Do you think we'll ever get to?

1353
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:01,927
Why? Are you going somewhere?

1354
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,220
You should promise me, too.

1355
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,347
What is this?

1356
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,558
-Why aren't you asleep?
-I'm going to.

1357
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:09,268
I can't seem to sleep.

1358
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,687
-I can still have dinner with you.
-What about Gyeo-ul?

1359
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:16,400
Is there something
you should be telling me?

1360
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:20,029
I can't promise you I won't do it again.

1361
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,322
Can't you trust us?

1362
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:22,782
I was just asking.

1363
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:26,702
Tell me if anything
ever happens to Gyeo-ul.

1364
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:32,583
