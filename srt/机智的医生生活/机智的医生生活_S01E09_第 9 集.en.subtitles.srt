1
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,559
Why won't you do the surgery?

2
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,519
Please get her the surgery now!

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,896
Let's give it more time, sir.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,567
And you can't undergo surgery yourself
in that condition, sir.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,987
I'm her father,
and I said I want to donate my liver.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,864
Who are you to stop me?

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,324
It's my decision and I want to save her
with my liver!

8
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,286
We have the same blood types.

9
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,496
And she's my daughter. What's the problem?

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,206
Get her the surgery now.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,208
I want the surgery right now!

12
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,503
Listen. If my daughter dies
because we wasted our time,

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,464
will you take responsibility for it?

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,174
Will you?

15
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,468
Sir, I've explained it to you before.

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,635
Even if you're her family,

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,847
it's not that easy to proceed
with transplant surgery.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,224
And you're not at a young age.

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,269
On top of that,
you're not that healthy, either.

20
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,272
Sir, would you like to have
some coffee with me?

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,400
-Okay.
-Calm down. This way.

22
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,574
Sir, I'll be honest.

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,120
You're quite old,

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,207
so if I were to follow the rules,
you don't qualify to get a surgery.

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,251
But we ran the tests
for the worst-case scenario.

26
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,004
Luckily, everything seemed to be fine
except for one area.

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,089
You have a fatty liver.

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,384
Usually, in these cases,
the donor must lose weight

29
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,136
to get rid of fat in the liver.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,765
But given your age, this won't be easy.

31
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,102
Sir, why don't we wait
for a brain-dead patient a bit longer?

32
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,857
There's something called a MELD score.

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,901
This number determines
who gets the liver first.

34
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,111
And her number is considered pretty high.

35
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,822
Given her score now,

36
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,658
I think we can afford to wait a few more
days to make our decision.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,121
Does my daughter have a high score?

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,748
Yes.

39
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,960
It's at 36. It's pretty high.

40
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,172
But to be honest,
her score has to be 39 or 40

41
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,508
to receive a liver
from a brain-dead patient,

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,218
so it won't guarantee her a liver.

43
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,100
Let's wait a few more days.

44
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,853
If your daughter's condition
becomes critical,

45
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,897
I'll make a decision, then.
So let's be a bit more patient, sir.

46
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,732
Yes, please.

47
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,697
It's time for her meal now.

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,449
She must be waiting for you.
Please go and enjoy lunch with her.

49
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,829
Okay. Thank you.

50
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,059
Hey. She's wearing hair rollers.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,728
That's nothing new.

52
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,438
Do you see the freckles there?

53
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,982
I didn't know
So-mi had that many freckles.

54
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,067
Bring her here.
A laser treatment will remove them.

55
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,236
She's wearing makeup. The freckle makeup.

56
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,031
-Why?
-I don't know.

57
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,908
Why not? She's your daughter.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,995
-Do you always understand U-ju?
-Right. No.

59
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,375
I think U-ju is going
through the sock phase these days.

60
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,920
It takes him about 30 minutes
to pick a pair of socks.

61
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,256
Right. I subscribed to So-mi's channel.

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,092
She's the number one teenage YouTuber
when it comes to cosmetic videos.

63
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,012
Seriously. Even I wanted
to try a few of her videos.

64
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,014
Forty, okay?

65
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,684
What? What's wrong with my age?
Men still want to doll up at 40.

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,562
I mean, my daughter weighs 40kg.

67
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,563
I see.

68
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,690
I think she weighs less than that.

69
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,318
My gosh.
She still hasn't had her first period.

70
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,862
She still hasn't?
But she's in eighth grade.

71
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,113
That is a bit late.

72
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,824
I wanted to take her to a clinic,
but she won't listen.

73
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,037
What about your lunch?
You're not going to have lunch?

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,415
I'm meeting up with the others
in the cafeteria. Join us.

75
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,168
I have somewhere to be.

76
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,087
I have a shift from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m.

77
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,964
What shift?

78
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,591
Well...

79
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,846
You have outpatients now, right?

80
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,808
If I stayed ten minutes longer,
I probably had to marry Seok-hyeong.

81
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,476
-Bye.
-Bye.

82
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,813
Ma'am!

83
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,942
Did you hear
that Seok-hyeong is going to adopt me?

84
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,862
Seok-hyeong promised to give me his house,
TV, and the recliner chair.

85
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,543
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

86
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,465
It's 100 over 70.

87
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,175
It's good.

88
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,969
Really? Thank you.

89
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,387
Did you have dinner?

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,848
-I'll need to go home after my shift.
-I see.

91
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,224
What about you?

92
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,184
Later, I'm going to have...

93
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,186
Mom, I'm back!

94
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,688
You're back.

95
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,401
Hello.

96
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,445
Hello.

97
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,116
Did you bring the humidifier?

98
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,078
Jun-wan brought it this morning.

99
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,331
And he stopped by to fill it up
this afternoon, too.

100
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,834
He didn't look like the considerate type,
but he is.

101
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,253
You can tell he's considerate
just by his looks.

102
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,090
Mom, he's a bit perverted like Jeong-won.

103
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,470
Ma'am, aren't you sick
of eating hospital food?

104
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,598
How about beef bone soup?
I'll sneak it in here from the cafeteria.

105
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,767
I'm all right.

106
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,477
You guys should go out and have some food.

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,103
Call the others, too.

108
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,980
I'm not leaving.

109
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,858
I'm going to stay next to you
for 24 hours starting today.

110
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,568
Don't you need to work?

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,029
I'm fine now.

112
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,990
But what caused arrhythmia
all of a sudden?

113
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,744
We couldn't even find out what caused it
from the electrophysiology study.

114
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,872
This is making me really anxious.

115
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,791
It's because I'm old.

116
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,418
When you get old,
your body starts failing one at a time.

117
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,296
Go out and get some food now.

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,340
Ma'am, I'll get you beef bone soup.

119
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,425
I think a warm bowl of soup
will help you recover.

120
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,097
I'll stay with her now.

121
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,807
I bet you stayed at the hospital all day.

122
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,059
Go outside and get some air.

123
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,979
You must've been startled, Seok-hyeong.

124
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,941
Yes. Are you coming from Yangpyeong?

125
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,110
Yes. I made Jong-su drive.

126
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,029
I made your mom's favorite,
pumpkin porridge and beef bone soup.

127
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,532
I didn't make a lot, so you should
get some food outside. Go.

128
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,075
Yes, Seok-hyeong.

129
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,536
Treat your friends to some meat.

130
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,329
That will help me feel better.

131
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,873
Jeong-won, leave with Seok-hyeong.

132
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,127
He's been staying inside the hospital
for three straight days.

133
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,964
But are they available?

134
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,298
Yes.

135
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,260
I just typed in "meat",
and they are all coming.

136
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,357
Would you like to order?

137
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,483
Who's buying today?

138
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,985
-Your dad.
-Nice.

139
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,319
Two of the most expensive sets.

140
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,822
Give us two special sets, please.

141
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,115
-Mushroom set, too.
-Okay.

142
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,908
And a set of homemade sausages, too.

143
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,161
That's too much.
One half dried pollack naengmyeon.

144
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,496
Hey, order noodles after eating the meat.

145
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,497
It's my preference.

146
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,959
My goodness. You guys would
never turn down a free meal.

147
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,836
Two of pork kimchi stew, please.

148
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,588
One for each table. Thank you.

149
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,839
-Okay.
-Right.

150
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,883
It's spicy,
so give us two pots of steamed eggs.

151
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,446
You guys can talk.

152
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,699
Can I eat this now?

153
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,326
-What?
-Song-hwa, that's beef!

154
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,619
-You can't.
-Is that tuna?

155
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,621
-That's pork.
-Why don't you eat it raw?

156
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,955
Is that pork tartare?

157
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,809
No one is going to steal your food.
That's all yours.

158
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,978
You'll eat all of them, so slow down.

159
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,939
I have three older brothers.

160
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,815
Yes, your brothers are all bony.

161
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,028
Seok-hyeong, I heard
your mother decided to divorce him.

162
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,239
-Yes.
-Really? That's great news.

163
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,616
She'll finally be able to live her life.

164
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,451
She decided to divorce him.

165
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,621
I cried and begged her on my knees
to divorce him.

166
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,457
I said we should be happy
even if we just had one day left to live.

167
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,459
-Good job.
-That must've been hard.

168
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,253
My goodness, well done.

169
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,713
She might say that now.

170
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,633
But what if she gets angry one day
and says she won't divorce him?

171
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,261
We already filed the divorce papers
through her lawyer yesterday.

172
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,639
Chairman Yang was probably
surprised and happy to see it,

173
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,015
so he filed the paperwork today.

174
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,519
The mandatory waiting period
is four weeks, so just one more month.

175
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,814
In one month, this will all be over.

176
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,485
But when my mom told me
that she would divorce him...

177
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
Now that she's finally divorcing him,

178
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,199
it felt so freaking nice.

179
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,370
It's different from when you got yours,
right?

180
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,081
Of course. When I got divorced,
I was really heartbroken.

181
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,792
-You weren't?
-I wasn't.

182
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,085
Not even in the slightest.

183
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,214
I only thought about
how I could have a happy life with U-ju.

184
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,508
Don't tell me
you're still not over Sin-hye.

185
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,469
Come on. Do you think I'm mad?
No, that's not it.

186
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,389
I'm over her. I got over her,

187
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:04,312
but deep down, a part of me
always feels sorry to her.

188
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,689
-You're not over her.
-No, I'm already over her.

189
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,566
And it's more like a connection, not love.

190
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,736
I feel sorry and heartbroken.
It's something like that.

191
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,321
-What is that?
-I don't know.

192
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,574
Goodness, you know nothing about love.

193
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,243
Just eat up, you kids.

194
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,496
It's a shame you won't get the company.
When your father passes away,

195
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,708
all of his assets will go
to that woman and her child.

196
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,585
Taegeon Apparel isn't a listed company.

197
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,587
And his father owns
most of the shares, right?

198
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,839
But I think he can claim
a part of his assets legally.

199
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,258
I don't need his money.
I won't accept it even if he offers.

200
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,427
Exactly. Money isn't the problem now.

201
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,220
-No way.
-No way.

202
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,389
You're so annoying.

203
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,352
Seok-hyeong, listen to me carefully. Okay?

204
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,938
Don't talk such nonsense like
you won't accept the money or whatnot.

205
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,441
Just take it no matter what.

206
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,859
Take it and give it to us.

207
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,569
Okay.

208
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,489
I'll get the money
and give it to you guys.

209
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,410
By the way, did you hear
about the chairman?

210
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,913
Yes, I heard from my mom.

211
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,456
What about him?

212
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,876
Mr. Ju has been experiencing
early symptoms of depression.

213
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,960
What?

214
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,171
Oh, no.

215
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,591
I can completely relate to him, Rosa.

216
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,052
I also wrote my will once.

217
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,763
What did you write on it?

218
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,184
Did you write, "I want you to die,
you bastard, Yang Tae-yang."

219
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,728
I ought to tell them to his face.

220
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,272
Why would I waste papers on that?

221
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,442
Is that why you splashed
a bucket of dirty water on them?

222
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,735
Yes.

223
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,029
It was embarrassing to face my son,

224
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,447
but it felt nice.

225
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,741
That was great.
You must blow off the steam.

226
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,994
Do whatever you want to do and
say whatever you want to say. Good job.

227
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,456
So what is the chairman going to do?

228
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,916
Will he go to therapy?

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,545
He doesn't want therapy.
He said he's fine.

230
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,213
He said it's the autumn blues.

231
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,464
He's so pig-headed.

232
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,342
You should stay with him
and take care of him.

233
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,095
He seemed to have the best time with you.

234
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,972
I told him to come upstairs now.

235
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,433
He said he'll come up after a phone call.

236
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,725
But he won't get that call.

237
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,185
What phone call?

238
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,730
He was going to have dinner with his
second son's family. It's been a while.

239
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,941
But all of a sudden,
his grandson got an upset stomach,

240
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,568
so it was canceled.

241
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,611
They were going to give him a call,

242
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,448
but they probably forgot to call
because things are hectic.

243
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,366
He can call first.

244
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,409
Right.

245
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,745
He could just call them first,

246
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,832
but I think he feels bad
that by calling them,

247
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,668
he might be bothering them
when they are already busy.

248
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,172
When you're old,
all sorts of thoughts cross your mind.

249
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,234
Yes, Dad.

250
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,111
Hey.

251
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,239
How's Yun-min? What happened?

252
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,825
When we got to the hospital,
he was completely fine, you know.

253
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,495
-Goodness. Can you stop moving?
-Gosh, what a relief.

254
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,955
Yun-hyeon. Yun-min. My goodness.

255
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,165
And he's okay now?

256
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,250
Yes, he's okay now.

257
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,003
-He's having fun playing with his brother.
-Guys, stop that.

258
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,963
We got him his favorite pizza and Coke.

259
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,924
So he's singing and is in a good mood.

260
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,384
But still, don't feed him a lot of food.

261
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,178
He should be careful today.

262
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,262
Okay.

263
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,098
Oh, Dad.

264
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,184
Yes. What is it?

265
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,730
Yun-hyeon and Yun-min took a photo
in their taekwondo suits this afternoon.

266
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,023
They looked so cute.

267
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,733
I'll send it to you now.

268
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,151
Okay. Thank you.

269
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,028
Enjoy your dinner.

270
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,447
Okay. Have a goodnight, Dad.

271
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,594
Hey, Rosa.

272
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,054
What's taking you so long?

273
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,514
Did Tae-ung call?

274
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,475
Yes, he called just now.

275
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,102
Yun-min is fine.

276
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,479
That's good to hear.
You need to eat your dinner.

277
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,939
Come up now. You must be hungry.

278
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,649
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

279
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,526
You'll skip dinner?

280
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,777
No, come upstairs now.

281
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,822
Hey, skipping a meal won't kill me.

282
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,739
I'll be fine.

283
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,868
Aren't you going home soon?
Come down. I'll drive you home.

284
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,161
If we start skipping meals at our age,
we'll never eat.

285
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,079
It'll be awful.

286
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,333
I won't nag you. Come upstairs now. Okay?

287
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,672
My goodness, you win.

288
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,593
The liver transplantation from a living
donor usually starts early in the morning.

289
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,762
As both surgeries must be
performed at the same time,

290
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,765
it takes long
and requires a lot of people.

291
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,310
Professors usually come
around eight in the morning.

292
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,437
They come down
when the anesthesiologist is ready.

293
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,815
And before the surgery, the scrub nurses
set up the operating room.

294
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,696
Today, we'll do
a living donor liver transplant.

295
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,114
The donor is a man in his 50s,

296
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,824
is the patient's younger brother.

297
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,328
The anatomy type of the donor's biliary
tract is C, so it'll be a difficult case.

298
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,623
But Professor Lee will be careful,
so there won't be a problem.

299
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,585
Professor Lee might seem
distracted and all over the place,

300
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,462
but he's a really good surgeon.

301
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,630
What did you say?

302
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,508
Was that criticism or a compliment?

303
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,135
What are you doing here?

304
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,303
I'm studying.

305
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,014
-Are you assisting me today?
-No.

306
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,516
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok will assist you today.

307
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,363
Here's the liver specimen
for frozen biopsy.

308
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,123
KIM CHANG-HWAN

309
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,639
It's taking a bit too long today.

310
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,937
This is Kim Mi-ae from Pathology.

311
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,482
Here's the result of the frozen biopsy
of the patient, Kim Chang-hwan.

312
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,943
The macrovesicular fatty change
is six percent.

313
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,988
And there's no inflammation
around the hepatic portal vein.

314
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,489
Okay. Thank you!

315
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,907
Let's start right away.

316
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,664
Please put on some music.

317
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,266
Neurosurgeons don't usually say

318
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,101
that everything will be okay

319
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,520
and that the patient
will definitely recover.

320
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,024
Since we deal with brains,

321
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,152
there's a less chance
of seeing a dramatic improvement

322
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,195
after the surgery
compared to other departments.

323
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,488
I see.

324
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,907
I'm taking out the tumor now.

325
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,294
-Are you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

326
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,130
I easily get cold.

327
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,341
You can't survive in CS, then.

328
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,512
Are you okay, Yun-bok?

329
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,223
Aren't you cold? Hold on.

330
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,643
I can't see it. Pull it to my side.

331
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,936
Yes, sir.

332
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,232
CURRENT TEMPERATURE: 18

333
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,613
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm okay.

334
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,119
Thank you.

335
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,373
When we stop the heart and use
a heart-lung machine during surgery,

336
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,668
the patient won't get much blood flow
as the heart is stopped.

337
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,754
So we must slow down
the patient's metabolic rate.

338
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,714
We lower the temperature

339
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,343
to help the organs' metabolic rates
go down, so the patient uses less energy.

340
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,138
That way, when the heart beats again,
the patient can make a good recovery.

341
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,848
Where is Hong-do?

342
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,558
He's attending a pediatrics surgery.

343
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,478
I see. Does he easily get hot?

344
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,938
Yes. Very easily.

345
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,606
My goodness.

346
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,690
Oh, no.

347
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,088
Gauze, please.

348
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,134
CURRENT TEMPERATURE: 30.3

349
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,394
Hey, are you all right?

350
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,770
-Are you okay?
-Doctor.

351
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,021
Are you okay?

352
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,857
The student collapsed, right?

353
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,819
-Yes.
-Is he okay?

354
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,572
Yes. It took a while this year.

355
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,740
Last year, a student fainted around June.

356
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,710
Hello, my baby.

357
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,129
It's Mommy.

358
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,217
Okay.

359
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,011
-I don't have a clear view.
-Okay.

360
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,932
When you're suturing the uterus,
make sure to keep it tight.

361
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,018
But you can't pull too hard.

362
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,477
Okay.

363
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,527
Professor Yang, the students
from the nursing school are here.

364
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,113
Ma'am, congratulations.

365
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,698
Thank you.

366
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,909
I already informed the mother.

367
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,620
If you came a bit early,
you could have seen the baby coming out.

368
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,706
You have another surgery this afternoon.
Hopefully, we can see it then.

369
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,124
You may approach closer.

370
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,960
Make sure not to contaminate
the operating table.

371
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,009
NURSING STUDENT, KIM YEONG-JU

372
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,637
Hello.

373
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,187
My gosh. Did your surgery just finish?

374
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,106
-That was a long one.
-Controlling the bleeding took some time.

375
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,107
But it went well.

376
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,235
-You're getting off work late.
-Yes.

377
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,571
Right. It's about the patient, Oh Yu-min.
The patient in Room 6011.

378
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,074
She's waiting for a donor
due to liver cirrhosis.

379
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,785
-Yes.
-Can you call her father?

380
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,162
We must let him know that
the patient is getting worse now.

381
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,166
It's been a while
since he stopped coming to the hospital.

382
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,502
He stopped coming after last week.

383
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,255
That's right.
I haven't seen him around lately.

384
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,841
Does she have other family members?

385
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,219
No. She doesn't have any family.

386
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,722
I heard she hadn't seen her father
for a while before her condition, either.

387
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,891
My gosh, what should we do?

388
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,645
He might have gone somewhere, you know.

389
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,106
-He'll be back.
-I doubt it.

390
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,483
Okay.

391
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,695
I've been doing this over a decade now,

392
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,613
so I can tell just by their eyes.

393
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,699
I can tell if they will go through with it

394
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,909
or if getting the donation
will be difficult.

395
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,079
And her father is the latter case.

396
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,499
I can tell you
that he will never come back.

397
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,043
The decision is his,

398
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,212
so I can't criticize him for it.

399
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,131
Besides, getting a piece of his liver

400
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,925
seemed challenging from the get-go.

401
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,218
Anyway, I got it.

402
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,054
Professor Lee.

403
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,390
It's raining outside.

404
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,852
It's been raining since the morning.
You didn't know, right?

405
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,229
Have a goodnight.

406
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,897
Bye.

407
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,118
It's raining. Let's eat.

408
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,164
-Are you done with the surgery?
-That's why I'm here.

409
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,415
What should we get?

410
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,917
How about jeon? Or sujebi?

411
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,712
Of course, it's got to be sujebi.
See you in the lobby.

412
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,547
I didn't drive today. Let's take your car.

413
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,090
Sure.

414
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,559
WET FIELD SUJEBI

415
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,938
It's raining. Shall we go for a drive?

416
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,815
Sounds great.

417
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,859
What about U-ju?

418
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,654
He's in Changwon.
He's hooked on pork rice soup these days.

419
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,032
What about your dad's hearing aid?
Did you really refund it?

420
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,909
No way. You think I'm nuts?

421
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:52,079
I talked to Professor Song
to get the best one for my dad.

422
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,789
Why did you tell him how much it cost?

423
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,082
I didn't tell him.

424
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,125
My dad somehow found out.

425
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,837
My gosh. Anyway, I told him
that I got the employee discount,

426
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,423
used a coupon, and a credit card discount.

427
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,092
I came up with all sorts of white lies.

428
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,511
I had to tell about millions of lies

429
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,304
and said I paid less than one million won.

430
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,432
I barely managed to persuade him
to wear it.

431
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,892
Gosh, don't get so mad about it.

432
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,561
He doesn't want you to spend money.

433
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,396
Ma'am, more kimchi, please.

434
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,691
Yes, what is it?

435
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,610
The patient has a cerebellar hemorrhage

436
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,363
and is in a semicoma.
And both pupils are fixed at 0.2.

437
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,823
And the patient barely has
any motor skills.

438
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,366
I'm nearby. I'll be right there.

439
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,076
Let's go.

440
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,853
I took the enhanced brain TC.

441
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,063
The bleeding is causing compression
in the brain stem.

442
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,314
How old is the patient?

443
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,649
Thirteen years old.

444
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,901
It's a 13-year-old girl.

445
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,574
GUARDIAN

446
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,924
What is that?

447
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,718
Is that a cerebral hemorrhage?

448
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,012
The patient is still young.

449
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,431
-Dr. Ahn.
-Yes.

450
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,683
Do you see the AVM in her cerebellum?

451
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,101
AVM: ARTERIO-VENOUS MALFORMATION

452
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,477
Yes, I do.

453
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,022
The AVM is ruptured,
so it caused ICH in the cerebellum.

454
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,357
She became unconscious and collapsed.
Let's do the surgery.

455
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,359
-Okay.
-Hurry. Get the guardian's consent now,

456
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,778
talk to Anesthesiology
and send her up right away.

457
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,072
-I'll talk to her parents.
-Okay, I got it.

458
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,790
You startled me.

459
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,376
Didn't you go home?
Are you on calls? Do you have an umbrella?

460
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,587
I didn't go home.
No, I'm not on calls and no umbrellas.

461
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,963
Give me 10,000 won.

462
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,715
I don't have any cash.

463
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,176
I had a baseball bet with Gwang-hyeon.
Darn it. NC lost.

464
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,220
It could've been
their tenth winning game in a row.

465
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,640
-Pay it back.
-Okay.

466
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,559
Give me some cigarettes, too.

467
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,734
You borrowed 10,000 won and 4 cigarettes.

468
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,693
And a lighter.

469
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,951
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter.

470
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,994
Hey, it's Gyeo-ul.

471
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,877
What are you doing?

472
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,754
What do you think? I lied.

473
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,005
Crazy jerk.

474
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,423
Bye.

475
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,053
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter.

476
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,137
Hold on.

477
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:03,311
You borrowed 10,000 won,
4 cigarettes, and 1 lighter

478
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,439
Jessica, only child, Illinois, Chicago

479
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,150
Ahn Jeong-won from school
Is such a cheapskate

480
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,282
I'm really leaving now.
It's time for the baseball highlight.

481
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,033
That crazy jerk.

482
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,559
Hello, Professor Ahn.

483
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,022
See you later at home. Bye.

484
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,168
That's a different car, right?

485
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,837
Yes. It was a gray sedan yesterday.

486
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,340
Who on earth is Gyeo-ul dating?

487
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,008
I don't like his vibe.

488
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,262
Doesn't Jeong-won have a car?

489
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,182
He does. But it's very sick.

490
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,516
It's always at the hospital.

491
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,810
Hey, Gyeo-ul. Why are you back?

492
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,187
Hello.

493
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,813
-Hi.
-Did you forget something?

494
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,315
I need to take care of some charts.

495
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,150
I was too busy to do them this afternoon.

496
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,861
Since I'm here, I'll look at the baby
in the PICU that had surgery.

497
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,280
Do you want some coffee?
Should I get you one?

498
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes. But is the cafe still open?

499
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,203
There is a convenience store.
I'll get you one.

500
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,371
Go to the PICU.

501
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,622
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

502
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,919
Here.

503
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,755
Thank you.

504
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,549
Right. Here's one more. Ta-da.

505
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,635
I could have gotten them myself.

506
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,930
I get more discounts.
30 percents. Quite a lot, right?

507
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,561
Gyeo-ul.

508
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,563
Can I ask you a question?

509
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,983
-It's a personal question. Is it okay?
-Okay.

510
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,698
What does your boyfriend do?

511
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,662
What does he do for a living?
How can he drive different cars every day?

512
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,206
Is he a car dealer?
Does he sell imported cars?

513
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,752
You only got half right.
The other half is wrong.

514
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,765
THE PATIENT'S SURGERY HAS ENDED
PLEASE COME TO THE OR

515
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,892
Honey.

516
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,441
What are you doing still up?

517
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,569
My gosh, it's past midnight.

518
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,154
I can't sleep.

519
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,490
Did your surgery just finish?
Was it a difficult one?

520
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,868
No, the previous surgery
didn't finish on time,

521
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,286
so I started late.

522
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,037
You probably didn't eat dinner, then.

523
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,957
I'm going to have ramyeon in the office.

524
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,126
You should go to sleep now.
I'll see you this weekend.

525
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,252
Okay.

526
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,379
Bye, Jun-wan.

527
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,964
Okay. Sleep tight.

528
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,599
You're still here?

529
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,058
Hello.

530
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,935
Hi.

531
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,729
-Are you studying?
-No.

532
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,523
I just organized my notes I took
this afternoon.

533
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,234
It's getting late. You should go home now.

534
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,944
Okay. I'm done now.

535
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,116
Take a taxi. Return my card tomorrow.

536
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,410
No. It's all right.

537
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,661
No, take it.

538
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,122
My boyfriend is picking me up.

539
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,666
He's waiting for me downstairs.

540
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,752
Thank you, though.

541
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,967
The surgery went well.

542
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,595
We did everything we could.

543
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,890
We stopped the brain hemorrhage and
removed the arteriovenous malformation,

544
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,308
but the swelling was severe.

545
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,353
The bleeding was located deep in the brain
and in an unfavorable spot.

546
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,605
So we need to observe her more.

547
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,440
We'll give her medicine to lower

548
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,692
the brain pressure
and keep her in the ICU.

549
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,236
Will she regain consciousness?

550
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,363
We won't know that now.

551
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,783
She was in a life-threatening situation,

552
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,993
so it's too early to judge
if she'll wake up or not.

553
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,038
We need more time.

554
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,249
Bye.

555
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,126
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

556
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,229
It's raining a lot outside. I'll leave
an umbrella in front of your office.

557
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,731
Thank you for today.

558
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,838
Hey, what is it?

559
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,715
Why are you calling me at this hour?
What's up?

560
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,676
Must you ask? I'm waiting for you.

561
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,303
You're still here?

562
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,305
Where would I go?
You didn't bring your car today.

563
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,348
It's raining. How will you get home?

564
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,641
You're done, right?

565
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,435
Come to the ER. I'll pull out the car.

566
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,147
Okay. I'll be there soon.

567
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,664
That looks like Yun-bok.

568
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,669
Why can't you show me?

569
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,797
Why do you need to check my phone?

570
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,219
"Are you sleeping?"

571
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,057
Doesn't he know what time it is?
Why did he text you at this hour?

572
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,059
-"Are you sleeping?"
-Hey.

573
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,728
Did you go through my phone?

574
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,521
Why did you go through my phone?

575
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,607
It popped up right there.
How can I not look?

576
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,026
-Give me your phone.
-No.

577
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,403
Why not?
You must be hiding something from me.

578
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,614
No, I'm not.

579
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,993
Then, what about you? Why aren't you
using the cell phone case I got you?

580
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,078
It's a matching case.

581
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,746
It won't fit in here.

582
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,039
I take it off when I drive.

583
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,082
I need to use GPS.

584
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,500
Where's the case?

585
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,221
That bastard.

586
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,306
Give me your phone.

587
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,141
What's wrong with you?

588
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,018
I told you it's not what you think. No.

589
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,103
Then, let me see.

590
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,063
-Let me check.
-I don't want to do.

591
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,273
I'll check it and give it back right away.

592
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,609
I told you no. Why do you keep nagging me?

593
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,278
Is showing me your phone that hard?

594
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,615
Listen. I don't want to show you my phone.

595
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,284
Look. That's the haircut.

596
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,538
That was U-ju when he was two.

597
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,540
He looks just like Ik-jun
when he was young.

598
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,375
He takes after his grandfather.

599
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,752
CAPTAIN HONG JEONG-HO

600
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,965
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND?

601
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,302
He's Captain Hong in my battalion.

602
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,141
This is his habit.
He's like this to everyone.

603
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,019
He's friendly to everyone around him.

604
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,937
Do you want to see his texts?

605
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,731
-Look.
-It's fine.

606
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,441
If you say so, then he must be.

607
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,692
I don't have to see it.

608
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,195
-Are you sure?
-Yes, why would I check your phone?

609
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,410
So you want to go for a doctorate?

610
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,995
Where's the doctorate program at?

611
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,415
It's either the States or the UK. I don't
know where they'll have an opening.

612
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,917
I'm studying hard,

613
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,837
but only one or two people
will get picked.

614
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,507
-Do you want to be a professor?
-I might not be as smart as my brother,

615
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,385
but I'm pretty smart, too.
I joined the military academy

616
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,303
as I'm athletic, too.

617
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,846
How long will you stay if you go?

618
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,265
If I get picked,

619
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,602
the program will last
at least three to five years.

620
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,191
I guess you have no interest
in getting married.

621
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,239
I told you when we first started dating.

622
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,575
That I'm not interested
in marriage at all.

623
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,664
But you know that this kind
of conversation is pointless, right?

624
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,417
It's really hard to get into this program.

625
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,295
Captains probably have
a higher chance of getting picked.

626
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,838
I can't go.

627
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,049
Why can't you?

628
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,717
If you don't go, who will?

629
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,427
You can get in.

630
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,554
I think you'll get picked.

631
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,057
Really?

632
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,229
Yes, that's right.
I also think I'll get picked.

633
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,898
I'll probably get to go.

634
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,986
If you do go,

635
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,615
does it mean we're breaking up?

636
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,661
If you go abroad for your studies,

637
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,164
what will happen to us?

638
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,004
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

639
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,842
Let's eat. They are serving
braised pollack in the cafeteria.

640
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,885
-Let's go.
-Easy, easy.

641
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,638
Easy, easy.

642
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,723
The choledochal cyst takes place

643
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,852
when there's a cystic dilatation of the
biliary duct, so its function decreases.

644
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,687
As a result, this condition

645
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,982
may lead to cholelithiasis
and cholangiocarcinoma.

646
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,609
We will make an incision the cyst

647
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,778
in the common bile duct in surgery.

648
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,447
We will perform
Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy

649
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,616
to reconstruct the biliary tract.

650
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,410
I see.

651
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,536
Hello, ma'am.

652
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,538
Hi, Professor.

653
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,249
Jae-won isn't getting a difficult surgery.

654
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,043
Our liver produces something called bile.

655
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:15,131
This is a type of digestive fluid
that helps break down the grease.

656
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,634
When our liver produces bile,
it moves down to our stomach.

657
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,637
And the passageway to our stomach
is called the common bile duct.

658
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,889
I see.

659
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,726
Most of the kids have
a common bile duct less than 5mm.

660
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,646
But Jae-won's bile duct
is stretched to 3cm.

661
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,232
If it's stretched,

662
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,526
the bile can't flow out
and gets stuck in there.

663
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,322
And this may lead to gallstones
and other complications.

664
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,742
So we'll cut the stretched part
of the common bile duct.

665
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,203
That's the surgery
Jae-won is getting today.

666
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,787
I see. Okay.

667
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,831
Of course, after removing it,

668
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,125
he still needs
a passageway for the bile to go through.

669
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,545
So we need to connect a part of his small
intestine with the biliary duct.

670
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,631
And once we connect them together,

671
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,799
the surgery will be over.

672
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,219
It's not that complicated or difficult.

673
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,095
You don't have to worry that much.

674
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,932
I see. Thank you.

675
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,767
I totally understood that.

676
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,353
Please take good care of my son. Please.

677
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,562
Okay.

678
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,943
Hey.

679
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,070
All right. I'll see you guys there.

680
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,322
Okay.

681
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,081
Don't laugh like that.
You look like Gargamel.

682
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,791
What's so funny?

683
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,086
Guys. You know
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae in CS, right?

684
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,587
-No, I don't.
-He's the guy who owns

685
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,089
a lot of real estate properties.

686
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,382
That much I know.

687
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,133
Jun-wan reported him regarding the rebate.

688
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,218
Yes, it's him.

689
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,138
Goodness, speak of the devil.

690
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,153
You're even friends with Jae-hak?

691
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,573
Yes, I'm also super close
to Dragon in her department.

692
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,492
-Who's Dragon?
-Yong Seok-min.

693
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,953
You're not close to anyone
in OB-GYN, right?

694
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,204
Of course not. He may have had

695
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,873
a couple of meals with them,
but I'm sure he's not close to anyone.

696
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,875
Chu Min-ha and I are besties.

697
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,713
We're going to have tteokbokki together
next week. With Gyeo-ul too.

698
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,840
Hey, Jang Gyeo-ul is busy.

699
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,467
I'm busy too, and so are they.
All of us are busy.

700
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,428
But they asked me to buy them tteokbokki.

701
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,096
They all like me so much.

702
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,556
No, you're just too nosy.

703
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,933
Jun-wan, did you hear the news?

704
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,103
Professor Cheon and the CEO of
Jinyong Credit Union are getting married.

705
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,688
Who is he marrying?

706
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,982
Jin Min-ju,
the CEO of Jinyong Credit Union.

707
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,234
The self-made entrepreneur. She's loaded.

708
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,403
She's one of the foundation's
board members.

709
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,280
Yes, she's close to the chairman.

710
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,617
She's very capable, and I think
she's an all-around wonderful person.

711
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,163
And that's why the chairman is
very concerned at the moment.

712
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,958
-Why is he concerned?
-I'm sure he's very worried.

713
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,711
She's a competent businesswoman
and has a great personality,

714
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,004
but she has low standards for men.

715
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,798
Professor Cheon is obviously
after her money,

716
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,468
so I bet the chairman is torn
whether or not he should intervene.

717
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,763
-Is he really not a good person?
-That's right. He's a total jerk.

718
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,139
He's really horrible.

719
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,640
I'd describe him as a villain.

720
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,185
What is a villain?

721
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,563
It's a compliment.

722
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,107
Runs to get and pay bills.

723
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,651
It means a hardworking person
who always does his best.

724
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,403
Really?

725
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,073
Oh, I have to go do my rounds.
See you later, guys.

726
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,199
See you.

727
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,994
Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology
will check in as well,

728
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,330
and we'll thoroughly prepare
for your surgery.

729
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,707
-I'll get going.
-Thank you.

730
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,836
Doctor, when can I be discharged?

731
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,005
You look like a different person now.

732
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,217
-The urine output has been okay, right?
-Yes.

733
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,511
What about her prolactin levels?

734
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:49,970
It's going down.

735
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,348
You can be discharged tomorrow.

736
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,601
Just remember that
you shouldn't blow your nose too hard.

737
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,269
Mild exercise is okay,

738
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,897
but please stay away
from water exercises for the time being.

739
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,441
Dr. Yong will go over everything again
in detail.

740
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,038
Yes?

741
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,208
Okay, I'll be right there.

742
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,129
You won't need restitching. It looks fine.

743
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,757
Thank you. You should get going.
I know you're busy.

744
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,883
Yes, that was from the ER.

745
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,469
If you experience any discomfort again,
let us know.

746
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,601
Mom, I'm craving tteokbokki.

747
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,146
I'll buy you a ton of it
when you get discharged.

748
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,231
I'll buy you everything you want to eat.

749
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,860
My baby...

750
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,154
Thanks for staying so strong.

751
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,783
She seems to be doing much better
than yesterday. Her speech is clearer too.

752
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,076
Yes, I know.

753
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,996
It's a miracle
that she's already recovered this much.

754
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,624
Her cranial nerves are regenerating
very quickly because she's young.

755
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,877
The pressure around the medulla is gone,

756
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,462
and we took care of the bleeding too.

757
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,589
Just keep up
with the rehabilitation therapy,

758
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,467
and she'll recover to the point
that it won't affect her day-to-day life.

759
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,052
Please don't worry too much.

760
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,890
We should be able to move her
to the regular ward in about two days.

761
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,934
Thank you, Doctor. We owe it all to you.

762
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,019
No problem.

763
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,439
You haven't been able to go home
for the past few days, right?

764
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,983
I saw you sleeping on the chairs at night.

765
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,777
She's passed the critical stage,

766
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,863
so you should go home
and sleep comfortably tonight.

767
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,867
We were planning
to go home tonight anyway.

768
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:40,122
Our grand opening is tomorrow.

769
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,250
I'm starting a business
in the midst of all this.

770
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:48,088
My mom teaches yoga. She's very famous.

771
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,548
Oh, really?

772
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,384
So, you're opening a yoga center?

773
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,013
Yes. After working as an instructor
on salary for years,

774
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,599
I took out a loan
and opened a yoga center.

775
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,893
But a few of members from
the previous center signed up

776
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,521
and helped me spread the word,
so I already have many members.

777
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:08,400
They already paid their membership fees,
and some of them are coming from far away,

778
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,402
so I couldn't postpone the opening.

779
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,155
Knowing that my daughter is in the PICU...

780
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,116
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.

781
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,786
Gosh, don't say that.
You need to earn money, of course.

782
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,540
Tae-hui has her dad, you know.
And we'll check in on her often as well.

783
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,585
Doctor, please feel free to visit
my yoga center when you have some time.

784
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,339
I feel like it'll do very well
if you come.

785
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,550
Doctor.

786
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,220
You're like a good luck charm
to me and my family.

787
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,933
Whenever you have some free time,
please stop by for a cup of coffee.

788
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,812
She won't have time for that.
She must be always busy.

789
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:49,650
Doctor, it's okay even if it's
a year later, or three years later.

790
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,235
Just visit us anytime.

791
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,029
For you, free yoga classes for life.

792
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,991
Thank you for saying that.

793
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,577
And I really will stop by
when I have some time.

794
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,328
Talk to you soon.

795
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,089
Can you raise this arm for me?

796
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,217
Raise this leg for me.

797
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,927
This one too.

798
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,430
My head hurts so much, Doctor.

799
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:26,937
When did you get here?

800
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,897
I got here a while ago
for another patient.

801
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,983
Do we have the CT angiogram?

802
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,152
That's an aneurysm.

803
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,821
-Shave the area for coil embolization.
-Okay.

804
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,910
Yes, hello.

805
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,872
Is the bleeding severe?

806
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,125
Well, I'll go and take a look.

807
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,543
Okay.

808
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,296
Sorry. Call the coil embolization team
and Anesthesiology.

809
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,340
-No problem.
-Seong-yeong, can you shave the area

810
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,425
-for coil embolization?
-Sure, no problem.

811
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,387
Coil embolization?
Then you'll be late for practice.

812
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,973
I won't be late. It'll be done quickly.

813
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,976
-What's for dinner?
-Seok-hyeong wants ramyeon.

814
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,313
-Shall we get some dumplings and gimbap?
-That's a given.

815
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,940
-By the way, where are you headed now?
-The ER.

816
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,029
Oh, Hui-su wants my advice on something.
I think she fought with her sister-in-law.

817
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:18,822
Aren't you busy?

818
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,533
Today is not so bad.
I'll be busy next week though.

819
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,744
U-ju has a field trip,
and I have a lot of lectures.

820
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,247
I'll be busy with surgery as well. Come
with me if you have some time to kill.

821
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,291
-I have the coil procedure.
-Oh, right.

822
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,918
Move.

823
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,338
PROFESSOR OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
KIM JUN-WAN

824
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,923
THERE IS A 20-MINUTE DELAY

825
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,892
PROFESSOR OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
CHEON MYEONG-TAE

826
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,227
NO WAITING PATIENTS

827
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,063
She got a stent put in last year
at a different hospital,

828
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,731
but the symptoms are reoccurring?

829
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,899
Yes.

830
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,737
She's been experiencing chest pain
frequently as well as severe constipation.

831
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,075
Doctor, I read in books
and on the Internet

832
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,994
that the medications that are prescribed

833
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,580
after a stent procedure
can cause constipation.

834
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,958
I read that probiotics can help.

835
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,293
Can she take probiotics?

836
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,296
-Where do you live?
-We live in Ilsan.

837
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,927
Yeongji Hospital in Ilsan is pretty good.
You should take her there.

838
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,595
Pardon me?

839
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,390
You don't need to tell me
about what you read on the Internet.

840
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,309
And you don't need to come
all the way here.

841
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,520
She should just get treated
at a hospital nearby.

842
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,730
Anyway, thank you for coming. Next?

843
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,442
-Was she my last patient for the day?
-Yes.

844
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,986
Take care.

845
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,702
The surgery was done
on the 23rd of last month,

846
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,620
so you still have to wait a bit
to give a bath.

847
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,497
It healed nicely though.

848
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,624
Showers are fine, starting next week.

849
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,210
You can bathe the baby
starting next weekend.

850
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,795
Okay. Got it, Doctor.

851
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,589
Thank you.

852
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,048
-One more thing.
-Yes?

853
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,385
When you're using running water,
be gentle with the soap.

854
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,053
As for bathing the baby,

855
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,474
it'd be best if you could wait
until the scabs fall off naturally.

856
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,893
Okay, thank you.

857
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,563
-How many are left?
-Five more.

858
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,357
-You said you have plans this evening.
-It's no problem at all.

859
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,443
Professor, I heard
Professor Cheon is already done.

860
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,737
It's not even 4 p.m. yet.

861
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,284
Everything's ready.

862
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,120
Professor Chae is in her office.
Call her, and she'll come right away.

863
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,830
Thanks for everything.

864
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,005
-We're getting a lot of NS patients today.
-I know.

865
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,382
-Hello.
-Hello.

866
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,385
Seong-yeong, are you done
with the shaving?

867
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,894
What's the matter?

868
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,604
What's wrong?

869
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,458
Seong-yeong, spare me a second.

870
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,168
Come on.

871
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,717
What is it?

872
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,142
Well...

873
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,480
Professor, we told the patient
that we had to shave his head

874
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:42,442
in case we might have to perform
another brain surgery

875
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,486
in the near future.

876
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,613
-Shut it.
-Okay.

877
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,751
Gosh, you...

878
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,563
Patient Oh Yu-min
is really not doing well.

879
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,940
But strangely,
her MELD score is going down.

880
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,984
What do we do? We don't have time.

881
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,780
Do we have her father's address?

882
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,699
Yes, just a moment.

883
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,703
My gosh, he's here.

884
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,376
My goodness.

885
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,469
At the top, you see the fetal heart rate.

886
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,305
And at the bottom,
you see the mother's contractions.

887
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,391
-If you look closely...
-We have a patient with PPH coming in!

888
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,693
Her hemoglobin level is four.

889
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,196
That's too low.

890
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,739
Four?

891
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,325
What does that mean?

892
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,161
It means that she has lost a lot of blood.

893
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,289
Will she live?

894
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,957
Yes.

895
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,010
Are you really the same person?

896
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:34,930
Yes, Doctor.

897
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,891
I lost 7kg.

898
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,519
Not by starving myself.

899
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,772
I hired a personal trainer
and worked out six hours a day.

900
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,525
And I've been strictly watching
what I eat.

901
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,069
I predict that I'll probably lose

902
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,240
additional 2 to 3kg
in the next week or so.

903
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,368
Doctor.

904
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,206
Please allow me to donate my liver.

905
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,043
You see,

906
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,212
I don't care if I die.

907
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,051
If I can save my daughter,

908
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,013
I really don't care what happens to me.

909
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,934
I was so preoccupied
with my business abroad

910
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,103
that I neglected

911
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,815
my one and only daughter.

912
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,986
I had no idea at all until
my daughter was on the brink of death

913
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,573
from alcoholism.

914
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,327
She's in this mess now

915
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,997
all because of me.

916
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,167
Had I been there for her,

917
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,919
she wouldn't have

918
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,797
ended up like this.

919
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,800
Doctor.

920
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,596
I know it's late,
but I want to be a good dad to her now.

921
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,809
So please allow me to donate my liver.

922
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,313
I'll lose more weight if you tell me to.

923
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,316
And I'll exercise even harder.

924
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,527
Please, Doctor.

925
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,907
Let me donate my liver.

926
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,825
Please?

927
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:23,955
Sir.

928
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,418
According to the rules,
you can't be a donor.

929
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,589
You're above the age limit
to qualify as a donor,

930
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,093
and you have a fatty liver. I can't let
you do it if I were to stick to the rules.

931
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,972
And to tell you the truth, I had given up.

932
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,183
But seeing you today...

933
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,064
I'll muster up some courage.

934
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,859
Let's do it.

935
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,905
I'll order a liver ultrasound
and other tests.

936
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,366
We'll proceed with the surgery
if everything looks good.

937
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,410
Thank you.

938
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,080
Doctor, I really

939
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,249
appreciate this.

940
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,209
No, please.

941
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,632
I mean, I should thank you. I'm grateful
to see you again, looking so healthy.

942
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,271
Your son will go through a procedure
called coil embolization.

943
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,399
We'll insert a thin catheter
via a femoral puncture

944
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,067
and guide it up to his cerebral arteries.

945
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,903
Then we'll insert coils
to fill the aneurysm

946
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,655
and close it off.

947
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,325
And to prevent infections,
we have to shave the hair

948
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,411
around the groin area before the surgery.

949
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,373
But one of our interns
misunderstood the instructions

950
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,084
and shaved his head instead.

951
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,256
My instructions weren't clear enough,

952
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,134
so this is my fault. I'm really sorry.

953
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,805
You can claim compensation if you'd like.

954
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,017
I promise you
that I'll get this all sorted out for you.

955
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,644
It's okay, Doctor.

956
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,982
He may lose his life.

957
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,484
Who cares about his hair?

958
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:17,944
Don't worry about it.

959
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,238
Thank you.

960
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,744
Doctor. The surgery won't hurt, right?

961
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,413
It's all good as long as it won't hurt.

962
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,581
So please...

963
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,751
Don't be so harsh on the intern.

964
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,131
We'll administer anesthesia,
so you won't feel any pain.

965
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,676
Your thigh might feel a little tight
after the surgery,

966
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,055
but I'll tell them
to give you cold compresses.

967
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,349
Thank goodness.

968
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,112
-Which song are we practicing today?
-"Met You by Chance."

969
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,656
Okay.

970
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,409
What are you doing?

971
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,079
-I'm reflecting on myself.
-What for?

972
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,582
For thinking that I knew

973
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,293
everything about this world and people.

974
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,925
-I'm reflecting on a bunch of stuff.
-What are you talking about?

975
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,594
Can you step aside?
Chi-hong needs to come in.

976
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,056
-Hello.
-Hi. What's up?

977
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,933
He said he had to ask me something.

978
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,021
Jun-wan, if you have the time,
would you please get lost?

979
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,272
It's about a family matter.

980
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,972
You can come in and see Jae-won.

981
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,932
No, it's okay. I saw Jae-won earlier.

982
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,727
It's just that I keep wanting
to see my baby.

983
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,522
The surgery went well, right?

984
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,399
Professor Ahn explained everything,

985
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,985
but I wasn't really listening
because I was so out of it earlier.

986
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,821
-Come in for a second.
-Okay.

987
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,990
I was in the OR

988
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,451
to assist Professor Ahn,
so I saw everything.

989
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,582
Look.

990
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,543
This is what the common bile duct
normally looks like.

991
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,545
As we explained before the surgery,

992
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:44,257
this part of Jae-won's common bile duct
was stretched out.

993
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,135
First, we cut out the stretched-out part.

994
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,722
Then to create a new passageway
for his bile to travel, we connected this

995
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,934
to his small intestine.

996
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,145
The surgery went well.

997
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,523
It's only been a while,
so Jae-won seems to be in a bit of pain.

998
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,026
But there's no bleeding,
and the urine output is good as well.

999
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,861
The vitals are very stable too.

1000
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,447
We should be able to send Jae-won
back to the ward tomorrow.

1001
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,116
Thank you, Doctor.

1002
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,619
Thank you so much.

1003
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,579
My gosh.

1004
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,623
Thank you.

1005
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,095
Yes, they dated for a long time.
About five years?

1006
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,516
But as you know,

1007
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,476
Ik-sun had no interest in getting married.

1008
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,312
But the guy kept asking her to marry him,

1009
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:42,607
and Ik-sun liked him enough
to change her mind about it,

1010
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,484
so she said yes.

1011
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,986
Anyway, things were fine between them.

1012
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,365
But one day, they went
to see a fortune-teller on a whim.

1013
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,618
Apparently,
the fortune-teller said to Ik-sun

1014
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,996
that she'd destroy his future
if they stayed together.

1015
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,248
What?

1016
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,166
She said they're totally incompatible

1017
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,627
and that Ik-sun would be like a roadblock
to his future.

1018
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,713
They were told some nonsense like that.

1019
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,634
-And she believed it?
-No, of course not.

1020
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,429
But that would stay
in the back of your mind, you know?

1021
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,473
So the next day,

1022
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,644
Ik-sun made an appointment
with every fortune-teller in the area

1023
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,689
and asked him to come with her
to get that out of their heads.

1024
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,608
-And?
-But that jerk was like...

1025
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,820
He said he told his mom about it

1026
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,449
and that she is against them
getting married.

1027
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,784
Then he asked her for time apart.

1028
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,079
Ik-sun was baffled.

1029
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,708
She was just sitting there,
dazed and confused.

1030
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,545
Then she suddenly got a call
from that guy's mom.

1031
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,881
She answered,

1032
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,177
and his mom wanted to hang out
on the weekend.

1033
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,557
In such a happy, jolly voice,

1034
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,311
she asked Ik-sun to join her
on her trip to Sokcho that weekend.

1035
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,604
So he lied.

1036
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,398
He sure did, using his mom as an excuse.

1037
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,068
He didn't know that
his mom and Ik-sun talked often.

1038
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:14,199
If his feelings had changed,
he should've just been honest with her.

1039
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,492
I mean, he's not a kid.

1040
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,287
Why did she even date
a douchebag like him?

1041
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,125
Anyway, she suffered from insomnia
for over six months after that.

1042
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,919
She couldn't even eat,

1043
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,839
and she lost over 5kg during those months.

1044
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:35,303
I was busy at the hospital back then,
so I couldn't really be there for her.

1045
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,764
Is my dear sister okay now?

1046
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,184
Yes, she seems
to have fully recovered from it.

1047
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,728
Her sense of humor is coming back.

1048
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,113
Anyway, thanks for telling me.

1049
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,534
When I talk to Ik-sun, I'll pretend
not to know anything about this.

1050
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,035
Okay, sounds good.

1051
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,412
Professor.

1052
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,625
Please believe me.
Nothing's going on between me and Ik-sun.

1053
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,335
We're really just friends.

1054
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,672
Okay, I heard you. Jeez.

1055
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,509
You have your band practice
later today, right?

1056
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,428
May I stop by next time
and watch you practice?

1057
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,429
Sure!

1058
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,640
You can definitely come, but...

1059
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,600
You like Song-hwa, right?

1060
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,519
-I mean, you admire--
-Yes.

1061
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,775
I like her.

1062
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,993
Everyone likes Song-hwa.

1063
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,495
That's why she's always so busy.

1064
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,416
Anyway, when those who like her
see her playing her bass guitar...

1065
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,378
I'm sure you'll fall for her even more.
She's gotten so much better at it.

1066
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,921
She's such a nerd.

1067
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,758
I heard that she had to do
coil embolization. Would she be done?

1068
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,344
Yes, she should be almost done now.

1069
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,763
Good work, everyone.

1070
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,768
I know a good sujebi place nearby.

1071
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:06,978
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1072
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,940
Professor, you must be exhausted.
Did the surgery go well?

1073
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,193
We struggled to locate
the origin of the bleeding at first,

1074
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,111
but it went well.

1075
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,988
We managed to stop the bleeding,

1076
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:20,074
so we'll do a transfusion
and see how she recovers.

1077
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,410
When you're requesting a CBC,

1078
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,830
order a DIC as well.
And let me know when the results are out.

1079
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,083
Also, she's gotten a lot of blood,
so do a chest X-ray tomorrow.

1080
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,376
Got it.

1081
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,544
Professor.

1082
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,633
Did that patient make it?

1083
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,926
Of course, she's okay now.

1084
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,472
See you tomorrow.

1085
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,017
-See you.
-See you.

1086
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,103
Thank you.

1087
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,658
-We're late.
-All right, okay.

1088
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,159
Give me a minute.

1089
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,082
Jeez, I heard you!

1090
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,902
Sorry about that.

1091
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,322
Wait, sir. Your wallet.

1092
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,281
Thank you.

1093
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,375
Hey, what is this?

1094
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,212
Doors are opening.

1095
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,762
-Where are you headed?
-Doors are closing.

1096
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,180
-It's a secret.
-What?

1097
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,025
Hey, I'm in the lobby.

1098
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,290
It's understandable.

1099
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,375
He's just a middle-aged man
without his white coat.

1100
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,711
I didn't recognize him at all.
What do I do?

1101
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,130
It's okay. Professor Yang is cool
with these things.

1102
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,465
Don't worry about it.

1103
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,885
Girls, the moment
we take off our surgical gowns,

1104
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,512
we're back to being
just like anybody else.

1105
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,889
-Okay.
-Okay.

1106
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,850
I know it can get stressful, but think
that the patients can be your family

1107
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,226
and be patient.

1108
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,146
Give them a second chance
and try to be understanding.

1109
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,857
But no third chance.
Tell your supervisors right away.

1110
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,066
-Okay.
-Okay.

1111
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,905
Yeong-ju, did you say
your father is a doctor?

1112
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:07,575
Yes, but he's getting chemotherapy
after his cancer surgery at the moment.

1113
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,912
My gosh, is he okay?

1114
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:15,041
Yes! He always bad-mouths
his doctor and the hospital.

1115
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,210
He's doing great.

1116
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,589
-Over there.
-Oh, I see them.

1117
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,716
-Seok-hyeong!
-Ik-jun!

1118
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,801
What?

1119
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,470
What? What do you want?

1120
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,347
Sorry about that.

1121
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,848
Hey, dude.

1122
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,475
-You bumped into me.
-I'm hungry.

1123
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,228
-You're at it again.
-Gosh, you started this skit.

1124
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,704
Who's coming?

1125
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,670
I'll get all shy.

1126
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,172
You never let us down. Well done.

1127
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,966
Will he like it though?

1128
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,592
Then my mom will come too.

1129
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,684
Jong-su, when was the last time
you went to a concert?

1130
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,103
I don't know what songs
are popular these days.

1131
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,315
Jeong-won, can you guys perform a song
by Moon Ju-ran?

1132
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,693
Or something by Cho Mi-mi.

1133
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:27,738
We'll kick you out if you're going
to keep making such unreasonable requests.

1134
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,198
All right, fine.

1135
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,033
Get started, then.

1136
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,577
Yes, sir.

1137
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,037
I'm fine with anything,
but pick something upbeat.

1138
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,622
Pick something exciting, mister.

1139
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,666
"Mister"?

1140
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,626
Yes, ma'am.

1141
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:09,280
I met you by chance

1142
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,699
And your beauty stole my heart

1143
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,662
I met you by chance

1144
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,790
And your eyes captivated my heart

1145
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:25,963
There is something I want to tell you

1146
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:32,720
Why can't I muster up the courage?

1147
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:39,518
I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident

1148
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,563
My heart is pounding

1149
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:47,360
I shall let all this frustration

1150
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,196
Fly away in the wind

1151
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,241
I'm not a kid, Dad.

1152
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,576
I'll just eat it myself.

1153
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,161
To me, you're still a ten-year-old.

1154
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,375
And why do I have to eat porridge?

1155
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,419
I haven't even gotten the surgery yet.

1156
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,551
Dad, I want to eat fried chicken.

1157
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:46,771
That lady
Who is as beautiful as a blooming flower

1158
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,648
Stole my heart

1159
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,779
Her gorgeous eyes
That sparkle like morning dew

1160
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,490
Captivated my heart

1161
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:03,913
There is something I want to tell you

1162
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:09,877
Why can't I muster up the courage?

1163
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:17,259
I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident

1164
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,221
My heart is pounding

1165
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,975
A fool, such a fool

1166
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,437
I must be a fool

1167
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:49,625
There is something I want to tell you

1168
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:56,632
Why can't I muster up the courage?

1169
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:03,097
I want to say it to you
But I don't feel confident

1170
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,683
My heart is pounding

1171
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:10,312
A fool, such a fool

1172
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:14,692
I must be a fool

1173
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,764
That was amazing!

1174
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,767
-Hey! Goodness.
-Gosh, I'm sleepy.

1175
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,735
Daddy, take me with you.
I want to go with you.

1176
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,572
Hey, U-ju. I'll see you in the evening.

1177
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:02,823
You can wait, right?

1178
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,785
Okay, our goodbye ritual.

1179
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,581
There! Okay. See you later.

1180
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:41,904
My gosh.

1181
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,491
My gosh, Doctor!

1182
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,159
You actually came.

1183
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,121
WISHING YOU ABUNDANCE OF PROSPERITY
CHAE SONG-HWA

1184
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,123
Congratulations on your opening.

1185
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,042
Thank you.

1186
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,087
Honey, Dr. Chae is here. Come on out!

1187
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:02,007
No, that's okay. I can't stay anyway.

1188
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,760
I'm meeting someone in the area,
so I wanted to stop by.

1189
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,556
Have a great day.

1190
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,117
A guy is here to see you.

1191
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:31,036
He seemed to be in his late 30s,

1192
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:32,788
and he's handsome.

1193
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,297
What the...

1194
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:56,687
Surprised to see me?

1195
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,983
You're no fun.

1196
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,820
This one is for spicy fish stew.
All the ingredients are ready to go,

1197
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,363
so just boil them with the sauce.

1198
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,451
In this one, you'll find different kinds
of tripe. They're raw, so grill them.

1199
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,077
You have to grill them, okay?

1200
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,789
This is sundae and organ meats.
Things like the ears, liver, lung,

1201
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,167
intestines, kidneys, and so on.

1202
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,210
They're cooked,
so you can eat them right away.

1203
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,509
-Did something happen?
-No, not at all.

1204
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,595
-Are you getting remarried?
-No.

1205
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,847
-Is Mom ill?
-No, she's fine.

1206
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,308
-Is Dad ill?
-Jeez, I just came to see you.

1207
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,226
-Are you ill?
-Gosh, I'm off.

1208
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,437
I promised U-ju
I'd take him out for tonkatsu.

1209
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,356
I just stopped by on the way
to give you these.

1210
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,274
-Where's the restaurant?
-In Apgujeong-dong.

1211
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,321
I just came to see you, okay?

1212
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,450
You've been well, right?

1213
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:53,660
Yes.

1214
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,372
I've been well. What about you?

1215
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,082
I'm always well.

1216
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,959
I'm sorry for not visiting you often
and not taking

1217
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:04,046
better care of you.

1218
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:12,846
Bye.

1219
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,478
I should give you some spending money.

1220
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,647
Here.

1221
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,068
What?

1222
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,112
Are you crying?

1223
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,199
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

1224
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:36,912
You're nuts.

1225
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,872
I'm off. Take it easy.

1226
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,418
Call me if you're ever stressed out.

1227
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:46,839
I'm not busy at all,
so you can call me anytime.

1228
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:49,550
I'm off, for real this time.

1229
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,973
Okay. We'll go together.

1230
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,017
I have to go
if my girlfriend wants me to go.

1231
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,060
They're all nice people.

1232
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,145
-Hello.
-Hello.

1233
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,605
What is this?

1234
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:47,983
I guess you really want to see
the end of me.

1235
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,819
Ik-jun, how about a drink with me tonight?

1236
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,738
What? What's going on?

1237
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,949
I'd be a shame for Jeong-won
to quit his job as a doctor.

1238
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,951
There aren't a lot of doctors like him.

1239
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,496
What's up with your kids?

1240
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,540
Our dear Gyeo-ul must be dating someone!

1241
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:04,458
Really?

1242
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:07,127
If you like her, say so.
I'll keep it a secret.

1243
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,921
Jeong-won hasn't gone home yet.

1244
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,088
I have to see a patient.

1245
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:12,424
-I'll stay here.
-Professor, by any chance...

1246
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,968
You're not being jealous, are you?

1247
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,637
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

1248
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,597
No! When? What time?

1249
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,766
It's nice if you can rely on each other.

1250
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:22,851
Later.

1251
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:26,188
I'll tell you guys at once
when we're all together.

1252
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:30,442
-Who?
-Who's going to do the surgery?

1253
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,401
It'll be burdensome.

1254
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,363
It's a given to do well. If not,
it'll harm the hospital's reputation.

1255
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,865
The patient's condition is really bad
due to chronic rejection.

1256
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:39,701
I won't do it. I don't want to.

1257
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:41,620
Don't do it if you don't want to.

1258
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,664
I've told you though.

1259
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:47,000
The patient says no,
and Professor Cheon says to follow it.

1260
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,502
If I had an excuse,

1261
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,420
I don't want to proceed
a high risk operation

1262
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,089
It's not up to you.

1263
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,966
It's up to the doctor.

1264
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,718
Professor. What do I do?

1265
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,096
We must protect the baby
who came to us this time.

1266
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:00,931
If the doctor gives up on the patient,

1267
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:02,808
he isn't a doctor anymore.
