1
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,192
What kind of sick son of a bitch
does this?

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,450
Dr. Jang. Call the police.

3
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,660
-Sorry?
-It's child abuse, isn't it?

4
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,997
I think so.
These aren't bruises from a car accident.

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,875
Besides,
the bruises have different colors.

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,378
The bruises from long ago are lighter,

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,547
and the recent ones are more vivid.

8
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,467
Seeing that his back
is covered with bruises,

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,010
his father must beat him often.

10
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,054
Haven't you called the police yet?

11
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,402
-Wait!
-Hey!

12
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,990
-He needs surgery right now.
-Of course.

13
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,619
By the way, will Dr. Jang be all right
without her shoes?

14
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,084
I've called the police.
They'll be here in five minutes.

15
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,795
They'll bring a social worker with them.

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,548
Shouldn't someone follow Dr. Jang?

17
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,926
-You also called the security team, right?
-Yes.

18
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,595
She's so bold.

19
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,722
What if he has a knife or something?

20
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,311
By the way, Jae-yong's brother
was here yesterday as well.

21
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,688
Will he be all right?

22
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,648
His father said he broke his arm,

23
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,692
but the X-ray showed
he had broken ribs as well.

24
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,318
It did seem strange.

25
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,071
Let me see his X-ray.

26
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,887
What are you doing, you crazy bitch?

27
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,889
Let go. Let go of me.

28
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,892
Let go of me. Get lost!

29
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,073
Are you all right?

30
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,660
Yes. Thank you.

31
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
Let go of me.

32
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,169
Keep it up, guys.

33
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,837
Let go!

34
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,716
Do you have any proof that I beat him?

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,801
Let's go to the police station
and talk about it.

36
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,180
Hey, you doctor. Do you have any proof
that I beat my child?

37
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,015
Tell me.

38
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,311
The doctor suspects you've been
beating both of your sons.

39
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,854
Are they supposed to be gods or what?

40
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,232
Do they know everything that's happened?

41
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,485
They're my children. Okay?

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,613
They're my children, so I know better.

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,450
They only saw them for ten minutes.
What do they know?

44
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,787
If you think it's unfair,
you can explain yourself at the station.

45
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,581
-Let's go already.
-About Jae-hun.

46
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,381
He broke his arm when he fell off
the table yesterday.

47
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,510
I saw the X-ray,
and his right rib was broken too.

48
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,929
Yes, you're right. So what?

49
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,598
It's because he fell on his right side.

50
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,767
-So what?
-It's not every day

51
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,020
that you see someone break their arms
and ribs just from falling off the table.

52
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:37,235
And I also found that his lowest right rib
had healed from a previous fracture.

53
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,570
And the same goes for his lower left rib.

54
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,407
Do you have prior convictions for assault?

55
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,002
We were notified that you're wanted
for child abuse. You're under arrest.

56
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,006
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to explain yourself.

57
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,883
You also have the right
to challenge your arrest or detention.

58
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,432
You. I'll remember your face.

59
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,851
When we meet again, you'll pay for this.

60
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,811
Be careful. Okay?

61
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,479
-Let's go.
-Take him.

62
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,277
-You're the social worker, right?
-Yes.

63
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,487
The surgery will take two to three hours.

64
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,157
When he wakes up, he might be anxious.

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,034
So, please take good care of him.

66
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,869
-I will.
-Okay, then.

67
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,416
And his brother Jae-hun is at home.

68
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,252
He must be waiting for them, starving.

69
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,297
One of my colleagues should be there
by now. Don't worry.

70
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,424
Okay. Thank you.

71
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,762
Dr. Bae.

72
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,764
Good job.

73
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,933
I didn't think of checking
his brother's X-ray.

74
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,519
-Thank you.
-No problem.

75
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,315
See you, Gwang-hyeon.

76
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,525
Dr. Jang.

77
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,654
Hurry up and get ready for the surgery.

78
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,450
I've already called Anesthesiology.
When the surgery is approved,

79
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,577
send the patient to the OR.

80
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,371
Yes, Doctor.

81
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,970
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

82
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,225
I'm so hungry.

83
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,811
Let's go eat some barbeque.
I've already texted the others.

84
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,230
Oh, right. Did you take care of it?

85
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,439
Almost.

86
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,568
I never imagined this kind of thing
would happen.

87
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,445
God, I need some sweets. Do you have any?

88
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,780
Over there.

89
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,785
Then, the patient
Professor Kwon saw was fake?

90
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,287
Yes, they had me see the real son,

91
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,706
and had Professor Kwon see the fake one.

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,335
This punk... He's like a little kid.

93
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,713
We do two check-ups, a psychiatric test,

94
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,716
and a fingerprint registration.
It's really tight here.

95
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,845
-How did they think it was possible?
-Gosh.

96
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
The liver transplant
was the only way for Sim.

97
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,850
But since his son refused,
he had to take chances.

98
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,143
Jeez.

99
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,062
It was quite well-planned.

100
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,815
The real son went through
most of the check-ups,

101
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,233
and the fake one hid in the room

102
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,695
and showed his face
only to Professor Kwon and his nurse.

103
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,030
Since Professor Kwon is in charge
of the donor's surgery,

104
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,159
the fake son had to greet him
every time he came in.

105
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,787
On top of that, they've chosen
the fake son quite elaborately

106
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,582
with a candidate who was checked up
for a year at another hospital.

107
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,002
They would've gotten caught
on the day of the surgery anyway.

108
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,712
Hey. Give me some too.

109
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,131
Here.

110
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,635
They knew that the donor and recipient
could have different medical teams.

111
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,137
That's what they were hoping for.

112
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,681
They knew I was in charge of Sim

113
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,225
and Professor Kwon was in charge
of his son.

114
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,103
They thought we might not know
about each other's patients.

115
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,106
Did they think the hospital
is that stupid?

116
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,691
And what about me?

117
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,776
Do they think that
all I do is perform surgery?

118
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,821
They don't know that I constantly
check up on all the patients.

119
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,072
Hey.

120
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,034
Stop eating that.
Jun-wan is keeping count.

121
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,328
-That's his favorite.
-What a freak.

122
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,123
By the way, where the hell is he?

123
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,000
-We have a tight schedule today.
-I don't know.

124
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,878
He took the day off.
I saw him go somewhere, all dressed up.

125
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,672
He said he'll meet us
at the barbecue place.

126
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,257
-He must be meeting a girl.
-Of course.

127
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,344
I knew it. He's been single for too long.

128
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,262
I'm guessing three months, as usual.

129
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,807
He's pretty good-looking,

130
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,393
but how come he can't date
longer than three months?

131
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,521
Hey, Ik-jun, did you see this?

132
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,897
What's that?

133
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,858
The donor disguised as the fake son

134
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,110
is an employee
at Seok-hyeong's dad's company.

135
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,156
Where's Seok-hyeong?

136
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,368
I don't know. Maybe in the OR?

137
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,498
Good work, everyone.

138
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,333
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

139
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,843
CONGRESSMAN SIM CAUGHT
SWITCHING HIS LIVER DONOR

140
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,820
You're renovating the place?

141
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,448
When?
Where are you going to be staying then?

142
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,200
It starts tomorrow.

143
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,452
Why can't he just leave the house be?

144
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,038
It's not like you're getting married.
Why all of a sudden?

145
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,291
How can you take a shower
in that bathroom?

146
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,501
I'm just renovating the bathroom.
It's old.

147
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,295
They'll be staying at my place
for a while.

148
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,463
But what about my cute U-ju?

149
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,091
He went to Changwon with Auntie Wang.

150
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,927
Seok-hyeong, aren't you drinking too much?

151
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,263
You should stop.
This is your third can of soda.

152
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,640
Just drink some beer, man.
They won't call you this late.

153
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,683
You're so frustrating.

154
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,811
Hey. You are just like my family.

155
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,523
Don't you think
this bean powder is like my family?

156
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
You're right.

157
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,319
It is like your family. Right, guys?

158
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,697
His family is in pieces
like the bean powder. Jeez.

159
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,574
Hey, your dad is really...

160
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,953
What's wrong with your dad?

161
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,955
He cheated on your mom

162
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
and coaxed his employee
into organ trafficking.

163
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,169
And he was charged
with tax evasion last year.

164
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,171
He paid 10 billion won
in penalty tax alone.

165
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,342
Hey, you got nothing?

166
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,177
-Me?
-Just tell me.

167
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,682
When I was a freshman,

168
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,727
I went down to the basement
for band practice.

169
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,397
I was the first to arrive,
so I was practicing the drums alone.

170
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,316
It was then that Seok-hyeong's dad came

171
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,694
and sent me on an errand
for a pack of cigarettes.

172
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,989
-What about it?
-Could it be?

173
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
He didn't give me the money for it.

174
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,121
He still hasn't paid me.

175
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,791
It was 1,100 won. 88 Light.
It was unbelievable.

176
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,877
Excuse me.
Two more servings of pork belly, please.

177
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,922
-And a miser bowl of soup, please.
-Okay.

178
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,256
-Seok-hyeong.
-Yes?

179
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,175
He's not arrested, though.

180
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,720
Can you believe that? I don't get it.

181
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,765
I bet he used his heart condition
to get off lightly.

182
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,891
What about your mom?

183
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,143
She doesn't really care.

184
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,187
But I think she actually wants him jailed.

185
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,481
-Here's the pork belly.
-She should get divorced like me.

186
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,069
We're so cool these days. We talk about
heavy topics like they're nothing.

187
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,988
-We're like grown-ups.
-What's wrong with divorce?

188
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,408
Is it a sin to be divorced?

189
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,284
Seok-hyeong, is it a sin to get a divorce?

190
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,286
-Yes, it's a sin.
-You jerk.

191
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,289
I still feel bad for my ex-wife.

192
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,836
She went through a lot of trouble
because of me and my family.

193
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,921
You did good, getting that divorce.

194
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,135
We are busy tonight. Hurry up and eat.

195
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,180
We should go practice and do other stuff.
We're busy.

196
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,099
Gosh, it's 9 p.m. already.

197
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,601
The night is deep

198
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,480
-Lights that wander and dance
-It's hot.

199
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,357
It's good.

200
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,484
Intoxicated by the night

201
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,069
-And the alcohol
-And the alcohol

202
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,489
I'm stumbling

203
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,577
It's nearing dawn

204
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,331
But I'm still alone

205
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,002
This feeling

206
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,965
Isn't too bad

207
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,177
I want to stay

208
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,140
By your side forever

209
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,934
Intoxicated by the night

210
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,394
-And the alcohol
-And the alcohol

211
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,148
I want to get away

212
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,943
I don't know

213
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,948
If you can understand my sadness

214
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,535
My darling shoes

215
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:12,124
Please, don't leave me

216
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,544
-Watching the stars appear
-Watching the stars appear

217
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,797
-Blossoming like a fairy tale
-Blossoming like a fairy tale

218
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,844
-I get on the carriage, drunk
-I get on the carriage, drunk

219
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,933
-And catch myself a moon tonight
-And catch myself a moon tonight

220
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,811
Even if just once

221
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,230
-Don't go
-Don't go

222
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,857
-If you could smile for me
-Don't go

223
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,111
-Don't leave me behind
-Even if it were a lie

224
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,821
-Don't go
-Don't go

225
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,241
I would pluck a star for you

226
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,537
-Don't leave me behind
-When morning comes

227
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,038
-Don't go
-Don't go

228
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,582
-Stars will disappear
-Don't leave me

229
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,836
-Don't leave me behind
-What am I to do

230
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,547
-Don't go
-Don't go

231
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,510
-I would rather you just leave me
-I would rather you just leave me

232
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,721
-Watching the stars appear
-Watching the stars appear

233
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,225
-Blossoming like a fairy tale
-Blossoming like a fairy tale

234
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,269
The patient is looking for me. I'm off.

235
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,981
-I get on the carriage, drunk
-No, I need you for something.

236
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,315
Hey!

237
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,777
Guys, a recipient is suddenly refusing
to go through with the transplant.

238
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,321
-I got to go.
-Don't go

239
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,908
-Don't leave me behind
-Don't leave me behind

240
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,997
-Tonight I want to stay at your feet
-Tonight I want to stay at your feet

241
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,626
-Like bright red flower petals
-Like bright red flower petals

242
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,342
But the NST was fine in the afternoon.

243
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,013
Yes, but the late deceleration suddenly
dropped to 70 and it won't recover.

244
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,098
Professor. Come straight to
the treatment room, okay?

245
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,433
Okay.

246
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
How can a father

247
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,446
do this to his child?

248
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,950
Doctor.

249
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,621
I can't have this surgery.

250
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,960
Bin has made an important decision.

251
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,713
She didn't visit you today on purpose,

252
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,967
so that you won't cry and maintain
the optimum condition for the surgery.

253
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,721
Sir, you're making it harder for Bin.

254
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,647
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt at all.

255
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,357
Okay?

256
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,360
It's not for you, but for Bin.

257
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,781
I will make sure that she
doesn't feel any pain.

258
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,824
Don't worry about it.

259
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,586
I heard you used to be a detective,
but you're such a crybaby.

260
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,474
-Happy birthday!
-Surprise!

261
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,228
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

262
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,438
-Dear Professor Yang
-Dear Professor Yang

263
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,273
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

264
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,198
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

265
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,451
Professor.

266
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,709
I'm going home.

267
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,129
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

268
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,714
-Hello.
-Hello.

269
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,925
Seok-hyeong was called to the hospital.

270
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,136
He already told me. Thank you.

271
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,096
Try these.

272
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,348
I bought them myself.

273
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,809
Thank you.

274
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,853
Why don't stay over tonight, Song-hwa?

275
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,229
Pardon?

276
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,565
It's late. Why don't you stay the night?

277
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,608
I've cleaned Seok-hyeong's room.

278
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,572
You should.

279
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,994
If something goes wrong with the donor,

280
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,247
it'll be hard on me too.

281
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,625
I'll do my best for Bin's surgery.

282
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,794
While I do that,

283
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,757
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok will remove
your husband's liver.

284
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,968
The surgeries will be performed
at the same time.

285
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,720
When your husband's liver is removed,

286
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,556
and the necessary
preparations are complete,

287
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,559
I'll transplant the liver to your husband.

288
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,810
It'll take...

289
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,357
around 10 to 12 hours
from anesthesia to surgery.

290
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,027
If I come out in the middle
of the surgery, it's bad.

291
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,739
But if I don't, you can be relieved
that the surgery is going well

292
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,617
even if it takes longer than expected.

293
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,704
Is my daughter's surgery a tough one?

294
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,624
All surgeries are tough.

295
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,210
But since she's young and healthy,

296
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,129
and because of her determination,

297
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,257
I'm sure Bin will do just fine.

298
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,175
But

299
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,303
your husband's veins are dilated

300
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,472
from the severe cirrhosis he's suffered,

301
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,975
so it might be difficult to stop
the bleeding during the surgery.

302
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,354
I'm sure they've explained it in detail
when you signed the consent form...

303
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,523
Why aren't you asleep?

304
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,442
Don't worry, Mom.

305
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,779
I heard he performs
this surgery all the time.

306
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,447
I wouldn't say "all the time."

307
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,034
I guess you're right.
I do it "all the time."

308
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,411
You're braver than your dad.

309
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,081
She's better than I am.

310
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,377
Bin, let's sleep together tonight.

311
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,587
Gosh, forget it.

312
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,589
Bye, doctor.

313
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,760
Sure.

314
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,599
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

315
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,489
We're going to go slow.

316
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,495
You said that your husband was strong.
I guess he isn't.

317
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,916
What kind of father

318
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,503
takes his own daughter's liver to live?

319
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,509
I'm such a horrible father.

320
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,722
Sir, I'm sure the surgery will go well.

321
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,850
Try to think of it as
going into a deep sleep.

322
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,604
You need to calm down so that you
can be at optimum condition

323
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,814
for the surgery to be successful.

324
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,447
Be careful.

325
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,407
-Hello.
-Hi.

326
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,162
Lean against my back, honey.

327
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,748
God, I'm fine. Stop that.

328
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,004
Doctor, why is my baby not coming out yet?

329
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,965
-I don't think the baby wants to meet us.
-Don't say that.

330
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,426
Let's give it a few more days.
It's due soon.

331
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,971
There's nothing wrong with her, right?
Is she fine?

332
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,973
Yes, everything looks good.

333
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,516
Thank you.

334
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,978
The mother's been doing a great job,
so everything's good.

335
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,232
Leave the rest to me and try to relax.

336
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,609
Eat well and sleep well,

337
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,236
then you'll be fine.

338
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,406
-Well, I have a question.
-Okay.

339
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,575
Are you married, Doctor?

340
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,911
Yes. Pardon?

341
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:50,207
I've been thinking that
you're such a good person.

342
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,292
I'd like to set you up with someone.

343
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,213
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

344
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,298
I guess you have a girlfriend.

345
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,219
No, I don't. But still, it's fine.

346
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,472
You're 37 weeks pregnant.

347
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,433
So please come to the hospital right away
whenever your belly hurts, okay?

348
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,852
I have a question too.

349
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,355
When she gives birth,

350
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,692
is it okay for me to sing a song
in the delivery room?

351
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,987
Come on. I told you, don't do that.
We'll get going.

352
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,824
I've been singing the baby a song.
I'm sure my baby will love it.

353
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,951
I really want to--

354
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,995
Honey, I'm--

355
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,417
Gently.

356
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,795
That's too strong. Hold back a little.

357
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,673
You'll cut through it
if you put too much pressure.

358
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,091
Okay. I'm sorry.

359
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,635
-Didn't you get much sleep last night?
-No.

360
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,886
I mean, I did.

361
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,596
What? You were off yesterday.

362
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,182
Professor Cheon Myeong-tae asked him
to examine 200 people

363
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,185
to use as the data for his thesis
by today, so stayed up all night.

364
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,813
Who's Professor Cheon Myeong-tae?

365
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,190
A new professor who started last week.
Don't you know him?

366
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,318
No. Is he famous?

367
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,612
Yes, he's famous for being
hard on his patients.

368
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,872
I've done some research and read

369
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,875
that aortic valve replacement is
usually done

370
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,544
by minimally invasive method
in other countries.

371
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,296
-Are you a doctor?
-Sorry?

372
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,593
No, I'm just asking because I'm worried.

373
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,678
Then surgeries are fine.

374
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,889
Well, then.

375
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,143
Let's go, Dad.

376
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,230
I'll leave the rest to you, Dr. Do.

377
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,315
Professor.

378
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,402
Don't abandon me, okay?

379
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,241
If you abandon me,
I'll be sold to another hospital.

380
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,785
Focus!

381
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,667
Let's focus.

382
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,171
Then who'll take Geon-hui?

383
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,672
Dr. Ahn will.

384
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,094
Hong Geon-hui, a five-year-old boy.

385
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,888
He passed out while blowing a balloon
and was taken to the ER.

386
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,766
According to the CT angiography,
we suspect it may be Moyamoya disease.

387
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,102
And we've made the arrangements
for a TFCA this afternoon.

388
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,438
He's currently on a ventilator
and is being hydrated.

389
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,065
His condition is quite stable.

390
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,525
What causes this disease?

391
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,319
I think it's genetic...

392
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,739
There's a good chance

393
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,492
that children will get Moyamoya disease
if their parents have it.

394
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,077
However, not all of them do.

395
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,871
So it's not entirely genetic.

396
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,291
Chi-hong, what do we have
to watch out for the most?

397
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,293
We can't let him cry.

398
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,922
If he cries and yells, it'll constrict
the blood vessel in his brain

399
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,924
and lower the blood flow to his brain,

400
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,510
which will result
in a seizure or hemiplegia.

401
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,304
That's correct. You can't let him cry.

402
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,683
-That's so hard.
-Indeed, it's hard.

403
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,893
Be careful when you take his CT.

404
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,687
Calm him down before you take it.

405
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,356
If it doesn't work,
you might have to give him Pocral.

406
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,692
-It's safest to put him to sleep.
-Okay.

407
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,361
Watch him closely and act accordingly.

408
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,405
I think that'll be enough.

409
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,074
What about lunch, Seok-min?

410
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,327
Dr. Do will buy lunch since
his installment savings matured today.

411
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,662
I can join, right?

412
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,291
Dr. Do, the infamous miser, is buying.
I have to be there.

413
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,084
Is he a miser?

414
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,712
Yes, totally.
He's like a legend at the hospital.

415
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,923
His monthly allowance is 100,000 won.
I heard he saves half of his monthly wage.

416
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,300
That's amazing.

417
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,053
All right, then. Have a nice lunch.

418
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,681
What about me? I'm available.

419
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,184
-What?
-I'm free for lunch.

420
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,476
Why aren't you going?

421
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,312
You're not? It's a historical moment.

422
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,981
No, I won't.
I'll just have lunch with you.

423
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,734
Okay. Let's go.

424
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,068
I'll buy you something fancy

425
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,529
-at the Professors' Cafeteria.
-Really? What about me?

426
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,865
-You should've said sooner.
-Too late.

427
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,285
I'm taking Chi-hong only. Let's go.

428
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,500
-I'll hold the portal vein.
-Okay, the hemostat's ready.

429
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,550
-Is the perfusion ready?
-Yes.

430
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,135
I'll hold the hepatic artery.

431
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,098
It went well. It looks clean.

432
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,851
Dr. Kim, there's no bleeding, right?

433
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,937
Check for bleeding and wrap it up, please.

434
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,647
Good job, Doctor.

435
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,776
Go get some rest. You have to perform
the transplant surgery.

436
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,403
They're still doing hepatectomy.

437
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,696
Okay, I will.

438
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,743
Keep it up, people. You too, Gyeo-ul.

439
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,245
Sure.

440
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,375
-Give me the vascular clamp.
-What's the vital?

441
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,543
BP is 90-60 and the pulse rate is at 100.

442
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,003
Suction. I can't see.

443
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,130
More suction. And gauze.

444
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,549
-I brought three bags of RBC.
-Wider.

445
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,218
A bit more. I can't see.

446
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,136
-Widen it more, please.
-Give me another lever.

447
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,430
-Get me a full dose of--
-Keep suctioning.

448
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,891
Gauze. There.

449
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,102
-Bring more blood.
-Wider, please.

450
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,689
Is he bleeding too much? Is he okay?

451
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,608
There's an opening in the IVC,
but I can't get to it.

452
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,277
Anesthesiology, are his vitals okay?

453
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,531
He's been bleeding quite a bit,
but his vitals are okay now.

454
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,199
Thank you. You want me to join?

455
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,159
I think you should.

456
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,577
Keep pressing on it. I'm going in.

457
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,169
Anesthesiology, we got the major bleeding.

458
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,256
The liver was surrounding the IVC,

459
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,009
so it started bleeding while we were
removing it. This is hard.

460
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,137
You know Professor Kwon,
the master of liver transplants, right?

461
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,973
-Yes.
-On his first surgery as a fellow,

462
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,685
his patient started bleeding
the moment he opened the chest.

463
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,564
He was removed after stopping the blood.
He didn't even get to see the liver.

464
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,815
I see.

465
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,443
It's okay. This happens a lot.

466
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,404
And when this happens again,
you'll do better.

467
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,198
If you can't, call me again.

468
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,700
Okay. Thank you.

469
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,702
And we have to save him no matter what.

470
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,620
If anything goes wrong, Bin will kill me.

471
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,040
Okay.

472
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,794
The specimen is coming out.

473
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,258
You've never failed
to make a single deposit.

474
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,428
It's hard enough to make 60 payments
over 5 years,

475
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:22,140
but you've never even been late once.
You're amazing.

476
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,434
So, how much is it in total?

477
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,977
You're withdrawing a mature saving.

478
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,898
Including the principal and interest
of the last five years excluding tax,

479
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,692
it's 100,128,480 won.

480
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,987
It's been wired to your account.
Congratulations.

481
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,032
One, ten, a hundred...

482
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,161
And this is a gift
from the branch manager.

483
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,789
I get a gift too?

484
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,375
You've been our regular for five years.
This is nothing.

485
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,418
The manager also sent you
his congratulations.

486
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,295
This is enough to last me a year.

487
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,590
Sorry? You shouldn't be like that now.

488
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,883
Your wife must not like it.

489
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,136
She doesn't even turn the lights on
in the house before 8 p.m.

490
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,141
Honey.

491
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,310
We have 100 million now.

492
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,562
No, 100 million!

493
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,107
Bye.

494
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,819
I know. I felt bad since
I always mooched off them.

495
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,196
I'll treat them to something nice.

496
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,873
Seriously?

497
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,459
I'm sorry.
I'll buy you pork belly next time.

498
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,169
Thanks for the food.

499
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,839
Come on. Eat already.

500
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,716
For him, it's like he's buying beef.

501
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,346
I'm sorry, Seok-min. I really am.

502
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,682
I've sent all the money
to my wife right away.

503
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,143
I wanted to show her that
we do have 100 million won.

504
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,271
Did you say 100 million?
How much did you deposit per month?

505
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,772
It was 1.6 million a month.

506
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,274
Is that even possible?

507
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,068
Of course. He doesn't spend
any money at all.

508
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,363
Still, what about the maintenance fee
for the house,

509
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,824
the phone bill and other living costs?

510
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,909
My wife works full-time as well.

511
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,954
She's never taken a single day off
since we've married.

512
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,124
We've saved up for 10 years
and now it's exactly 100 million.

513
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,543
What will you do with that money?

514
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,794
Well...

515
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,088
I'm leasing a house tomorrow.

516
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,591
Congrats!

517
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,470
I'm really happy right now.

518
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,390
I know it's a small apartment,
but it's on a deposit basis.

519
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:28,933
How much is it?

520
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,646
With a loan and the money I've saved up,
it's 200 million won.

521
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,440
Read the contract carefully.

522
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,609
There's been a lot of scams
on the news lately.

523
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,820
Hey, I've studied for ten years
to be where I am.

524
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,071
I don't need your advice.

525
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,907
What about the landlord?

526
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,159
Mind your own business.

527
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,370
The real estate agencies
take care of everything now.

528
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,456
You should set aside
at least half a million.

529
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,417
You and your wife should go on a trip
on the weekend.

530
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,085
A trip?

531
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,421
-What's a trip?
-The weekend?

532
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,423
What's a weekend?

533
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,604
It's so hot.

534
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,982
Why is it so hot?

535
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,275
Aren't I amazing?

536
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,237
I've grown all of them myself
just like how I've brought you up.

537
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,989
You have a bad back.
You shouldn't be farming.

538
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,368
And Mom, eating only vegetables
is not that healthy.

539
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,455
These are organic. No pesticides.
It's healthy.

540
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,750
It's more like you couldn't spray them
because of your bad back.

541
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,462
And you should have
a more balanced diet at your age.

542
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,673
Okay. Eat now, it's getting cold.

543
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,385
Protein, iron, omega-3, and calcium.

544
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,555
Your anemia and dizziness
come from lack of nutrition.

545
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,056
I'm eating well,

546
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,724
-so worry about yourself.
-You're not.

547
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,519
Eat like this, and you'll suffer
from malnutrition.

548
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,437
Look over there.

549
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,820
See? I really am eating well.

550
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,281
If you have all of that,
then you're a drug addict.

551
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,450
I'll just live like this until I croak.
Be quiet and eat.

552
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,661
-Why...
-Hey, try this.

553
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,456
It's seasoned aster.
I made it myself, and it's divine.

554
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,835
Jeez, I can't argue with you.

555
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,756
It's good.

556
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,555
By the way, about the thing
I told you about last time...

557
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,015
We need red pepper paste.

558
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,699
This is insane.
How can it be so delicious?

559
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,409
Right? It's divine, right?

560
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,078
-It's heavenly.
-Try this too.

561
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,880
I've talked to my brother,
asked my sisters,

562
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,090
and even asked
the Seoul Archdiocese about this.

563
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,886
It's difficult in Korea
because of the age limit,

564
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,931
but I can study to become
a priest in Italy.

565
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,727
I've sent the letter of recommendation
and I'm waiting to hear from them.

566
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,230
I think I'll regret it
if I don't do it any sooner

567
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,650
Mom.

568
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,652
Mom.

569
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,696
You can't. Studying to become a priest?

570
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,907
Study to become a groom in Korea.

571
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,954
-You don't even have a girlfriend?
-Gosh...

572
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,206
Your brothers and sisters could,
but not you.

573
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,041
I'll get too lonely.

574
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,922
Jong-su and Seok-hyeong's moms
will be here soon. Hurry and eat.

575
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,261
It's so hot.

576
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,396
Stronger.

577
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,859
Mom.

578
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,367
You're good.

579
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,454
You must be dexterous
since you're a surgeon.

580
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,790
Delicacy is the most important
for a surgeon.

581
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,336
Don't just remove the heads.
Remove the wastes in the middle.

582
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,255
Goodness.

583
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,509
How are we supposed
to do all of this by hand?

584
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,390
You know the laparoscope, right?

585
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,267
Tell her we used that.

586
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,355
Stop right there. Hands in the air.

587
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,360
Didn't I tell you to keep the head
because I'm going to use them?

588
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,862
You did, ma'am.

589
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,740
But you threw away the heads
and didn't even remove the wastes.

590
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,034
I did.

591
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,661
It's just a few of them.

592
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,539
There isn't even 20.

593
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,583
Okay, let's see.

594
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,670
I can't remember which is which.

595
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,839
I'll do it again.

596
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,758
I'll find them all.

597
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,801
Find every single one of them, okay?

598
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,553
If there's even a single drop

599
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,222
that I find while cooking my broth,
I'm going to kill you.

600
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,058
Yes, ma'am.

601
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,437
Director, pass me the trimmed ones.

602
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,897
Sure, ma'am.

603
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,567
Hurry up. You have to trim
the spring onions after this.

604
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,904
Darn it. I came because
you said you'll cook us to noodles,

605
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,405
but I guess it was just a trap.

606
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,618
To be honest, how could the two of us
trim all of these?

607
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,746
Have you no conscience?

608
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,502
God... How come every one of them
has the waste?

609
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,753
Here's one more.

610
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,469
So, that woman who's dressed
like Audrey Hepburn

611
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,639
from head to toe is

612
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,017
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong's mother?

613
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,645
Yes. She's Dr. Yang's mother

614
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,814
and the wife of Chairman Yang Tae-yang

615
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,441
-of Taegeon Apparel.
-I see.

616
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,069
I should help you,

617
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,238
but I'm not feeling well. I'm sorry.

618
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,908
It's okay. We're almost done.

619
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,578
Ma'am, would you like some coffee?
Iced? Hot?

620
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,704
Coffee?

621
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,999
By the way, why are you not married?

622
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,668
Okay, iced it is.

623
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,462
I think I have enough now.

624
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,297
-Really?
-Yes.

625
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,384
Oh, my back.

626
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,389
Hey, my puppy.

627
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,892
You called me
because you missed your grandpa?

628
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,770
-What game?
-What's the point of having

629
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,022
-children who are doctors and lawyers?
-You do what?

630
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,650
Their dad can't even
have proper meals on time.

631
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,444
I told you to dress casually.

632
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,488
You can be comfortable around them.

633
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,824
I am dressed casually.

634
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,165
Do what?

635
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,458
The mafia game.

636
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,294
-Is that it?
-Yes.

637
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,381
My grandson is coming next weekend,

638
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,385
and he wants me to play the mafia game
with him. What do I do?

639
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,389
You can do it.
A lot of young people play it. It's fun.

640
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,267
It must be fun since The Godfather is fun.

641
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,438
Yes. To put it simply,

642
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,524
one of you is chosen as the mafia.

643
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,444
And the rest of you
will be innocent civilians.

644
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,363
When you're chosen as the mafia,
you have to pretend to be a civilian

645
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,865
to not get caught by them.

646
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,951
The goal is to figure out
who the mafia is.

647
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,954
I see. That's easy.

648
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,916
We have to find out
which one of us is lying, then.

649
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,836
That's right. I'll lead the game.

650
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,298
Since there are four of you, if a civilian
dies in the first round, it's game over.

651
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,175
The mafia will win.

652
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,093
Do you all understand the rules?

653
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,388
I'm good at fishing out people
who are hiding things.

654
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,307
-I think I can ace this game.
-Same here.

655
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,726
If we're playing a game,
there should be a prize.

656
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,770
We don't win anything? No prizes?

657
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,855
Right. Hold on.

658
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,774
Here.

659
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,817
I got them from the hospital.

660
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,694
Those are the tickets I gave out.

661
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,406
Yes. These are recital tickets
I got from the hospital.

662
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,742
-How come I didn't get one?
-I didn't get one, either.

663
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,536
They only gave me ten tickets.

664
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,914
So I gave the tickets to the doctors
at the VIP Ward

665
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,457
to thank them for their hard work.

666
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,503
Besides, you don't know much
about classical music anyway.

667
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,382
You should've given me the tickets.
Why bring them out here?

668
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,467
You can win the game and take the tickets.

669
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,844
Besides, you're not even interested
in classical music.

670
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,137
Go with your girlfriend.

671
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,722
I don't have a girlfriend!

672
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,057
Why don't you have one?

673
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,059
You're a handsome doctor
at a university hospital.

674
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,811
You should have a girlfriend.

675
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,229
He doesn't have one

676
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,606
because he hangs out with his friends
and plays in the band.

677
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,193
Seok-hyeong might not have a girlfriend
since he's divorced,

678
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,404
but why don't you have a girlfriend?

679
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,447
Is there anyone you're interested in?

680
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,574
-There is.
-Who?

681
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,618
The Lord.

682
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,621
Mom!

683
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,125
I'm leaving.

684
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,627
No. You can't leave yet.

685
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,337
Professor Ahn, sit down.

686
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,715
You need to teach us
how to play the game before you go.

687
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,259
You should let him eat in peace.

688
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,470
What's so bad about being religious?

689
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,348
-Right.
-You love Him a lot, too.

690
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,394
-Exactly.
-Seriously. You're so selfish.

691
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,979
What's that?

692
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:38,983
It's...

693
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,070
It's seaweed.

694
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,452
All right. We'll begin now.

695
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,954
After I announce, "It is night,"

696
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,789
I will pick someone as the mafia.

697
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,084
And when I say, "It is morning,"

698
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,213
that's when you start looking for
who is in the mafia.

699
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,174
We have to do this all night?

700
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,801
That must be why
only young people play this game.

701
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,470
I have an appointment in the afternoon.

702
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,680
Then you should leave early.

703
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,933
Since we're all here,
let's give it a go at least once.

704
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,228
You're all available
this afternoon, right?

705
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,105
Jeong-won, do you have any plans?

706
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,903
All right. It is night.

707
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,864
Everyone. Close your eyes
and lower your head.

708
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,993
Now, I'm going to choose someone
to be the mafia.

709
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,870
All right.

710
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,957
Now, the mafia will--

711
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,960
It's me. I'm the mafia.

712
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,420
It's her.

713
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,172
I felt something go past me.

714
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,259
-It's me.
-Congrats.

715
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,555
All right. It's morning.

716
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,893
Now, you have to find out
who the mafia is.

717
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,104
Stop tapping the floor now.

718
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,275
-It's not me.
-We didn't say anything.

719
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,444
I'm not a yakuza, either.

720
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,490
This game isn't called "Yakuza."
It's called "Mafia."

721
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,076
What about you?

722
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,996
You're stupid.
I'm not supposed to tell you.

723
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,958
Whatever you are,
you should say that you're a civilian.

724
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,418
Why won't you say that?

725
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,045
Really? I can say that?

726
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,464
I'm a civilian.

727
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,218
You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?

728
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,221
-Aren't you the mafia?
-Me? No, I'm not.

729
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,806
Hold on.

730
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:38,477
Since it's advantageous for you
to suspect me as the mafia,

731
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,189
I should say that I am in the mafia.

732
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,567
I am the mafia. I'm not a civilian.

733
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,610
How do you run the foundation
with that brain?

734
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,528
Just retire soon.

735
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,905
-Don't run our hospital into the ground.
-What do you mean?

736
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,742
As soon as I took over the hospital,
our profit skyrocketed.

737
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,497
And thanks to her husband, our hospital
is covered by the press a lot these days.

738
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,957
Our hospital is doing very well.

739
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,586
Why is your face getting so red?

740
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,380
-Me?
-Yes.

741
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,758
-Are you the mafia?
-Your face is redder than his.

742
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,303
Aren't you in the mafia?
You've been quite chatty.

743
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,180
No, I'm not. How can I be the mafia?

744
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,267
No one in the mafia would openly say
that they are in the mafia.

745
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,643
It's really not me!

746
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,312
Jong-su, say something.

747
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,357
Rosa isn't the mafia.

748
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,734
How do you know that?

749
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,486
Because I'm the mafia.

750
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,030
What is he doing?

751
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,657
Did Jeong-won tap you
on your shoulder or not?

752
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,828
-He didn't.
-Jong-su, be quiet.

753
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,372
Seeing how you keep trying
to eliminate me,

754
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,916
I think you are the mafia.

755
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,501
-Shall we vote?
-Let's do it.

756
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,002
I think you're in the mafia.

757
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,378
I'm sure of it, too.

758
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,963
Let's vote Rosa out.

759
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,090
My gosh. It's really not me!

760
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,343
I'm not in the mafia.

761
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,178
Jong-su, don't you believe me?

762
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,554
I do.

763
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,932
Everyone. I am the mafia.

764
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,642
Forget it. Just vote.

765
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,393
Professor Ahn, proceed.

766
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,397
-Fine, let's vote. It's two against two.
-You can't vote if someone calls you out.

767
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,358
Why are there so many rules?

768
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,401
Change the rule so I can vote
since it's my house.

769
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,903
Yes. Let her vote.

770
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:14,365
All right. The voting will take place.

771
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:18,077
If you believe Jeong Rosa is the mafia,

772
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,328
raise your thumb

773
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,247
-facing up.
-Yes.

774
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,626
Hey.

775
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,338
I'm sorry.

776
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,882
How could you betray me like this?

777
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,426
And the votes are in.

778
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,933
Jeong Rosa,
an innocent civilian, has died.

779
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,810
I told you that it wasn't me!

780
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,772
The person in the mafia was

781
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,525
Ju Jong-su.

782
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,152
What? You bastard!

783
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,906
Jeez. What the...

784
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,118
I should have known.
You were always so sly.

785
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,580
You even look like a weasel. You fraud.

786
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,499
You lied in elementary school
saying that you went to feed the cows

787
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,544
when you went to the hill and
drank makgeolli. I should've known then.

788
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,879
This is just a game.

789
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,591
This is how you play this game.

790
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,467
Aren't I right, Professor Ahn?

791
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,177
Totally.

792
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,432
Whether it is a game or gambling,

793
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,934
your true colors are bound to show
when you play.

794
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,894
Even if you had to betray someone,

795
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,021
how could you betray

796
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,981
your best friend of 65 years?
How could you?

797
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,067
I was just playing the game
the best I could.

798
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,028
-Give me that. I'll do it.
-Forget it.

799
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,571
-Give me that.
-My gosh.

800
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,655
-Come here.
-Oh, no.

801
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,033
-Wait.
-Stop it. My gosh.

802
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,744
-Hold on.
-Goodness!

803
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,995
-How could you?
-Hey.

804
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,462
Hey, Seok-hyeong.
Did you deliver the baby?

805
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,006
Yes. Mom, how was it?

806
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,092
Wasn't it uncomfortable
with strangers around?

807
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,637
Let's go to a hot spring next weekend.

808
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,097
I found a good hot spring in Gangwon-do.

809
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,351
I want to hang out with them
next weekend, too.

810
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,727
What?

811
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,187
Really?

812
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,608
I haven't laughed this much
since I got old.

813
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,153
I've never met people who are
as entertaining as they are my whole life.

814
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,032
Thank you, son.

815
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,786
Tell Jeong-won that I thanked him.

816
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,164
I had a lot of fun in a long while.

817
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,292
Okay.

818
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,971
You're back already?

819
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,432
Why did you order so much?

820
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,309
I heard another nurse will be joining us.

821
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,396
So there are only three of us.
We can't have all of that.

822
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,749
She eats so much,
but she doesn't gain weight.

823
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,710
I know. Gosh, it's so annoying.

824
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,464
Didn't you say you were going to a musical
with your boyfriend last weekend?

825
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,508
-Was it good?
-We broke up.

826
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,676
Why?

827
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,387
He suddenly asked me
how much my annual salary was.

828
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,432
I thought he might help me
with my investments, so I told him.

829
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,725
After that, he asked me
what my father does for a living.

830
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,563
I thought his questions
were a bit childish.

831
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,565
I was slightly irritated,

832
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,067
and I began to question his intentions.

833
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,028
I told him that my father ran
a guesthouse in Gangwon-do.

834
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,238
And what happened?

835
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,615
In case he thought we ran a fancy resort,

836
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,201
I told him it was a small guesthouse
at the foot of Seoraksan.

837
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,579
His face turned grim all of a sudden.

838
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,913
He runs a guesthouse?

839
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,207
How nice. The view must be great.

840
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,876
Only the view is great.

841
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,669
Anyway, since I'm a doctor,

842
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:59,006
he must have assumed I had
a lot of money and had a rich family.

843
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,091
My gosh, he's so materialistic.

844
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,427
Gosh, poor you, Min-ha.

845
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,678
You're in trouble now.

846
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,472
She has a wish, you know.

847
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,224
She wants to have her first kiss
on Christmas wearing matching rings.

848
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,269
Your first kiss?
I've never been kissed before, either.

849
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,646
Are you mad?

850
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,732
I meant the first kiss of this year. Okay?

851
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:17,816
I see.

852
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,318
You still have a lot of time.

853
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,777
You should go on blind dates.

854
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,738
Actually,

855
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,450
I'm going to stop going on blind dates.

856
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,828
I'm thinking of confessing my feelings.

857
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,123
You have a crush?

858
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,002
Well, you know...

859
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,673
Yes?

860
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,550
Okay. I got it.

861
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,179
I just got a call saying Kim Jae-yeong
is experiencing a gross ROM.

862
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,889
They sent her up to the delivery room.

863
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,015
Who was that again?

864
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,684
I told you about her once.
The really affectionate couple.

865
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,187
The husband said he'd sing,
so the wife smacked him.

866
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,688
Right.

867
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,441
All right. You're doing very well.

868
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,151
Breathe quickly.

869
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,611
Push harder.

870
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,821
Push harder. Push.

871
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,574
Okay. Great.

872
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,619
Honey, you're doing so well. So great.

873
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:19,545
Cardiothoracic surgeon needed in the ER.

874
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,301
The patient had a cardiac arrest
due to bradycardia.

875
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,719
I performed CPR for three minutes.

876
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,638
His cardiac activity has been
restored for now.

877
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,266
Let's check his ultrasound.

878
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,729
My gosh, his heart is in awful shape.

879
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,691
Why didn't he come to the hospital sooner?

880
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,401
He probably didn't have the money.

881
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,279
According to his colleague,
he works in logistics during the day

882
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,239
and does deliveries
for fish markets at night.

883
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,991
What about his guardian? Did anyone come?

884
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,701
I talked to his father a few minutes ago.

885
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,578
He's on his way right now
from the country.

886
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:56,498
When I checked, his father is receiving
chemo at our hospital.

887
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,917
Why is he in the country
if he's doing chemo here?

888
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,961
He works in construction.

889
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,507
Both of them live
from paycheck to paycheck.

890
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,759
His colleague is already worried
about the medical bill.

891
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,052
We'll think about that later.

892
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,554
Let's prep him for surgery first.

893
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,264
Call Anesthesiology and ask for an OR.

894
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,391
And, Hui-su. Give me a call

895
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,351
-as soon as his father gets here.
-Okay.

896
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,028
Don't tell me you're here to see me.

897
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,613
Do you think you're that important?

898
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,448
Ma'am, did you eat?

899
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,907
I came here to see your mother.

900
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,372
The guardians of Oh Jae-il
can come in now.

901
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,923
Let's take a deep breath first.

902
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,468
Lift your head towards your stomach.

903
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,721
One, two, three.

904
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,935
Great job. One more push.

905
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,313
All right. Push. A little more.

906
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,732
You're almost there. Push.

907
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,816
Push.

908
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,738
You got it.

909
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,451
My gosh, how beautiful. Congratulations.

910
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,078
It's 1:51 p.m.

911
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,413
It's 1:51 p.m. Congratulations.

912
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,291
Great job, honey.

913
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,693
Thank you for coming to us, my baby.

914
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,945
Mommy loves you.

915
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,155
You've checked
all of her fingers and toes.

916
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,951
The baby will be in the nursery
to maintain the temperature.

917
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,912
Sir, if you come over here,
we'll let you hold the baby.

918
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,251
When the world was withering me away

919
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,963
You came into my world

920
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,218
When my heart was dry in a drought of love

921
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:17,097
You were my much-needed rain

922
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,643
The song of hope which I had forgotten

923
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,230
Came back to me as new sprouts grow

924
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,565
Papa.

925
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,279
Living my life as I yearn for you

926
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,658
Is a dream come true

927
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,996
You, my beautiful love

928
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,667
My dream is as warm
As the ray of sunshine in May

929
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,919
-I spend my night
-Doctor.

930
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,714
-As I wait for you
-Doctor.

931
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,716
-Please tell him to stop.
-How slow the night goes

932
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,010
Please? Please tell him to stop.

933
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,137
Please. Gosh.

934
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,017
I cannot not even begin to understand

935
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,771
The burden you are shouldering

936
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,776
I am feeling lonely today

937
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,321
Just like any other day

938
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,659
When the thorn bushes rustle

939
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,371
I want to give you my heart

940
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,876
And give you a place of rest

941
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:33,256
My precious love

942
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:38,720
Honey.

943
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,142
Honey.

944
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,692
Your daughter is here.

945
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,322
Dad. It's your daughter.

946
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:02,994
Does it hurt?

947
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,998
My daughter.

948
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,001
Are you hurt?

949
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:15,507
It doesn't. It doesn't hurt at all, Dad.

950
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,720
Didn't it hurt a lot?

951
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,599
I'm sorry.

952
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,602
There's nothing to be sorry about.

953
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,021
Don't be sorry, Dad.

954
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,557
When the world was withering me away

955
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,268
You came into my world...

956
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,437
Professor Kim,
this is Kim Tae-jin's father.

957
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,563
Doctor.

958
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,399
Please take good care of my son.

959
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,611
Please save him.

960
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,987
We put him under 20 minutes ago.

961
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,072
He has endocarditis.
His endocardium was infected,

962
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,908
so it's badly damaged now.

963
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,243
As the damage is severe,
the endocardium can't be repaired.

964
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,870
I will insert a prosthetic valve.

965
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,163
Oh, no.

966
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,498
Oh, no.

967
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,667
The surgery will take about four hours.

968
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,170
It may take longer, or it may not.

969
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,380
I'll do my best.

970
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,551
Doctor.

971
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,678
Please give him

972
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,807
the most expensive prosthetic valve.

973
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,730
Please give him the most expensive one.

974
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,865
Don't worry, sir.

975
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,743
I will give him the most expensive

976
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:10,205
and the best prosthetic valve
in this world.

977
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,457
Thank you.

978
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,671
Thank you.

979
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,839
Thank you.

980
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,934
NAME: HONG GEON-HUI, NEUROSURGERY

981
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,361
Honey.

982
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:58,086
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER,
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

983
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:01,089
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

984
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,895
Hey, aren't you going home?

985
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,064
I have to hand this in by tomorrow.

986
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,150
-What is it?
-An assignment for the KIHASA.

987
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,401
Make the residents do it.

988
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,820
I'm writing on how to improve
their medical work environment.

989
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,572
How can I make them do it?

990
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,950
-I can finish it if I pull an all-nighter.
-Come on, take it easy.

991
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,702
Stop talking to me.

992
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,288
Hey!

993
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,456
Gosh.

994
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,852
It's decaffeinated. I thought
you might have had a lot of coffee today.

995
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,440
Can I stay for a bit?

996
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:05,278
Yes. Sit over there for a moment.

997
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,409
Did you have something to say to me?

998
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,370
Do you need some help?

999
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,081
I'm good at running errands.

1000
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,917
Do you

1001
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,044
like me?

1002
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,473
Yes.

1003
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,230
I like you. Yes.

1004
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,193
I was going to tell you,

1005
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,653
but I couldn't find the right time.

1006
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,447
I'm sorry.

1007
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,492
I'm sorry.

1008
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,040
But my feelings for you are sincere.

1009
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,335
-I've had them for a while now--
-Hey.

1010
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,339
Don't.

1011
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,925
Hey. Stop talking.

1012
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,844
What's wrong with you?

1013
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,222
I'll behave accordingly,

1014
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,558
so you won't feel uncomfortable.

1015
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,477
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1016
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,064
Hey, just don't.

1017
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,442
Okay?

1018
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,903
Well, it's not something
I have control over.

1019
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,409
I can't just stop because you told me to.

1020
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,756
I'll get going.

1021
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,135
Bye.

1022
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,358
-Will Jeong-won stay up all night again?
-Yes.

1023
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,360
By the way, who's at your house?

1024
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,570
Ik-sun.

1025
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,240
She came to Seoul to attend
her friend's wedding.

1026
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,534
She'll stay over and go back
first thing tomorrow morning.

1027
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,785
I'll sleep in the living room.

1028
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,121
I will. I'm the one crashing there.

1029
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,333
Which degree black belt was Ik-sun
in taekwondo again?

1030
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,918
-First degree.
-What about judo?

1031
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,545
Judo? First degree.

1032
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,922
Is she a real soldier?

1033
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,507
Well...

1034
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,635
Go ahead.

1035
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,470
Yun Jeong-hui has an increased drainage

1036
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,931
and there's a color change.
I suspect she's bleeding.

1037
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,225
Check her vitals and do a CBC.
I'll be right there.

1038
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,352
-I'll drop you off.
-No.

1039
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,645
Drop me off over there.

1040
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,021
The subway is quicker.

1041
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,024
Jun-wan.

1042
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,486
Jun-wan.

1043
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,448
Are you okay?

1044
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,664
The patients seem to get better

1045
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,292
the moment I call for you.

1046
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,336
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's all right.

1047
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,132
It's not like I've got anything better
to do at home.

1048
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,010
Oh, right. Jeong-won's been
staying at my house.

1049
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,554
Really? Invite me to your home.

1050
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,222
Yes, let's pick a day. Today?

1051
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,684
Wait, I can't do it today.
My younger sister is staying over today.

1052
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,395
I'll try to pick another date. Gosh.

1053
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,691
I heard that your younger sister
is in the military.

1054
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,151
Is she good at martial arts?

1055
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,237
A total of 15 degrees.

1056
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,421
Sixth degree in Muay Thai,
in the national team.

1057
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,381
Fourth degree in hapkido,
third degree in kendo,

1058
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,966
First degree in taekwondo and judo.

1059
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,970
I heard that she's been
practicing jiu-jitsu lately.

1060
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,180
No way.

1061
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,351
My sister is really good at kicks.

1062
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,520
Her kicks are amazing.
They really are something else.

1063
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,690
Guess how many kicks she can do
in a second. I'll exaggerate just a bit.

1064
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,192
She can do 1,000 kicks. I'm serious.

1065
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,695
You know,

1066
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,697
your kicks...

1067
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,409
Your right kicks...

1068
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,662
They're deadly.

1069
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,705
I thought you were a robber.

1070
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,333
What kind of a robber punches in
the door code when entering?

1071
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,501
A new kind of robber?

1072
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,047
Do you want more kimchi?

1073
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,357
My goodness.

1074
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,200
So you're leaving at dawn?

1075
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,078
Yes. I'm taking the first bus.
I have to be there by 8 a.m.

1076
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,373
Have you ever gone on a blind date
with a celebrity?

1077
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,959
Where did that come from?

1078
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,504
The groom at the wedding turned out
to be the CEO of an entertainment agency.

1079
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,381
And his agency signed only one actress.

1080
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,091
She even came to the wedding.

1081
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,844
She asked me
if I was Ik-jun's younger sister.

1082
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,222
-Is this the actress?
-Yes, that's her.

1083
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,808
She was gorgeous in person.

1084
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,351
And she had a good personality, too.

1085
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,771
Did you really go on a blind date
with an actress?

1086
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,731
Should I tell her?

1087
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,319
We used to date.

1088
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,990
Oh, my gat kimchi.

1089
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,283
You're not lying, right?

1090
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,993
Weren't you a public health doctor, then?

1091
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,078
I was in the fourth year of my residency.

1092
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,122
After seeing me on Good Doctors
for five seconds,

1093
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,915
she had a crush on me and called me.

1094
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,667
I don't believe it.

1095
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,294
I used to be pretty popular back then.

1096
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:37,795
Why did you break up?

1097
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,214
If you had tied the knot,
you would've been happily married.

1098
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,259
-You wouldn't have met that ex of yours.
-Then, I wouldn't have U-ju.

1099
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,886
Goodness.

1100
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,013
But seriously,
why did you break up with her?

1101
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,724
She even came to Changwon
when you were a public health doctor.

1102
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,102
She wouldn't eat.

1103
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,812
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1104
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,856
When we met, she never ate.

1105
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,360
And it looked like she was
addicted to sleeping pills.

1106
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,446
When I woke up
to go to work in the morning,

1107
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,364
she would go to sleep then.

1108
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,243
It felt like she lived in
a different world from me.

1109
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,996
Of course, in the end, she dumped me.

1110
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,124
Are you serious? You really dated her?

1111
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,125
I'm serious.

1112
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,544
You never believe me anything I say.

1113
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,296
Even if it's the most obvious truth.

1114
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:23,132
You should have earned my trust
when you had the time.

1115
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,968
Where am I sleeping tonight?

1116
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,179
-Let me sleep in your room.
-No.

1117
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,515
-Sleep in Jun-wan's room.
-With him?

1118
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,016
Are you crazy?

1119
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,435
Jun-wan will sleep on the sofa.

1120
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,772
Oh, gosh.

1121
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,858
Sometimes, you're so fake.

1122
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,152
You're spot-on.

1123
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,426
Hello? Who is this?

1124
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:08,803
Who is this?

1125
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,721
Who is this?

1126
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,139
Is it you, Jun-wan?

1127
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,559
Is this your phone, Ik-sun?

1128
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,061
I must have left it at home.
I thought I left it in the taxi.

1129
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,896
My gosh. What a relief.

1130
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,023
-Where are you now?
-At the terminal.

1131
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,651
I came early in case of a traffic jam,
but I'm too early.

1132
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,945
I'm sorry to ask you this,

1133
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,739
but can you please send
my phone to my base?

1134
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,533
It takes only a day via courier
these days.

1135
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,326
I'll bring it to you myself. Stay there.

1136
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,746
Okay. At the exit.

1137
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,873
The toast truck?

1138
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,624
Okay.

1139
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,054
What are you eating at this hour?

1140
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,099
This is your phone, right?

1141
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,686
Thank you.

1142
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,690
I have a present for you.

1143
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,954
I'm just kidding.

1144
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,081
I have a real present.

1145
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,793
I heard you like chocolate.

1146
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,588
This is the one, right?

1147
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,466
Give me your hand.

1148
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,094
Here.

1149
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:34,972
Oh, no.

1150
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,353
No. Put them back in.

1151
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,608
Oh, no.

1152
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,068
No. Let me do it.

1153
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,402
I have no choice.

1154
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,448
Here. The rest is mine.

1155
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:53,991
Okay.

1156
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,334
Have I told you that I like you?

1157
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,676
Go out with me.

1158
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,484
My goodness.

1159
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:31,946
Mr. Go Yeong-min.

1160
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,240
Hello.

1161
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,908
Hi.

1162
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,159
Hello.

1163
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,536
How are you feeling?

1164
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,037
I'm feeling great.

1165
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,873
I guess money can
really buy you happiness.

1166
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,750
My daughter is spoiling me
with this VIP room.

1167
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,504
Who's his daughter?

1168
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,131
Didn't you know?

1169
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,841
I don't check who the patient's family is.

1170
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,344
Hello.

1171
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,763
You should have hired a caregiver.

1172
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,182
Professor Lee. This is
the patient's daughter, Ms. Go A-ra.

1173
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,980
Long time no see.

1174
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,065
Hello.

1175
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,695
Yes.

1176
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,996
Hello?

1177
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,291
Who is this again?

1178
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,335
I'm the person who's living
with Chairman Yang Tae-yang.

1179
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,629
Right. I'm the adulterer.

1180
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,841
That's what people call me. The adulterer.

1181
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,468
Why did you call me?

1182
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,553
I have something to tell you.

1183
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,597
I know it's uncomfortable for you,

1184
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,515
but could we meet in person for a moment?

1185
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,934
There's a nice garden behind the hospital.

1186
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,478
Let's meet there.

1187
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,081
I'll talk to you later.

1188
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,637
Hello. Two large cups
of iced Americano, please.

1189
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,430
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1190
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,643
It's spilled milk.

1191
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,561
I know she's thinking,

1192
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,106
"Screw you. I won't let you be happy.
Over my dead body."

1193
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,691
I do understand her

1194
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,945
but refusing to divorce him isn't right.

1195
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,951
Could you persuade your mother?

1196
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,370
I think she'd at least listen to her son.

1197
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:46,789
I don't want to.

1198
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,394
I am...

1199
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,813
pregnant.

1200
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,858
I'm three months pregnant already.

1201
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,611
Let's not choose the difficult path
for all of us.

1202
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,698
I know that she despises me,

1203
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,492
but how long can she keep this up?
She's throwing a tantrum.

1204
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,495
I heard she's not well.

1205
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,958
What's the point of hating a girl like me?

1206
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,005
Let's be adults about this.

1207
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:39,091
We should do what must be done
for both parties

1208
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,260
and settle things once and for all.

1209
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,388
We have a long life ahead of us.

1210
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,602
I trust that you'll talk to your mother.

1211
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,645
You're a smart man.

1212
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,158
If you didn't feel any lumps before

1213
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,535
and you suddenly feel a big lump,

1214
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,581
it could be a sign of bad news.

1215
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,293
From the way the lump felt,

1216
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,087
it was quite firm.

1217
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,673
And when you look at its shape,

1218
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,510
it's spiky as you can see here.

1219
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,430
And there's a shadow in the back here.

1220
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,308
The shape is irregular.

1221
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:32,436
In this case,

1222
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,105
it's better to get a biopsy.

1223
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,525
Why don't you get the biopsy today?

1224
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,114
I have a job.

1225
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,491
How long will it take?

1226
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,201
About 20 minutes.

1227
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,412
Okay. Let's do it right away.

1228
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,556
Hey, Jun-wan. Are you seeing someone?

1229
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,266
My gosh, that immature prick.

1230
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,643
You know that you're the first, right?

1231
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,563
I think my sister likes you.

1232
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,315
I know that very well.

1233
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,108
The two of them are driving me nuts.

1234
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:03,444
Have you ever seen Ik-jun
fall for a girl first?

1235
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,696
I should buy you a meal sometime.

1236
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,782
She said she's not ready
to date someone yet.

1237
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,868
I think it will take her some time.

1238
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,911
Did you know you two had
a huge transformation?

1239
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,038
Us two?

1240
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,956
It's the school entrance. Why take a bus?

1241
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,127
Doesn't Dr. Jang like Professor Ahn?

1242
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,754
You're best friends with Dr. Jang, right?

1243
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,255
Yes, I am. How do you know that?

1244
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,965
Could he have feelings for me?

1245
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,967
I have a question.

1246
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,053
You can never know someone completely.

1247
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,679
She acts as if everything is fine,

1248
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,890
but I think something is up with her.

1249
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,641
Professor Chae is a good person.

1250
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,477
Something sounded off about her.

1251
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,436
Did something happen?

1252
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,104
Go to the ER now.

1253
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,439
I'm not okay.

1254
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,192
I think I would be in utter despair.

1255
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:46,320
I want to live in a place
that's not too big or not too small

1256
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:47,237
just for a year.

1257
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,031
I can work at a hospital there, too.
