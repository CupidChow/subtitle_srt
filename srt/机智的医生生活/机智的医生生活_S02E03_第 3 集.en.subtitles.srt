1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,188
Your wife is about to faint right now.

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,691
She's pushing, but the baby won't drop.

3
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,986
A natural birth is simply not possible
in this situation.

4
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:32,490
If the head is stuck in the birth canal
for too long, it's not good for the baby.

5
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,035
The fetal heart rate
is becoming erratic as well.

6
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,245
This is probably taking a toll
on the baby too.

7
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,290
We'll go into surgery right away.

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,167
Your wife wants it too.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,002
No. I can't allow that, Doctor.

10
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,212
Let's wait just a little longer. Please?

11
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,021
Can you park my car?

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,693
My wife has to have a natural birth
no matter what.

13
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,821
She probably agreed to surgery
because she's in too much pain.

14
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,200
-If she gets through this--
-Both she and the baby are at risk.

15
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,951
She's already exhausted

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,121
and the baby is face-up
and just won't drop.

17
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,583
It hasn't budged for over three hours,
so she needs surgery.

18
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,337
It's past 4 a.m. now,
which means it's been almost four hours.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,216
My daughter-in-law promised me
that she'd give a natural birth.

20
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,594
Doctor, let's wait a little longer.

21
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,180
If it really doesn't work,
she can go into surgery then.

22
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,224
Right, that is now.

23
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,226
We cannot wait any longer.

24
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,061
This is an emergency situation!

25
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,439
What are you doing?
Why isn't she in the OR yet?

26
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,235
Professor Yang, her family is insisting
she must give a natural birth.

27
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,319
They won't let us--

28
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,739
They say babies who are
born vaginally are smarter.

29
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,825
Can't we wait just a little longer?

30
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,495
Back in my day, women gave birth naturally
without any problems

31
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,455
even after being in labor for three days.

32
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,875
I guess your goal is
to have a natural delivery,

33
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,130
but ours is to ensure that the delivery
is safe for both the mother and the baby.

34
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,756
It's already late.

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,175
Ms. Choi Ye-rim needs surgery,

36
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,177
and she has already given her consent.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,806
We'll go into surgery now.

38
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,101
-Hurry and get ready.
-Okay.

39
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,318
-Mr. Kim Hyeong-jin.
-Yes.

40
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,321
Here you go.
Please wait in front of Room 4.

41
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,000
It's so busy today, as usual.

42
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,628
This is nothing.

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,299
-Mr. Kim Hyeong-jin, please come in.
-Sure.

44
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,343
We need to confirm your date of birth.

45
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,262
January 25, 1974.

46
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,105
Mr. Kim Hyeong-jin is next.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,359
I remember him! He lives in Yesan.
When he came in last month,

48
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,903
his AST level was 150.

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,739
Do we have his results already?

50
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,657
Do you even remember such details?

51
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,660
Quiz Champion.

52
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,665
Don't you know Janghak Quiz?

53
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,377
I've heard of it, but I grew up
watching The Golden Bell Challenge.

54
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,258
So did I. I watched Star Golden Bell.

55
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,679
Hello. It's been a month, right?

56
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,681
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello.

57
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,270
So how's everything? Good?

58
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,397
Yes, I feel great.

59
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,983
I think the surgery went very well.

60
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,321
But you don't look so well today.

61
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,282
I was on duty last night,
so I didn't get any sleep.

62
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,661
You got blood work done this morning.

63
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,871
It doesn't look like
we have the results yet.

64
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,749
They're sending you the results now.

65
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,334
Great, thank you.

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,920
It looks like
you've gained a bit of weight.

67
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,840
Mr. Cho Seon-ho.

68
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,469
Here's your prescription
for one more week.

69
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,930
Call this number to book your appointment.

70
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,098
Okay, thank you.

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,658
Professor,
we don't have all the lab results yet.

72
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,326
We'll start ten minutes late.

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,078
Your gown is in the treatment room.

74
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,789
Really? Good timing.

75
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,542
I just finished the surgery.
I won't be late, then.

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,918
I'll head there right away.

77
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,558
Doors are opening.

78
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,024
Doors are closing.

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,693
Doors are opening.

80
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,111
Let's hurry.

81
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,071
Thank you.

82
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,700
Hi. How's the candy?

83
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,996
I have three more at home.

84
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,124
Strawberry, orange…

85
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,460
and toasted rice!

86
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,552
Strawberry, orange, and…

87
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,804
Plum, maybe?

88
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,768
Apple?

89
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,438
No! That's not it!

90
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,400
Okay, all right.
Ha-yul, are you upset with me?

91
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,156
Let's see.

92
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,827
It's dropped a little.
Her jaundice is definitely getting better.

93
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,164
The color of her eyes
looks much better now.

94
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,375
I was worried as it was going up.
But thankfully, it's dropping now.

95
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,835
How was she the past two weeks?

96
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,297
Pretty good,
but she did have a fever last week.

97
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,174
Stop! Don't tell him that.

98
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,510
Okay, I won't tell him.

99
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,637
-Does she still have it?
-No, she's fine now.

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,055
When she's running a fever,

101
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,474
-I get scared--
-Stop. Don't say that.

102
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,142
Okay, I won't.

103
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,435
Hold on.

104
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,105
Just a second, Ha-yul.

105
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,858
Let's see.

106
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,781
You're wearing a hairpin.

107
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,993
Your hair looks nice.

108
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,582
Ha-yul, this is you.

109
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,751
You can play with this, okay?

110
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,669
Okay.

111
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,424
We tested her vitamin levels last month,

112
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,301
and everything looks good.

113
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,053
So I suggest we change it all up.

114
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,223
No more vitamin injections.
Let's switch to oral medications.

115
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,100
I see. What about Vitamin K?

116
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,395
Yes, that too.
Let's simplify the treatment plan.

117
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,772
That should be okay, right?

118
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,315
Yes, she'll be fine.

119
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,775
This is you.

120
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,735
That's me?

121
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,617
My gosh, what a nice drawing.

122
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,869
Yes!

123
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,456
Please draw me again next time.

124
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,124
Okay, sure!

125
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,710
Let's go.

126
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,087
Say "Thank you, Doctor."

127
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,298
Thank you.

128
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,638
What did she say?

129
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,849
"Toasted rice flavor." She remembered it.

130
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,979
Bye, Ha-yul. Bye!

131
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,523
Bye!

132
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,031
-Hello.
-Hello.

133
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,075
Yes, take a seat.

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,467
Everything looks good.

135
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,844
It looks fine.

136
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,017
I'm relieved to hear that.
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

137
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,104
Does the X-ray look okay too?

138
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
Yes.

139
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,568
What about the blood test
and electrocardiogram results?

140
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,279
I just told you everything's fine.

141
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,619
Doctor.

142
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,499
My husband has been getting
leg cramps at night--

143
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,293
That has nothing to do with the heart.

144
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,045
No other questions, right?

145
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,550
-No.
-Then I'll see you next time.

146
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,307
Hello?

147
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,271
Who?

148
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,147
Thank you.

149
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,234
Take care. And don't forget to exercise.

150
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,411
-Hello.
-Hello, please have a seat here.

151
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,799
You had your surgery
over two months ago, right?

152
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,427
Yes, it's already been two months.

153
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,021
You got a haircut.

154
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,732
Yes, I did.

155
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,483
I looked like a crazy person before.

156
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,949
Professor Kim, did my condition get worse?

157
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,659
No, everything looks good.

158
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,830
I reviewed everything
starting with your pre-surgery X-ray.

159
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,458
Your X-ray and blood test results
from today look good.

160
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,418
And your electrocardiogram is normal too.

161
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,882
This one was taken before the surgery,

162
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,176
and the one on the right is from today.

163
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,511
The lungs show up as black
and the heart is white.

164
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,765
Your right atrium and ventricle
were enlarged before the surgery.

165
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,768
You don't have to be a doctor
to see the difference.

166
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,853
Your heart looks notably smaller
than before.

167
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,272
Yes, I can see the improvement.

168
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,026
Yes, everything looks good.
Did you experience any other symptoms

169
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,111
after your appointment last month?

170
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,741
No. Oh, right. Everything's been good,

171
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,410
but when I get up suddenly,

172
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,371
I feel lightheaded.

173
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,332
-Does it happen often?
-No, just once in a while.

174
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,044
Is it common after the surgery?

175
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,798
Yes, it can happen after the surgery.
I've seen it in some cases,

176
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,966
but it will go away with time.

177
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,552
As I've explained before, your heart is

178
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,098
at the same level as your brain
when you're lying down.

179
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,102
But when you get up, your brain is
suddenly higher than your heart.

180
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,813
So your blood vessels must contract
the moment it happens.

181
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,940
Squeezing the tip of your garden hose

182
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,983
makes the water shoot out farther, right?

183
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,654
It's the same thing. The vessels
must contract to pump blood to the brain.

184
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,950
If that doesn't happen right away,
you can experience lightheadedness.

185
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,327
I see. I totally get it now.

186
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,580
You were given diuretics
and antihypertensives after the surgery,

187
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,958
which can throw you off balance
temporarily.

188
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,003
Rather than testing yourself to see
whether your condition is improving,

189
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:57,425
I suggest you try to get into the habit
of getting up slowly.

190
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,760
-Okay.
-She's awfully impatient.

191
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,721
She always gets up quickly.
She doesn't have the patience.

192
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,348
I'll be careful from now on.

193
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,308
-Any other questions?
-No.

194
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,768
-All right, then.
-Thank you.

195
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,993
-Professor Cheon will be here shortly.
-Thank you.

196
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,205
Sir, our resident doctors
in Cardiothoracic Surgery

197
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,792
perform tube thoracostomy most often
on pneumothorax patients.

198
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,294
They do it several times a day.

199
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,507
Should I also call a resident
in Cardiothoracic Surgery just in case?

200
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,346
We'll wait for Professor Cheon.

201
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,806
Okay.

202
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,351
He's coming?

203
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,104
Professor Cheon is on his way now?

204
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,858
Yes. He moved all his appointments
to come here right away.

205
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,776
I thought he'd say no.

206
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,030
I called him,
thinking I'd probably get yelled at.

207
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,073
But he said he'd come and take care of it.

208
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,658
My goodness.

209
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,245
But he hasn't treated lung disorders
for over 20 years.

210
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,789
Yes, but it's considered
a basic task in CS.

211
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,877
That's right. Because it's a basic task,

212
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,129
the last time he did it in the ER,
not in an OR,

213
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,048
was probably well over 20 years ago.

214
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,469
Who is the patient though?

215
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,137
An assemblyman.

216
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,556
He represents the district
where Professor Cheon lives.

217
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,683
They play golf together.

218
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,147
-Where is he?
-This way.

219
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,291
Why isn't this working?

220
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,965
Why isn't this going in?

221
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,680
What is wrong with this?

222
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,640
This is a piece of crap.

223
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,684
Pass me the mosquito forceps. Quick!

224
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:19,775
Gosh, why isn't this working?
What is wrong with this?

225
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,695
Wait. Hang in there, okay?

226
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,993
Goodness.

227
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,911
What is wrong with this?

228
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,372
Come on!

229
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,751
Your liver somatic index is normal

230
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,045
and you don't have jaundice anymore.

231
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,716
You had cancer,
so we ran the tests to check for relapse.

232
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,846
Your blood vessels are fine.

233
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,684
Here, look at the screen.

234
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,732
This is your vein.

235
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,361
The hepatic portal vein looks fine too.

236
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,616
This is your hepatic artery.
This thin one here.

237
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,242
This one looks fine too.

238
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,413
So as for your blood vessels,
they're fine.

239
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,874
Thank you, Professor Lee.

240
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,960
I've been coming to the hospital
for so long

241
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,672
that I can now tell how good or bad it is
from the X-rays alone.

242
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,718
He got the transplant done two years ago

243
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,889
but still has a hard time falling asleep
the night before his appointments.

244
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,475
He's worried the cancer might recur.

245
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,977
My mom and I stay up all night too.

246
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,777
Your father's cancer wasn't that serious,
and he had the surgery over two years ago,

247
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,157
so I think it's safe to assume
that he's fully recovered now.

248
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,076
Pardon?

249
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,832
My gosh, Doctor Lee.

250
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,417
Really?

251
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,129
I thought we had to wait five years
to assume he's fully cured.

252
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,716
My gosh.

253
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,761
We should still monitor his condition.

254
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,931
But statistically,
a recurrence is unlikely

255
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,309
unless it happens
within two years of transplantation.

256
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,728
Only in not-so-severe cases like this,
of course.

257
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,856
Thank you, Professor Lee.

258
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,568
I'm so grateful to my son

259
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,655
and to you as well, Professor Lee.

260
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,536
It's a miracle
that I'm still alive like this.

261
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,999
I'm so grateful to see
that you've recovered like this.

262
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,835
I'd say you're almost fully cured now,
but it's important

263
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,796
that you keep taking care of yourself
and exercise regularly.

264
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,257
Also, don't miss your appointments

265
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,884
-and get your tests done on time.
-Of course.

266
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,055
Then I'll see you in three months.

267
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,018
-Okay, thank you.
-Take care.

268
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,102
Bye.

269
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,069
This is a record.

270
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,781
You were booked back-to-back
after working the night shift.

271
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,658
Do you want some bread?

272
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,412
No, thank you. I want real food.
I'm going to have a proper dinner.

273
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,165
You still have one patient left.

274
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,001
-Liar.
-You're right. I was just kidding.

275
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,172
I'm hungry. Let's go eat something.

276
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,966
Sure.

277
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,596
Gosh, I'm tired.

278
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,317
You can't see Min-chan and Eun-ji
from here.

279
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,531
I brought some side dishes from home.
Let's have dinner together.

280
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,616
Sure.

281
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,077
-Let's go.
-Okay.

282
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,536
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER
PICU

283
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,255
They're serving beef bone soup today.

284
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,967
Enjoy. I have a date.

285
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,106
Let's go have some beef bone soup.

286
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,359
I'm having dinner with my mom.

287
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,820
Hey, don't push me.

288
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,282
Those jerks.

289
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,704
Please leave a message after the tone…

290
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,290
Ik-jun should be done
with his appointments by now.

291
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,292
He's never around when I need him.

292
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,675
Professor Kim!

293
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,928
As of today, I'm free.
Even the second exam is done.

294
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,139
-Let's have dinner.
-Did the interview go well?

295
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,226
Of course.
I have such a likable face, you know.

296
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,937
I came straight here
because I missed the cafeteria food.

297
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,816
I've got some intel that beef bone soup
is on the menu today.

298
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,818
Intel, my foot. Hey.

299
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,278
Beef bone soup. Come down.

300
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,615
Let's go. You had to study so hard.
Dinner's on me.

301
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,367
Then we should eat out.

302
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,912
You should take me out
to a nice restaurant.

303
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,248
I have a lecture in 30 minutes. Bye.

304
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,917
I know that!

305
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,712
I know your schedule
like the back of my hand.

306
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,339
Of course,
I know you have a lecture today.

307
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,632
I was just joking.

308
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,343
Dear Jae-hak,
look at you cracking jokes with me.

309
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,597
Did you just say "dear Jae-hak"?

310
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,890
Jeez.

311
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,974
"Dear Jae-hak"?

312
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,311
-That's what you said.
-Shut it.

313
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,482
I'm sick of the food here.

314
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,235
That's why I bring a few dishes from home.

315
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,862
I prefer to eat like this.

316
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,405
This way, I can save money too.

317
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,490
Who knows how much longer
we'd have to wait?

318
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,534
We can't eat out every meal.

319
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,997
Thank you. I didn't even know
there was a place like this.

320
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,957
How could you have known?

321
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,835
Min-chan has only been hooked up
to the VAD for a week.

322
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm sure you still feel frazzled.

323
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,215
I'll bring some side dishes tomorrow.

324
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,508
I had to rush Min-chan to the hospital,

325
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,011
so I still have all the side dishes
in the fridge.

326
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,554
I can just bring them tomorrow.

327
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,056
Tomorrow's the weekend.

328
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,434
You should go home and get some sleep
even just for a day.

329
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,853
You need to catch up on sleep to recharge.

330
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,775
And we can only see the kids
twice a day anyway,

331
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,320
so don't stay here all day.
Go home and come back when you need to.

332
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,696
It's okay to do that.

333
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,244
I told you. We're like marathoners.

334
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,996
Yes, thank you.

335
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,292
Oh, you should add some calorie boosters
to Min-chan's food or milk.

336
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,379
I know he's older than Eun-ji,

337
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,173
but he's on the smaller side.

338
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,595
The faster he grows, the easier it'll be
for him to find the right heart donor.

339
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,680
Right.

340
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,601
It always worried me
that he's smaller than average.

341
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,522
I guess I didn't do a good job
raising him.

342
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,775
Goodness. Don't say that.

343
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,653
Here, have this and cheer up.

344
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,198
Min-chan's blood type is A.

345
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,576
He can get a heart from someone
with an A or O blood type,

346
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,453
so he'll have more chances.

347
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,665
Only think positive thoughts, okay?

348
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,293
Okay.

349
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,045
The food must be cold now.
Hurry up and eat.

350
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,214
Thank you.

351
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,927
I hope Eun-ji finds a donor soon
so Min-chan can find one too.

352
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:49,308
I really hope they can find
the right donor for Eun-ji soon.

353
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,101
Thank you.

354
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,979
I believe

355
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,232
in miracles.

356
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,447
Eat up.

357
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,285
You have many surgeries booked
next week, right?

358
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,496
Yes, I'm all booked
for the next two weeks.

359
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,332
There's one Chief Kwon asked me to do.

360
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,085
Chief Kwon? Professor Kwon Sun-jeong
asked you to operate on a patient?

361
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,338
-Yes, his sibling.
-Oh, no.

362
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,673
He said he couldn't operate
on his own brother,

363
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,508
so I told him I'd do it next week.

364
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,177
I'll do it before my appointments.

365
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,724
I see.

366
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,730
What is it?

367
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,486
It's about Daddy-Long-Legs.

368
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,614
I told you how it works, right?

369
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,449
Yes, you did.

370
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,786
We received this inquiry
from Ji-am Medical Center in Mokpo.

371
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,120
It's a pretty big hospital

372
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,456
that performs
three to four transplants a year.

373
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,457
Mokpo?

374
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,502
Wasn't it just for Yulje and KWMC?

375
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,963
I've expanded it a little.

376
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,802
The more people it can help, the better.

377
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,806
I sent an anonymous email
to every hospital in the country,

378
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,599
explaining how the program works

379
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,478
and telling them
that they can inquire anytime.

380
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,733
Don't ever complain
that you're tired again.

381
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,361
I'm totally fine.

382
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,075
So? What's the inquiry
from the hospital in Mokpo?

383
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,994
At first,
they asked for financial support.

384
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,164
The patient is a sailor who's been
battling liver cancer for years.

385
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,958
He doesn't have health insurance,

386
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,377
so he's exhausted his savings
on his hospital bills.

387
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,047
He's on welfare at the moment
and can barely make ends meet.

388
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:48,385
He has a son,
but his son had no idea about his illness

389
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,263
because he and his wife didn't tell him.

390
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:56,101
One day, his son suddenly got worried
and went to Mokpo to see them.

391
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,020
But he was in the ER at the time
due to hepatic encephalopathy,

392
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,565
and his belly was quite swollen.

393
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,359
When the son saw that,

394
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,154
he flopped down and started bawling,

395
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,448
saying that he's a terrible son
and asking them to save his father.

396
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,117
Can't the son be a donor for him?

397
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,786
The son said
he'd happily donate his liver right away.

398
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,621
The wife was seeing a neurosurgeon

399
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,166
for a cerebrovascular disorder,
so she couldn't do it.

400
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,960
But as soon as he regained consciousness,

401
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,255
he said he'd never let his son
go through surgery for him.

402
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,215
He was strongly against it,

403
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,094
but his wife and son finally managed
to persuade him.

404
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,763
I'm surprised you asked
for all these details.

405
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,017
Of course, I need to make sure
the money is put to good use.

406
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,934
That's true.

407
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,604
We can help them, right?

408
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,731
Yes, I told them we would.

409
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,984
But I got an email from the doctor there
three days later.

410
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,945
They were going to liaise
with a local university hospital,

411
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,407
but while testing for compatibility,
they concluded it'd be too difficult

412
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,619
and were hoping to transfer him
to a hospital in Seoul.

413
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,830
But they're good.
One of my old professors is there.

414
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,457
I wonder what the problem is.

415
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,044
The father is a big guy. He weighs 90kg,
but his son weighs less than 60kg.

416
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,129
-The size is the problem.
-Right.

417
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,757
They said they couldn't do it
due to the size difference.

418
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,134
They wanted to see
if it could be done in Seoul

419
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,347
and if we'd still be able to provide
financial support in that case.

420
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,807
-That doesn't matter.
-Right, I told them that.

421
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,936
But I got another email from them
this morning.

422
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,064
They received feedback from KWMC
and Seojung Hospital.

423
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,733
Apparently, they also said
they wouldn't be able to do it.

424
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,487
Jae-an Medical Center is willing to do it
if there are two donors,

425
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,239
just to be safe.

426
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,741
That's impossible, though.

427
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,037
The son is the only person
who can do it at the moment,

428
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,124
and the father is strongly against
getting liver grafts from two donors.

429
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,169
Every hospital has
its own rules and standards.

430
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,590
The doctor there said he would ask
Yulje for his patient as a last resort.

431
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,550
So I told him I could ask Yulje directly

432
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,344
because I've done business with them.

433
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,597
The patient's not doing well,
so we don't have time.

434
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,808
Why waste time going back and forth?

435
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,393
I told him I'd ask Yulje for him.

436
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,477
Good.

437
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,981
Can you take a look?

438
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,236
If you think the surgery can't be done,

439
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,616
then I'll give up
because that means it's not possible.

440
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,160
You can do that, right?

441
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,162
Okay, I'll have a look.

442
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,750
Ask them if they can send over
his CT scan and other test results.

443
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,460
The sooner, the better.

444
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,296
Okay, I'll ask them right away.

445
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,840
-Hurry up and eat. It must be cold now.
-Right.

446
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,973
Is it someone you know? Who is it?

447
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,518
-How did you know?
-It sounded as if you knew the doctor.

448
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,313
Who is it?

449
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,108
Hyeong-do, Baek Hyeong-do.

450
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,113
The Baek Hyeong-do who was on my team?

451
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,075
The Baek Hyeong-do I know,
with that charming, deep voice?

452
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,286
Yes, that Baek Hyeong-do.

453
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,912
Your rival.

454
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,874
"Rival"? Oh, please.
What are you talking about?

455
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,626
He thought of you as his rival
for six years.

456
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,545
That's why he hated your guts.

457
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,964
Me? How can anyone hate me?

458
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,300
This is probably why he hated you.

459
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,556
Anyway, it turns out that he's actually
the director of the hospital in Mokpo.

460
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,767
My, I'm impressed.

461
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,728
Performing transplants there…
It can't be easy.

462
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,396
He said it's not easy.

463
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,316
I played dumb
and asked a bunch of questions.

464
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,070
He said they're short-staffed,
and the medical office is small.

465
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,697
But he's doing his best
out of a sense of duty

466
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,742
so that the people there
wouldn't have to go

467
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,495
all the way to Seoul.

468
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,622
I have huge respect for him.

469
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,958
I should give him a call
if I end up taking the patient.

470
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,003
He and I were quite close,
although you hated him.

471
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,089
Who? You're friends with everyone.

472
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,131
-Hi.
-Hello.

473
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,550
Hello. Hey, you know Hyeong-do, right?

474
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,844
Baek Hyeong-do?
I sure do. He's your rival.

475
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,014
-A "rival"?
-Hyeong-do. We went to school with him.

476
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,891
He wanted to beat Ik-jun so badly

477
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,143
that he gave him tickets to a club
during exams.

478
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,396
He bought it with his own money

479
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,398
so Ik-jun would party hard
and bomb the exam.

480
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,983
Wait, Hyeong-do bought that ticket?

481
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,653
He said it was free
because his uncle owned that club.

482
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,115
Hyeong-do's uncle is a Buddhist monk.

483
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,243
He's the chief monk
at the biggest temple in Mokpo.

484
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,994
He's still well-respected.

485
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,664
So did you bomb the exam?

486
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,042
No. He kept getting the highest marks
because he got to unwind

487
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,419
and de-stress at the club.

488
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:37,006
You guys know that I was totally crazy
about Park Jin-young back then.

489
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,300
My pelvis popped out,
and it's still missing.

490
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,429
Then what is that
between your waist and butt now?

491
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,972
-My pelvis.
-You said it's gone.

492
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,641
It just came back.

493
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,186
Didn't you see that?
It came back like this just now.

494
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,648
-That's so lame.
-My gosh.

495
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,526
I thought that was hilarious.

496
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,490
Look at you, Dr. Do Jae-hak.
You have such a keen sense of humor.

497
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,785
Send me the results right away.

498
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,203
All right.

499
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,549
Let's go.

500
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,135
Get in. It's cold.

501
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,137
Hurry.

502
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,572
What if people see us?

503
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,700
Sorry, it totally slipped my mind.

504
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,328
Was someone there? There's no one.

505
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,538
Let's go.

506
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,396
That was Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul
and Professor Ahn Jeong-won, right?

507
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,314
-Yes.
-I'm sure of it.

508
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:03,653
Did Professor Ahn just open the car door
for Dr. Jang?

509
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,574
Yes, and it was so natural.

510
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,709
-Professor Ahn is such a gentleman.
-Totally.

511
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,252
He's incredibly well-mannered.

512
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,671
The way he opened the door for her
was so natural.

513
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,924
He's such a gentleman.

514
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,885
I should have applied to GS.

515
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,345
I envy Dr. Jang.

516
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,393
Professor Chae gave you this car?
For free?

517
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,855
Yes. She gave me her old car
because she bought a new one.

518
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,361
-Are your hands cold?
-Yes, a little.

519
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,769
Are you not seeing anyone?

520
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,940
-What do you mean?
-I mean a girlfriend.

521
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,567
-No.
-Don't you want to date?

522
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,320
No, I don't.

523
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,907
I'll figure it out.

524
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,285
Don't worry. Just eat.

525
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,081
Is it because of me?
Are you worried I'd fight again?

526
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,709
No, I just really like how things are now.

527
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,046
I'm the happiest when I'm alone.

528
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,256
Don't you feel the same way?

529
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,467
Aren't you relieved that Dad's gone now?

530
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,802
Jeez.

531
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
I mean it.

532
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,973
I love being single.

533
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,849
It is nice to be single.

534
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,852
It's comfortable, and you don't need
to worry about anyone else.

535
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,271
But you see,

536
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,567
it's nothing compared to the joy
of being with someone you love.

537
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,572
Even New Journey to the West
would be much more enjoyable then.

538
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,785
That being said,

539
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,955
-my friend has a daughter--
-Excuse me.

540
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,166
Could we get the bill?

541
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,674
No, Professor Ahn.
Then everyone will know.

542
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,218
No one will know.

543
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,807
We're not at the hospital now.
Why are you still calling me "Professor"?

544
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,354
I don't want to be called that.

545
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,607
Everyone will find out at this rate.
Because of you.

546
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,736
You're like a ticking bomb now.

547
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,823
-Me?
-Did you already forget

548
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,950
what you did in the Medical Office
yesterday?

549
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,418
Hey, you made it.
Looks like everyone's here now.

550
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,504
Did you have to gather everyone
for the retirement symposium?

551
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,298
Professor Ahn isn't here yet.

552
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,684
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

553
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,019
My apologies.

554
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,564
What's this for?

555
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,941
The video and certificate of merit

556
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,360
for Professor Kim Jin-mo's
retirement symposium.

557
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,737
Right.

558
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,406
We've received all the video files.

559
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,700
They'll compile and edit them
this weekend,

560
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,369
so if you have any photos or videos…

561
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,849
-Jeong-won never disappoints.
-Such a gentleman!

562
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,726
-We should learn from him.
-Yes!

563
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,561
Hey, you should've done that for her.

564
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,855
She assisted you in two surgeries today.

565
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,067
My gosh, Professor Ahn. You're so good.

566
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,027
You take great care of the residents.

567
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,404
Professor Ahn, you're so sweet.
I give you that.

568
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,990
-Yes, totally.
-My goodness.

569
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:23,496
People would think that he is
Dr. Jang's boyfriend or something.

570
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,264
I mean, people could think that.

571
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,102
-Come on!
-My gosh.

572
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,354
-You startled me.
-No way!

573
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,940
-Who'd think that?
-You went too far with that one.

574
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,734
Professor Lee, you and your absurd jokes.

575
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,946
-What if things get awkward between them?
-Yes, seriously.

576
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,615
Right? My bad. I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

577
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,869
No worries. It's fine.

578
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,247
By the way, have we decided
on the lecture topic yet?

579
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,125
Yes. The director of KWMC's Cancer Center
will give a lecture

580
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,169
on the future
of minimally invasive surgery.

581
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,004
Let's talk after this, you crazy jerk.

582
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,465
I'm busy. I need to get
my immigration documents ready.

583
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:21,429
We should also organize a talent show.
You're listening, right?

584
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,264
That feels nice.

585
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,143
Why are your cheeks so cold?

586
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,563
We've only been outside for a moment,
but even your nose is red.

587
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,064
Go inside quickly, okay?

588
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,066
I can't, until you let go of me.

589
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,401
Right.

590
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,239
Sweet dreams.

591
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,367
Wait.

592
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,699
Gosh. You're heading out now?

593
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,367
Yes. You should get more sleep.

594
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,620
You really are something.

595
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,429
Mom, did you just make this?

596
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,514
The perilla leaves taste so fresh.

597
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,934
Yes. I marinated them this morning,
one leaf at a time.

598
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,981
I wanted my son to eat
the freshest perilla leaves today. Here.

599
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,234
I can't finish this, Mom.

600
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,570
Why can't you? You're still growing.

601
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,364
I'm still growing at age 41?

602
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,367
I can't believe my son is already 41.

603
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,036
I suppose I've lived too long.

604
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,122
Mom, 70 is the new 50.

605
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,374
You'll live another 30 years
at the very least.

606
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,382
-It's so good.
-What?

607
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,135
This is the best.
The best perilla leaves I've ever had!

608
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,187
That bowl is deceptive.
It's actually not that much.

609
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,399
-I can finish this.
-Good.

610
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,785
Mom, I like these big chunks of potatoes
in the soybean paste stew.

611
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,622
Right? They're from my neighbor.
They were small, so I didn't cut them up.

612
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,248
But it's actually quite nice.

613
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,333
Indeed.

614
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,753
-Did you cook these bracken ferns?
-Yes.

615
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,464
Did you even cook bracken ferns for me?

616
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,841
-Yes.
-Here.

617
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,054
-Delicious.
-Is it good?

618
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,847
Yes, because my son fed me.

619
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,187
Mom, do you want coffee? Black or sweet?

620
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,438
Sweet, please.

621
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,815
Sweet, got it.

622
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,110
Who is it so early?

623
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,654
There's only one person
who'd come here at this hour.

624
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,543
Is everything okay?
Why are you staring at the falling leaves?

625
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,879
Because they're like me.

626
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,971
Those falling leaves remind me of myself.

627
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,100
Is it because of your kids?

628
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,396
Your eldest kid's visiting Korea and
you were excited to have dinner together.

629
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,400
He hadn't seen me for months,
but as soon as he saw me,

630
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,194
he said I should decide

631
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,156
how I want to divide my assets
when I'm still healthy.

632
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:59,290
If I just leave it until I become senile
and lose sound judgment,

633
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,543
my children would get into a big fight
over my assets.

634
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,547
He said I should sell everything now
and divide it equally.

635
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,841
Did he say it in such a heartless manner?

636
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,595
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

637
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:16,140
It was actually worse than how I said it.

638
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:22,021
Gosh, I'm getting upset again
now that I'm talking about it.

639
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,567
I know that he's right.

640
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,822
But I have to say,
I feel so hurt and resentful.

641
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,453
I'll give them everything I own.

642
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,290
Who will get all my assets
if my two sons don't?

643
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,543
But they're flat out asking me
to pass everything on to them.

644
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,963
It really hurt my feelings. I'm so pissed.

645
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,132
Darn it.

646
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,220
You said you'll give them everything
anyway.

647
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,641
Go ahead and divide your assets equally
among your kids.

648
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,436
Geon-tae must've hesitated for days
before he brought it up to you.

649
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,897
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

650
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:11,654
Rosa, my son is not like Jeong-won.

651
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,201
Jeong-won is one of a kind.

652
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,455
Even if he told me he'd go on
to become a priest now,

653
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,332
I wouldn't doubt him for a second.

654
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,875
-Hey!
-Watch.

655
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,129
Jeong-won.

656
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,217
-Yes?
-You know that your mother owns

657
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,095
some land in Hwaseong, right?
It's well over 10,000 pyeong.

658
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,889
She inherited it from her father.

659
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,433
Yes, I think I remember hearing about it.

660
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,145
She'll give it to you, as inheritance.

661
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,272
What?

662
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,942
Mom, really?

663
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,444
Yes, really. It's all yours.

664
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,364
Why?

665
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,243
Why would you give it to me?
I don't need it.

666
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,502
Just sell it and buy a nice apartment
so you can live comfortably.

667
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,839
Working on your vegetable garden
will make your back worse.

668
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,926
If you need more money,
I'll take out a loan and help you out.

669
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,304
A loan?

670
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,056
You're a doctor! Are you that broke?

671
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,059
Do you need a loan?

672
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:28,063
No, that's not what I meant.
A loan is an asset too.

673
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,357
-Not everyone can get a loan, Mom.
-Be quiet!

674
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,958
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

675
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:55,132
JI-AM MEDICAL CENTER
JANG JONG-GIL

676
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,890
-Hey.
-I'll do it.

677
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,725
-Really?
-I think I can do it.

678
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,145
I'm so relieved.
I hope it's not too much to ask though.

679
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,397
It won't be easy,

680
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,775
but it's a borderline case,
so I'd say it's doable.

681
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,527
I have operated on a patient
with a lower GRWR,

682
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,571
and the surgery went well.

683
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,866
And the test results tell me
that his son is young and healthy.

684
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,868
It's a borderline case, but it's doable.

685
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,745
His liver is barely functioning,

686
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,705
and we can't find another donor for him.

687
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,625
So I think we should take the risk
and give it a shot.

688
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,461
Let's have him come in on Monday
and get him tested.

689
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,047
Okay, I'll text Hyeong-do.

690
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,966
No, just text me his number.

691
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,427
I'll call him.
I have some questions for him anyway.

692
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,014
Really? He doesn't know
that I'm Daddy-Long-Legs.

693
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,685
Hey, what do you take me for?

694
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,147
I'll tell him Social Services
gave me the deets.

695
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,024
Okay, we'll tell him that.

696
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,901
-Bye.
-Bye.

697
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,498
Did you wash your hands?

698
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,711
Well done.

699
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,755
What do you want to eat?

700
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,883
I have to do some work from home,
so we'll order in. Is that okay?

701
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,510
-Yes.
-Great.

702
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,513
How about I guess
what you feel like eating?

703
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,515
Sure, it's a multiple-choice question.

704
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,934
You know what that means?

705
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,645
Tell me the options.

706
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,648
Choose the dish
U-ju is craving the most right now.

707
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:38,110
Wait, that sounds too hard.
I don't think I can do this.

708
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,070
Number one, a hamburger.

709
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,532
Number two, a burger.

710
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,452
-Number three.
-Yes.

711
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,288
Wait, hold on.

712
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,832
Hang on…

713
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,084
Don't you remember?

714
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,921
Then hold on, U-ju.

715
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:02,050
Let's hurry home. You can try to remember
what it was while eating your burger.

716
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,051
Let's go.

717
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,513
Let's see.

718
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,188
Did you have lunch?
Tell me what kind of burger you want.

719
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,772
I had lunch just now.

720
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,317
I'll go pick up the packages.

721
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,361
Okay. U-ju, I'm going to order you
a Happy Meal. Which one?

722
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,698
-The bulgogi burger, nuggets--
-I want the bulgogi burger combo.

723
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,493
I want French fries and juice.

724
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,204
Goodness, he knows the menu by heart.

725
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,539
-What about you, Dad?
-Me?

726
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,917
What should I get?

727
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,586
You? You should order
the supreme shrimp burger.

728
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,589
-Supreme shrimp?
-Yes, the large set.

729
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,925
Get cheese sticks instead of French fries.

730
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,761
And get cola.
I'm going to have a sip, okay?

731
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,803
Yes, sir.

732
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,479
Is it good?

733
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,441
I make really good burgers.

734
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,570
How about I flaunt my cooking skills
sometime next week?

735
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,823
Let's just order in. This tastes better.

736
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,497
Is everything going well
with Mo-ne and Ma-ne?

737
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,501
Ma-ne and Mo-ne always go camping
with their dad.

738
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,378
-Camping?
-Yes.

739
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,089
They brag every day
about going camping with their dad.

740
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,091
They go every weekend.

741
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,135
-Do you want to go camping too?
-Yes.

742
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,680
We can go too. Let's go camping.

743
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,098
-Really?
-Yes.

744
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:36,061
-Hey.
-Professor, Kim Eun-sun is vomiting blood.

745
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,938
Gastric variceal bleeding is suspected.

746
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,065
We're using the SB tube. It's better,

747
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,484
-but the bleeding won't stop.
-I'll be there soon.

748
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:46,238
Check her vitals and call Gastroenterology
for an emergency endoscopy.

749
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,699
We may not be able to do it,
so get a CT scan done

750
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,118
and see if she can get TIPS done.

751
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,078
Okay.

752
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,457
See you later, Dad.

753
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,627
It's okay. I'm used to it.

754
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,046
I'm sorry, sweetie.

755
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,675
No, Dad. You don't need to be sorry.

756
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,345
You're doing good deeds.

757
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,223
You want to spend time with me,
your universe.

758
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,602
But you're busy saving
the bigger universe out there.

759
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,980
-Who said that?
-Auntie Ik-sun.

760
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,656
I'll be quick.

761
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:33,201
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

762
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,829
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

763
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,253
Chief Kwon was really worried.
The recovery will be okay, right?

764
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,006
There was minimal blood loss,
and the incision is small.

765
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,175
There's sufficient remnant liver volume,

766
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,178
-so recovery won't be a problem.
-Okay.

767
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,554
Good job, everyone.

768
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,805
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

769
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,223
Well done.

770
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,358
Why didn't you come in?

771
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,735
Thanks for doing this.
You finished pretty early.

772
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,447
Yes. Thankfully, it wasn't big
as we had seen on the MRI scan,

773
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,158
and the location wasn't bad either.

774
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,662
The surgery went well, and there's
sufficient remnant liver volume.

775
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,497
So I don't think you need to worry.

776
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,876
My goodness.

777
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:27,089
Were you that worried?
Then you should've just done it yourself.

778
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,342
No other doctor has performed
more liver resections than you have.

779
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,387
This was my brother's request,
and I said yes right away.

780
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,055
What request?

781
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,808
He said I'd feel too pressured

782
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,601
and end up ruining the surgery.

783
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,104
He asked me to recommend
the best doctor I trust.

784
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,899
Don't you have appointments right away?

785
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,735
I'm sorry. I owe you big-time.

786
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,195
I'll return the favor tenfold.

787
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,197
Gosh, don't mention it.

788
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,325
I still have some time
until my first appointment.

789
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,410
Buy me a coffee.

790
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,454
Sure thing. I can even buy you
a coffee machine if you'd like.

791
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,455
Let's go!

792
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,165
Actually, forget it.

793
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,834
Well…

794
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,378
I don't want to have coffee with you.

795
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,296
What? Why are you so fickle?

796
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,424
I'll get coffee in my own time.

797
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,428
I don't want to start my morning
with a coffee date with you.

798
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,975
You should get some rest, Chief Kwon.

799
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,102
You have to do a transplant later.

800
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,522
I want to wait for my brother.

801
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,898
I'll wait until he wakes up.

802
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:35,657
Professor Lee, don't hesitate to tell me
if there's anything I can do for you.

803
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,159
I'll help you, no matter what.

804
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,119
Okay, thank you.

805
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,580
See you.

806
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,083
-Thanks again.
-No problem.

807
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,324
Good morning, Professor Chae.

808
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,950
Hi, good morning.

809
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,702
Have some bread.

810
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,120
Thanks.

811
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,998
-Don't you have a conference?
-I still have some time.

812
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,501
I wanted to stop by quickly to see you.

813
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,338
I'll be here all week.
Seok-min's farewell party is this week.

814
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,467
Gosh, I really don't understand
why he's leaving.

815
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,469
Did you guys fight?

816
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,805
Yes, we're in a cold war at the moment.

817
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,268
By the way, has Ms. Yoo's mother asked you
if you'd be interested in a blind date?

818
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,855
She asks me about you
every time she sees me.

819
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,316
"How old is she?
Does she have a boyfriend?

820
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:54,653
What does her father do?
Which school did she go to?"

821
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,947
She didn't say much
when I was doing rounds.

822
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,075
She must be asking me instead
because she's intimidated by you.

823
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,786
She has a son
and thinks you'd make a good couple.

824
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,247
She asks me questions about you
whenever she sees me.

825
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,917
If she says she wants to set you up
with her son--

826
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,710
I told her I'm not interested.

827
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,504
What?

828
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,340
She already asked me,
and I turned it down.

829
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,050
I see. I'm relieved to hear that.

830
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,471
Why would I go on a blind date
with my patient's brother?

831
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,348
I told her I'm not comfortable with it.

832
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,684
She probably won't give up.

833
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,812
Just tell her that you have a boyfriend.

834
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,647
Do I have to lie?

835
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,023
I don't care.

836
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,483
But it's annoying.

837
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,152
Just pick one of your friends
and say he's your boyfriend.

838
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,029
Tell her you're getting married soon.

839
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,615
Otherwise, she really won't give up.

840
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,785
What about him?

841
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,663
The owner of Yulje Medical Center.
A rich heir.

842
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,208
Hey, what's the song for this week?

843
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,129
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

844
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,843
-Who picked it?
-Ik-jun.

845
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,555
Is he trying to kill us or what?

846
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,310
Jeong-won doesn't own this hospital.

847
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,729
This hospital doesn't have an owner.

848
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,856
I'll take care of it, okay?

849
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,608
Then what about him?

850
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,235
If it's him, they'll believe you.

851
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,238
Your best friend,

852
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,949
who always makes you laugh.

853
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,620
-Professor Lee Ik-jun.
-Oh, right.

854
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,706
If you ask him,
he'll totally do it for you.

855
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,418
He's busy, and so am I.

856
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:37,255
But you know what?
You're the busiest one here, Seon-bin.

857
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,341
I have to go.

858
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,181
-Hello?
-Good morning.

859
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,185
Good morning, Hyeong-do.
You should be here if you're that worried.

860
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,978
Have you met him yet?

861
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,314
No, but he's my first patient today.

862
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,192
Can you squeeze in his surgery?
I hope he can get it soon.

863
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,612
Yes, my surgery on Friday
has been moved to next week,

864
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,615
so I should be able to do it this Friday
if everything's ready.

865
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,117
Seriously though, if you have some time,

866
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,702
come join us this Friday.

867
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,537
You've done so much for this patient.

868
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,581
It'd be nice to see him
before his surgery.

869
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,959
Or scrub in and help me out.

870
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,920
I want to watch the surgery,
but why this Friday of all days?

871
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,214
I'm doing my first transplant
in four months.

872
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,550
Nice. Just your hospital?

873
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,136
Yes, it's just us this time.

874
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,846
It's for a longtime patient,

875
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,848
who trusts us to perform the surgery.

876
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,392
I see. Congratulations.

877
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,896
Do you have enough staff?
How many assistants do you have?

878
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,690
One fellow and one resident.

879
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,775
The resident is only in his second year,

880
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,236
but the fellow will closely assist me.
He's good.

881
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:44,406
Look at you. You're a trailblazer.

882
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,491
I'd love to visit you.

883
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,120
Just make sure you save my patient.
He's a wonderful person.

884
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,998
I treated his liver cancer
for several years.

885
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,501
He used to volunteer at nursing homes
before his health started to decline,

886
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,254
and he donates 10,000 won
to a children's home every month.

887
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,382
He's someone I admire
before he's my patient.

888
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,344
Okay, I'm meeting him soon.
I'll tell him I know you.

889
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,763
Hey, Hyeong-do.

890
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:14,310
About your uncle…
He still owns that club, right?

891
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,980
My uncle owns a club?

892
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,483
He's been meditating in silence
for 98 days.

893
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,443
Bye.

894
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,251
This surgery won't be easy.

895
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,715
The low GRWR does concern me a little.

896
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,343
However,

897
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,722
the donor is young

898
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,099
and very healthy.

899
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,519
His liver is in great condition,
so with this size…

900
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,730
I think we can do the surgery.

901
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,484
Thank you.

902
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,278
-Thank you so much, Professor Lee.
-Thank you.

903
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,571
It is a borderline case.

904
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,365
You look quite skinny,
but you're very healthy.

905
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,077
Thank you, Professor.

906
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,328
Let's give it a shot.

907
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,582
And to be honest,
we have no other option at the moment.

908
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,501
Yes, I'm aware.

909
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,378
A liver transplant is
your father's only option now.

910
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,381
And since you're the only suitable donor,

911
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,549
we have to do this.

912
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,385
I'll do my very best.

913
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,140
It'll be an emergency surgery.
He'll be admitted right away,

914
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,601
and we need to run a few additional tests.

915
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,521
And the surgery will be this Friday.

916
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,107
One of my surgeries has been rescheduled,

917
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,401
so we'll do it this Friday
if there are no issues.

918
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,071
Thank you, Professor Lee.

919
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,074
I heard many people die

920
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,830
because they can't find donors.

921
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,999
Compared to them, I'm…

922
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,547
I'm incredibly lucky.

923
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,300
Doctor.

924
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:14,139
I can handle pain,

925
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,975
but my son…

926
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:23,606
He has to undergo surgery because of me.

927
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,610
So please…

928
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,740
make sure the entire process is painless
for my son.

929
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,033
Yes, I will.

930
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:39,539
I'll make sure his surgery is
completely painless. Don't worry.

931
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,627
Thank you. Thank you so much.

932
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,423
It's okay. This happens fairly often.

933
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,926
It's caused
by a bilateral pleural effusion.

934
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,138
But hopefully, the cardiac stimulant
and diuretics will be helpful.

935
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,306
We'll wait and see.

936
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,433
Okay.

937
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,062
We're monitoring his condition thoroughly,
so don't worry too much.

938
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,856
Okay, thank you.

939
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,736
Excuse me. Hey.

940
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,407
How's the BP?
Do the hands and feet feel warm?

941
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:17,994
I'm coming now.

942
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,621
We'll talk soon.

943
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,067
Mr. Son Chan-gyu, are you thirsty?

944
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,902
Yes, I'm parched.

945
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:53,029
He's thirsty.

946
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:56,783
His CVP is low,
and his fluid balance is negative,

947
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,369
so don't reduce the input.
You can actually increase it.

948
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,329
-Call me if anything happens.
-Yes, sir.

949
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,627
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hi.

950
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,963
There are two types of VAD,
internal and external.

951
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:14,133
Only the external type can be used
on infants and young children.

952
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,760
-Yes.
-The power source

953
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:19,180
and control unit outside shut down
within 30 minutes if disconnected,

954
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,932
so hospitalization is required.

955
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,017
But adults can get the implantable type,

956
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,812
so they can be discharged
and wait to receive a transplant.

957
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,189
-Good.
-Also, they operate differently.

958
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,109
Then what is
the most basic factor considered

959
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,860
for selecting a compatible donor?

960
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,283
This is basic knowledge.

961
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,457
-Blood type?
-Yes, the blood types must be compatible.

962
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,586
I can't believe
you had to think that long about this.

963
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,254
Right?

964
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,465
This is not good.

965
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,809
Looks like you'll have to study a lot.

966
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,937
The difficulty level
is all over the place.

967
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:14,485
But I hope Professor Kim knows
that I'm a fixed intern.

968
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,155
I'm sure he knows.

969
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,532
He interviewed you himself
as the department chief.

970
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:24,037
Right? I'm already afraid of CS.

971
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,104
What are you doing here?

972
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,066
Just making eye contact with Gyeong-mi.

973
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,652
-Professor Cheon's patient?
-Yes.

974
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,364
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

975
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,998
She's Professor Cheon's patient.
Our eyes met when I was walking by.

976
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,001
She smiled at me with her eyes,
so I smiled back.

977
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:15,880
She had an aortic dissection while riding
her bike, right? She had surgery.

978
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,633
Yes, she's been diagnosed
with a hereditary disease.

979
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,553
Her treatment had been going well,

980
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,390
but a dissection occurred
when she was riding her bike.

981
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,475
And the fall damaged
her C3 and C4 vertebrae.

982
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,478
She might end up a quadriplegic.

983
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,979
The surgery was also difficult.

984
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:35,066
It's scary because you never know
when a dissection can occur.

985
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,776
Her family must be very worried.

986
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,027
She has no family.

987
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,363
She's an orphan.

988
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,989
Isn't there a guardian?

989
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,660
There's no one. No family or relatives.

990
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,620
There's a nun who visits her sometimes,

991
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,331
but I've been stopping by
every single day,

992
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,583
and she's always alone.

993
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:57,130
I wish I could keep her company,

994
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,673
but I don't have time.

995
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:29,871
Eun-ji has had a pleural effusion too.

996
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,792
I was really worried too back then.

997
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,129
But she overcame it.

998
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,384
It'll be okay.

999
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,264
You haven't eaten anything yet, right?

1000
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,144
I brought some apples.
Let's eat it together.

1001
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,563
Come on.

1002
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,458
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1003
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,543
What about here?

1004
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,545
-None.
-None? Did you double-check?

1005
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,635
Hello.

1006
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,386
-Hello.
-Hello.

1007
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,983
My gosh, Professor Lee.

1008
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,528
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello.

1009
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,364
Your surgery is tomorrow.
How are you feeling?

1010
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,324
Good.

1011
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,952
I feel great.

1012
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,870
What about you?

1013
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,163
I feel great too.

1014
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,791
I'm glad to hear that. I feel great too.

1015
01:03:56,874 --> 01:04:01,754
Professor Lee,
I was totally fine until yesterday.

1016
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,800
But this morning, it suddenly hit me
that the surgery is tomorrow.

1017
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:09,095
And my heart has been pounding like crazy
since then.

1018
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,639
Even my hands are trembling.

1019
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,559
I'm more nervous and anxious
than they are.

1020
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,811
Don't worry too much.

1021
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,437
It is a big, difficult surgery,

1022
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,356
but I'll be the one dealing with it.

1023
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,526
When they wake up from their sleep,
it'll all be over already.

1024
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:26,612
So try not to worry,
and take good care of yourself today.

1025
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,114
Thank you, Professor Lee.

1026
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,658
And if you…

1027
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:36,330
get a chance to talk
to Professor Baek Hyeong-do,

1028
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:43,379
please let him know
how grateful I am for all his help.

1029
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,716
You said the two of you
went to med school together.

1030
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,551
Yes, we talk often on the phone.

1031
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,429
I plan to visit him after my surgery,

1032
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,056
but I still want to tell him

1033
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,268
that I'll come see him soon,
happy and healthy.

1034
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:02,565
Please tell him not to worry too much.

1035
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,401
I'll definitely relay the message.

1036
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,986
All right, get some rest.

1037
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,112
-Will do.
-Thank you.

1038
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,490
-Your surgery ended early.
-Yes.

1039
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,326
Didn't you say you had surgery too?

1040
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,412
Yes, I should eat quickly and go.
I have a few minutes.

1041
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,176
Did you not have breakfast?

1042
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,595
Is this your first meal?

1043
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,681
I had breakfast.

1044
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,101
I just couldn't pass up this meat dish,
which I love.

1045
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,273
Hey, why did you have to
discourage her like that?

1046
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,444
What will you do if she's too embarrassed
to finish her food now…

1047
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,495
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

1048
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:00,456
You should pay extra
if you have a conscience.

1049
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,375
Okay.

1050
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,255
I heard Hyeong-do sent his patient to you
for surgery.

1051
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:12,009
This is the first surgery
Daddy-Long-Legs is sponsoring.

1052
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,803
This is great.

1053
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,305
-I think this is a good direction for us.
-Yes.

1054
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,224
How do you know about Daddy-Long-Legs?

1055
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,145
I'm just kidding.

1056
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,566
Jeez, you freak.

1057
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,319
How's Hyeong-do doing?

1058
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,279
He was this prick's rival.

1059
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,031
That reminds me. I have to call him.

1060
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,665
Hey, can you talk now?

1061
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,291
Yes, what's up?

1062
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,502
Mr. Jang Jong-gil says hi.

1063
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,422
He asked me to tell you
not to worry about his surgery.

1064
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,049
Why would I be worried
when you're doing the surgery?

1065
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:56,012
Tell him I'm not worried at all
and that I send him my best regards.

1066
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,055
Is everything okay?
You sound a little down.

1067
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,351
My surgery is tomorrow,
but something happened.

1068
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,520
I don't think
we can do the surgery tomorrow.

1069
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,813
What happened?

1070
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:09,066
The fellow had a cerebral hemorrhage
and collapsed this morning.

1071
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,945
Thankfully, he's in surgery now,
so he'll live.

1072
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:16,115
But the problem is the surgery tomorrow.

1073
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,868
I asked a university hospital nearby
to send us a doctor,

1074
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,953
but they're short-staffed too.

1075
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,497
Looks like we have to reschedule it.

1076
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:27,251
But I can't bring myself
to tell the patient.

1077
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,670
Hey, hold on.
Jeong-won, can you clean up for me?

1078
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,298
Sure.

1079
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,886
Sol's mother from Tongyeong signed a lease
for a room near the hospital.

1080
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:41,015
Really? That's such good news.
It's been so hard for her.

1081
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,850
We could at least go home to shower.

1082
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:46,479
She always washed up at the sauna
and slept uncomfortably there.

1083
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:51,484
She told me that we can shower and sleep
at her place whenever we need to.

1084
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,694
She even gave me her door code.

1085
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,697
That's very kind of her.

1086
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,576
How long has Sol been hooked up
to the ECMO?

1087
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,536
It's been a while.

1088
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,622
Not as long as Eun-ji though.

1089
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:05,873
I see.

1090
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,918
My goodness. Why is the nurse calling?

1091
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,338
Yes, hello.

1092
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,676
Sorry?

1093
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,516
Really?

1094
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,103
Yes, Min-chan is the first one
on the list.

1095
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:30,356
KONOS just called us. The first
brain death diagnosis is confirmed,

1096
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,358
and Min-chan is getting the heart.

1097
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,614
Thank you.

1098
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,367
Thank you so much.

1099
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,788
This isn't a dream, right?

1100
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,624
No, it's not.
You're at the hospital now, right?

1101
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:51,919
Come to the PICU. Professor Kim
will fill you in on the details.

1102
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,713
Okay, I'm coming now.

1103
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,220
What should I do? My gosh…

1104
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,515
What's going on?
Did they find a donor for Min-chan?

1105
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:08,561
Yes, Min-chan is getting the heart.

1106
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,981
They chose Min-chan.

1107
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,109
Hurry and go.

1108
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,111
You don't have time to cry now. Hurry.

1109
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,489
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1110
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,035
This is a miracle!

1111
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,476
We found a donor this morning.

1112
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,146
Considering the blood type, weight,
and so on,

1113
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,939
Min-chan was at the top of our list.

1114
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,859
But we thought the situation could change,

1115
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,944
so we waited
for the brain death declaration.

1116
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,863
And we just got a call from KONOS.

1117
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,699
The first assessment
and the transplant have been confirmed.

1118
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,869
Min-chan's getting the heart,

1119
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,954
and we'll go ahead with the transplant.

1120
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,750
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Professor Kim.

1121
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,961
The donor is 6 years old and weighs 18kg.

1122
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,631
Blood type A,
which is the same as Min-chan's.

1123
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,677
My gosh, I can't believe
this miracle is happening to us.

1124
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,932
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1125
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:33,604
Don't thank me. Thank the donor's family
for making such a difficult decision--

1126
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:36,273
Yes, I will live with a grateful heart

1127
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,361
until the day I die.

1128
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,909
Yes, but they still have to do
the second assessment

1129
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,452
and make the final decision,

1130
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,580
so the transplant surgery won't happen
until tomorrow.

1131
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,457
Don't stay up all night here.

1132
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,877
You should go home, get some rest,
and come back tomorrow.

1133
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,464
-Okay.
-Okay.

1134
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,842
I guess you're not going home.

1135
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,805
We want to stay here with Min-chan.

1136
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:08,764
Yes.

1137
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:10,933
All right, then.

1138
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,019
Thank you.

1139
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,604
Congratulations.

1140
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,773
I'm so happy for you.

1141
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,776
-It really is a miracle.
-Thank you.

1142
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:23,904
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1143
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,781
I know how worried you were.

1144
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:29,243
-Min-chan will become healthy in no time.
-Congratulations.

1145
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,002
-Professor Kim.
-Yes.

1146
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:44,091
Eun-ji's turn will come too, right?

1147
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,805
Yes, of course.

1148
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,016
I trust that it will.

1149
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,519
Yes.

1150
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:03,485
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1151
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,679
Is your class over?

1152
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,765
Yes, I'm home now.

1153
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,517
You seem to be in a great mood.

1154
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,935
You can tell?

1155
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,271
Yes, it's so obvious.

1156
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,858
I'm going on a trip with my friends
this weekend.

1157
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:45,444
We're going to Bournemouth,
for three days!

1158
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:49,531
Really? That's great. Have fun.
Who are you going with?

1159
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,660
Se-gyeong and a couple Se-gyeong knows.
Four people in total.

1160
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,162
We're going to rent a car.

1161
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:58,082
Really? Will you be okay?
They drive on the opposite side.

1162
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,167
Just take the train or bus.

1163
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,669
I won't be driving.
Se-gyeong's friend will.

1164
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:03,962
Don't worry.

1165
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,342
Okay. Call me when you're leaving
and when you arrive there.

1166
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:11,303
Will do. I'll be sure to report to you.

1167
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,515
Gosh, I'm really worried.

1168
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,683
Why are you worried?

1169
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,937
Professor Kim, I'm turning 40 soon.

1170
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,107
What does that have to do with driving?

1171
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,526
Anyway,
make sure your friend drives safely.

1172
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,111
Will do!

1173
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,988
I'm hungry. I need to eat something.

1174
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,324
-Bye!
-Bye.

1175
01:13:58,642 --> 01:13:59,643
Come in.

1176
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,731
Do you want to step out with me
for some fresh air?

1177
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:05,858
The stars are out.

1178
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,070
Sure.

1179
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,490
It'd be great if you could scrub in.

1180
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,535
Dr. Park's my main assistant.
You can be the second assistant.

1181
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:20,539
Or I'll take care
of the procurement for you.

1182
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,377
Really? I'd love that.

1183
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,714
Yes, that'd be better.
Let the kids have the opportunity.

1184
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:42,895
What's wrong?

1185
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:45,731
Hang on a minute.

1186
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,407
Okay.

1187
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,451
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1188
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,371
SURGERY PATIENT
FAMILY WAITING ROOM

1189
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,472
PATIENT NAME: LEE MIN-CHAN
CURRENT LOCATION: OPERATING UNIT

1190
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,829
-Let's remove the heart now.
-Okay.

1191
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,044
Professor Kim, the donor heart is here.

1192
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,212
Thanks.

1193
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,382
Was it beating fine until it was removed?

1194
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:36,883
Yes, it seemed fine.

1195
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:39,636
Thanks.

1196
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,472
No problem. I'll go wash my hands.

1197
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,833
The portal vein is blocked,

1198
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,252
so you'll see a lot of varices
and severe ascites.

1199
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,880
Manage bleeding carefully.
Don't get flustered.

1200
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,715
Yes, Professor.

1201
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:19,760
I'll call you if I can't keep
the bleeding under control.

1202
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,471
Sure, anytime.

1203
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,020
Let's do a good job, as usual.

1204
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:44,326
The liver is quite small as expected,
but we can do this.

1205
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,953
I'll go take care of the benchwork.

1206
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:50,374
Make sure you check for bleeding
and bile leakage.

1207
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:51,667
Close it up nicely.

1208
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,085
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1209
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:18,485
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1210
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:21,279
Hospital discharge at this hour
is unheard of.

1211
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,199
The room's paid for until tomorrow.

1212
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:27,661
They paid another 1.7 million won
just so they wouldn't have to rush.

1213
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:31,456
What a flex.

1214
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,001
What does that mean? "Flaxen"?

1215
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,045
I'll tell you next time.

1216
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:42,551
Hello, congratulations on going home.

1217
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,219
Hello, Professor Chae.

1218
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,972
I was so anxious,
thinking you might not stop by today.

1219
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,849
This is perfect timing.

1220
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,518
I think you two are meant to be.

1221
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:56,857
Hey, this is Professor Chae Song-hwa,
the doctor who performed my surgery.

1222
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,988
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

1223
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,239
Come join us.

1224
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,619
He's so shy.

1225
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,790
No wonder
he's never had a real girlfriend.

1226
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,667
Take a seat.

1227
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,546
I'll make you a cup of tea.
We have some cookies too. Have a seat.

1228
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:22,215
It's okay, ma'am. I just had some tea.

1229
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,887
Seizures can occur
after brain tumor surgery,

1230
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,890
so make sure you take
your anticonvulsant medication.

1231
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:33,852
You may experience postoperative bleeding
as the surgical site is still healing.

1232
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:37,647
The incision could open up,
so avoid strenuous exercise.

1233
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,191
Okay, will do.

1234
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,860
Come back and see me in two weeks,

1235
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,155
but rush to the ER
if you experience headaches or dizziness.

1236
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,866
Then I'll see you in two weeks.

1237
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:51,953
Wait, Professor Chae. If you don't mind,

1238
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,623
we'd love to take a picture with you.

1239
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:57,667
I'm just so glad we met like this.
Please take a picture with us.

1240
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,377
Yes, take a picture with us.

1241
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,297
-Well…
-Come join us, son!

1242
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,799
Let's take a picture together.

1243
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:10,055
Let me buy you a coffee, Professor Chae.
Is that okay, Mom?

1244
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,474
Yes, of course. By all means.

1245
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,310
Let's go.

1246
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:17,437
Shall we?

1247
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,242
It ended an hour early.

1248
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,662
It doesn't mean there's a problem, right?

1249
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:37,666
Yes, of course. Don't worry.
I'm sure everything went well.

1250
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:38,917
Okay.

1251
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,609
The surgery went well.

1252
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,574
Thank you. Thank you, Professor Kim!

1253
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,492
Thank you, Professor Kim.

1254
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:16,538
Min-chan is okay now.

1255
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,582
Our son is okay now.

1256
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,086
Don't cry. It's happy news.

1257
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:24,754
The surgery went well,

1258
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:27,465
and we received the donor heart on time.

1259
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:30,802
The heartbeat is solid,
and there was only minimal bleeding,

1260
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,179
so we could wrap up earlier than expected.

1261
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:35,515
They're closing up his chest now,

1262
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:38,685
and he'll be moved to the ICU
in about half an hour.

1263
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,938
I'll see you there in a bit.

1264
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,441
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1265
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:51,865
Keep it up.

1266
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:53,325
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1267
01:21:57,954 --> 01:22:00,373
My gosh, Professor Lee.

1268
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,042
The surgery went well.

1269
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:03,668
My gosh…

1270
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,046
Thank you.

1271
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:10,133
It was a little difficult to remove
the blood clot from the portal vein,

1272
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:13,720
and variceal hemorrhage,
which he'd had before, happened again.

1273
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,765
But thankfully, the bleeding stopped
once we connected the liver.

1274
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,099
My goodness.

1275
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,977
That's why it took longer
than we had expected,

1276
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,604
but the surgery went well.

1277
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:26,149
All the important parts are done.
They're wrapping up now.

1278
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:29,069
He'll be moved to the ICU
in an hour or so.

1279
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:33,031
He'll be on a ventilator for a while,
so he won't be able to talk.

1280
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,784
But I'll make sure you can still see him.

1281
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:39,162
My gosh, Professor Lee…

1282
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,373
Thank you so much.

1283
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,249
You can put your worries to rest now.

1284
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:46,002
Don't worry. It's okay.

1285
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,214
I'm really sorry.
It must have made you very uncomfortable.

1286
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,633
I apologize on her behalf. I'm sorry.

1287
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,887
It's all right. I'm not the type
to be bothered by things like that.

1288
01:22:56,429 --> 01:23:00,600
You're probably very busy.
She must have been such a nuisance.

1289
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:01,935
I'm sorry again.

1290
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:07,232
No, I should thank you
for saving me earlier.

1291
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:11,069
Now, I know exactly
how to handle situations like that.

1292
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,278
That was smooth, right?

1293
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,114
Yes.

1294
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:21,037
Is the café still open?

1295
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,415
-Yes, the part-timer sent me a DM.
-What?

1296
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,417
A DM. We're friends on Instagram.

1297
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,043
What does all that gibberish mean?

1298
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,880
Min-chan's out. Hey, I have to go.

1299
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:35,510
Really?

1300
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,555
Yes, I have a girlfriend.

1301
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,474
Your mother seemed to have no idea.

1302
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,435
She knows.

1303
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,105
Oh, my sister doesn't know
because she was overseas for years.

1304
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:48,940
Does she not approve of her?

1305
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,068
No, definitely not.

1306
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,196
My girlfriend's from an average family.

1307
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,324
My mother doesn't like that
and her job too.

1308
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:01,578
She used to be so fond of her though.

1309
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,833
We were friends long
before we started dating.

1310
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:10,378
My mother knows her very well too.
We became friends in college.

1311
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,465
My gosh. Then how did you suddenly start
seeing each other?

1312
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:18,094
She professed her feelings for me
out of the blue one day.

1313
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,640
Last year. She told me that she liked me.

1314
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:27,729
I rejected her at first.

1315
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,816
We were best friends,
so I didn't want things to get awkward.

1316
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:36,571
I told her,
"I want us to stay best friends."

1317
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,661
That night, I came home
and mulled over what I said to her.

1318
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:48,792
Then I realized
I hadn't really answered her question.

1319
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,588
She told me she liked me,

1320
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,509
but I told her I didn't want
our relationship to get awkward.

1321
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:01,763
My answer didn't make sense.

1322
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:07,560
So I started seeing our relationship
in a different light.

1323
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:12,065
As a man and a woman,
not just two friends.

1324
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,526
Well…

1325
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,072
I really like her.

1326
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,075
When I'm with her, I feel so…

1327
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,121
happy.

1328
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:30,583
When I'm with her, I always feel…

1329
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:34,003
I feel great.

1330
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,426
Do you have a friend like that too?

1331
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:42,262
Me?

1332
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,393
Hello.

1333
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:51,938
Oh, sorry.

1334
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:01,406
Here, these are for the nurses.

1335
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,658
Thank you. This will make their day.

1336
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,829
-Aren't you done for the day?
-Yes, I just want to check in on Mr. Jang.

1337
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,416
Hold on. One's missing a straw.

1338
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:12,709
This one's mine.

1339
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,171
-Take it easy.
-Bye.

1340
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,851
It went well.
I'm headed to the ICU now to see him.

1341
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:33,479
-Hey, seriously.
-What?

1342
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:36,691
Hey, I can't believe you sent your chief.

1343
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,026
Isn't he good?

1344
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:40,945
Was he confused because
he hasn't assisted anyone in ages?

1345
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,616
Jeez, seriously.

1346
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,117
You're nuts.

1347
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,747
Hey, hold on.
Jeong-won, can you clean up for me?

1348
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:53,249
Sure.

1349
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:59,088
Hyeong-do, don't tell the patient yet.
I'll call you in five minutes.

1350
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:00,715
Okay.

1351
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,178
Tell me, whatever it is.

1352
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,888
I'll do anything for you.

1353
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,932
What are you doing tomorrow?

1354
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,683
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

1355
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:15,104
I have a conference in the morning,
but I'm available after that.

1356
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:19,025
These days, I try not to book anything
after lunch on Fridays.

1357
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,944
I'm going to retire soon,

1358
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:23,446
so I can slack off a little.
No one says anything.

1359
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,200
Why? What is it?

1360
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,204
Then can you go to Mokpo tomorrow?

1361
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:37,627
I'd like to give you a chance
to help some trailblazers.

1362
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,970
The surgery went well, right?

1363
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,973
-Yes, it went very well.
-Way to go.

1364
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:53,559
Ik-jun, Chief Kwon
helped us out so much today.

1365
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,229
He helped us clear a bunch of hurdles.

1366
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:59,983
Really? I'm going to call him in a bit.
I'll let him know.

1367
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,361
-Thanks.
-What? Come on.

1368
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:06,614
Whatever. I'll let you go. Get some rest.

1369
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,992
-Okay, nice work today.
-Bye.

1370
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:44,152
I don't know what love is yet
I do not know

1371
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:50,908
But we are happy together

1372
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:57,999
Your confusing confession
Makes my heart flutter

1373
01:28:58,082 --> 01:29:02,337
But it's too difficult to understand
So I don't like it

1374
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,715
I don't like it

1375
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:13,556
People have told me

1376
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:20,063
That they like my cute smile

1377
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:26,402
But not anymore

1378
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:33,910
I have a secret now

1379
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:42,251
But I like you
This could be love

1380
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:49,967
But I like you
This could be love

1381
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,094
Guitar.

1382
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:21,874
I don't know what love is yet
I do not know

1383
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:28,381
But we are happy together

1384
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:35,930
Your confusing confession
Makes my heart flutter

1385
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:39,892
But it's too difficult to understand
So I don't like it

1386
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,062
I don't like it

1387
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:51,112
People have told me

1388
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:57,618
That they like my cute smile

1389
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:04,000
But not anymore

1390
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:11,132
I have a secret now

1391
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:19,932
But I like you
This could be love

1392
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:26,063
But I like you
This could be love

1393
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:32,570
But I like you
This could be love

1394
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:36,407
La-la-la-la-la-la

1395
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:43,873
La-la-la-la-la-la

1396
01:31:57,553 --> 01:31:59,972
She should be there by now.

1397
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,141
Why isn't she picking up?

1398
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,771
Hello?

1399
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:53,192
Isn't this Lee Ik-sun's phone?

1400
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:57,655
Yes, it is.
Ik-sun can't come to the phone right now.

1401
01:32:57,738 --> 01:33:01,450
You must be her boyfriend. I picked up
because I didn't want you to worry.

1402
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:02,994
I'm Ik-sun's friend.

1403
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:06,330
I see. Is everything okay with her?

1404
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,710
Well, it's nothing too serious.
But we got into a car accident,

1405
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:12,461
and she's a little hurt.

1406
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:16,132
She hurt her arm and head.
She's getting some tests done now.

1407
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,511
It's nothing serious though.
You really don't need to worry.

1408
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:25,474
-Well…
-She said not to tell you or her family…

1409
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:27,226
-Wait.
-…but I didn't want you to worry.

1410
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:29,729
What kinds of tests is she getting?

1411
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:32,064
I'm not really sure.

1412
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:36,068
It's probably for the brain.
She bled quite a bit from a head wound.

1413
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:39,322
She'll be out shortly.
I'll tell her to call you.

1414
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:42,908
Okay, please tell her I'll stay up
and wait for her call.

1415
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:44,327
Okay, I'll let her know.

1416
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,079
Thank you. What's your name?

1417
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:49,707
I'm Ko Se-gyeong.

1418
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,585
Ik-sun and I live in the same building.

1419
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,587
I'm her closest friend here.

1420
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,357
Is something up with Jun-wan?
He's lost so much weight.

1421
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,235
I can't really eat.
I feel like I'm chewing sand now.

1422
01:34:59,318 --> 01:35:01,904
He's stressed out.
Too many surgeries. He's overworked.

1423
01:35:01,987 --> 01:35:04,115
I've never seen him so stressed out.

1424
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:06,117
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week.

1425
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,910
Are you taking his patients?

1426
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:09,954
I don't care. Mind your own business.

1427
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:12,540
What do you mean? Ik-sun.

1428
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:15,042
Something's happened, right?

1429
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,627
Could he have broken up
with his girlfriend?

1430
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:20,172
A bunch of things are stressing me out.
I have a lot on my mind.

1431
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:21,340
And? What else?

1432
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:25,678
I heard too.
Everyone at the hospital knows.

1433
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:27,721
Just wait. Something will come along.

1434
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:29,223
On one condition though.

1435
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,309
I might go back to Sokcho tonight.
I'm weird, right?

1436
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,437
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it to myself.

1437
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:37,982
How did you know? Can you read my mind?

1438
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:41,444
I feel so reassured when you're in Seoul.

1439
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,238
Dr. Heo, we shouldn't be so quick
to open up the head.

1440
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:45,781
No way. What are the chances?

1441
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:48,784
-I'm sorry.
-You know this is serious, right?

1442
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:51,370
I really can't figure him out.

1443
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:56,459
