1
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,193
Who is it?

2
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,529
Why did you leave without seeing me?

3
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,531
Where are you? Let me buy you dinner.

4
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,827
I won't mention becoming a priest.
Have dinner with me.

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,328
I didn't come here to see you.

6
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,039
I'm leaving now. Get back to work.

7
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,540
Mom!

8
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,085
I'm having dinner with Jong-su.

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,712
Bye.

10
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,089
He is on a business trip. What--

11
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,805
Mom. Mom!

12
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,197
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,826
If you're free, you should hide
in the on-call room now.

14
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,496
It's all right.
Thanks for looking out for me.

15
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,791
Shouldn't you be off now?

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,793
You're kind of a workaholic.

17
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,253
I'm not working. I'm waiting
for Song-hwa to have dinner together.

18
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,506
She's talking to someone,
so I'm waiting for her now.

19
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,091
You're worried about something, right?

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,552
Tell me. I'll help you out.

21
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,098
Tell me.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,226
Professor Lee.

23
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,232
-It's nothing.
-What is it?

24
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,531
-It's nothing.
-Gosh, I want to figure out what it is.

25
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,991
I'm sure it has to do with Jeong-won.

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,702
Should I bring him here alive?

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,830
No, don't do that. He'll get hurt.

28
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
My gosh.

29
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,463
Gyeo-ul, I'm just curious, okay?

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,674
Since

31
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,718
when did you like Jeong-won?

32
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,056
I'm just curious.

33
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,309
Isn't that obvious?

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,858
I heard you're transferring
to the Sokcho branch.

35
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,528
I told him about it just this morning.

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
Gosh, words travel fast here.

37
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,991
I'll transfer to the branch too.

38
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,743
You can't.

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,622
Come on, be reasonable.
Why would you work there?

40
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,876
Because you are going there.

41
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,712
Get a grip, Chi-hong.

42
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,797
There are no residents over there.

43
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,466
If you transfer, you'll have to do
everything on your own.

44
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,510
It's not worth giving up
your position here.

45
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,264
Besides, if you transfer
before you become the chief,

46
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,433
it might backfire
during your interview later.

47
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,268
It's not a good decision for your career.

48
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,187
Chi-hong.

49
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,982
Who would transfer
in their fourth year of residency?

50
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,776
Instead, assist with more surgeries
and meet more patients.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,196
That's what you need the most
and that will become your assets.

52
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,452
The last year of your residency
will be the most important period for you.

53
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,663
Just hang in there for one more year
and get the board.

54
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,082
Okay?

55
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,043
I will make decisions

56
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,212
for my life.

57
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,933
Kim Sang-man is in the OR now.
I'll get going now.

58
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,385
I was just about to call you.

59
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,138
-What are you doing?
-I just got home.

60
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,933
-What about you?
-I'm about to get off work.

61
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,353
You're getting off work
really early today.

62
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,688
What's your plan after work?

63
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,607
I'll head over to you now.
Don't go to sleep yet.

64
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,818
-Now?
-Yes. See you soon.

65
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,579
Do you want to eat or starve?

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,002
Did something happen again?

67
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,840
Really?

68
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,970
Gosh, life is

69
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
so shitty.

70
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,268
I can't believe your father.
Now you can't even talk shit about him.

71
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:27,577
I LEAVE ALL OF MY ASSETS
TO MY SON, YANG SEOK-HYEONG

72
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,456
When was this will written?

73
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,707
It was probably this spring.

74
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,627
It was the day when Ms. Kim Tae-yeon
told him about her pregnancy.

75
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,546
He drafted it that night.

76
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,424
That crazy bastard.

77
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,136
Did he leave anything to Ms. Kim?

78
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,849
None, to my knowledge.

79
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,897
The chairman considered Ms. Kim
nothing more than his caregiver

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,441
who will look after him until he dies.

81
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
That's what I have gathered
based on my knowledge.

82
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,613
What a jerk.

83
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,199
He impregnated her with a child.

84
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,410
That's a load of crap.

85
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,371
That selfish jerk.

86
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,541
He only cared about himself all his life,
that worthless leech.

87
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,808
Is there anything else in the will?

88
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,684
Like his last words
to your mother and you?

89
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,062
There is.

90
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,565
He wants me to run the company.

91
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,363
He wrote that I should quit my job
and run the company.

92
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,243
He's surely interested in my life.

93
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,541
So

94
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,334
will you quit your job?

95
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,053
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

96
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,187
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello.

97
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,773
-What's the line for?
-To consult.

98
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,234
I need to consult Professor Chae
about something.

99
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,444
Mine is about my career.

100
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,196
She's busy and sick.

101
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,493
Hello.

102
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,996
Dr. Yong, what did you talk about?

103
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,375
About dating.

104
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,253
-She talks about dating, too?
-Yes.

105
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,880
She can do it all.

106
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,591
She's better than
a professional consultant.

107
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,431
I miss those days...

108
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,183
Let's eat.

109
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,392
-Sir!
-Sir!

110
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,352
-Be quiet.
-I have a lecture in 20 minutes.

111
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,980
Get lost, Ik-jun. Dr. Do?

112
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,692
Beautiful Chae Song-hwa!

113
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,403
I only have eyes for you!

114
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,697
Hello, Professor Chae.

115
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,988
MEN'S CHANGING ROOM

116
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,993
This is Ahn Jeong-won speaking.

117
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,079
Hello, this is Bae Jun-hui
from Emergency Medicine.

118
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:58,996
Hello.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,666
I have a seven-year-old girl
with blunt trauma to the abdomen.

120
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,918
She is mentally alert
and her BP is fine for now.

121
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,753
But her heart rate is high.

122
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,966
I did an echocardiogram with FAST,
and she has grade-four liver laceration.

123
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,885
I saw symptoms of hemoperitoneum,
so I took an abdomen CT.

124
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,345
And there's active bleeding.

125
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,305
Okay. I'm on my way now.

126
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,476
Dr. Jang.

127
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,728
Yes? Yes, Professor Ahn.

128
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,398
There's a seven-year-old girl
with blunt trauma in the ER.

129
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,858
Her vitals aren't good,
so we need to operate now.

130
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,653
Call Anesthesiology
and get me an OR as soon as possible.

131
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,405
And order transfusion for the patent.

132
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,447
Okay.

133
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,291
Hello, this is Jang Gyeo-ul from GS.

134
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,423
You're helping Seok-hyeong
with his paper? Why?

135
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,885
Why do you think? He asked me for help.

136
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,929
-Seok-hyeong asked you?
-Yes.

137
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,850
Why is he here?

138
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,102
Hello, Professor Yang. Sit right here.

139
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,856
Which department
do you not hang around, Ik-jun?

140
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,898
I go everywhere.

141
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,400
-Seok-hyeong. Teddy Bear.
-What?

142
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,944
Did you ask Dr. Chu to help you
with your paper?

143
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,074
Residents are busy. Don't bother them.

144
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,119
I did?

145
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,625
We don't have soup. Who wants cup noodles?

146
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,839
You two should finish this.
I have outpatients.

147
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,607
-Eat up.
-Okay.

148
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,368
Please come this way.

149
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,040
I did run the test.

150
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,293
Her liver is severely lacerated,

151
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,422
and a blood vessel is still bleeding
in her abdominal cavity.

152
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,841
We must undergo laparotomy now.

153
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,596
We will try to find
the damaged blood vessel

154
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,099
and stop the bleeding by ligating it
or performing hemostasis.

155
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,893
We may have to cut the parts

156
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,562
that are too damaged
for us to stop the bleeding.

157
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,939
How long is the surgery?

158
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,607
It will take at least two hours.

159
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,485
If the surgery gets difficult,
it may take up to four hours.

160
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,822
But I'll have to start the surgery
to check more in detail.

161
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,824
I'll do my best.

162
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,409
What?

163
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,203
Why not? We're married.

164
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,663
Well, that's...

165
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,666
We really had a wedding,
and we have wedding photos, too.

166
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,668
There are a lot of witnesses.

167
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,296
Doctor, he's been suffering
from ascites lately.

168
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,341
And a while ago, he coughed up blood,
so he had an endoscopy.

169
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,636
Doctor, he needs to be treated urgently.

170
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,639
I understand your point,
but even if you're a couple,

171
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,018
your marriage must be registered--

172
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,230
We'll do it. We'll register it today.

173
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,606
Even if so,

174
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,276
the regulation set by KONOS states
that you must be married

175
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,237
for a year for the living-donor
liver transplant to be approved.

176
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,990
To prevent any organ trade,

177
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,868
getting approved as a donor
is quite complicated.

178
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,250
I'm okay. I'm not going
to die anytime soon. Okay?

179
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,793
You're not going to die.

180
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,546
Don't say stuff like that.
Your mother is here, too.

181
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,300
I would recommend
getting a transplant right now,

182
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,510
but if you have to wait for the donor,

183
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,970
let's get treated first.

184
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,430
Why don't we

185
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,559
proceed with the living-donor
liver transplant after a year?

186
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,603
We'll monitor you as well.

187
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,692
When was your wedding?

188
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,986
Four months ago.

189
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,990
Had we registered our marriage then,

190
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,161
there would have been
only eight months left to wait.

191
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,830
If you don't mind,

192
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,500
can I ask why you didn't register
your marriage?

193
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,919
I told them not to do it.

194
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,838
When they were dating,

195
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,550
my son was diagnosed with cirrhosis.

196
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,095
Both families were against their marriage,

197
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,140
but they went ahead and got married.

198
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,772
It was me who stopped them
from registering their marriage.

199
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,652
She's a precious daughter to her parents.

200
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,863
If something happens to my son,

201
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,327
what about her?

202
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,833
Doctor.

203
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,504
What do I need to do
while we wait for a year?

204
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,176
I will exercise diligently
and stay healthy.

205
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,973
If I need to take medicine,
I'll make sure I take it.

206
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,935
I will come back after a year,

207
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,896
meet you again in this very office,

208
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,649
and get the approval for the surgery.

209
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,361
Doctor, please.

210
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,615
Please save my husband.

211
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,367
Please?

212
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,970
Here's a quiz for you.

213
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,765
I think

214
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,102
they met for the first time
while traveling.

215
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,356
Or...

216
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,483
was it a blind date?

217
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,410
I want the husband to get the liver
from a brain-dead patient.

218
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,247
What are the criteria for him to receive
a donation from a brain-dead patient?

219
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,210
You don't know?

220
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,755
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,548
Goodness, this is an elementary quiz.

222
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,717
-Study about that until tomorrow.
-Okay.

223
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,218
Next patient.

224
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,900
By the way, how did she get hurt?

225
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,861
She was on a scooter
and tripped over a speed bump.

226
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,073
And the handle hit her stomach
pretty hard.

227
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,324
My gosh.

228
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,370
I bet her parents are heartbroken.
How sad must they be?

229
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,833
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,923
Dr. Jang, your parents
must be very heartbroken too

231
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,050
if they knew
you don't even have time to eat at work.

232
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,928
Dr. Jang, I'll buy you
something delicious later.

233
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,763
No.

234
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,557
Professor Ahn,
treat her to a delicious meal.

235
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,727
I've been seeing
her around the most lately.

236
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,021
No, it's okay.

237
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,564
Mixter, please.

238
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,027
Suture, please.

239
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,867
If the surgery goes well
and the patient recovers,

240
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,285
I'll take you out for a nice meal.

241
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,163
Thank you.

242
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,166
When you tie, loosen your shoulder.

243
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,585
Don't pull too hard.
The blood vessel here is weak.

244
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,712
Okay.

245
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,089
Metzenbaum scissors, please.

246
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,384
Professor Min is sensitive
during his rounds.

247
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,885
Check the lab results thoroughly,

248
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,471
and make sure the first-year residents
check them, too.

249
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,473
When preparing for conferences,

250
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,143
make sure you don't leave out
any materials.

251
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,271
Familiarize yourself with the presentation
to lead the conference.

252
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,523
Chi-hong, did you find a place?

253
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,067
Not yet.

254
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,112
And you should move as soon as possible.

255
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,323
You'll be busier once you become a chief.

256
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,367
You should at least sleep well
in your own place.

257
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,621
I like the on-call room.
Moving is a bigger hassle.

258
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,459
Seok-min, you've been out here a lot
instead of studying for the board.

259
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,502
-Hello.
-Hi.

260
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,881
I'm not done handing over my tasks to him.

261
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,135
Besides, Dr. Do didn't even start
studying for the board.

262
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,016
What is it, Professor Chae?
Do you not like seeing me here?

263
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,018
Should I not come back?

264
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,895
I doubt you'll stop coming
even if I ask you.

265
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,484
-Chi-hong, Yun-bok.
-Yes?

266
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,069
Let's go. I'll take you out to dinner.

267
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,780
-What about me?
-And me?

268
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,573
You two should eat together.

269
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,283
Please, no.

270
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,870
I heard the faculty cafeteria is serving
short rib soup for the first time,

271
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,706
and it's packed.
There's only one table left.

272
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,585
Just think. Should I not take Chi-hong,
the future chief?

273
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,379
Or should I leave Yun-bok,
the future NS resident, behind?

274
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,592
Seon-bin and I should butt out.

275
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,969
Exactly. We'll get going.

276
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,972
-Let's go.
-Okay.

277
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,225
Bye.

278
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,644
-Bye.
-Bye.

279
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,812
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,484
How many moves can she see ahead?

281
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,028
Did she even have time
to think about all of that?

282
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,825
I told her.

283
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,744
Told her what?

284
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,375
That I like you.

285
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,215
And that I wanted to tell you how I feel,

286
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,219
but I didn't have the courage.

287
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,100
She took them with her for me.

288
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,024
Well,

289
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,569
this is

290
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,947
awkward,

291
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,203
so let's have dinner separately.

292
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,313
As expected, one of her blood vessels
in her liver was partially torn,

293
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,106
so that's why there was bleeding.

294
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,358
And the surrounding tissues
were severely damaged,

295
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,027
so it was hard to stop the bleeding.

296
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,446
I had to cut out a piece of liver
during surgery.

297
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,199
I've checked after the surgery,

298
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,243
and there were no more sources
of bleeding in her stomach

299
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,079
But there may be bleeding
from another organ.

300
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,707
So we must keep an eye on her
for a day or two in the ICU.

301
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,210
You cut out a piece of her liver.
Can it grow again?

302
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,962
It's not life-threatening, right?

303
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,797
She's out of the woods for now.

304
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,843
I had to cut out a piece of her liver,
but it will grow back over a few months.

305
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,473
I did everything I could.

306
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,435
Now, we must wait and see how fast
she can recover from this.

307
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,650
You can see her once she goes to the ICU.

308
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
Thank you, Doctor.

309
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,903
Thank you.

310
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,405
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

311
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,057
We won't wake her up.
We'll induce sleep for a day or two,

312
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,351
and she'll have the ventilator
to help her breathe.

313
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,395
We can wake her up now,

314
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,146
but if we do, she'll be in more pain.

315
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,358
And if she moves around,
it won't be good for her.

316
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,237
So it's not that she didn't wake up
from the surgery,

317
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,531
but you put her to sleep
on purpose, right?

318
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,909
That's right, Mother.
He explained that to us earlier.

319
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,745
Right. She might move around
because her stomach hurts.

320
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,581
Instead of putting her through the pain
because she can't breathe well,

321
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,751
it's better to let her sleep for a day
to help her stabilize.

322
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,420
Mom!

323
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,339
My goodness, why are you here?

324
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,341
Doctor, this is Ji-hyeon's aunt.

325
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,384
Hello.

326
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,635
And this is her uncle.

327
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,803
Hello.

328
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,558
Doctor, I heard
Ji-hyeon is still unconscious.

329
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,602
If she's still unconscious,
isn't that a serious problem?

330
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,814
Well, I can wake her up now.

331
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,150
But if I do that,
she'll be in bigger pain--

332
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,360
Doctor, I'll explain it to her.

333
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,115
All right. Bye.

334
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,283
Thank you.

335
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,534
Doctor.

336
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,621
Nothing will happen to Ji-hyeon
throughout the night, right?

337
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,542
Please take good care of her.

338
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,754
I will. Nurses will be here.

339
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,882
And I'll be at the hospital tonight.
So don't worry.

340
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,343
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

341
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,097
NOVEMBER 30, 2019

342
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,390
ELAPSED TIME

343
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,547
You're still here?

344
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,798
I'm about to go home now.

345
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,133
Are you staying here all night?

346
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,886
Yes. I operated on a patient
with liver laceration this afternoon.

347
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,014
Sedation seems weak,

348
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,642
so I might have to adjust
the ventilator over the night.

349
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,270
Jeong-won, I'm sure
your patient will be okay.

350
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,148
She'd better.

351
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,486
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

352
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,156
I only burdened you when you're sick.

353
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,907
I only thought about myself.

354
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,994
I mean, the Daddy-Long-Legs Program.

355
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,246
Don't mind me.

356
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,415
You should just focus
on getting better in Sokcho.

357
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,666
I'll take care of it.

358
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,418
Hey! No!

359
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,295
Don't do that. I want to run it.

360
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,715
I can take care of that in Sokcho.

361
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,259
The thought of being on that project

362
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,052
made me all excited.

363
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,637
I'll be doing it. Okay?

364
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,556
Don't take it away from me.

365
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,143
Fine.

366
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,313
Drive safely if you're driving.
Take a cab if you can.

367
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,230
Bye.

368
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,625
Aren't you going home?

369
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,628
No. U-ju went to Changwon.
So I'm on a break.

370
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,879
I'm going to enjoy this time.

371
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,505
Hey, do we have band practice this week?

372
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,842
No. Jeong-won will be at the hospital
this weekend.

373
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,512
Isn't your symposium next week?

374
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,472
Yes.

375
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,308
We'll have to stop for a while.

376
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,143
Okay. Goodnight.

377
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,900
I think Dr. Chu

378
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,985
likes you.

379
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,532
Can't you feel it?

380
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,159
You're so slow-witted.

381
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,082
Dr. Chu confessed her feelings?

382
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,209
Good for you.

383
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,587
I told her very respectfully
that I'm not interested.

384
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,092
Well, it's been a while
since she told me about her feelings.

385
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,678
Min-ha told me that she was okay

386
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,846
and she just wanted me to know
how she felt.

387
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,973
But how can I just ignore that?

388
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,558
We're working together at the hospital.

389
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,686
I hate feeling awkward or uncomfortable
while working,

390
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,689
so I met her outside the hospital
and talked to her.

391
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,651
I told her to meet a good guy
instead of liking me.

392
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,947
I told her that
I don't have time or energy

393
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,907
to date anyone right now.

394
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,036
I'm divorced.

395
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,621
And my life is complicated right now.

396
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,834
So instead of dating me,
I told her to date someone better.

397
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,757
So we're working together professionally
just like before.

398
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,970
It's true.

399
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,222
We're

400
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,058
kind of hip, you know.

401
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,478
-We're cool.
-Here's another interpretation.

402
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,648
If you weren't divorced
and weren't in a complicated situation,

403
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,859
you would have dated Dr. Chu.

404
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,740
No. I mean it.

405
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,245
I'm really not interested
in dating anyone right now.

406
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,373
And I'll probably stay this way.

407
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,085
And obviously,
I'm not interested in Dr. Chu, either.

408
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,007
I like being alone.

409
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,092
My life is perfect now.

410
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,094
I have U-ju.

411
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,766
You know? Jeong-won
has his siblings and God.

412
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,850
Jun-wan has a girlfriend.

413
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,811
And Song-hwa has
her brothers even if they fight a lot.

414
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,937
But who do you have?

415
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,902
I know that you have us.

416
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,738
But if you have your family
or loved ones with you,

417
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,366
their mere existence can comfort you.

418
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,911
Don't rob yourself of those chances.

419
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,829
I don't want her to get hurt.

420
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,250
She might get hurt

421
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,462
because of me and my situation.

422
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,133
After seeing how hard it was for Sin-hye,

423
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,136
I promised myself not to forge
any relationships in the future.

424
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,104
Don't look at me like that. What is it?

425
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,398
Do I look pathetic?

426
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,651
No. I'm just craving alcohol.

427
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,319
Darn it.

428
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,532
Do you want to get some drinks?
It's Saturday tomorrow.

429
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,451
What? Wait, I won't get called in, right?

430
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,246
No, you won't. No one will call you.
It's past 2 a.m. now.

431
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,789
-It's past 2 a.m.
-My gosh.

432
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,834
You have an on-call doctor.

433
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,918
Let's go.

434
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,003
You're still up?

435
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,756
It's past 2 a.m.

436
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,882
You should get some sleep.

437
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,801
I didn't go to work today.

438
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,469
I slept a lot in the afternoon.

439
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,055
But did you just finish your surgery?

440
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,058
Yes. I'm just about to leave the hospital.

441
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,646
I'm hungry and sleepy.

442
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,815
And I miss you, too.

443
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,192
Don't drive.

444
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,070
You can't even open your eyes
because you're exhausted.

445
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,864
I was actually going to take a cab.

446
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,242
I was just about to call a cab.

447
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,747
Ik-sun.

448
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,791
I'm seeing things.

449
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,376
What are you talking about?

450
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,669
I see you.

451
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,713
What? Don't say that.

452
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,381
I'm serious.

453
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,092
A woman in front of me
is talking on her phone.

454
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,094
She looks just like you.

455
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,555
That woman is talking on the phone, too?

456
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes. And she's crossing the street.

457
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,311
What?

458
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,730
What?

459
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,815
She's coming here.

460
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,369
Hello. I'm your hallucination.

461
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,547
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

462
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,385
Are you okay? Are you feeling well?

463
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,973
Ji-hyeon, hang in there a bit longer.

464
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,310
Once you get all better,
why don't we all go

465
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,980
to an amusement park?

466
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,898
We took her off the ventilator.

467
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,817
Luckily, there were no lung complications.

468
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,153
We can keep an eye on her
without getting her intubated.

469
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,573
And her blood result seems good.

470
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,449
We just need to be a bit more patient.

471
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,538
Ji-hyeon, let's start drinking
water today. Okay?

472
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,832
-Okay.
-Good.

473
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,086
The nurse will help her drink water
little by little.

474
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,463
So don't worry too much.

475
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,342
Then, let's keep her in the ICU
for one more night and check her progress.

476
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,177
Thank you, Doctor.

477
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,387
Thank you.

478
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,189
Ji-hyeon, are you in any pain?

479
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,608
No.

480
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,276
Good girl.

481
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,988
Ji-hyeon, what do you want to eat
the most when you get discharged?

482
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,575
-Chocolate.
-You want to eat chocolate?

483
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:54,162
When you get discharged,
I'll buy you lots of chocolates.

484
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,623
Promise.

485
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:01,127
Three years ago, I removed
the tumor completely during surgery.

486
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,130
But unfortunately, the tumor relapsed.

487
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,260
But he's not in pain like before.

488
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,263
And all of his follow-up checkups said
he was fine.

489
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,643
Astrocytomas are a type of tumor
that's likely to come back after surgery.

490
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,020
It's very unfortunate.

491
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,439
Well, you will need

492
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,442
additional surgery, radiation therapy,
and chemotherapy.

493
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,653
If you want to get the surgery,

494
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,489
I can find out when you can get admitted.

495
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,035
Or you can have some time for yourself
before making a decision.

496
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,455
I'll think about it.

497
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,040
What's there to think about?

498
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,210
When can he get the surgery?

499
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,169
Please

500
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,421
let me think about it first.

501
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,677
Doctor, can I make another appointment
and come back?

502
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,178
Sure.

503
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,763
Okay.

504
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,557
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

505
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,858
He had a hard time
when he was undergoing radiation therapy.

506
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,445
He always came with his son and daughter

507
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,698
and they stayed by his side
and held his hand.

508
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,282
At his last appointment,

509
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,159
he was happy to hear that
he could come only once a year.

510
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,371
He knows how difficult it will be
because he's done it before.

511
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,540
He must go through the same process again.

512
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,417
I can understand
how devastated he must feel.

513
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,087
But I think he can overcome this.

514
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,885
Excuse me.

515
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,431
From what I know,

516
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,559
the patient is diagnosed with astrocytoma.

517
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,145
Then, three years ago
when he got the surgery,

518
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,897
what was his exact pathology?

519
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,360
Well, it was WHO grade-two

520
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,487
diffuse astrocytoma.

521
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,408
This tumor is known to relapse
and develop into a higher grade.

522
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,243
I see. Thank you.

523
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,208
"Estoy loco por el."

524
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,419
SPANISH BASICS, EASY SIGN LANGUAGE,
FLYING A DRONE

525
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,839
"Estoy loco por el."

00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,299
When are you leaving?

527
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,092
Me? Three days from today.

528
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,388
What are those books?

529
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,807
I'm going to read them on the plane.
I have 14 hours to kill.

530
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,395
You're not going to the airport tomorrow?
Ik-sun is leaving.

531
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,023
Did I tell you that she was leaving?

532
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,401
She flies in the afternoon,
but I have an operation in the morning.

533
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,403
I'll go if I have time.
If not, I can't go.

534
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,865
My parents will be there.
She doesn't need her brother there.

535
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,825
-Hey.
-What?

536
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,078
Do you want to get drinks tonight?

537
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,954
I have something to tell you.

538
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,582
I'm busy today.

539
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,210
I have surgery later.
It will take a while.

540
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,504
Let's meet after your surgery
even if it's late.

541
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,633
What is it?

542
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,218
It's a 35-year-old male.

543
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,261
He underwent surgery two times
to put a stent in due to CoA.

544
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,930
The last one was three months ago.

545
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,015
He went to Jeongmyeong Hospital
due to a high fever.

546
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,267
Based on the test,
it seems like his stent was infected.

547
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,062
They asked if they could send him
to our hospital for his surgery.

548
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,772
How are his vitals?

549
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,316
His BP is 90 over 60.
His heart rate is 120.

550
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,193
And he's already intubated.

551
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,237
Tell them to send him.

552
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,741
He has a hemothorax.

553
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,868
I think his aorta is ruptured, too.

554
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,287
This is bad. I must operate on him now.

555
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,456
Get a circulation chamber and an OR.

556
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,083
-Okay.
-What about his family?

557
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,126
They are on their way.

558
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,758
Who's the patient?

559
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,678
He had surgery two times
to put a stent in, and it got infected.

560
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,221
I'll remove the infected stent

561
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,931
and do a replacement.

562
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,432
I'm not sure if it will work.

563
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,853
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

564
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,147
Does it feel as if something
is coming out of your nose?

565
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,023
-No.
-I'm glad to hear that.

566
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,733
Is his BP good?

567
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,694
Yes. And his urine volume
is back to normal.

568
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,488
At the earliest,
you can get discharged tomorrow.

569
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,240
Or two days from today at the latest.

570
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,741
Thank you.

571
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,536
I'll go to the Sokcho branch
for my appointment now.

572
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,454
I heard you're transferring there.

573
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,206
How did you know?

574
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,541
It's top-secret.

575
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,502
My gosh. All the patients here know.
Everyone heard about it.

576
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,255
Excuse me, Doctor.

577
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,466
I have surgery tomorrow.

578
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,427
I heard I have a test this afternoon,

579
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,262
but I didn't get an explanation about it.

580
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,973
I see. Who's handling his case?

581
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,475
He's Professor Min's patient,
and Dr. Heo is his doctor.

582
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,978
I'll relay the message to your doctor.

583
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,774
I heard that you had a tough morning
because of the cerebral angiography.

584
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,111
You'll have a Navigation MRI
later at 8 p.m.

585
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,489
Through this MRI process,
we will see the location

586
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,533
and size of the tumor before surgery.

587
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,286
The resident in charge of your case
will come later

588
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,955
and explain to you in detail
while getting your consent.

589
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,540
I see. Thank you.

590
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,961
Dr. Heo is assisting
Professor Min's surgery now.

591
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,838
She was probably going to
explain it to him afterward.

592
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,715
I got it. I won't think she's slacking.

593
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,550
-Bye.
-Bye.

594
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,147
Suction. I can't see anything.

595
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,399
His BP is 50.

596
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,235
He's bleeding a lot here.
Hang up more blood.

597
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,741
ELAPSED TIME

598
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,743
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

599
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:30,873
FASTING

600
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,084
-Hello.
-Hi, Professor Lee.

601
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,044
What brings you here? You must be busy.

602
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,213
-Hello.
-Please don't get up.

603
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,466
You have an embolization tomorrow, right?

604
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,052
Hello. What time is the procedure?

605
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,429
-It's at 2 p.m.
-Then, you must fast for a long time.

606
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,432
Let me know if it's too hard on you.
I'll see if we can move it up.

607
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,268
No, Professor Lee.

608
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,688
It's okay. I don't have much
of an appetite these days.

609
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,317
I have surgery tomorrow morning,
but it won't take long.

610
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,945
So if I have time after the surgery,
I'll stop by.

611
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,655
Let me explain the procedure.

612
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,116
When you can't get surgery
due to liver failure,

613
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,743
you get this procedure as a treatment
instead of surgery.

614
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,038
We can't expect your condition
to be cured with this,

615
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,540
but until you get a donor,

616
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,459
let's get you the procedure
and be more patient.

617
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,586
Don't worry and get a good night's sleep.

618
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,422
Thank you.

619
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,395
Gosh, I'm sure we'll drink up
all the Coke in Korea.

620
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,022
Gosh.

621
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,818
Leave them. I'll help you sort them out.
You have a bad neck.

622
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,155
There's not much to sort out.
I'll just take a few books I need.

623
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,782
Come.

624
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,702
My gosh, I can't believe
we're eating dinner at this hour.

625
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,912
Goodness.

626
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,000
Is Jun-wan working all night?

627
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,962
Probably. He'll end late at night.

628
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,803
ELAPSED TIME

629
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,273
I'm not sure if this will work.
It's severely infected.

630
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,649
Forceps.

631
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,615
What about Jeong-won?

632
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,702
He's in the PICU.
He lives there, you know.

633
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,330
But you put away risotto for him, right?

634
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,457
-Yes.
-Okay.

635
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,167
I did.

636
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,063
Her hemoglobin count didn't go down.

637
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,399
And she's not bleeding right now.
She's fine.

638
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,151
We can move her
to a general ward tomorrow.

639
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,362
-What a relief.
-Gosh.

640
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,782
-That's great news.
-Once we move her down,

641
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,660
she'll take a CT scan on the seventh day
after the surgery.

642
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,537
And we'll observe
for one or two more days.

643
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,581
And if everything checks out,
Ji-hyeon can go home.

644
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,293
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

645
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,753
-Thank you.
-That's great.

646
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,921
Bye.

647
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,465
Doctor.

648
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,009
When do you sleep?

649
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,849
I've been here for four days.

650
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,561
You're here every morning and every night.

651
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,897
Thank you, Doctor.

652
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,149
Thanks to you,

653
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,985
Ji-hyeon lived.

654
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,990
No, I'm grateful that Ji-hyeon recovered.

655
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,366
Bye.

656
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,329
He's a great doctor.

657
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,582
-That's great.
-Yes.

658
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,016
I bet your patient got better.

659
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,518
Yes.

660
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,609
How can you guys tell so easily?

661
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,152
What?

662
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,739
How do you guys know
whether my patient is doing well or not?

663
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,491
How could we not know that?

664
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,201
How do you guys know that?

665
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,414
I took a guess. We just take guesses.

666
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,042
You guys are amazing.

667
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,587
When did you order this risotto?

668
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,631
Did you just order this? At this hour?

669
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,341
It's nice and warm.

670
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,219
I thought you probably skipped dinner.
So I put one aside for you.

671
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,470
I microwaved it at the store.

672
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,142
When are you moving to Sokcho?
Are you going to take everything?

673
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,852
Thursday. No, not everything.

674
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,813
I'm just going to take some books
and a few things I might need.

675
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,942
Does the apartment overlook an ocean?

676
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,238
Can I visit you often?
My gosh, that's my dream.

677
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,114
Sure. You'll probably like it.

678
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,953
Ik-jun is leaving on Thursday, too.

679
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,663
Isn't he leaving for his symposium?

680
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,956
Yes.

681
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,293
By the way,

682
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,420
Jeong-won.

683
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,423
Yes? What is it?

684
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,344
Nothing.

685
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,729
ELAPSED TIME

686
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,441
I've been pressing for an hour,
but it keeps bleeding.

687
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,403
Surgery won't cut it anymore.

688
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,906
I have no choice.
Let's pack it up with gauze and stop.

689
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,074
Gauze, please.

690
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,356
I removed the infected stent

691
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,317
and switched it with an artificial artery.

692
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,653
But the bleeding is too severe,
so we blocked it with gauze.

693
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,824
We tried our best to stop
the bleeding in the OR,

694
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,910
but the blood wouldn't coagulate,
so he lost a lot of blood.

695
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,789
We're inducing antihemorrhagic agents
in the ICU now,

696
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,375
but we may not be able to stop
the bleeding.

697
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,087
Let's observe for the time being.

698
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,675
Monitor him while giving him RBC and FFP.

699
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,594
And call me right away
if he keeps bleeding.

700
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,511
Okay.

701
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,145
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

702
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,361
Thank you.

703
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,032
Ms. Choi Ji-eun.

704
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,117
-Ms. Choi Ji-eun.
-Yes.

705
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,661
-Come on in.
-Okay.

706
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,124
I waited so long for my appointment.

707
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,502
It's been more than an hour.

708
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,546
I'm sorry. There were a lot of
expecting mothers today.

709
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,299
I have to wait so long
every time I come here.

710
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,510
I'll see you next week.

711
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,595
Hello.

712
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,684
-It's been a month.
-Yes. Hello.

713
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,979
Doctor, I have never seen
this many patients in my life.

714
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,692
I had to wait really long
for my appointment. I always have to wait.

715
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,362
I'm sorry. I see outpatients
only three days a week.

716
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,699
I took a look at the test you took
for gestational diabetes.

717
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,619
By the way, we have
about the same number of patients.

718
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,372
But compared to last week,
we have fewer outpatients today.

719
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,706
Dr. Chu.

720
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,002
Can you get me the ultrasound scan
she took last time?

721
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,379
Sure.

722
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,511
What is it? What happened?

723
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,556
We were preparing for a DDLT, but
the recipient arrested during hepatectomy.

724
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,142
So cardiothoracic surgeons
are putting the patient on ECMO.

725
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,519
Professor Kwon Sun-jeong said
the transplant is impossible

726
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,271
so he wanted me to call the KONOS.

727
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,523
You must find a recipient quickly.

728
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,442
Did the organ arrive at our hospital?

729
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,901
Yes.

730
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,779
This is Ham Deok-ju,
the transplant coordinator at Yulje.

731
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,406
The recipient had a heart attack.

732
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,491
So the professor said
the transplant can't happen.

733
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,785
You must select another recipient.

734
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,204
Okay.

735
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,832
Okay. Call me right away.

736
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,087
They will call the first patient
on the list and call us back.

737
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,217
But I'm not sure if this will work.
We lost a lot of time already.

738
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,303
How long has it been
since you extracted it?

739
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,138
It's been over eight hours.

740
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,731
Jae-hak, his parents are outside, right?

741
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,774
Yes.

742
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,319
I must update them.

743
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,581
We've been giving him
antihemorrhagic agents in the ICU,

744
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,750
hoping that it would coagulate his blood.

745
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,711
After observing for five hours,

746
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,215
he's still bleeding.

747
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,055
Even if we go back to the OR now,

748
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,642
there's not much we can do
except for changing the gauze we packed.

749
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,436
I don't see any other way.

750
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,691
I am sorry.

751
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:15,999
Doctor.

752
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,296
Can I go see my son just once?

753
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,676
I want to see him

754
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,928
one last time.

755
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,014
Please let me do that.

756
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,775
It's a 48-year-old female patient
with SAH.

757
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,443
She's in a coma,
and her pupils are dilated.

758
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,362
She can't breathe on her own.
No motor function.

759
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,090
She's in a coma.
There's no point operating on her.

760
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,759
Induce her with dopamine
if her BP goes down.

761
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,137
Okay.

762
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,557
Okay.

763
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,561
The first patient on their list
is far away from Seoul,

764
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,438
so it's impossible
due to the time restriction.

765
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,190
And the doctor
of the next patient in line gave up.

766
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,443
The ischemia time was prolonged.

767
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,945
It will take too long
to find another recipient.

768
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,823
They want us to find a patient
in our hospital and call them back.

769
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,366
Then, they'll approve it.

770
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,704
Hello, this is the transplant coordinator
from Yulje Medical Center.

771
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:36,872
Is this Ms. Um Ji-seon?

772
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,957
YANG SEOK-HYEONG

773
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,542
Ms. Jang Seul-gi.

774
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,670
-Is Ms. Jang Seul-gi here?
-Right here.

775
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,632
You're next.
Please wait in front of the office.

776
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,509
But why is the previous patient
taking too long?

777
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,596
-A lot of people are waiting.
-I'm sorry.

778
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,558
Appointments may run long
when there's a lot to explain.

779
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,060
Please wait a little longer.

780
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,980
It's been hours since I took
my ultrasound. Why am I still waiting?

781
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,899
Aren't you Ms. Han Seung-hui?

782
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:08,320
There are five more patients before you.
Please wait a little longer.

783
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,780
How much longer must I wait?

784
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,740
What's the point of making appointments?

785
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,700
I'm sorry.

786
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:19,373
At our hospital, two patients
can be booked for every ten minutes.

787
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,334
And that's the only way we can accept
appointments due to the system.

788
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,296
As you know,
Professor Yang has a lot of patients.

789
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,257
I am sorry for making you wait every time.

790
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,301
I hope you can understand.

791
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,178
Okay.

792
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,056
No fever, right?

793
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,351
Let me know once you get the X-ray scan.

794
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,104
What's the blood type of the donor?

795
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,313
He's a type-A.

796
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,192
Kim Yeong-je, the second patient
on the list, is in Geochang.

797
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,862
Even if we get ready while he gets here,
the liver won't be viable.

798
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,114
What about Moon Jeong-hwa?

799
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,782
She said she'd wait a bit longer.

800
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,868
She's been feeling well,
so she doesn't want it for now.

801
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,871
Yoo Dong-jin doesn't have
the same blood type.

802
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,207
Well...

803
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,044
Type-A.

804
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,547
We have one more type-A patient
at the hospital.

805
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,298
Lee Chang-hak?

806
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,051
Yes. His blood type is A.

807
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,859
My son.

808
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,120
He used to be so tiny like this.

809
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,916
When did you grow up so much, son?

810
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,047
Jung-min.

811
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,427
This is yours.

812
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,723
Your dad and I

813
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,269
love you so much,

814
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,397
so we kept this all this time.

815
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,485
But now, you should keep it.

816
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,447
My son.

817
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,742
I am not

818
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,537
ready yet.

819
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,165
So

820
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,878
don't leave us here.

821
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,797
Jung-min.

822
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,633
Jung-min.

823
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,178
Your dad and I

824
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:43,225
love you so much, our dear son.

825
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,857
Don't leave us. Promise me.

826
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,151
Have you been well?

827
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,362
-It's been two weeks.
-Yes, doctor.

828
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,446
Is the baby active?

829
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,575
It's been about two days
since the baby has been quiet.

830
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,037
Perhaps, I didn't feel any movements
because I was sleeping.

831
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,413
My baby is okay, right?

832
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,999
I read online that that happens
in the last month of pregnancy.

833
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,627
Shall we check if your baby is doing okay?

834
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,035
Well, Professor Kim.

835
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,456
Why don't we try again from the front?

836
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,594
We can use an artificial artery to bypass
the ascending and descending aorta.

837
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,430
And if we ligate the operated area
from top to bottom,

838
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,472
wouldn't it be isolated?

839
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,057
How are his vitals?

840
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,186
His BP is stable with 0.05mg of epidural
and 0.1mg of norepinephrine.

841
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:12,939
Can he urinate?

842
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,691
He can urinate with 5mg of Lasix.

843
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,192
Every hour, it goes over 100.

844
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,363
Let's try it. Ask them to open the OR.

845
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,489
Okay.

846
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,957
Well,

847
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,960
I checked multiple times.

848
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:38,131
But I didn't detect any heart movement.

849
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,475
Are you saying

850
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,856
my baby is dead?

851
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,276
Yes.

852
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,447
It looks like the heart stopped beating
in your womb.

853
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,952
I don't know what caused it for now.

854
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,747
I will be able to find the cause
after we take the baby out.

855
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,471
Doctor.

856
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,724
No...

857
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,727
Doctor! No.

858
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,145
Doctor...

859
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,982
My baby...

860
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,091
We'll now administer the anesthesia.

861
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,344
Relax and breathe.

862
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,431
Don't be nervous.

863
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,308
Yes, good.

864
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,827
As for the ischemia time, what are we at?

865
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,080
About ten hours. The biopsy results
look good. The liver should be fine.

866
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,086
Let's do this quickly. Scalpel, please.

867
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:55,018
WE ARE SORRY FOR THE DELAY

868
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,690
I'm sorry, Doctor.

869
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,859
Here.

870
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,821
It's okay. Don't worry about us.

871
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,075
Take your time to calm down.
You can stay here for a bit.

872
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,785
We're okay.

873
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,454
I'm sorry, Doctor...

874
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,964
-Shall I tell the patients outside...
-Doctor...

875
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,343
...that our system is down or something?

876
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,722
No, there's no need. It's okay.

877
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,818
She's taking forever.

878
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,736
Excuse me.

879
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,905
Don't say anything.

880
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,343
NAME: BAEK SEON-JEONG
AGE: 48

881
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,681
Unfortunately,
the situation is pretty bad.

882
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,309
She has a brain hemorrhage
accompanied by severe swelling.

883
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,897
It's got to the point
that the contrast agent doesn't even work.

884
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:29,654
At the moment, she's unconscious
and can't breathe on her own.

885
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,406
So we believe she's brain-dead.

886
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:36,786
It's highly likely that she'll pass away
within a week or two.

887
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,124
No way...

888
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,254
Mom...

889
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,883
Mom!

890
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,428
-Honey...
-Mom!

891
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,013
-Mom!
-Honey.

892
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,601
Chi-hong.

893
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,688
I was so surprised when I saw her name.

894
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,440
Why?

895
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,860
She has the exact same name
as the patient who passed away

896
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,445
when I was a fourth-year resident.

897
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,824
You remember all your patients' names?

898
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,075
Well...

899
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,162
From the day she was brought in to the ER

900
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,873
to the moment she passed away
in the ICU after her surgery,

901
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,750
I stayed by her side.

902
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,588
I thought she'd make it.

903
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,091
That's why I did nothing else and
just stayed by her side for over a week

904
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,968
while getting an earful from my professor,

905
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,263
but she passed away.

906
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,308
She also had SAH.

907
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,394
I beat myself up so much
after she passed away.

908
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,856
Maybe it's my fault that she passed away.

909
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,442
"Had I been smarter,

910
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,612
she probably could've lived."
I kept thinking that.

911
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,283
She was so beautiful.

912
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,496
I still remember what she looked like
as well as her name.

913
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,748
I remember everything vividly.

914
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,753
Her name was also Baek Seon-jeong.

915
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,803
It was you.

916
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,727
I had no idea.

917
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,729
Professor Chae...

918
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,400
Yun-bok.

919
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,152
What's wrong?

920
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,826
What's the matter?

921
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,663
What is it?

922
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,423
I miss my mom.

923
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,685
Professor Chae.

924
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,774
I miss my mom so much.

925
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,905
My gosh.

926
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,911
You grew up
into such a wonderful young lady.

927
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,875
Your mom

928
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,045
must be so proud of you,
watching over you from heaven.

929
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,842
Why are you crying?
She'll be heartbroken if she sees this.

930
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,055
Don't cry.

931
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,598
Okay.

932
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,189
My gosh.

933
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,409
It's okay.

934
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,255
Mr. Kim Hyeon-su?

935
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,217
Doctor!

936
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,886
I was waiting for you.

937
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,055
-Me?
-Yes.

938
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,517
I asked the front desk for your number,
but they said they can't give it out.

939
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,561
So I thought I should just wait here
until you showed up.

940
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,480
This year must be my lucky year.

941
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:35,983
Well, it seems so.

942
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,822
By the way, you look great.

943
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,951
You don't look like someone who underwent
brain surgery three months ago.

944
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,703
Thank you.

945
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,498
Well, Doctor Ahn.

946
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,880
This is for you.

947
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,592
I know that doctors can't accept gifts,

948
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,010
but still...

949
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,973
Please accept it.

950
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,892
My gosh...

951
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,688
Gosh, this is...

952
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,904
It's not expensive.
It costs under 20,000 won.

953
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,867
My gosh.

954
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,828
Next week,

955
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,457
I'll be returning to the police.

956
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,377
My gosh, congratulations.

957
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,966
It's a desk job, and I'll be working
short shifts for the time being.

958
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,134
But still...

959
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,054
I thought I'd never return to the force.

960
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,392
But thanks to you, I can go back to work.

961
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,317
I hope this pen can be

962
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,446
one of the many pens you always keep
in your pocket.

963
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,492
And I hope this pen can cheer you up

964
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,411
when things get stressful.

965
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,581
There are people who gained new life
thanks to you,

966
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,251
so don't be discouraged and cheer up.

967
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,761
You must be busy. I'll get going, then.

968
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,387
I'll see you at my next appointment.

969
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,771
All right.
See you at your next appointment.

970
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,056
Doctor, how did the surgery go?
Did it go well?

971
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,645
Yes, the surgery went well.

972
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,399
He didn't even bleed much
during the surgery.

973
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,026
We'll have to do a blood test
when he wakes up to be sure,

974
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,821
but the surgery itself
went as well as it could,

975
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,739
so I don't think you should be worried.

976
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,535
We've overcome a huge hurdle.

977
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,037
Thank you so much, Doctor.

978
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,416
I really think this is a miracle.

979
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,795
I'll be grateful to the donor
for the rest of my life.

980
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,463
Thank you very much.

981
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:49,260
Your dad's surgery went very well.

982
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,514
So my dad isn't ill anymore?

983
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:58,144
He still is. Just a little bit though.

984
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,939
But he'll recover soon.

985
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,774
Don't worry.

986
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,527
Thank you. I'm grateful.

987
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,865
I am a lot more

988
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,034
grateful.

989
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,577
Doctor.

990
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,079
I will take the test.

991
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,876
And when you get the test result,

992
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:29,091
please tell them that I wasn't a match.

993
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,182
I'm sorry.

994
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,477
I'm really sorry.

995
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,032
Dong-ju.

996
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,056
GIVE YOUR MOM A BIG HUG!

997
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,616
I'm okay.

998
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,286
Don't cry.

999
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,068
What?

1000
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,071
You have something to tell me, right?

1001
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,240
Is something bothering you?

1002
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,035
No.

1003
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,593
I agree.

1004
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:41,265
I agree with what you're thinking now.

1005
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,038
You can read minds, can't you?

1006
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,541
People call me psychic, you know.

1007
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:15,633
I think there are three types of people
in this world.

1008
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,386
First, those who are happiest
when they're eating something good.

1009
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,974
Ik-jun and Jun-wan
are the perfect examples.

1010
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,995
It's mine. It's my ramyeon.

1011
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,666
This is my first meal of the day.
Go get a new one.

1012
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,127
-Jeez!
-You go get a new one. I'm exhausted.

1013
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,254
Me too!
Do I look like I'm brimming with energy?

1014
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,092
-Cut it out, you crazy prick.
-Come on, dude.

1015
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,260
-Give it back.
-I'm not done.

1016
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,177
Get a new one!

1017
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,388
No! I want to eat this!

1018
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,475
Then there are those who enjoy food
the most when they're eating alone.

1019
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:12,356
I bet Seok-hyeong is eating ramyeon
all by himself now while watching

1020
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:13,607
New Journey to the West.

1021
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:29,957
Who is it?

1022
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,378
Professor Yang, even this resident
working the night shift

1023
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,839
at the medical office
heard that you're eating ramyeon,

1024
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,632
so I came to eat with you.

1025
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,301
I can join you, right?

1026
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,013
Sure.

1027
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,473
Great.

1028
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,895
All right.

1029
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:56,317
Then... All right, be careful.

1030
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:01,864
Perfect.

1031
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,242
And the fish cake bars.

1032
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,285
Nice. This is perfect.

1033
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:18,547
-Can I dig in?
-Yes, of course. Enjoy.

1034
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,967
Lastly, there's you.

1035
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,139
Seeing others enjoy good food
makes you happier than

1036
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,891
when you are eating it yourself.

1037
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,644
I'm not like that.

1038
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,479
You are like that.

1039
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,576
DECEMBER 3, 2019
10:22 P.M.

1040
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,371
It's already past ten o'clock.

1041
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:55,251
Ik-sun must be on the plane now.
I didn't even have a chance to call her.

1042
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,591
Jeez, what was that about?

1043
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,094
What's with him?

1044
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,472
The number you have called is unavailable.

1045
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,044
I'm really okay,
so don't worry about it if you're busy.

1046
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,381
I just left home.
I'll text you when I'm at the airport.

1047
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,759
I'm at the airport. It's not busy,
so I should be able to check-in quickly.

1048
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:49,555
Both my mom and dad are crying.
I'm crying too.

1049
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,849
The check-in is done. I'm inside now.

1050
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,559
I want to hear your voice.

1051
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,144
I guess you have emergency surgery.

1052
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:57,104
I have so much time
until my boarding time.

1053
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:59,565
Take a breather after the surgery
and call me.

1054
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,191
Boarding will close in five minutes.

1055
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,944
I wanted to hear your voice. I'm sad.

1056
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,447
I'm on the plane now.
I have to turn my phone off.

1057
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,490
I hope everything is okay.

1058
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,492
It's okay if you're in surgery,

1059
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,620
but I'm worried you can't check your phone
because something bad happened.

1060
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,291
Bye, for real.

1061
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,752
I'll call you when I arrive.

1062
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,421
I love you, babe.

1063
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,225
No one's here.

1064
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,144
Leave me alone.

1065
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:42,775
Professor Kim.

1066
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,903
The patient's tube drainage
has been under 100 per hour,

1067
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,030
and the bleeding seems
to have stopped as well.

1068
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,448
The vitals have also stabilized.

1069
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,536
I thought I'd come and tell you
this happy news in person.

1070
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:55,996
I'll be off, then.

1071
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,914
Jae-hak.

1072
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:01,919
Let's go get some fresh air.
My head hurts so much.

1073
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,631
I took the CSAT four times
and the bar exam six times.

1074
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,882
That's ten years in total.

1075
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,343
That's why I know for a fact
that I can study very hard.

1076
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:13,680
I'm a wimp, so I'm not confident when
it comes to exams and the actual work.

1077
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:18,519
But I was always good at studying
and memorizing things all day long.

1078
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,271
That's why I thought
I'd have a successful career as a doctor

1079
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,815
because you need to study a lot.

1080
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,733
I thought I should be able

1081
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,361
to live a decent life
if I became a doctor,

1082
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,947
so I studied very hard and became one.

1083
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:35,494
But then, my gosh. I learned that having
good judgment is more important than

1084
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,829
your ability to study well.

1085
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,915
Every day... No, you have to make a choice
every moment.

1086
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,709
I mean, that's what surgery is all about.

1087
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:45,087
If a patient's condition worsens,
should he or she

1088
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,755
be hooked up to the ECMO
or transferred to the OR?

1089
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,508
I struggle every time
I have to make such decisions.

1090
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,138
Professor Kim, you see...

1091
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:57,099
Indecisiveness is my biggest weakness.

1092
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,853
I have a lot of knowledge,

1093
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,397
but I don't know when and how
it should be used.

1094
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,192
What do I do, Professor Kim?

1095
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,779
My patients could live or die
depending on what I decide to do.

1096
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:14,950
What if I make the wrong decision?

1097
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:21,582
I'll encounter hundreds of thousands
of moments when I must make a decision.

1098
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,836
Gosh, I don't know if I can do it.

1099
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,882
What should I do

1100
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,134
every time that happens?

1101
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,349
Ask me.

1102
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:45,147
When you're feeling overwhelmed
because you must make a lot of decisions,

1103
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,775
you can ask me how to handle
a few important cases.

1104
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:56,158
I'll do my best to help you out
if I'm not too busy.

1105
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,790
Jae-hak.

1106
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,009
I want to give this to my girlfriend,

1107
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,554
but she doesn't like things like this.

1108
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,849
Christmas is just around the corner,

1109
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,353
so I want to send it to her
as a Christmas gift.

1110
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:27,814
Will it be okay to send this to her?

1111
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,693
Am I putting too much pressure on her?

1112
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,116
Ask her.

1113
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,037
Ask your girlfriend.

1114
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,791
You two love each other, right?

1115
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,334
Is it one-sided?

1116
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,045
Then ask her.

1117
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,507
She'll give you the answer.

1118
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,138
I have to say,

1119
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,642
you're clueless when it comes to dating.

1120
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,604
Gosh, you frustrate me so much.

1121
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:17,114
There.

1122
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:19,866
The arm, please.

1123
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,660
Good. This arm.

1124
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:23,829
Look at me.

1125
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,792
U-ju, be a good boy and be good to Auntie.

1126
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,545
Wait for just ten days
even if you miss Daddy, okay?

1127
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,297
Ten days? How many days is that?

1128
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:36,133
Ten days... It's more than nine days

1129
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,259
but less than 11 days.

1130
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:42,264
U-ju, Daddy will be back
when you finish counting

1131
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:44,057
with all ten fingers.

1132
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,435
My gosh, you're such a pro.

1133
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,314
Professor Lee, I hope you don't have to
work all the time when you're there.

1134
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,190
You should catch up on sleep

1135
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,067
and go shopping while you're there.

1136
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,445
Of course. I should be able
to take two to three days off.

1137
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,363
Yes, come here.

1138
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,115
There we go.

1139
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,951
U-ju, tell me the acrostic poem for Daddy.

1140
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,662
You learned it at the daycare yesterday.
Go!

1141
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,039
Daddy.

1142
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,874
-Next?
-Bye-bye.

1143
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:13,253
Don't you think U-ju should join Mensa?

1144
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,588
He's as talented as Shakespeare.

1145
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,257
That's exactly what I was thinking
yesterday.

1146
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:20,427
-U-ju, come up with one for Auntie.
-Sure.

1147
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,762
-Go!
-Auntie.

1148
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:23,513
-Next!
-Bye-bye.

1149
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,436
The daycare bus is probably here now.

1150
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:30,812
Say bye to Daddy.

1151
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,981
Have a good trip, Daddy.

1152
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:33,940
Yes, sir.

1153
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,692
What?

1154
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:41,365
Father, bring me
a ton of cookies and chocolates.

1155
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,874
Yes, sir. I will. No problem.

1156
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,337
Oh, boy. That nearly killed me. All right.

1157
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:56,922
Bye, Daddy!

1158
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,131
It still tickles.

1159
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,969
You have to wear it at all times, okay?

1160
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,972
You too.
You double-checked the address, right?

1161
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,599
What if it gets misdelivered?

1162
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,894
The address is quite complicated,
so the mailmen often make mistakes.

1163
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:13,522
I triple-checked it,
so I'm sure it won't be misdelivered.

1164
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:16,566
You should go to bed.
It's after midnight there.

1165
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,734
All right.

1166
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,196
Bye, babe. I love you.

1167
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:22,739
I love you too.

1168
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,883
Hello.

1169
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,094
Hi, Yun-bok.

1170
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:46,972
What brings you by?

1171
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,934
There's something I forgot to show Dr. Ahn
when I was doing the handover.

1172
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,478
Chi-hong is moving today.

1173
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:55,605
Oh, right.

1174
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,899
I bought him a gift for that
and forgot all about it.

1175
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,615
What are you doing tonight?

1176
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,702
-Me?
-Yes.

1177
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,370
You are not on-call tonight.

1178
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:12,956
I don't really have any plans.

1179
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,499
Then how about dinner together?

1180
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,016
Hey, yes.

1181
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,018
Hong-do.

1182
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,605
What? You're feeling sick?

1183
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,315
You feel like you're dying?

1184
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,609
Yes, okay.

1185
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,791
Message me when you're off work.

1186
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,043
I'll meet you in the lobby.

1187
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,587
Well, sure.

1188
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,328
Hey.

1189
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,289
Seriously,
what brings you all the way here?

1190
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,500
Shouldn't you have left by now?

1191
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,253
Gosh, it's so nice here.

1192
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,632
I came here
because I'd like your advice on something.

1193
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:47,717
I still have about five hours.

1194
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:55,684
Listen up, okay?

1195
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,022
I have a friend

1196
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,116
whom I've known for a long time.

1197
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,080
But I started to like her.

1198
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,394
If I tell her how I feel,
things might get a little awkward.

1199
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,024
But if I chicken out again

1200
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,277
and not tell her,

1201
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,866
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

1202
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,248
What should I do?

1203
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,528
Take your time.
You can answer when I'm back.

1204
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,696
Bye.

1205
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,506
CHIEF

1206
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,685
Congratulations on your new home
and becoming a chief resident.

1207
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:47,605
Dr. Ahn Chi-hong,
you're already doing a great job.

1208
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,149
I'll always be rooting for you.

1209
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,236
First, try not to get too nervous
during surgery.

1210
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,947
What you need now is a heart of steel.

1211
01:23:56,573 --> 01:24:00,285
Second, focus on bleeding control
when performing brain tumor surgery.

1212
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,537
That will decide whether
the surgery will be a success.

1213
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,540
Third, make use of impactful diagrams
and videos

1214
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:08,209
when you're preparing
for your presentation.

1215
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,627
And practice is a must.

1216
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,629
From Song-hwa.

1217
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:20,555
Do you

1218
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:22,974
like me?

1219
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:25,810
I like you. Yes.

1220
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,191
I was going to tell you,

1221
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,318
but I couldn't find the right time.

1222
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,196
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

1223
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:40,200
Don't.

1224
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,788
Hey. Stop talking. What's wrong with you?

1225
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,999
Well, it's not something
I have control over.

1226
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,505
I can't just stop because you told me to.

1227
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,103
I'll get going.

1228
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:11,606
Bye.

1229
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:29,082
PROFESSOR CHAE SONG-HWA

1230
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,466
They are cute.

1231
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,844
I used to be young like them.

1232
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,265
I'm sorry.

1233
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,143
Anyway, we have our precious med students.

1234
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:32,061
Let's listen to why
they applied to med school.

1235
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:34,731
What's wrong with him? Just let them go.

1236
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,816
Right? You don't like that either.

1237
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:41,487
-Pardon?
-I'm sorry.

1238
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:43,531
I won't talk to you.

1239
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:50,038
Both of my parents are doctors,
so I didn't have much choice--

1240
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:52,332
Hey, Seon-bin.
We're not interested in your story.

1241
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:12,060
You have to work tomorrow?

1242
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,687
I feel bad for you.

1243
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,564
Since when did we get Christmas off?

1244
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,984
Hey, tomorrow is Christmas. Don't you
have to spend time with your bidulgi?

1245
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,946
She's away at the moment.
And I also have to go into work briefly.

1246
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,281
-Hey, did you get me a gift?
-No.

1247
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,367
Seok-hyeong, what did you decide to do?

1248
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,576
Have you made your decision?

1249
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,622
What?

1250
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,374
A decision about what?

1251
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:36,209
You too. We'll talk about that later.

1252
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,336
Seok-hyeong, tell us.

1253
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,880
Is something else going on
with his family?

1254
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:45,593
His dad wrote in his will that he'd like
Seok-hyeong to inherit the company.

1255
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:47,637
-What?
-What?

1256
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,014
Hey, then are you going
to quit being a doctor?

1257
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:57,730
Just tell us.
Tell us already, you silly bear.

1258
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,524
Let go, and I'll tell you.

1259
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:12,203
Why would I run the company?

1260
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,582
I already told everyone
that I'm not interested.

1261
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:19,127
We'll find a management specialist
to run the company.

1262
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,628
You made the right choice.

1263
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,463
-Of course.
-Why would you do that?

1264
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,549
Well, I think it'd be nice to have
the opportunity

1265
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,634
to run a company before you get too old.

1266
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:27,844
I think it's a bad idea.

1267
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:30,263
What's so bad about it? When else
will he be called "Mr. Chairman"?

1268
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:31,180
Do it.

1269
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,349
Just come back if it doesn't work out.

1270
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,396
I don't want to waste time.

1271
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,111
My time is too precious for that.

1272
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,370
I want to live doing the things I like

1273
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,582
and the things

1274
01:28:57,915 --> 01:28:59,375
that I want to do right now.

1275
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,631
That's why I wanted to start a band.

1276
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:11,471
I...

1277
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,893
used you guys.

1278
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:22,982
As if.

1279
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,944
-What's he saying?
-That nutjob.

1280
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,447
What is wrong with him today?

1281
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,867
-What are you saying?
-That's absurd.

1282
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,620
-What's with him?
-You silly bear.

1283
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,580
-What's wrong with him?
-My gosh.

1284
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,457
He actually looks like
the statue of Agrippa

1285
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,501
instead of a silly bear.

1286
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:45,129
-Hey, stop it.
-I see a lot of shadows.

1287
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,715
-Hey.
-What's that under his eyes?

1288
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,675
-The gradation...
-Let me see.

1289
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:51,636
-Cut it out.
-Come on. Let's see!

1290
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,064
Hey, why are you drinking that?

1291
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:10,488
Because I'm singing a line today.

1292
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:59,954
Like a sunset

1293
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:06,419
I want to be a beautiful memory to you

1294
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:14,218
I hope you can always remember
Our radiant days

1295
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:21,184
Like a beautiful painting
Without any regrets

1296
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:27,815
To me, you were the sunlight

1297
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:32,904
That warmed my lonely heart

1298
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:40,244
Like the dazzling jewel
On your small, fair hand

1299
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:46,250
Our promise will be eternal

1300
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:52,506
-Like a sunset
-Like a sunset

1301
01:31:53,549 --> 01:31:58,679
-I want to be a beautiful memory to you
-I want to be a beautiful memory to you

1302
01:31:59,388 --> 01:32:02,141
-I hope you can always remember
-I hope you can always remember

1303
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:06,812
-Our radiant days
-Our radiant days

1304
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:10,608
-Like a beautiful painting
-Like a beautiful painting

1305
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:14,737
-Without any regrets
-Without any regrets

1306
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:24,455
DECEMBER 24, 2019
11:20 A.M.

1307
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,432
Oh, hello.

1308
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,601
Ji-hyeon, say hello.

1309
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,937
Say, "Hello, Doctor.
Thank you for saving my life."

1310
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:50,356
Thank you.

1311
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:52,692
Doctor!

1312
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,069
My gosh.

1313
01:32:57,446 --> 01:33:00,157
Ji-hyeon, is your stomach okay now?
It doesn't hurt anymore?

1314
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,784
No, it doesn't hurt at all now.

1315
01:33:01,867 --> 01:33:03,536
Gosh, you're so adorable.

1316
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,081
What brings you by?
You don't have an appointment today.

1317
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:08,958
It's Christmas Eve, you know.

1318
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:12,545
You're the person we wanted
to see the most on Christmas Eve.

1319
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,172
Oh, my.

1320
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:21,262
Merry Christmas.

1321
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:26,767
It's healed nicely.

1322
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:29,145
If you have a fever or experience
other types of discomfort,

1323
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:30,730
come to the ER anytime.

1324
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,566
Then we'll see you
at your next appointment in two weeks.

1325
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,192
-We'll remove the stitches then.
-Okay.

1326
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:36,986
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1327
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:38,195
Thank you.

1328
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:43,409
-Son.
-Yes?

1329
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:46,912
What's the first thing you want to do
when you leave the hospital?

1330
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,248
I'll do anything for you.

1331
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,125
I mean, you nearly died.

1332
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:53,127
I'd happily do anything for my dear son.

1333
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:54,920
I want kimchi stew.

1334
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,591
I want to eat your kimchi stew, Mom.

1335
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:00,843
Gosh, that's it?

1336
01:34:00,926 --> 01:34:03,971
Yes, I just want to go home
and eat a home-cooked meal.

1337
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,223
That's what I want to do the most, Mom.

1338
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:08,851
Me too.

1339
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:15,816
You can be discharged tomorrow.

1340
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,361
Really?

1341
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:21,489
Hello, Doctor.

1342
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:26,952
Well, there's nothing more
we can do for you here.

1343
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,038
Vacate the room, please.

1344
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:30,998
Thank you.

1345
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,459
I owe it all to you, Doctor.

1346
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:34,460
Don't mention it.

1347
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:36,962
-Dong-ju.
-Dong-ju.

1348
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,422
Merry Christmas.

1349
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,800
Oh, one more thing.

1350
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:42,635
Merry Christmas.

1351
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,805
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1352
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,066
Common indications
for liver transplantation?

1353
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:01,570
Chronic liver failure,
acute liver failure,

1354
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,114
hepatocellular carcinoma, and so on.

1355
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,698
Bingo. Have you been studying?

1356
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,826
Yes, I had a feeling
that you'd test me today.

1357
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,162
Well done. Doctors have to study a lot.

1358
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,165
You can't save patients
by being friendly to them.

1359
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,793
-Right.
-I'll quiz you every time I see you.

1360
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,711
Two questions if you get it wrong.

1361
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,267
It's good news.

1362
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:33,060
Why are you crying?

1363
01:35:35,187 --> 01:35:36,730
I feel so bad for my wife.

1364
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,026
She's been so stressed out,

1365
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,990
but there was nothing I could do for her.

1366
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:51,203
Doctor, do you mind saying that
one more time?

1367
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:57,835
You no longer need
to worry about premature birth.

1368
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:03,966
The baby now weighs over 1.5kg,
which means it's growing well.

1369
01:36:04,049 --> 01:36:06,260
Everything seems stable so far,

1370
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:09,638
so it's most likely
that you'll be fine until you're due.

1371
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:12,808
You no longer need to be lying down
all the time.

1372
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,228
Like other expecting moms, you can now
return to non-strenuous daily activities.

1373
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,189
Thank you.

1374
01:36:22,776 --> 01:36:23,861
You held out

1375
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:26,530
really well.

1376
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:07,863
To me, you will always be remembered

1377
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:13,327
As a lush yet sad song in my little heart

1378
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:20,709
I want to be the countless stars

1379
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:27,424
In your beautiful, sparkling eyes
And shine forever

1380
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:32,846
-Like a sunset
-Like a sunset

1381
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:39,144
-I want to be a beautiful memory to you
-I want to be a beautiful memory to you

1382
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:42,022
-I hope you can always remember
-I hope you can always remember

1383
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:46,902
-Our radiant days
-Our radiant days

1384
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:49,321
-Like a beautiful painting
-Like a beautiful painting

1385
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:53,492
-Without any regrets
-Without any regrets

1386
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:58,289
-Like a sunset
-Like a sunset

-I want to be a beautiful memory to you

1390
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:15,222

1392
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,240
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1393
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,742
DECEMBER 25, 2019
06:30 P.M.

1394
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:46,462
Where's the nail clipper?

1395
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:16,533
-What's up?
-A package came for you.

1396
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:19,536
-A package? I'm not expecting anything.
-Well...

1397
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,288
It's actually a returned package.

1398
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,253
Who is it?

1399
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,212
It's me, Gyeo-ul.

1400
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,257
Come in.

1401
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:33,986
What is it?

1402
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,702
Professor Ahn.

1403
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:45,956
I...

1404
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:07,811
Professor Ahn... I...

1405
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:12,524
I like you.

1406
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:20,991
I'm sorry.

1407
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,035
Why am I crying?

1408
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:25,746
Sorry.

1409
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:27,581
I'm sorry.

1410
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,885
I know it's not my place to say this,

1411
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:46,350
but can you please stay at the hospital

1412
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:51,772
instead of becoming a priest?

1413
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:02,324
Please stay by my side

1414
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:07,830
instead of God's.

1415
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:16,213
I'm sorry.

1416
01:42:19,007 --> 01:42:20,342
I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

1417
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:30,579
Gyeo-ul.

1418
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:32,289
Since

1419
01:43:33,665 --> 01:43:35,626
when did you like Jeong-won?

1420
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:38,545
Isn't that obvious?

1421
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:45,093
Is it...

1422
01:43:48,805 --> 01:43:50,057
Like love at first...

1423
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:56,396
The moment I first saw him.

1424
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:01,443
I fell for him

1425
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:04,071
the moment I first saw him.

1426
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,662
Have some bread and milk.

1427
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:12,913
Thank you.

1428
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:17,626
Dr. Jang.

1429
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:20,545
Did you hear about the new professor
who's starting today?

1430
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,923
Yes, I heard he was
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

1431
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:24,341
A professor of Pediatric Surgery.

1432
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:27,219
That's right.
Pediatric surgeons are so rare.

1433
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:30,597
I heard he can perform operations
all by himself

1434
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,307
and handle appointments on his own.

1435
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:37,562
So don't even worry about Pediatrics

1436
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:40,899
-and assist me--
-Guys, say hello.

1437
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,609
Today is his first day.

1438
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,945
Professor Ahn Jeong-won
of Pediatric Surgery.

1439
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:47,656
Hello.

1440
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:02,587
This is Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul,
the only resident in GS.

1441
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:04,256
I see.

1442
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:09,886
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ahn Jeong-won.

1443
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:15,934
Hello, I'm Jang Gyeo-ul.

1444
01:45:19,438 --> 01:45:20,605
Hello, I'm Ahn Jeong-won.

1445
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:22,232
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Bae-jin.

1446
01:45:22,315 --> 01:45:23,400
Nice to meet you.

1447
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:26,653
-Nice to meet you. I'm Ahn Jeong-won.
-I'm Lee Ji-hun. Nice to meet you.

1448
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,031
-Nice to meet you.
-You're very handsome.

1449
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:30,574
My gosh, I'm flattered.

1450
01:45:31,074 --> 01:45:33,201
Right. Gyeo-ul is in the ER now.

1451
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:34,411
My gosh, why?

1452
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:36,747
It's gotten better after she got the shot.

1453
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,874
I think she had anaphylaxis from NSAIDs.

1454
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,000
SUDDEN REACTION TO THE BODY

1455
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,627
Her face swelled 30 minutes
after taking the pill for cramps.

1456
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:43,920
Then, she couldn't breathe.

1457
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:46,089
She passed out like a scene in the movie.

1458
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,050
Oh, no. Please excuse me.

1459
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,053
She's much better now.

1460
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:52,471
She's probably asleep.

1461
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:01,688
Hey, "City Hall Subway Station" is fine
for tomorrow, right?

1462
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:04,691
Yes, I love all the songs by Zoo.

1463
01:46:04,983 --> 01:46:06,693
I should practice tonight.

1464
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:09,571
Can you guys clean up mine? I have to go.

1465
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,952
Hello, Professor Ahn.

1466
01:46:57,536 --> 01:46:59,454
You must be here for Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

1467
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:01,289
She's much better now.

1468
01:47:01,706 --> 01:47:02,582
Let's go in.

1469
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:05,252
No, it's okay.
I got a call, so I have to go.

1470
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,129
I see.

1471
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:09,506
Wait.

1472
01:47:11,383 --> 01:47:12,634
Take good care

1473
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:14,803
of Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

1474
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:16,721
Of course.

1475
01:47:20,475 --> 01:47:23,061
Seeing others enjoy good food
makes you happier than

1476
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,313
when you are eating it yourself.

1477
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:27,649
I'm not like that.

1478
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:29,067
You are like that.

1479
01:47:36,032 --> 01:47:37,951
You made the right decision.

1480
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:42,539
Stay here and save more lives.

1481
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:50,422
Don't tell the other guys
for the time being.

1482
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:54,551
There's someone I want to tell first.

1483
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,905
Winter is here.

1484
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:20,535
The winter we've been waiting for.

1485
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,894
Professor Yang, it's me, Min-ha.

1486
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:12,439
Do you have any plans for this evening?

1487
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:15,483
If not, let's have dinner together
at the steakhouse across the street.

1488
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:16,484
At 7:30 p.m.

1489
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:22,741
No pressure though.
You don't have to come.

1490
01:50:23,325 --> 01:50:26,036
My friend lives in the area,
so I can eat with her if you can't come.

1491
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:30,373
But I really hope you can come.

1492
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:55,940
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS, MERRY CHRISTMAS

1493
01:50:59,486 --> 01:51:05,325
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

1494
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,462
YOON SIN-HYE

1495
01:51:29,432 --> 01:51:30,517
Hello?

1496
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:16,062
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

1497
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:04,527
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST WILL BE BACK
IN A NEW SEASON IN THE YEAR 2021
