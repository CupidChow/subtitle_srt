1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,487
Professor Yang, it's me, Min-ha.

2
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,157
Do you have any plans for this evening?

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,285
If not, let's have dinner together
at the steakhouse across the street.

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,369
At 7:30 p.m.

5
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,082
No pressure though.
You don't have to come.

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,586
My friend lives in the area,
so I can eat with her if you can't come.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,423
But I really hope you can come.

8
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,019
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

9
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,781
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER
WITH YOUR FRIENDS, MERRY CHRISTMAS

10
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,165
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

11
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,302
YOON SIN-HYE

12
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,649
Hello?

13
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,736
What about a CT scan?

14
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,489
He's conscious?

15
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,825
Yeah, he got a CT scan done.

16
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,787
The Professor of Neurosurgery said
they'd just have to monitor him tonight.

17
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,124
Is that okay though?

18
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,458
I'll be there in a minute.

19
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,305
THE STEAKHOUSE IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

20
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,849
You go ahead.

21
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,893
My gosh.

22
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,898
Yeah, please go ahead.

23
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,820
SORRY, JUST HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS

24
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,797
Hey, Seok-hyeong! You're still here?

25
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,718
This is Kang So-ye.
She's a good friend of mine.

26
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,470
She's going to join our hospital
as a fellow next year,

27
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,015
but she wanted to learn the job
in advance. How kind!

28
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,141
Yes, thank you.

29
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,851
-Hello.
-Hello.

30
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,770
Just now, Professor Yoon Seon-ju…

31
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,940
He was just admitted, right?
Cerebral hemorrhage, in his seventies.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,319
Yes, the CT scan shows
ICH in the right basal ganglia.

33
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,738
I'd say about 15cc,

34
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,197
which isn't a lot, thankfully.

35
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
The CT angiogram shows no abnormalities.

36
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,370
His mental status is alert,
but the left side motor response is poor.

37
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,540
We're going to monitor him all night.
Why? Do you know him?

38
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,834
He's a famous professor.

39
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,629
Over here.

40
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,345
Who's on duty tonight for Neurosurgery?

41
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,473
Professor Choi Hyeong-su.
He came and left.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,474
Seok-hyeong.

43
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,809
Yes.

44
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:52,941
EMERGENCY CENTER

45
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,652
Who is she?

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,208
Cheers!

47
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,247
It's a Christmas gift from our chef.
Enjoy.

48
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,507
What a stingy chef.

49
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,176
This is tiny!

50
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:36,377
THE STEAKHOUSE IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

51
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,143
Wash up later.
The bathroom's flooded right now.

52
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,444
Hey, where were you? I called you twice.

53
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,156
The study session ended just now.
What's up? Is something up?

54
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,158
No, it's fine.

55
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,911
Liar. You're obviously not okay.

56
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,539
-What?
-You miss me.

57
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,795
Gosh, what should we do?
There's no medicine for this.

58
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,881
Should I come see you?
Should I get on the bus now?

59
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,466
I really miss you a lot.

60
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,095
I miss you so much
that I'm about to get a sty…

61
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,225
Hold on.

62
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,686
Go away. Get lost.

63
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,564
I'm off anyway.

64
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,526
I can't stand to watch any more of this.

65
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,028
Jeong-won dropped by.

66
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,739
Ik-sun, the ring got sent back
to the hospital.

67
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,157
I received it today.

68
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,284
It got sent back? Why?

69
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,787
It just says, "Return to sender."

70
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,414
That's odd. I was home all week.
Last week too.

71
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,794
Let me ask my friend in the room
next to mine. I'll call you back.

72
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,587
All right.

73
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,426
He can't move one arm
and threw up earlier.

74
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,803
Doesn't he need surgery?

75
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,890
No. It's only a little bit of blood,
so the meds will do.

76
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,685
They're right in putting him on meds

77
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,688
that can lower
the intracranial pressure and BP.

78
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,649
But what if the bleeding
gets worse overnight?

79
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,276
What if his condition worsens?

80
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,194
The bleeding could increase.

81
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,073
But I'm sure the ICU staff will
keep taking CT scans to check.

82
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,827
If the bleeding worsens,
we'll insert a long tube

83
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,038
called a catheter to drain the blood.

84
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,041
If the bleeding worsens significantly,

85
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,878
we'll go into surgery right away.

86
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
But at the moment, we don't know.

87
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,093
We have no idea whether or not
the bleeding will worsen,

88
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,096
so let's wait and see.
We can decide later.

89
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,766
This is why it's important to know someone
who works in a hospital.

90
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,685
Thank you for stopping by.

91
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,270
No problem.

92
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,025
The ICU is full at the moment,
so he'll have to wait a little.

93
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,571
You should sit down and get some rest.
It won't take too long.

94
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,948
See if you can speed it up a little…

95
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,369
for old times' sake.

96
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
Okay.

97
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,221
Did you have dinner?

98
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,264
No.

99
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,185
He suddenly collapsed
on our way to a family dinner.

100
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,938
So we brought him here.

101
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,439
None of us had dinner.

102
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,066
I see.

103
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,776
Mom must be hungry.

104
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,072
Is there a gimbap place nearby?
Or even just a convenience store.

105
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,366
Yes, there's a gimbap place
across the street.

106
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,243
It should still be open.

107
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,120
-Come with me.
-What?

108
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,207
Okay.

109
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,050
It's snowing a lot outside.

110
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,636
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

111
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,930
We're stepping out to get gimbap.
It'll be quick.

112
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,098
Let's go, Seok-hyeong.

113
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,526
It's so cold!

114
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,123
Oh, no. What should I do?

115
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,259
I'm here.
I'm right in front of the ER now.

116
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,178
My gosh, it's snowing so much right now.

117
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,805
I just saw your text.

118
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,683
You're back already?
You said you had a date this evening.

119
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,394
Did I?

120
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,896
I was joking. A date, my foot.

121
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,441
Anyway, I'm heading in now.

122
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,110
Wait at the station, okay?

123
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,945
Gosh, it's so cold.

124
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,314
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

125
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,247
The half-dried herring
actually goes quite well with wine.

126
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,332
-Doesn't it?
-Yes, it's very nice.

127
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,167
Good choice, Kettle.

128
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,004
What kettle? What brand is it?

129
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,757
He calls me Kettle, Mr. Kettle.

130
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,301
Oh, I see.

131
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,097
What are you doing? Hurry up!

132
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,267
It must be good news, right?

133
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,437
That's what you want to tell me.
That's why you're coming to see me!

134
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,148
What is the good news
that you're thinking of?

135
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,484
What do you think? You staying
right by my side forever, obviously.

136
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,778
Let's talk in person on the weekend.

137
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,616
Okay. I'll be waiting, with the red carpet
rolled out just for you.

138
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,368
I love you, son!

139
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,584
Jong-su, pour me some wine.
All the way to the top.

140
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,587
What's going on? What did Jeong-won say?

141
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,505
Sounds like he decided not to quit.

142
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
Really?

143
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,011
That's great.

144
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:47,183
My, that's such good news. Great news!

145
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,686
Really?
He told me that he was leaving soon.

146
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,981
He's not going anywhere.
He's had a change of heart.

147
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,400
He's visiting Yangpyeong this Sunday,

148
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,777
but his flight was booked for this Sunday.

149
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,906
What does that mean?
Clearly, he's decided to stay!

150
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,496
And I think Jeong-won's got a girlfriend.

151
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,706
What does her family do?

152
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,209
What does her father do?

153
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,171
How would I know?
And who cares what her family does?

154
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,926
I'm just grateful that my 40-year-old son
has finally got a girlfriend!

155
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,428
That's such great news for the hospital.

156
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,475
I was really worried about how
I'd manage Pediatric Surgery without him.

157
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,186
PEDIATRIC SURGERY AHN JEONG-WON

158
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,356
Gosh, it's Professor Ahn.

159
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,775
Answer it. Hurry, quick!

160
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,238
Hi, Professor Ahn. What's up?

161
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,201
Me? I'm with your mother now.

162
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,787
Right.

163
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,540
Can I stop by your office for a moment
tomorrow morning?

164
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,166
I need to have a word with you.

165
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,045
Yes, of course. You can stop by
for ten hours, if you'd like.

166
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,422
You can come by anytime.

167
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,052
Okay. Then I'll come by
before my outpatient appointments.

168
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,846
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

169
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,242
Hey, what's our next song?

170
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,453
"I'm okay now. I've given up on love."

171
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,956
"Why am I crying like a fool?" By the way…

172
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,000
Someone's dating.

173
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,547
Seok-hyeong is seeing someone, right?

174
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,552
Well, I'm not sure.
He didn't say anything to me.

175
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,722
The song choice is pretty suspicious.

176
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,730
Hey! I figured out why. My goodness.

177
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,608
Hold on. Hold on a second.

178
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,860
Just a second.

179
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,339
It got sent back because no one was there?

180
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,798
That's the way it's done here.

181
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,968
The mailman must have come
when I stepped out for a moment last week.

182
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,930
Se-gyeong told me they'd redeliver it

183
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,641
if I called the post office
and confirmed the details,

184
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,434
but I'd have to call right away.

185
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,479
I can't believe it got sent back.

186
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,730
I'll send it again.

187
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,566
No, it's okay.
What if something goes wrong again?

188
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,653
Just give it to me in person
when I'm back in Korea.

189
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,154
When will that be?

190
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,822
I don't know.

191
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,158
All right. Then I'll hold onto it for now.

192
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,578
I don't want you to be stuck at home
waiting for the ring.

193
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,121
How's studying going?

194
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,249
It's hard. I should've done this sooner.
I'm physically struggling.

195
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,251
I get tired so easily.

196
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,879
Doesn't my face look weird now? Look.

197
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,383
You look pretty.
You don't look weird at all.

198
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,094
I guess your friend
is helping you out a lot.

199
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,221
Yes, Se-gyeong helps me out so much.

200
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,724
Se-gyeong came here a little before I did
but is like a native Londoner.

201
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,811
My gosh, your friend is better
than your boyfriend.

202
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,483
Jun-wan, I know it's late,
but Merry Christmas.

203
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,404
-It'll be Christmas in a few hours there.
-Yes.

204
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

205
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,450
I'm sorry too. Merry Christmas.

206
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,744
Thanks. I love you.

207
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,540
I love you too.

208
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,334
-I love you.
-I love you.

209
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,961
All right.

210
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,427
Professor Lee.

211
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,513
How did you know it was me?

212
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,392
Who else would be here at this hour?

213
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,310
By the way…

214
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,565
where are you going so early?
You usually sleep in.

215
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,484
-I'm off to work.
-I'm sorry?

216
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,862
I haven't been exercising at all,
so I feel very unfit these days.

217
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,114
I'm going to bike to work.

218
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,741
This man in black will be off now.

219
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,512
U-ju, see you later. Have fun with Auntie.

220
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,139
My gosh.

221
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:25,687
Oh, my. When did my son grow so much?

222
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,189
Right?

223
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,735
I feel like he's grown so much overnight.

224
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,736
Isn't it odd?

225
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,197
The New Year is here.

226
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,243
He's had a growth spurt
now that he's a year older.

227
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:43,497
Sorry?
You're not making much sense right now.

228
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,255
Auntie.

229
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,093
Sometimes, yesterday feels like today,
and vice versa.

230
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,555
And sometimes, the day after tomorrow
feels like the past, you know?

231
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,639
Look here.

232
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,412
-Hello, take it easy.
-Thank you.

233
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,707
Hey, let's take a break too.
I have a headache.

234
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,085
Yes, don't push yourself too hard
on a cold day like this.

235
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,755
Come on. We're almost there. Get up.

236
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,552
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

237
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,636
Are you all right?

238
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,519
I'm…

239
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,857
Sir.

240
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,360
Sir, open your eyes. Sir?

241
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,072
Can you describe your symptoms?
What's your name?

242
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,658
My head…

243
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,764
I'm a doctor. Can you call an ambulance?

244
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,057
This could be a stroke.

245
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,475
Okay.

246
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,212
911 RESCUE SERVICES

247
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,010
-Can I borrow your penlight?
-Sure.

248
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,985
Thankfully, his pupil reaction seems fine.

249
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,739
By the way, where are we taking him?
Which hospital?

250
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,075
-We're taking him to Yulje.
-Yulje?

251
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,703
It's before the rush hour,
so there's no traffic now.

252
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,997
Right, it's still early.

253
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,833
Sir, which hospital do you work at?

254
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,086
If it's on our way back,
we'll drop you off.

255
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,172
It's okay. There's no need.

256
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,261
It's really okay.

257
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,779
It's so cold.

258
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,074
I got here way too early.

259
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,877
Are you a ghost?

260
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,630
Hey, why are you here?

261
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,469
-Where's your car?
-Why are you here so early, sleepyhead?

262
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,596
Something happened.
Did you not go to Sokcho?

263
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,557
I have a lecture in the morning.
Thank you!

264
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,226
I came early to prepare for it.

265
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,062
I'm getting my new car later today.

266
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,064
Did you bike here? What are you wearing?

267
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,816
-Does it look weird? Do I look lame?
-Yes, weird and lame.

268
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,029
Did you have coffee?
Don't you need coffee in the morning?

269
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,782
Coffee?

270
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,248
Sure, let's have some coffee.
Come to my office.

271
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,917
Okay!

272
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,679
-Good morning.
-Hello, Professor Yang.

273
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,389
Hello, good morning.

274
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,231
Hurry.

275
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,109
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello, Professor.

276
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,694
Hi, guys.

277
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,657
Aren't you getting in?

278
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,868
I left something in the car.

279
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,995
Go ahead.

280
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,250
Doors are closing.

281
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,318
Ms. Song, ER's sending a patient now.
Is that okay?

282
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,821
Tell them it's fine.
And see if Room 11 is ready.

283
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,906
Got it. Yes, you can send the patient now.

284
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,035
This patient had a hepatectomy,

285
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,414
but the urine output has decreased a lot.
Was everything okay last night?

286
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,083
Yes, I went there and checked.

287
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,837
The patient was fine,
and I confirmed that we changed IV bags.

288
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,757
Dr. Jang, Park Cheol-yong in Room 10
has a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius,

289
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,051
and he's shivering badly.
What should we do?

290
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,137
Give him an IV
and a fever reducer for now.

291
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,680
-I'll check on him soon.
-Okay.

292
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,104
I have surgery first thing in the morning.

293
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,898
You've seen me go to work this early.

294
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,068
I'll be late. I'll call you at night.

295
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,153
All right.

296
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,117
Hey, did you use my shampoo?

297
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,119
No, I didn't.

298
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,872
Jeez, you stingy prick.
You can have it all.

299
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,874
Why not? Try it.

300
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,753
It's really good. You should use it too.

301
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,505
I've used it. It was great.

302
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,763
Was he a pitcher or what?

303
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,890
That pitch was so accurate.

304
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,605
Have you been practicing?

305
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,817
Yes, I have.

306
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,989
Then do it in front of me.

307
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,961
You haven't been practicing hard enough.

308
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,672
-This isn't good.
-My stomach…

309
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,423
My stomach hurts a lot.

310
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,135
It feels tight, and I feel so weak.

311
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,389
Doctor, please leave it to me.
I'll do it at my own pace.

312
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,767
You may have to go back to the ICU
if you end up with pneumonia again.

313
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,187
Five times, every hour.
Do it properly before you rest.

314
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,439
I'll be back in the afternoon.

315
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,567
I expect you to fully lift a ball
when I'm back.

316
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,902
Do you understand?

317
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,198
Yes, Doctor. I'll make sure he practices.

318
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,700
Great. See you later.

319
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,222
What is this patient's diagnosis?

320
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,267
Well…

321
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,268
Age?

322
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,062
I'm sorry, sir.

323
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,732
What kind of surgery has the patient had?

324
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,030
Are you here
to just watch me perform surgery?

325
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,574
Make sure you study before you scrub in.

326
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,493
I'm sorry, sir.

327
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,288
Let's do the purse-string suture.

328
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,040
PURSE STRING: TECHNIQUE THAT CLOSES
A WOUND LIKE A PURSE

329
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,086
Keep checking the vitals

330
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,672
and check for any drainage color change.

331
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,841
We're doing a Doppler ultrasound today,

332
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,510
so check for fluid collection
in the hilum.

333
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,678
Yes, sir.

334
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,560
I'm counting on you guys.

335
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,492
PEDIATRIC SURGERY

336
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,879
Did you count everything?

337
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,049
-We're short of a dressing set.
-Room 8 is using one now.

338
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,927
Hello, Professor Ahn.

339
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,095
Hello.

340
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,645
Seung-ho ran a fever last night.

341
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,315
We gave him an IV and a fever reducer,
but he still has a mild fever.

342
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,945
A fever is common because of
the post-surgery condition of the lungs.

343
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,406
I'll have a look at him
when I'm doing rounds later.

344
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,366
Do we have Chae-eun's results?

345
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,202
The liver Doppler ultrasound results
look good,

346
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,121
but she's not in a good mood.

347
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,627
She's become a pessimist
since getting the liver transplant.

348
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,556
Hi, Chae-eun.

349
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,850
Hello, Professor Ahn.

350
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,477
Chae-eun, Dr. Ahn is here.

351
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,982
-What's the matter?
-No idea.

352
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,027
She's been eating well, right?

353
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,196
Yes, she's still a good eater.

354
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,698
I see.

355
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,661
Then I think she can go home tomorrow.
All the test results look good.

356
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,329
-I think she'll be fine--
-Doctor.

357
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,623
Yes, Chae-eun.

358
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,502
How much longer do I have to live?

359
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,468
My mom asks you that question
all the time.

360
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,139
"How much longer can Chae-eun live
with this new liver?"

361
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,895
I don't know either.

362
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,737
But I'm pretty sure you'll outlive me.

363
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,495
You'll live longer than me,
so don't worry.

364
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,581
Okay?

365
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,047
All right, see you.

366
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,053
-Jin-u is next.
-Okay.

367
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,723
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

368
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,102
It stings, doesn't it?
I'll be gentle. It's almost done.

369
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,187
Okay.

370
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,107
But how many more times
do I have to do this?

371
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,778
I really can't get used to this position.

372
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,572
Oh, I'm sorry.

373
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,994
Yes, Professor Yang.

374
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,247
We have a primi-patient, 12 weeks.

375
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,582
She's lost weight
because of her morning sickness,

376
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,626
so I told her she should be hospitalized.

377
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,503
I'll get you a new dressing set.

378
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,546
Okay, thank you.

379
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,465
Got it. So just order lab tests
and give her an IV?

380
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,426
-Are you doing something now?
-Pardon me?

381
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,346
-Are you changing someone's dressing?
-Yes.

382
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,140
Then call me when you're done.

383
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,193
Oh, I'm sorry.

384
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,036
Make sure the Hemovac doesn't
get disconnected. Close it up well.

385
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,872
Dress the wound thoroughly. See you.

386
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,707
Got it. Thank you, Professor Chae!

387
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,878
-Hey, Seok-min.
-I stopped by to see you.

388
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,130
-Where are you now?
-I'm busy.

389
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,551
You must not care about me
since I'm leaving. Spare me five minutes.

390
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,388
You've been slacking off so often.
Don't you have to study?

391
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:34,559
I was studying until ten minutes ago.
Where are you?

392
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,103
The Operating Unit.
Come to my office in five minutes.

393
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,564
Why are you in the Operating Unit again?

394
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,276
Jeez, were you assisting
Professor Min again?

395
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,237
We're short-staffed, so I had to.
Why did you have to leave?

396
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,823
I wish you were here to do these things.

397
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,868
Why did you take care of it
when the fellows can do it?

398
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,871
They're the busiest ones here.
I have the most time to spare.

399
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,497
Anyway, I'll see you in a bit.

400
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,512
Hey!

401
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,364
Is Chi-hong doing well
at the Jongno branch?

402
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,783
Didn't he start at the Jongno branch
this week?

403
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,160
Yes, his clinical rotation started today.

404
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,246
He didn't have to go there,
but I heard he volunteered.

405
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,706
I suggested he do it.

406
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,250
Professor Chae.

407
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,169
They were short-staffed and needed help.

408
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,588
I figured nothing bad
would come out of it.

409
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,715
They handle a wider range of cases.

410
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,177
And the more work you do,
the more and quicker you'll learn.

411
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,931
Did I sound like a geezer?

412
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,558
My goodness…

413
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,978
If you're a geezer,

414
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,438
Chae Song-hwa and company
are the only ones

415
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,316
who aren't geezers in this hospital.

416
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,194
I don't want to end up being a geezer.

417
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,863
I want to be a villain.

418
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,868
The greatest villain
in this entire hospital.

419
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,421
Hey, do you live here?

420
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,716
Yeah, I do. Want some crackers?

421
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,053
That…

422
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,056
Are you eating my crackers?

423
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,861
My gosh.
Thank you so much, Professor Chae.

424
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:54,866
The lecture will happen elsewhere,
so I wasn't sure how to bring it up.

425
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,411
My brother was the one who asked me,
so I couldn't refuse him.

426
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,371
Asking him will only take a second.

427
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,207
Ik-jun will do it if he's free.
He likes doing those things.

428
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,126
It's just that he's always busy.

429
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,170
He's in my office now, so let's ask him.

430
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,337
Thank you.

431
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,885
But does it have to be Ik-jun?

432
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,724
It is mine.
Why do you keep eating my snacks?

433
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,559
This is my favorite!

434
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,273
Jeez.

435
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,400
Get out, Ahn Jeong-won.

436
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,071
I said, get out.

437
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,115
Get out! Get out of Jun-wan's body.

438
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,910
Get out at once. You won't?

439
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,038
Get out.

440
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,082
-Stop…
-Get out.

441
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,251
Get out. Get lost.

442
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,629
-Leave Jun-wan alone!
-Jeez!

443
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,215
Get out.

444
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:57,345
Professor Lee Ik-jun is very famous
as a leading liver transplant specialist.

445
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,599
They specifically requested
Professor Lee Ik-jun.

446
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,560
He's a great lecturer
on top of being a competent doctor.

447
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,438
He's very charismatic.

448
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,774
Really?

449
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,039
Hey, stop!

450
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,551
He'll do it.

451
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,595
Ik-jun said he'll do it.

452
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,974
Just text me the location and time.

453
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,934
He'll be there. Don't worry.

454
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,769
Talk to you later.

455
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,898
Bye.

456
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,077
Patient Cho Seon-hwa said she was feeling
less fetal movement this morning.

457
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,037
-Did you do a nonstress test?
-Hello.

458
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,666
Yes, the variability seemed fine.

459
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,086
And she said she's feeling
more fetal movement now.

460
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,921
Check her ultrasound and let me know.

461
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,214
Sure.

462
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,842
Min-ha, can you spare me a moment?

463
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:18,926
Sure.

464
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,061
What happened to your hair?
Did you just wash it?

465
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,646
Don't ask.

466
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,108
Jun-wan…

467
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,321
He was possessed by you,
so I carried out a little ritual.

468
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,072
What are you talking about?

469
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,118
You are inside me.

470
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,872
You freak.

471
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,792
Kim Jun-wan speaking.

472
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,296
We're having a hard time
with the peripheral IV line for Eun-ji.

473
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,424
Okay, I'll check. I'm coming now.
Bye, guys.

474
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,220
Where's Seok-hyeong?

475
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,680
He's at a cafe meeting someone.

476
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,143
Who? He's not the type
to meet someone at a cafe.

477
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,978
-Is it a woman?
-Yes, Yoon Sin-hye.

478
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,397
That name rings a bell.

479
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,607
His ex-wife.

480
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,860
Her father is hospitalized now.
He should've told me.

481
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,447
I know. I thought he'd tell us,
but he hasn't said a word about it.

482
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,574
Her father will be discharged
in a day or two.

483
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,576
She must want to say bye to him in person.

484
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,705
My buddy, Ik-jun.

485
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,750
What's up, my buddy Jeong-won?

486
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,169
I'm curious about something.

487
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,879
What is it?

488
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,716
How is it that you always know everything?

489
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,053
That's because
I'm interested in everything.

490
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,223
-I'm curious about something too.
-What is it?

491
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,434
How much time do you need
to unwrap the damn pickled radish?

492
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,356
Look at her. She ate a whole line
of gimbap without it.

493
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,985
There was pickled radish?

494
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,412
I'm sorry.

495
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,666
Pass the phone over to someone else
in a situation like that.

496
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,127
The patient must have been uncomfortable.

497
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,713
Right. I'm sorry.

498
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,341
I understand you answered right away
because your professor called you,

499
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,012
but don't answer my calls
in situations like that.

500
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,055
You can call me back when you're done.

501
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,515
You're right.

502
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,690
Hey, Sin-hye.

503
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,775
I'll be there in three minutes.

504
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,490
It happens. Once is okay.

505
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,785
But not twice, okay?

506
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,746
Got it.

507
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,749
-See you.
-Bye.

508
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,217
My gosh, Yeon-u's mother is here again.

509
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,220
Hello, ma'am. Is it raining outside?

510
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,723
No, I brought an umbrella
because they said it'd rain,

511
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,308
but it doesn't look like it will.

512
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,897
I was in the area and wanted to stop by.
Here, have some tangerines.

513
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,149
They're from my parents' farm.

514
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,861
It's okay. You know that
we can't accept any gifts.

515
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,197
I know. I sure do.

516
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,449
I practically lived here for three years.

517
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,868
Then what should I do with these?

518
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,578
I should just throw them away.

519
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,580
Please throw these out for me.

520
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,166
My gosh. Thank you.

521
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,047
By the way, is Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul
not here today?

522
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,300
She's in the ICU. Oh, there she is.

523
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,762
Hello, Dr. Jang.

524
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,139
-Hello.
-My gosh.

525
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,350
You still seem so busy.

526
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,477
Aren't there any juniors
joining this year?

527
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,813
I should file a complaint or something.

528
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,899
No, it's okay. What brings you here today?

529
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,610
Did you want to talk to me
about something?

530
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,072
No, I just wanted to stop by
because I was in the area.

531
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,951
My friend's daughter turned one today,
so I had lunch with them.

532
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,081
The baby's skin was flawless,
without a single scar on the face.

533
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,668
But Yeon-u…

534
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:25,297
That tiny body was covered with scars,
you know.

535
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,261
We changed the dressings
as often as we could

536
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,597
and paid extra attention
to minimize scarring.

537
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,058
We're sorry.

538
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,643
Gosh, don't be.

539
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,814
I know you adored Yeon-u so much.

540
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,401
Was it about a month before Yeon-u died?

541
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,194
In the afternoon,

542
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,738
Yeon-u suddenly started vomiting
after taking the meds.

543
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,074
Even then, you took care of everything…

544
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,951
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

545
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,953
Yes, Professor.

546
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,249
Yes. I've wrapped up everything here,
so I can go.

547
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,168
Okay.

548
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,587
My professor needs me.

549
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,213
Okay.

550
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,854
Yes. You just need me
to procure it, right?

551
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,564
Okay, I'll make sure to check.

552
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,032
Let it go.
Just make sure you don't do it again.

553
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,034
Ms. Han.

554
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,163
Why is it that I don't know anything
I have not experienced before?

555
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,375
I'm incapable of learning things
on my own.

556
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,461
I always start from zero.

557
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,922
I don't have the talent
to be a good doctor,

558
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,466
I have no skills, and I'm dumb…

559
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,677
Anyway, I suck at everything.

560
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,140
-Hello?
-This is the ER.

561
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,809
We have a 38-year-old patient.
She's 19 weeks pregnant.

562
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,187
She's had a watery discharge
since lunchtime today.

563
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,357
PROM is suspected.
Could you come down and take a look?

564
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,858
She's not a follow-up patient.

565
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,486
She noticed the discharge
and came to our ER right away.

566
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,239
Sure, no problem. I have to go.

567
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,460
We managed to do it after we called you.

568
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,838
-Really? The peripheral line is in?
-Yes, it's in.

569
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,840
Great, let's get the central line in now.

570
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,841
Okay.

571
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,929
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

572
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,391
And Dr. Do Jae-hak just got here

573
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,684
to see Eun-ji.

574
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,774
NAME: SON EUN-JI
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

575
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:55,114
Oh, dear. The machine is bigger than her.

576
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,033
Eun-ji is waiting
for a heart transplant, right?

577
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,118
Yes.

578
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,289
She's been hooked up to the VAD
for over three months now,

579
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,165
but we can't find a donor for her.

580
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,252
But Eun-ji is staying strong.

581
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,464
What are you doing here?

582
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,718
-Hello.
-Hello, Professor Kim.

583
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,845
I came to see Eun-ji.

584
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,431
Jang Hong-do, right?

585
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,059
Yes, that's right.
I'm Jang Hong-do, in third year.

586
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,978
We've met a few times.

587
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,521
Isn't he impressive?

588
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,649
-What do you mean?
-He's spending his winter break

589
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,236
working here as a sub-intern
instead of hanging out with his friends.

590
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,780
Even Jang Yun-bok, his twin sister--

591
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,782
How's the VAD different from the ECMO?

592
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,828
Well…

593
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,414
Professor Kim.

594
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,750
He should study
since that's what he's here to do.

595
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,837
I expect you to have the answer ready
the next time I see you.

596
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,838
Yes, sir.

597
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,632
You should go study too.

598
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,259
Don't be one of the few people
who fail the board exam.

599
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,558
Does he always have to be so mean?

600
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,271
Eun-ji! She woke up.

601
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,066
Eun-ji, you woke up!

602
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,956
Someone left an umbrella here.

603
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,876
That's Yeon-u's mother's.
You can give it to me.

604
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,133
Is this Yeon-u's mother?

605
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,640
To be honest, I don't really get it.

606
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,600
What?

607
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,648
Yeon-u was hospitalized here
for a long time

608
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,567
but ended up dying
after suffering a lot of pain.

609
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,572
Yeon-u was born prematurely,
underwent surgery several times,

610
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,658
and practically lived here
for three years.

611
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,911
I only knew Yeon-u for about a year,

612
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,457
but Da-yeong and Dr. Jang saw everything
from the time when Yeon-u was a newborn.

613
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,085
-That kid practically grew up here.
-Yes.

614
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,964
They had Yeon-u's 100th-day celebration
and even their first birthday party here.

615
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,177
I understand she's befriended
many people here

616
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,555
and is grateful to the staff,
but if I were her…

617
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,769
If my child died here
after suffering from an illness for years,

618
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,314
I wouldn't even want
to think of this place.

619
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,150
I'd hate to visit.

620
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,487
That said, what if…

621
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,698
She said she'll pick it up
tomorrow evening.

622
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,242
It's Yeon-u's birthday tomorrow.
She'll bring cake.

623
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,870
-She'll be here again tomorrow?
-Yes.

624
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,498
Da-yeong.

625
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,042
I was just thinking,

626
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,754
but do you think that Yeon-u's mother

627
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,592
could be preparing to sue us,
thinking that Yeon-u died

628
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,303
because of some kind of mistake
that happened here?

629
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,099
Maybe she's coming here so often
to obtain clues or evidence.

630
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:14,688
I'm not sure. She got along with all of us
and with the doctors as well.

631
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:18,442
She still talks to Professor Lee Ji-yeong
who performed the surgery.

632
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,319
I'm sure that's not it.

633
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,280
I know, just in case.

634
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:27,659
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul and I were always
right by Yeon-u's side.

635
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,829
Dr. Jang isn't the type to make mistakes,

636
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,208
which means… Did I make a mistake?

637
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,378
Don't worry.
I told you, I was just thinking.

638
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,554
Yes, hello. I'm sure you told
Professor Kwon all the details,

639
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,973
but I wanted to ask you
about the donor's condition.

640
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,600
Was CPR performed?

641
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,895
Right.

642
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,234
Can you tell me the LFT results
and the amount of cardiac stimulant used?

643
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,319
I just wanted to double-check.

644
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,412
Move her to the delivery room.

645
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,875
Doctor. My baby is okay, right?

646
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:21,505
I'm only 19 weeks pregnant.
My water shouldn't break yet.

647
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,298
Nothing will happen, right?

648
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,261
Well, we need to run some tests
to find out what's going on.

649
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,805
We also need to find out
whether it's amniotic fluid.

650
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,475
Okay.

651
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,229
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

652
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,901
-Is the professor here yet?
-No.

653
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,113
-Who's on duty today?
-Professor Yeom Se-hee.

654
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,492
-There she is.
-Hello.

655
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,952
She's 19 weeks pregnant.

656
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,746
She's nitrazine positive
and has a gross rupture.

657
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,040
Her AFI is 3cm at the moment.

658
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,959
PROM is suspected.

659
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,169
-Did you say 19 weeks?
-Yes.

660
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,213
To be exact, 19 weeks and 5 days.

661
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,215
It's too soon.

662
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,468
-Where is she now?
-In the MFICU.

663
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,518
No, Doctor.

664
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:21,189
We went through hoops
to conceive this baby.

665
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,737
I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do
at this stage of pregnancy.

666
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,158
You need to be at least 24 weeks pregnant
for us to save the baby.

667
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,703
Waiting won't help as it's happening
so early in the pregnancy.

668
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:39,249
Even if we decide to wait,
the baby's lungs won't develop properly

669
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,251
because your water broke prematurely.

670
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:47,132
The baby won't last long at all
even if it's born.

671
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,303
And it could cause inflammation,
which will also put you in danger.

672
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,022
You probably need…

673
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,651
some time to prepare yourself
to say goodbye.

674
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,985
I'll leave you to it.

675
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,427
Premature rupture of membranes
at 19 weeks of pregnancy.

676
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,972
Can't keep the baby as she has lost
most of her amniotic fluid.

677
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,851
If delivered now,
the fetus will not be viable,

678
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,312
and the chance of survival is low.

679
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,940
PROM can cause a prolapsed umbilical cord,

680
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:49,277
a womb infection, and preterm labor pains,
which can be dangerous.

681
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,030
It can also cause inflammation
in the mother's body.

682
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,033
If prematurely born,
the baby's underdeveloped lungs

683
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,078
could cause complications
such as breathing difficulties.

684
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,334
Oh, boy. That's quite a chart.

685
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,170
She must be devastated now.

686
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,672
I know.

687
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:13,343
I hope she can let it go
and pull herself together soon.

688
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,096
If it's dragged out,
it'll only get harder for the mother.

689
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,727
The ambulances are so busy today.

690
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,396
Se-ho.

691
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,525
Do you know where you are now? Se-ho.

692
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,405
It's okay, Se-ho.
You're in the hospital now. It's okay.

693
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,159
Did you call Pediatric Surgery?

694
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,620
Dr. Jang is out for procurement.
It'll take her a while.

695
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,457
Oh, no.
I think we should call Professor Ahn.

696
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,917
Professor Ahn must be in surgery now.

697
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,215
This is Professor Ahn's phone.

698
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,468
He's in surgery
and can't come to the phone now.

699
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,303
This is Kang So-ye, a fellow in the ER.

700
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,014
I'm calling because
Professor Ahn's patient just came in.

701
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,433
An eight-year-old
traffic accident patient, male.

702
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,227
Mental state, drowsy.
His BP is 80 over 60,

703
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,772
and his heart rate is 120.
Based on the physical exam…

704
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,107
If there's a notable difference
in the diameters,

705
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,276
-keep the stitches small.
-Got it.

706
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,155
Everything else looks okay,
but we've spotted a fluid collection.

707
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,782
An emergency transfusion…

708
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,159
We need to do surgery.
Examine the patient quickly.

709
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,626
The intestinal anastomosis is done.
Please seal up the rest.

710
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,252
Please call me when it's done.

711
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,925
His current vitals?

712
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,053
BP is 70 over 50,
and his heart rate is 130.

713
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,102
Se-ho, does it hurt a lot?

714
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,690
I'm sorry, but can you book an OR for me?

715
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,858
Sure.

716
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,241
Sorry?

717
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,244
You want a different doctor?

718
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,664
I read a blog post about
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong helping someone

719
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,708
who was 18 weeks pregnant
keep her baby and give birth safely.

720
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,045
I'm really sorry.

721
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,632
I know it's rude of me
to make such a request.

722
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,969
I'm fully aware that
I shouldn't be asking you this,

723
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,723
but I feel no shame right now.

724
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,519
Please, help me.

725
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,857
Could you please ask
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong just once?

726
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,319
I'm really sorry.

727
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,909
I understand the situation is bad…

728
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,123
but I can feel my baby moving.

729
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,585
So how could I give up?

730
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,235
-Who is it?
-It's Chu Min-ha, Professor.

731
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,820
-Come in.
-Thank you.

732
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,582
Sure, that's fine.

733
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,463
Let her have her way. I don't care.

734
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,175
Okay, then.

735
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,764
-Who is it?
-It's me, Min-ha.

736
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,140
Come in.

737
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,937
I explained the situation to her
several times,

738
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,314
but she's saying she still can't give up.

739
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,609
She said she can't give up
when she can still feel her baby moving.

740
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,903
Is she, by any chance…

741
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,448
on the slimmer side?

742
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,616
Pardon?

743
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,035
Well, yes.

744
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,706
She conceived the baby
after three rounds of IVF.

745
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,877
She practically begged me, saying
she wants to try everything she can.

746
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,838
What did Professor Yeom say?

747
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,257
She said the decision is yours.
She doesn't care.

748
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,176
Really?

749
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,640
-Then I'll examine the patient.
-Really?

750
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,601
-Where is she now?
-In the MFICU.

751
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,229
-I'll go after my outpatient appointments.
-Okay.

752
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,982
Text me her name and registration number.

753
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,066
-Will do.
-Okay.

754
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,831
Get going.

755
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,376
Have a good day.

756
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,051
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

757
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,220
The situation looks pretty bad indeed.

758
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,350
The baby has a slim chance of survival.

759
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:19,441
But I wouldn't say there's zero chance,

760
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,028
so I'm going to trust that
we still have hope and do my very best.

761
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,910
Thank you, Doctor.

762
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,915
For the baby, we'll use antibiotics
and see how it goes.

763
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,085
At week 23, we'll consider injections
that speed up lung development.

764
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,298
Thankfully, the baby's movements
in the womb seem totally fine.

765
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:48,178
You're not showing any signs of infection,
and you don't have a fever.

766
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,513
If you experience contractions,

767
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,017
we'll give you meds that can control that
and see how it goes.

768
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,268
Okay.

769
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,773
-Thank you.
-Then I'll see you tomorrow.

770
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,566
I bet you haven't had dinner yet.
I got you some pastries.

771
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,151
I feel bad that I'm going home.

772
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,869
I feel like you work all the night shifts
in OB-GYN.

773
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,329
Do you have a lot to do?

774
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,752
Are you organizing the charts?
Is there a problem?

775
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,504
Look at this.

776
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,174
"At 19 weeks…"

777
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,094
Premature rupture of membranes
at 19 weeks of pregnancy.

778
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,639
Lost most of her amniotic fluid,
but fetal movements look good.

779
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:15,890
Breech presentation.

780
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,435
No signs of infection in the womb.
No contractions detected.

781
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,480
Antibiotics will be given
to prevent infection in the womb.

782
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,774
Contractions will be regulated
should they occur.

783
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,819
If stable condition is maintained
until Week 23,

784
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,614
the fetus will become viable.
We will, then, consider betamethasone.

785
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,533
C-section will be performed if needed.

786
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,369
Looks like this patient may be able
to keep her baby.

787
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,832
WATERY DISCHARGE

788
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,840
CAN'T KEEP THE BABY AS SHE HAS LOST
MOST OF HER AMNIOTIC FLUID

789
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,218
I see.
This case will be a little difficult.

790
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,891
Don't you notice anything strange?

791
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,100
I do.

792
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,062
You can't organize the charts like this.

793
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,734
There can't be two different patients
under one profile.

794
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,488
It's the same person.

795
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,242
The same day, the exact same patient.

796
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,330
And the charts were written
by the same person,

797
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,999
Chu Min-ha. Me.

798
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,545
The same patient.

799
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,089
The same day.

800
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,967
The same resident.

801
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,679
Just a different professor,

802
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,808
but the content of the chart
totally changed in just a few hours.

803
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,496
Professor Ahn!

804
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,082
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

805
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,167
-Hello.
-Hello.

806
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,293
Are you done for the day?

807
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,003
Yes, I'm going to head out soon.

808
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:13,216
Professor Ahn, I'm on duty tonight.
Can you buy me a coffee?

809
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,223
You can use this to get a coffee.

810
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,599
Thank you.

811
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,644
You can give my ID badge to Gwang-hyeon.

812
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,854
I'll pick it up tomorrow morning.

813
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,231
Thank you.

814
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,581
EMERGENCY CENTER

815
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,169
It's cold. Come out when I call you.

816
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,342
I knew it. I'll be right there.
Give me a minute.

817
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,934
I blow-dried my hair.

818
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,520
Stop raining, please.

819
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,366
Let's go. I'm hungry.

820
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,784
Okay.

821
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,291
All right, let's go.

822
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,252
-Aren't you hungry?
-I am.

823
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,881
-What shall we have?
-I'm good with anything.

824
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,343
Really? What should we eat
to make everyone jealous?

825
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,386
What? No one can know about this!

826
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,639
Oh, right. We have to keep this a secret.

827
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,738
Professor Lee Ik-jun asked me twice
today alone.

828
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,740
He asked me if we were seeing each other.

829
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,993
He said he feels like
we're putting on an act.

830
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,872
He asked me to tell him the truth,
swearing he wouldn't tell anyone.

831
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,084
I'll tell my friends sometime next week.

832
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,087
They'll keep their lips sealed
and keep it under wraps.

833
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,467
I'm totally fine with it
as long as you're okay with it.

834
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,928
So if there's anyone you want to tell,
go ahead.

835
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,638
I don't care.

836
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,266
Okay, let me think about it.
There's one person I want to tell.

837
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,396
Who? Dr. Chu Min-ha in OB-GYN?

838
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,231
Yes.

839
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,911
She stayed with you all night

840
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,996
when you went to the ER
due to anaphylaxis.

841
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,123
You're both ARMYs.

842
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,627
Yes, how did you know?

843
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,672
I heard about it.

844
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,177
-I think Ik-jun told me.
-I see.

845
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,680
Aren't you on duty tomorrow night?

846
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,099
I saw the schedule.

847
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,894
You're working all the night shifts
this week except for today.

848
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,021
Are you going to be okay?

849
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,610
I can stay with you at night.

850
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,325
I mean, I'd be in my office working,
obviously.

851
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,207
I can't help you with your tasks,

852
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,670
but I can stay up all night with you.

853
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,382
No, it's okay. I got it.

854
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,721
By the way,
there's something I want to ask you.

855
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,389
What is it?

856
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,185
I have one personal question
and one work-related question.

857
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,395
Well…

858
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,606
What's the personal one?

859
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,068
Can we go to the movies this weekend?

860
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,071
Of course, we can.

861
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,492
Now, the work-related question.

862
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:09,786
Well…

863
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,580
It's about Yeon-u.

864
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,416
The kid who died last fall.

865
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,460
Professor Lee Ji-yeong's patient.

866
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:19,712
Right.

867
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:26,093
Yeon-u's mother
has been visiting the hospital

868
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,013
since about a month after Yeon-u died.

869
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,894
Sometimes, she'd intentionally
book an appointment to visit us,

870
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,480
or she'd say she stopped by
because she was in the area.

871
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,068
She visits the hospital often
for no reason.

872
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,445
And she looks for me every time.

873
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,367
I get the feeling that
she has something to say to me,

874
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,328
but I can't figure out what it could be.

875
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:58,626
Should I politely ask her what it's about?

876
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:04,298
Or should I just continue
to feign ignorance like I'm doing now?

877
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,301
I don't know what to do.

878
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:18,020
She keeps visiting the hospital
because she wants to talk about Yeon-u.

879
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,402
There's no other reason.

880
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:31,200
No one else remembers her child, you know.

881
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,373
The relatives must have only met Yeon-u
once or twice.

882
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,210
And Yeon-u didn't go to day care,
so there are no teachers.

883
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,965
Yeon-u practically lived
in the hospital since birth,

884
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:51,470
so no one outside the hospital
remembers the kid.

885
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:57,977
As a mother,
she wants to talk about Yeon-u

886
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,688
but has no one to talk to…

887
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:07,153
except for the doctors and nurses
who took care of him for a long time.

888
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,159
She's grateful to you for all your help,

889
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,703
but she also wants to talk to you
about Yeon-u.

890
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,582
She might make you uncomfortable
or avoid the subject altogether,

891
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,585
but next time you see her,

892
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:27,131
go talk to her first and buy her
a cup of coffee or something.

893
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,221
No one keeps visiting forever.

894
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,641
She, too, will stop eventually.

895
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,770
Because we all have to forget and move on.

896
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,649
So just until then,

897
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,028
give her a warm welcome
whenever you see her.

898
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:51,822
Okay.

899
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,159
Let's eat.

900
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,390
No.

901
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,603
Come in. I can see you, you know.

902
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:23,562
Thank you.

903
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,416
Thank you.

904
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,500
No problem.

905
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,218
Professor Yang,
I guess it is winter indeed.

906
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,265
You're drinking hot coffee
instead of an iced Americano today.

907
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,894
I guess…

908
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,272
you're not scared of me at all.

909
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,942
I am. I'm really scared of you.

910
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,737
So, what's up?

911
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,905
I'm tired. I want to go home.

912
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,782
I have two questions for you.

913
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,411
-Just ask one.
-Just one?

914
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,997
Yes, just one question a day.

915
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:27,418
Only one a day. Then I'll answer it nicely
without getting angry.

916
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,504
What should I do?

917
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,675
What if the two questions
are combined into one?

918
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:35,760
No, you can't do that.

919
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,262
Okay.

920
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,558
Patient Kim Su-jeong…

921
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,643
The PROM patient who was admitted today.

922
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:50,107
What made you make such a decision
in that situation?

923
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,944
No one can guarantee
the treatment will be successful.

924
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,073
So why did you make that decision
knowing the chances are slim?

925
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,867
I was so impressed.

926
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:08,667
Well, I just wanted to help
the patient and her baby.

927
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:15,549
She felt her baby sooner
because she's on the slimmer side.

928
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:22,139
The fact that she can feel her baby
shows us the baby's will to live.

929
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:28,938
If both the mother and the baby
are determined to get through this,

930
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:34,652
I think helping them is the best choice
I can make in this situation

931
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,612
even though the chances are slim.

932
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,493
If…

933
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:48,999
something bad happens to the baby
and the mother as well…

934
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,335
What if her family blames you for it?

935
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,839
Aren't you afraid of that?

936
01:08:59,093 --> 01:08:59,927
I am.

937
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,306
I'm afraid too.

938
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,601
But if I think about that now,
I won't be able to do anything.

939
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,564
"What is the best I can do now?"

940
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,774
That's what I try to focus on.

941
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,909
Get going. It's past midnight.

942
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:25,911
I'm sorry.

943
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,920
-Professor Yang.
-Yeah?

944
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,297
It's past midnight.

945
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,632
I know. I'll go home soon.

946
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,176
No, it's not that.

947
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,764
It's a new day,
so I can ask you another question.

948
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,603
May I ask you the question of the day?

949
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:53,147
Sure.

950
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,232
What's your question?

951
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,234
Well…

952
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,697
It's about Professor Yoon Seon-ju
in Room 7109.

953
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,868
What's your relationship
with his daughter?

954
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,749
Rumors say she's your girlfriend.

955
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:12,917
She's my ex-wife.

956
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,380
Professor Yoon Seon-ju's daughter
is my ex-wife.

957
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,299
I see.

958
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,636
What are you doing tomorrow evening?

959
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,847
You don't have any surgeries
or outpatient appointments booked,

960
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,767
and I'm not working the night shift.

961
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,102
I have my band practice right after work.

962
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:33,896
But Professor Chae is in Sokcho now.

963
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,606
Song-hwa is in Seoul now.

964
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:38,234
She got a new car,
so she'll give us a ride…

965
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,739
Why am I telling you these things
right now?

966
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,033
Good night.

967
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,144
We picked the perfect song
for this rainy day.

968
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,397
Did you choose the song?

969
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,481
No.

970
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,567
I didn't know it'd rain.

971
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:23,904
Hey, everyone at the hospital's saying
you're seeing someone.

972
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,447
I don't care.

973
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,033
Are you sure you didn't spread the rumor?
It's so cold.

974
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,743
Why would I?

975
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,289
"She's his ex-wife, not girlfriend."

976
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,833
I'm debating whether or not
I should tell everyone.

977
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:40,004
Jeong-won, are you and Gyeo-ul
really not seeing each other?

978
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,338
Mind your own business.

979
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:46,802
Jun-wan's lovely dove is in the UK now.
He's in a long-distance relationship.

980
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,929
Really? Where in the UK?

981
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,390
I think she's in London.

982
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,474
London?

983
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,353
Don't tell me…

984
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,734
Ask her if she knows Ik-sun.

985
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,737
My sister's in London now, you know.

986
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,656
Oh, right. I'll ask her.

987
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,824
Okay.

988
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,661
Make sure you ask her.

989
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:16,040
My sister's always the life of the party,
so she may already know her.

990
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,292
-Okay, I'll ask her.
-Good.

991
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,627
-Don't forget.
-I won't.

992
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,172
-London is…
-Is that her car?

993
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,275
Nice car!

994
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,820
All right!

995
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,367
Get in the car!

996
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,749
It's raining a lot.

997
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,293
Let's wait for that car to move.
No need to rush.

998
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,836
We'll just watch the rain.

999
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,546
All right.

1000
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,048
Did you pick up the car today?

1001
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:08,050
Yesterday. I bought it with my own money.

1002
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,220
Obviously. Who buys a car
with someone else's money?

1003
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:20,104
You're not the type
to leave these things on, are you?

1004
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:23,857
Yes! I am! My gosh!

1005
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,235
I bought the car yesterday.
Why take this off?

1006
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,278
You have to take it off eventually.

1007
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,906
Hey, the hazard lights.
Let's move the car a little.

1008
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,040
Seriously. Did you have to do that?

1009
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,384
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

1010
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,719
Why do I always have to sit here?

1011
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,763
Jeez, he's at it again.

1012
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,433
Hey, keep your eyes on the screen.
Right here.

1013
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,935
It shows you everything you need to see.

1014
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:02,354
My gosh, you're right!

1015
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,273
This has been around for a long time.

1016
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:07,818
Lee Ik-jun, you sit here.
Sit in the middle for a change.

1017
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,570
No, the seat warmer is on now.

1018
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,488
You never sit in the middle.

1019
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,158
These guys have sat in the middle
once at least.

1020
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,325
But you, never.

1021
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,453
For me, this is the third time in a row!

1022
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,998
Jeez, that creepy jerk.
Is he a pervert or a genius?

1023
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:23,500
We'll go now.

1024
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,754
Ahn Jeong-won, can we go now?

1025
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,466
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mom? What should I eat for dinner?

1026
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,217
My friends and I will order in.

1027
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,428
Should I have kalguksu or fried chicken?

1028
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,305
How many chickens?

1029
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,891
You guys drive me nuts.

1030
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,144
I have to say, U-ju is much more mature
than these guys.

1031
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,869
My goodness.

1032
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,271
Hello.

1033
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,315
Oh, you're here. Just a moment, please.

1034
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:52,214
-You didn't bring an umbrella?
-No.

1035
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,258
Because I was coming to pick this up.

1036
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,886
Right, here.

1037
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,223
Oh, no. I'm the only one here now.

1038
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,809
Take it home
and enjoy it with your family.

1039
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:07,980
We already had one.
We also had seaweed soup this morning.

1040
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:12,693
We wished Yeon-u a happy birthday
and had the cake together.

1041
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:15,737
I got this for the Pediatric Surgery team.

1042
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,532
Still, I can't finish this whole cake
by myself.

1043
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:19,992
I'll eat the whole thing.

1044
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,662
-Hello, Dr. Jang.
-Hello.

1045
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,833
We'll accept the cake.
I can finish it alone.

1046
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,626
Well, okay.

1047
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,797
Are you working the night shift again?

1048
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,092
Gosh, you're always so busy.

1049
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:41,305
I've gotten the hang of it,
so I actually have more free time now.

1050
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,726
Make sure to look after yourself.

1051
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,272
You're busy.
Sorry for taking up your time.

1052
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,149
I'll be off, then.

1053
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:54,484
Ma'am.

1054
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:03,160
Would you like to have some coffee with me
if you're free now?

1055
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,583
It's my treat.

1056
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:14,838
Sure.

1057
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:52,584
I don't miss you anymore

1058
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:57,297
I don't even want to see you

1059
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:06,056
I'm even beginning to forget the fact
That we were in love

1060
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:10,769
Quietly

1061
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,358
I don't understand

1062
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,444
Why I feel this way

1063
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:23,865
I cry when it rains

1064
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:33,125
Just like the day I left you

1065
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:37,587
Many years ago

1066
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:46,263
I'm okay now

1067
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:50,934
I've given up on love

1068
01:18:53,812 --> 01:19:00,318
Why am I

1069
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:05,365
Crying like a fool?

1070
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:18,628
I visit too often, don't I?

1071
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:21,047
I'm sorry.

1072
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,051
My husband always asks me
why I keep coming here.

1073
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,599
For some strange reason,
I keep coming here.

1074
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,064
Ma'am.

1075
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,737
I can be very quiet and blunt.

1076
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,325
I'm not good with words.

1077
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,369
And I don't know what to say
to console others.

1078
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:59,294
But if you ever want to talk about
or miss Yeon-u ,

1079
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:02,047
feel free to visit me anytime.

1080
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:07,844
Thank you.

1081
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:11,848
I know as much about Yeon-u as you do.

1082
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,186
You won't find anyone
who understands you better.

1083
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:18,980
Right.

1084
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,069
Dr. Jang.

1085
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,657
Whenever I come here,

1086
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:33,286
people call me Yeon-u's mom.

1087
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:39,793
I love hearing that.

1088
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,091
Now that Yeon-u is no longer with us,

1089
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:50,345
no one knows that I'm Yeon-u's mom.

1090
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:53,807
But when I come here,

1091
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,728
everyone calls me Yeon-u's mom.

1092
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:04,067
People tell me

1093
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,612
that I should put behind

1094
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,075
such painful memories and move on,

1095
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:15,120
but I don't want to…

1096
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,456
lose Yeon-u so soon.

1097
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:24,838
That poor thing lived such a short life.

1098
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:32,137
I want to remember Yeon-u
for as long as I can.

1099
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,146
Oh, and…

1100
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:46,943
Here.

1101
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:54,743
I thought maybe I shouldn't give it to you
because it's embarrassing,

1102
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,039
but I still wanted
to express my gratitude.

1103
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:11,343
The faint memories
That I vaguely remember now

1104
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:15,722
They truly broke my heart

1105
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:24,898
I hate you

1106
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,612
But I still miss you

1107
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:38,620
I'm okay now

1108
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:42,374
I've given up on love

1109
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:52,050
Why am I

1110
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:57,889
Crying like a fool?

1111
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:05,355
I know you won't come back to me

1112
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:09,109
I hate myself
For still being hung up on you

1113
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:18,702
How much longer

1114
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:24,833
Will my heart ache?

1115
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:32,048
I'm okay now

1116
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:35,927
I've given up on love

1117
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:45,395
Why am I

1118
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:51,359
Crying like a fool?

1119
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:58,616
Why am I crying?

1120
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,850
-We're off.
-I'll drive you guys home.

1121
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,438
I said, I can drive you home.

1122
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,232
It's okay. We can take a cab.

1123
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,567
Just drive Ik-jun home.

1124
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:34,694
Yes, please!

1125
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:41,326
Song-hwa, if you hook up your phone
to your car,

1126
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,704
you can listen to music loudly
while driving. Try it.

1127
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:47,415
I always listen to music when I drive.

1128
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,585
That's called Bluetooth.

1129
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,922
I know that.

1130
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,674
Drive safely to Sokcho.

1131
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,385
-Will do. Bye.
-Bye.

1132
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:02,097
Gosh, I'm getting sleepy.

1133
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,849
-Drive safely. See you on the weekend.
-Okay.

1134
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,102
-Bye, Ik-jun.
-Bye, enjoy.

1135
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,446
He wants to watch New Journey to the West.

1136
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:21,032
I know that much.

1137
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:28,289
-Where's your car?
-Right in front.

1138
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,584
-Shall we?
-Okay.

1139
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:55,775
Should we put the radio on?

1140
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:58,611
Put on that song.

1141
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,114
The song we practiced earlier.

1142
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:02,323
Sure.

1143
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:08,640
Hey, what's up?

1144
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,809
Is everything okay? I have surgery.

1145
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,313
Do you have plans for this evening?
Let's have dinner together.

1146
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:18,942
I won't be out of the OR
until around 8 p.m.

1147
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,986
That's fine.
I'll come to the hospital around eight.

1148
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,906
All right, sure.

1149
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:26,366
I'll see you later.

1150
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:57,647
-Hey.
-Where are you?

1151
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,732
-The Operating Unit.
-I'll call you back.

1152
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:03,278
It's fine. They're still getting ready.
I came down early.

1153
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,822
I'm waiting in the lounge now.
Where are you?

1154
01:28:05,905 --> 01:28:07,824
Me? I'm at Yulje.

1155
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,993
What? Why are you back?

1156
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:12,161
You wanted to take it easy and recuperate.

1157
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,664
Why do you keep coming to Seoul?
Cut down on work.

1158
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:16,749
Just say no. Should I do it for you?

1159
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,003
I heard you. I'll take care of it.

1160
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,173
Ik-jun, when will you be done
with the surgery?

1161
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:28,094
Me? Around eight or nine? Why do you ask?

1162
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:30,179
I'll come to your office around then.

1163
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:34,809
Really? Okay. Then do what you need to do.
I'll call you when I'm out.

1164
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:37,353
Or, go home and get some rest.
I'll stop by later.

1165
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,731
No, I'll come to your office.

1166
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:45,153
I can find things to do to kill time,
so just do a good job with the surgery.

1167
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,072
I always do a good job.
All right, see you later.

1168
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,240
All right.

1169
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,088
We could have gone somewhere else.

1170
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,883
The food here is good.

1171
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,763
By the way, what's up? Is everything okay?

1172
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:15,808
You keep asking if everything's okay.

1173
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,895
Everything's fine.
My father's doing well too.

1174
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,897
Everything is fine.

1175
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:24,025
Then why are you here?

1176
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:29,322
I wanted to have dinner with you.

1177
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,661
I came here to have dinner with you.

1178
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:40,583
Let's…

1179
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:45,129
meet up like this and have dinner together
once in a while.

1180
01:29:47,381 --> 01:29:49,133
Can we do that?

1181
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:17,829
Are you done?

1182
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,039
Yes, I'm done. Where are you?

1183
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,916
I'm hungry.

1184
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,876
I'll come to you. Where are you now?

1185
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,545
No, I'll come to you.

1186
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,171
Stay in your office.

1187
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,161
Take a seat.

1188
01:30:58,786 --> 01:30:59,787
It's okay.

1189
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,582
I'll keep it short and get going.

1190
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,129
I want to give you my answer.

1191
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:10,923
Answer to what?

1192
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:13,926
The question you asked me in Sokcho.

1193
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:36,449
Don't tell her how you feel.

1194
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:46,167
I don't think you should tell her
how you feel about her.

1195
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,339
You said you've known her for a long time.

1196
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,718
If you tell her,
things will get really awkward.

1197
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:03,351
"I want us to stay best friends.

1198
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,481
I want things to stay
the way they are now."

1199
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,192
She'll probably say that.

1200
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,327
If I were you…

1201
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:24,538
I wouldn't tell her.

1202
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,841
Don't ask me for advice
on stuff like this.

1203
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:38,469
I'm off.

1204
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:04,096
-Professor, did you hear?
-About what?

1205
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:07,641
They asked for the best neurosurgeon
at our hospital.

1206
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,643
And Song-hwa was chosen.

1207
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,063
Send them over to me right away.

1208
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:15,941
I had five phone calls about it.
I need to work harder.

1209
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:17,318
-Free this weekend?
-Why?

1210
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,402
-We need to talk.
-Talk.

1211
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,154
A professor's card? Is it yours?

1212
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,114
Love's in the air in GS.

1213
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,533
-Take it easy.
-What's with the flowers?

1214
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,577
-Professor.
-You startled me.

1215
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,537
-What's going on?
-What?

1216
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,498
I need answers when I'm curious.

1217
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:36,295
Our goal is to get the baby out safely,
so double-check everything.

1218
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:39,090
Obstetrics.

1219
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,716
Studying your textbooks again?

1220
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,593
I can feel something running…

1221
01:34:42,676 --> 01:34:45,805
Her condition seems to have gotten worse
since coming here.

1222
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:47,431
I came all this way
because of a recommendation.

1223
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:50,184
That doubtful look in her eyes…

1224
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:51,143
Gosh.

1225
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:55,231
The way she looks at me
screams that she doesn't trust me.

1226
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:59,068
Countless people die
because they can't find donors.

1227
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:01,320
Nothing's going my way.

1228
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,655
I don't think…

1229
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:05,825
his heart can hold out any longer.

1230
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:11,747
