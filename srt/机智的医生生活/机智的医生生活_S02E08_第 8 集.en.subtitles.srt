1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,459
Didn't you say you'd be home late?

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,921
Some stuff happened.

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,841
What about the reunion?

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,551
It ended early.

5
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,493
What happened?

6
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,246
It's nothing.

7
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,962
Is everything okay with you?

8
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,215
Yes, I'm fine.

9
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
I'm going to wash up.

10
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,479
Okay.

11
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,155
DOOR CODE 0720
1ST KID BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY 8

12
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,639
What's all this?

13
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,476
Eggs, obviously.

14
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,063
Chicken eggs. Here, have this.

15
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,148
Are you working out again?

16
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,942
Yes, I'm trying to build muscle.

17
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,819
Take it easy.

18
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,613
I can take care of myself.

19
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,450
Forget muscles. You'll just fart nonstop
if you eat this many eggs every day.

20
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,036
Anything related
to my farts is top secret.

21
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,085
-In case of an invasion,
-Don't tell me…

22
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,504
it will be used
as a weapon in the gas operation--

23
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,299
Hey, what an ancient joke.
Get with the times.

24
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,677
It's true.

25
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,888
It's true.

26
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,314
Don't teach U-ju weird stuff.

27
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,359
Why would I? I'm busy. Here.

28
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,028
-Dad.
-Yes.

29
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,405
Look at me.

30
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,168
U-ju, the shuttle bus
should be here now. Let's go.

31
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,920
Auntie.

32
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,299
Auntie, U-ju is heading out now.

33
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,967
Come on. Let's go.

34
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,138
This isn't a freeze-frame.

35
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,225
-How are you getting to Yangjae?
-The subway, of course.

36
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,893
It's quick. I'll listen to some music.

37
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,105
Right, I'll be back in two weeks
for another training session.

38
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,107
Take the express train.

39
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,192
I prefer the bus.
They turn off the lights.

40
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,528
And I'll be coming
on a weekday after work,

41
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,072
so I won't be able
to take the train anyway.

42
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,615
I'll take the premium night bus.

43
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,659
Shall we, Doctor?

44
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,286
Please drop me off at the station.

45
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,748
All right. Let's go, Major Fart.

46
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,588
Go easy on those eggs.
Too much of anything is bad.

47
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,672
I know.

48
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,299
No fevers these days?

49
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,385
No. Even when I have one,
I take my medication and it goes away.

50
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,386
Stop worrying.

51
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,847
What? Stop making me worry, then.

52
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,809
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

53
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,894
-Hey.
-Professor.

54
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,812
We have an emergency patient.

55
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,524
A 61-year-old male, received
a liver transplant at Yulje last February.

56
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,736
The ultrasound shows
aortic valve endocarditis with AR.

57
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm in the lobby now.
I'll go straight to the ER.

58
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,032
So I said…

59
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,159
Professor Kim!

60
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,410
-Gosh.
-Professor Kim!

61
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,454
He didn't see you.

62
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,247
Are you that excited to see him?

63
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,417
Yes, I think Professor Kim is so adorable.

64
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,921
I want to put him in my pocket
and carry him around all day.

65
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,217
It looked like he got a call from the ER.

66
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,719
If it's surgery,
he'll call me in five minutes.

67
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,888
If not, he'll take care of it
with Chang-min.

68
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,557
Dr. Chu, I guess
you have lots of time this morning.

69
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,185
You're going to
the convenience store with this couple.

70
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,437
I'm working the night shift again today.

71
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,481
I should at least brush my teeth.

72
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
I'm going
because I've run out of toothpaste.

73
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,112
And I have a conference in ten minutes.
I'm a busy lady.

74
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,115
By the way,
what's your makeup theme today?

75
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,076
This is a spring warm tone makeup.

76
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,704
-What tone?
-Spring warm tone.

77
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,705
I see.

78
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,210
According to the personal color analysis,
that's my color, just like Park Bo-young.

79
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,379
-Park Bo-gum?
-No, Park Bo-young.

80
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,506
The epitome of the spring warm tone.

81
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,216
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,844
-That's not your tone.
-Yes, it is.

83
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,054
I think you're more like…

84
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,265
Boom, the comedian!

85
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,813
-We should…
-We're tight on time.

86
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,314
We're off.

87
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,861
Yes.

88
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,198
Okay, I'll go check now. All right.

89
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,909
Dr. Do.

90
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,580
That was so funny.

91
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,875
I was about to get angry,
but it's all gone now.

92
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,169
That was hilarious. My gosh.

93
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,212
I have to go to the ward. See you.

94
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
See you.

95
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,593
Well…

96
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,348
We checked the MRI results.
Thankfully, it's not a complicated case.

97
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,351
We can proceed
with the surgery next week as planned.

98
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,646
I see. By the way,

99
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,859
you will be performing
the surgery yourself, right?

100
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,614
Yes. Of course,
I'll be performing it myself.

101
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,951
I'm the only surgeon here who can
perform pediatric surgeries.

102
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,036
I see.

103
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,121
-Mom.
-Yes.

104
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,333
What time will the surgery begin?

105
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,293
I haven't been informed of the time yet.

106
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,087
We don't know
the exact time until the day before.

107
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,798
Your doctor will tell you
when you check in next week.

108
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,259
Right, okay.

109
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,015
And Doctor. Well, hold on…

110
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,809
Let me see.

111
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,562
Okay.

112
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,483
I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

113
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,196
I didn't even know what a bile duct was.

114
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,616
But now that I know
it'll also affect his intestines,

115
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,118
I'm just so worried about this surgery.
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,373
Don't be. If my kid was undergoing
a big surgical procedure,

117
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,375
I'd be asking a bunch of questions too.

118
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,256
Well, I've already answered
the first two questions.

119
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,260
The third one. He'll stay here
for about a week after the surgery.

120
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,637
The fourth question.

121
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,974
As for scarring, it's all case by case.

122
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,103
But the scar will fade away with time,
so don't worry too much.

123
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,521
The fifth one.

124
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,984
If the surgery goes well,
there won't be a recurrence.

125
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,530
So he'll be able to go to school
and grow up like any other healthy kid.

126
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,534
The sixth question. Oh, tae kwon do.

127
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,787
He can do it
about a month after the surgery.

128
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,332
-But be careful with strenuous movements.
-Okay.

129
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,875
The seventh question is…

130
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,096
Mr. Jang's guardian?
Professor Kim is here.

131
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,433
Okay. You stay here with Dad, Mom.

132
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,851
Keep an eye on Dad.

133
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,699
-Professor Kim.
-Hello.

134
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,994
It does look like a case of
endocarditis, as we expected.

135
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,206
In your father's case,
the inflammation is in the aortic valve.

136
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,334
What caused it?

137
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,295
Well, we're using
immunosuppressive agents,

138
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,924
which might have made him
more susceptible to endocarditis.

139
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,011
However, I can't really say
that was what caused it

140
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,931
because endocarditis can occur in patients
who aren't taking immunosuppressive drugs.

141
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,560
Does he need surgery?

142
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,563
Yes, he does.

143
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,490
The inflammation has
caused the aortic valve to be deformed,

144
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,326
so the valve
doesn't close tightly and leaks blood.

145
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,787
This condition is called
"aortic regurgitation."

146
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,622
The blood pumped out of the heart

147
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,833
keeps leaking backward into the heart.

148
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,502
That's why he's out of breath.

149
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,546
And the bacteria in the valve

150
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,799
could get into the bloodstream anytime.

151
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,218
If they travel to the brain
and block a vein there,

152
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,552
it may result in a stroke.

153
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,473
We've put him on antibiotics,
but he needs surgery fast.

154
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,559
I only have morning appointments tomorrow,

155
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,687
so we should be able to do it
tomorrow afternoon or evening.

156
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,692
The doctor will go through the details
once he's checked in.

157
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,028
Okay. Thank you, Professor Kim.

158
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm glad you brought him
to the ER quickly.

159
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,077
Did you bring him from Mokpo
in that state?

160
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,290
No. Thankfully, we had an appointment
booked with the liver transplant surgeon,

161
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,584
so we arrived in Seoul last night.

162
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,965
Yulje Medical Center
saved my father's life twice.

163
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,554
Anyway, please take
good care of my father.

164
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,889
Of course. Talk soon.

165
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,604
Order all the lab tests
and call Anesthesiology and HPB Surgery.

166
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,689
Got it.

167
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,650
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

168
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,612
Then I'll see you again in three months.

169
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,947
In three months?

170
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,783
Can we make it four months?

171
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,494
Well, then…

172
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,872
How about 3.5 months?

173
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,249
Okay, thank you.

174
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,710
I'll see you again in 14 weeks.

175
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,671
If everything looks good,
then we can make it four months.

176
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,716
Sounds good, Professor Lee.
I'll be off, then.

177
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
Take care.

178
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,599
Let's have lunch.

179
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,934
I have plans for lunch.

180
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,021
My goodness. I have plans too.

181
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,399
-Enjoy your lunch.
-You too.

182
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,070
We ran some tests because
your amniotic fluid index is borderline,

183
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,157
but everything looks okay now.

184
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:08,162
The amniotic fluid index becomes
even more important close to the due date,

185
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,915
and since it's still borderline,

186
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:16,212
we should check again
in three to four days instead of a week.

187
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,089
Today is Monday, right?

188
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,259
We'll check it again this Friday.

189
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,220
Okay.

190
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,597
Earlier, you said
the fetal movement is good.

191
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:32,061
If it drops from ten to five,
come to the hospital right away.

192
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,813
But if the baby is playing fine,
I'll see you on Friday.

193
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,567
Okay. I hope I won't need
to see you before Friday.

194
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,361
I know, me too.

195
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,821
Then we'll see you on Friday.

196
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,657
All right.

197
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,539
Are we done for the morning?

198
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,831
Yes.

199
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,960
Let's go for lunch, Seon-jin.

200
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,295
Would you like to join us?

201
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,381
No, I've got plans.

202
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,428
DINOSAUR RIDGE
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS? I PICKED UP TTEOKBOKKI

203
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,055
Enjoy your lunch.

204
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,139
You too.

205
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,731
LEE IK-JUN

206
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,901
Hey, I'm coming now.

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,702
Hey, are you all right?

208
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,123
I was so worried.

209
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,002
I'm sorry, Professor. I've been
all over the place. I'm fine though.

210
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,420
Have you had lunch yet?

211
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,840
Hold on, Gyeo-ul. Don't hang up.

212
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,844
I'm relieved now that
I'm hearing your voice.

213
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,599
You're really okay, right?

214
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,225
Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,146
My mom wasn't doing so well,
but she's okay now.

216
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,316
What's wrong with her? Bring her to Yulje.

217
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,737
She tripped and fell
and hurt herself pretty badly.

218
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,990
She has a broken rib
and a few other fractures.

219
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,451
How did she fall that
she ended up with a broken rib?

220
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,119
And where are the other fractures?

221
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,706
Which hospital in Gwangju?
Who's the professor there?

222
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,041
Should I come now?

223
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,627
It's the biggest hospital in Gwangju,

224
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,421
and the professor
in charge is very thorough.

225
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:26,425
Besides, you can't come all the way here.
You're fully booked with surgeries.

226
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,847
Did you eat?

227
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,183
Yes, I had some food here with my mom.

228
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,979
Did you sleep there? At the hospital?

229
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,107
Yes, my brother and I are taking turns.

230
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,569
-Professor.
-Yes.

231
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,739
I may not be able to call you often.

232
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,201
I probably won't be able to
text you back right away too.

233
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,621
It's okay. I got to hear your voice today,
so it's all good.

234
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm fine,

235
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,001
so don't worry about me.
Just take good care of your mom.

236
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,295
Okay. I'm sorry.

237
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,631
You don't have to be.

238
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,928
It must be very stressful.
I'm sorry there isn't anything I can do.

239
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,810
Gyeo-ul, are you okay with me texting you?
You don't need to text me back.

240
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,938
I'll stop if you find it distracting.

241
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,900
I'll be totally fine,

242
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,194
so feel free to tell me if it bothers you.

243
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,656
You can text me anytime. I like it because

244
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:35,452
it helps me escape reality,
even for just a moment.

245
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,579
All right.

246
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,791
I won't text you too often.
Just once a day.

247
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,044
Gyeo-ul.

248
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,464
You're really okay, right?

249
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,259
Yes, I'm fine. Everything's good.

250
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,429
My mom's looking for me.
I'll call you back later.

251
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
Okay.

252
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,658
DONGDAEMUN TTEOKBOKKI

253
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,750
What? A whole container per person?
Who placed the order?

254
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,878
Your friend Piggy number one, obviously.

255
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,798
One, two, three, four.
Who's going to eat all this food?

256
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,471
Is someone else coming?

257
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,891
No, just come and eat. This is all for us.

258
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,978
I must say,
check out this well-curated selection.

259
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,105
"Mild" for our mild,
gentle boy, Jeong-won.

260
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,774
"Spicy" for Piggy one and two.

261
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,860
And "Beginner's level"
for Muggles like us.

262
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,070
What is a Muggle?

263
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,285
-You don't know either?
-Shut up, Malfoy!

264
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,998
Who's Malfoy? Is Malfoy a Muggle?

265
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,501
You really don't know?

266
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,419
Well, it sounds familiar.

267
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,005
What kind of world
do you live in, Jun-wan?

268
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,258
What kind of question is that?
I live in the 21st century.

269
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,052
So who's Malfoy?

270
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,764
The new deputy director.

271
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,016
-That's why the name sounds familiar.
-I see.

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,102
His name is Foy, and his surname is Ma.

273
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,646
Liar.

274
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,191
You're so mean.

275
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,194
What's wrong with not knowing?
Don't make fun of him.

276
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,571
It's a rookie boy group.

277
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,450
A new boy band that just debuted.

278
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,043
You jerks.

279
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,093
I can't believe
you've never watched that movie.

280
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,511
You're a weirdo.

281
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,139
-He only watches superhero movies.
-Harry is a hero too.

282
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,723
Stop watching so many movies.

283
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,934
I want the mild flavor.

284
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,312
Yes. Mild for our mild, gentle boy!

285
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,692
How's Gyeo-ul?
Is everything okay with her?

286
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,862
Yes, she's okay. I talked to her just now.
She sounded fine.

287
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,613
Was she not feeling well?

288
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,992
She's off until this Thursday
due to some family stuff.

289
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,952
I'm surprised her chief let her.

290
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,456
They're booked up with surgeries
this week, and Se-hyeok isn't here.

291
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,294
Gyeo-ul has hardly taken any time off.

292
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,337
That's why her chief approved it.

293
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,549
She got the go-ahead as soon as
she said she'd be back Friday morning.

294
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,217
They're busy that day.

295
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,553
This is why
a good reputation is so important.

296
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,680
By the way,
where's the owner of this office?

297
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,806
Is Song-hwa in surgery?

298
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,683
Today is Monday.

299
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,893
Is it the thesis day?

300
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,478
That's on Thursdays.
She has a lab meeting today.

301
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,441
Right, the national research project.
It must have begun.

302
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,359
Yes. She should be here now though.

303
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,946
Hey, how many people is she helping
with their theses?

304
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,449
Seok-min, Seon-bin.

305
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,576
Eight residents,
two in every residency year.

306
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,494
And a clinical professor. 11 in total.

307
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,375
She meets with all of them on Thursdays,
30 minutes per person.

308
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,462
When does she have time
to do all that? Is she a superwoman?

309
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,465
Rumor has it that
she's the corresponding author

310
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,218
of all the theses and journals
that come out of NS.

311
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,016
I'm going to eat
one whole container by myself, okay?

312
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,561
Okay, we heard you loud and clear.
Just come and eat.

313
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,949
My appointments will start soon.
I should get going.

314
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,285
I'm free this evening, Jeong-won.

315
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,746
If dinner's on you, I should be there.

316
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,667
Bye, guys.

317
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,876
All right, see you.

318
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,506
I'm free too.

319
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,178
Jeong-won, you're… Jeez.

320
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,099
Just one barbecue dinner a month?
Don't you think that's a little too cheap?

321
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,643
Guys, don't you agree?
I mean, let's be honest.

322
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:15,607
Think about all the time and effort
we pour into the VIP Ward.

323
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,694
So I think we deserve
one free dinner a week.

324
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,988
-That's my point.
-Hey, you're running late.

325
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,115
I have to go.

326
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,415
When is the ER sending the patient?

327
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,000
They're sending her up now.

328
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,795
Then I'll take care of it.
You two should go eat something.

329
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,797
No, let's go together.

330
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,173
We can't.

331
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,427
Whoever can take a break now
should go have dinner before we get busy.

332
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,012
Go on.

333
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,264
-Okay.
-Okay. Let's go.

334
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,476
-Hello.
-Have some ice cream.

335
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
-We'll go have dinner first.
-Okay.

336
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,064
-What's the ice cream for?
-It's our appetizer.

337
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,316
Hong-do bought it for us.

338
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,484
I see. Thanks so much.

339
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,778
Is today a special day?

340
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,031
No. Everyone buys me treats all the time.

341
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,371
The three of us are on night duty again.

342
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,211
It's so quiet here today, Ms. Han.
Where is everyone?

343
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,839
They went to get dinner. Let's eat later.

344
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,717
Okay. Let's wait
until it dies down at the cafeteria.

345
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,264
By the way, this is just my hunch.

346
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,185
But don't you think
it will be quiet tonight?

347
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,770
That would be nice.

348
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,398
Something tells me
that we won't get a single call.

349
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,984
No emergency calls
and nothing from our patients either.

350
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:46,323
I get the feeling that
this will be the quietest night ever.

351
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:50,619
Do you have
any patient-related superstitions?

352
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,206
Me? No, I don't.

353
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:59,503
Maybe just the one that has been
passed down for generations?

354
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,756
-What is that?
-Don't you know?

355
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:08,261
If you eat anything
that your junior bought,

356
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,139
the hospital will be
rammed with patients that night.

357
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,142
They'll literally fall
from the sky nonstop.

358
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,060
Right, Ms. Han?

359
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,327
Hong-do.

360
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,789
Don't tell me

361
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,166
you bought this for everyone

362
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,961
with your own money. Did you?

363
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,006
What should we do, Dr. Chu?

364
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,510
-Yes.
-What's your bank account number?

365
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,012
I'll send you the money right now.
Come on, quick!

366
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,016
-Hurry.
-Hold on. It's… What was it?

367
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,143
Hurry!

368
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,981
Hello, this is OB-GYN.

369
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,192
This is Malgeum OB-GYN Clinic.
We'd like to transfer a patient to you.

370
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,069
A PPH patient.

371
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,321
I'll have you talk to our doctor.

372
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,949
Hello, this is Dr. Chu.

373
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,702
Can we transfer
a patient to you? It's urgent.

374
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,580
Her baby was quite big,
but the delivery itself was quick.

375
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,292
No uterine contractions.
We've sutured her cervical laceration,

376
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,335
but the bleeding is still severe overall.

377
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,010
Thank goodness
Professor Yang is still here.

378
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,929
Yes, he always stays late
when he has outpatient appointments.

379
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,017
He spends a lot of time with each patient.

380
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,895
Who's on duty this evening?
Professor Han Seul-gi?

381
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,023
Yes, in Gynecology.
Professor Han asked Professor Yang

382
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,275
to take care of it
upon hearing the details.

383
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,986
Is he done with his appointments?
Can he come now?

384
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,947
Yes, he'll come as soon as
he's done with his last appointment.

385
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,452
-Hello?
-This is the ER.

386
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,163
The patient just arrived.
You can come down now.

387
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,748
Okay, I'm coming now.

388
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,172
-Dr. Chu, over there.
-Thank you.

389
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,257
My gosh.

390
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,199
-Please get ready for an ultrasound.
-Got it.

391
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,041
-Hello?
-Professor.

392
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,668
We haven't done an ultrasound yet.

393
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,963
A primiparity patient, age 28. She had
a speedy delivery at a private clinic.

394
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,840
They've sutured her cervical laceration.

395
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,761
The fundus is firm,
but the lower segment isn't contracting.

396
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,554
The vitals are unstable.

397
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,140
I examined her with the speculum,
and she bled a lot.

398
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
She's already drowsy.

399
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,852
Embolization may not be enough.

400
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,938
-Please excuse me for a moment.
-Sure.

401
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,149
Was the laceration severe?

402
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,362
With the ultrasound, check for bleeding
behind the abdominal cavity.

403
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,155
Patients with cervical lacerations

404
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,450
often have additional lacerations
in the lower segment.

405
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,203
It could be a retroperitoneal hematoma,
so look carefully.

406
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,250
Min-ha, it may not show up
on the ultrasound. Do a CT scan quickly.

407
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,543
Okay, got it.

408
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,878
You should hurry.

409
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,631
Yes, after I go over
everything with you though.

410
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,932
Her vitals? What's her pulse now?

411
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,018
Her BP is 73 over 47. Pulse is 128.

412
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,102
And hemoglobin?

413
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,272
We checked her CBC after
giving her four units of packed RBCs.

414
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,065
It was 5.4.

415
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,526
What's the platelet count?
Is the DIC severe?

416
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,569
It's 50,000.

417
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,738
The ultrasound?
Any bleeding in the abdomen?

418
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,574
-I couldn't really see.
-And the retroperitoneum?

419
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,660
A 5 × 6cm hematoma is suspected.

420
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,748
I see a laceration all the way down there.

421
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,291
That vein is lacerated.

422
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,210
She must be losing a lot of blood.
Her BP has dropped further.

423
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,963
-She's getting oxytocin, right?
-Yes.

424
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,716
Should we get ready for a hysterectomy?

425
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,426
SURGERY TO REMOVE THE UTERUS

426
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,721
This was her first birth?

427
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,014
Yes.

428
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,641
Let's try suturing this spot again.

429
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,560
Let's try one more time

430
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,147
-before we remove it.
-Okay.

431
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,192
Pass me the Allis and suture too.

432
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,279
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

433
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,992
Good work, everyone.

434
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,327
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

435
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,705
Well done, Professor Yang.
You even took care of the skin.

436
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,957
We got this done so quickly.

437
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,542
The patient was unstable,

438
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,961
so I figured it'd be best
to finish it quickly.

439
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,297
Well done, everyone.

440
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,176
Hey, Yoon-hee.
Let's keep her in the ICU tonight.

441
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,388
Book a bed in the ICU
and let me know when she's there.

442
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,639
Yes, sir.

443
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,768
-Min-ha, is her husband outside?
-Yes.

444
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,983
I'm so relieved, Professor.

445
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,735
About what?

446
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,823
If we had to remove her uterus,
I wouldn't be able to face her husband.

447
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,701
Even if we explained
that we had no other choice,

448
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,662
he wouldn't get it. He'd be so upset.

449
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,205
Thank goodness, seriously.

450
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,374
No, I don't think so.

451
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,296
I'm sure he would have understood
and said it was okay.

452
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,342
She's his wife,
and this is about his family.

453
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,221
I'm sure he's thought about
the situation more than we have.

454
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,598
Right.

455
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,893
Don't you think he'd know

456
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,647
that saving her life
would be more important to us

457
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,776
than whether or not
we can save her uterus?

458
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,239
Right, I'm sorry.

459
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:20,300
Doctor, did the surgery go well?
My wife is okay, right?

460
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,969
Yes, the surgery went well.

461
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,805
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-My gosh.

462
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,849
A laceration
in the lower part of the uterus

463
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,561
caused by the baby moving down
also resulted in a ruptured vein,

464
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,189
so we stitched it up
and stopped the bleed.

465
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,149
We made sure the bleeding had stopped

466
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:40,236
and waited until her BP and pulse
were back within the normal range.

467
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,654
I see, thank you.

468
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,907
But she lost a lot of blood,

469
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,326
so we'll keep her in the ICU tonight.

470
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,410
Okay.

471
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,539
Thank goodness she was
quickly transferred to us from the clinic.

472
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,083
They handled the situation very well.

473
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,877
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

474
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,587
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Professor.

475
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,007
In case of a speedy delivery, the cervix…

476
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,052
The lower, narrow part of the uterus
should open up slowly,

477
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,762
so if it's forced to open abruptly,

478
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,598
it can occasionally
result in cervical tears.

479
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,810
In this case, there was a uterine rupture

480
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:17,065
in the lower segment,
which resulted in heavy bleeding.

481
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,361
She lost a lot of blood,
and her BP dropped during the surgery,

482
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,780
so we even considered removing her uterus.

483
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,368
But we managed to get it under control
and didn't have to go that route.

484
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,787
No, she was on the verge of death.

485
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,915
That's all I cared about.
I didn't even think about the uterus.

486
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,252
I just want my wife to be healthy.
That's all I wish for.

487
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,628
Thank God she's okay.

488
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,258
Thank you so much, Professor.

489
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,844
Thank you. Thank you very much.

490
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,514
Then when can we see her?

491
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,725
Oh, we'll move her to the ICU right away.

492
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,395
You can see her once it's all sorted out.

493
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,438
-Thank you.
-All right, then.

494
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,442
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

495
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,236
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

496
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,455
I'm sorry, Professor.
Why am I so narrow-minded?

497
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,625
I have a lot to learn as a doctor
and as a person too.

498
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,753
Just don't make the same mistake again.

499
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,341
Isn't it a bit much to criticize yourself
over something like this?

500
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,221
It's okay. You're building experience.

502
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:35,268
It's a good experience to learn
to think from their perspective first.

503
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,645
Don't do that again, okay?

504
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,772
Learn from your mistakes.

505
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,859
Okay, I will. I'm sorry.

506
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,612
I have to go. I'm late for dinner.

507
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,780
-Take it easy.
-Thank you.

508
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,332
I'm so upset.

509
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,966
Rosa, you need a new kimchi fridge.

510
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,177
It's not cold at all.

511
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,846
It's just like a drawer. My goodness.

512
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,476
Why bother? I don't have
that many years left to live.

513
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,687
Buy one now
just to use it for a few years?

514
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,231
It's okay.

515
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,361
I know plenty of people
who often forget their door code.

516
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,907
Just let it go.
The sooner you let it go, the better.

517
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,909
Jong-su, do you think…

518
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,622
I have Alzheimer's?

519
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,251
I'm too scared to see a doctor.

520
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,757
What? Alzheimer's?
It's not something that happens overnight.

521
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,261
I've been forgetful for a while now.

522
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:58,518
Last week,
I drove downtown to go to the pharmacy.

523
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,396
But on my way back,

524
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,316
I suddenly got lost.

525
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,366
I take the same route every day.

526
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,077
I know it like the back of my hand.

527
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,371
But…

528
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,791
my mind suddenly went blank.

529
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,297
I struggled to get home
even with my GPS on.

530
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,305
What's wrong with me? It's getting worse.

531
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,101
What should I do?

532
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,231
You should go
to the hospital and get tested.

533
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,445
I'm going to
a different hospital, not Yulje.

534
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,530
Nonsense.

535
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,617
Your son is a doctor.
Do you want to embarrass him?

536
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,871
Also, what will Jeong-won say
if he finds out later?

537
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,124
That sweet boy will cry his eyes out.

538
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,755
I'll book an appointment
for you through Mr. Kettle.

539
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,923
You should tell Jeong-won right away.

540
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,426
Don't book it yet.

541
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,262
And don't say anything to Jeong-won.

542
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,184
I'll tell him.

543
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,897
I'll tell Jeong-won
and go see a doctor, but I…

544
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,693
Give me a few days to think.

545
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,450
Okay. I can wait a few days.

546
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,828
Just a few days though.

547
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,164
Hey, let's make it a week.

548
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:48,586
I'll give you a week to think.
Then I'm taking you to the hospital.

549
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,587
Okay?

550
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,255
All right.

551
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,884
Eat up.

552
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,513
My gosh, what kind of soup is this?

553
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,974
Your favorite
soybean paste soup, obviously.

554
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,229
I put in some dried radish greens.
Do you like it?

555
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,357
Yes, it's good.
I can easily have two bowls of this.

556
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,819
Hey, Rosa.

557
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,614
How about you get back into it?

558
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,451
-What?
-The thing you devoted your youth to.

559
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,370
At this age?

560
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,913
Why not?

561
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,333
It's the perfect age
to start anything new.

562
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,670
I'm too old. People will speak ill of me.

563
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,965
Who cares?

564
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,844
It's not like I'm telling you
to go to college or get a job with it.

565
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,930
If you want to do it, go ahead.
Why worry what others might think?

566
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,975
It doesn't look good to do
everything you want to do at this age.

567
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,268
People will badmouth me.

568
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,729
I want to age gracefully,
so I don't want to do it.

569
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,654
Do you want more?

570
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,283
Yes, I want to mix it with rice.
Give me a bigger bowl this time.

571
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,495
No, don't worry. I'll get it myself.

572
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,459
It's in the lower cabinet.

573
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,627
I know.

574
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,437
Hey, piggies.

575
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,605
-What?
-What?

576
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:35,443
You're making him uncomfortable
by staring at the grill so intensely.

577
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,486
How embarrassing. Can you stop staring?

578
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,907
They won't even answer me.

579
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,451
It's okay. I'll grill some kimchi too.

580
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,461
Where's Seok-hyeong?

581
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,547
He's almost here.
He said he had emergency surgery.

582
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,508
Really? Let's talk about it
when everyone's here.

583
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,844
That one's mine. It's mine, okay?

584
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,306
It's mine. I've been
staring at it this whole time.

585
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,978
Is the meat cooked?

586
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,939
Hey, hurry. Take a seat.

587
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,399
My gosh, I'm starving.

588
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,704
It's delicious.

589
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,206
-Hey!
-Hey!

590
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,926
Can we make time though?

591
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,513
If we plan in advance,
we should be able to take two days off.

592
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,516
I do want to go to Mount Seorak.

593
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,643
It's been over 20 years
since we last went.

594
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,896
I went a few times
when I was in Sokcho. It's still nice.

595
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,357
I think I can take two days off too.

596
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,775
But Ahn Jeong-won.

597
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,237
We're not going to climb
the dinosaur ridge, right?

598
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,030
-That's nuts. How?
-You prick.

599
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,074
-The tofu stew restaurant?
-By the entrance.

600
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,451
The dinosaur ridge?

601
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,412
Great idea.

602
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,497
What do you say? Shall we try this time?

603
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,666
-Hey!
-Hey! I'm hungry,

604
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,293
-Let's go!
-but I'm going to leave.

605
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,179
Let's do it sometime in early May.

606
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,098
I'll plan it with the holidays in mind.

607
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,349
-Sure.
-Okay.

608
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,727
Do you like that stone grill that much?

609
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,437
Yes, I love this.

610
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,982
This will be perfect for a camping trip.

611
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,234
They won't sell it to us, right?

612
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,405
If you actually ask them about it,

613
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,825
you're really the worst.

614
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,994
Okay, I won't ask.

615
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,038
This was a great meal. Thanks, Andrea.

616
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,040
-Thanks, this was great.
-Thanks.

617
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,708
-Thanks.
-Here's your to-go order.

618
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,836
-Oh, thank you.
-Enjoy.

619
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,213
Hey, when did you order that?

620
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,343
Well done, bear. Nice one.

621
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,428
-What did you order?
-Everything on the menu.

622
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,846
Way to go, bear!

623
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,728
Excuse me!
Can I get a doggie bag for the leftovers?

624
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,981
I have a dog.

625
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,863
Who are you texting, smiling like that?

626
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,239
Captain Hong.

627
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,574
Captain Hong?

628
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,910
Your former junior in the other unit?

629
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,037
Yes, the only junior
I'm back in contact with.

630
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,624
-He wants me to join the gosu club again.
-"Gosu"?

631
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,502
Yes, Captain Hong loves gosu.
Gosu as in cilantro.

632
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,669
I see.

633
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,837
Oh, I totally forgot.

634
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,174
-I'll go give U-ju a goodnight kiss.
-Okay.

635
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,345
She's going to drop this.

636
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,487
Hey, I really think U-ju is a genius.

637
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,032
I had dinner with him today, and that
seven-year-old kid knows Pythagoras.

638
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,492
Did you teach him?

639
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,286
It's the name of a tonkatsu place.

640
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,373
Right beside it, there's a tteokbokki
place called Socrates.

641
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,001
I'm going to bed. Good night.

642
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:33,055
Just don't do it again. Okay, Min-ha?

643
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,226
You may be a little dumb, but
you never do what you were told not to do.

644
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,353
It's okay.

645
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,816
I'm sure Professor Yang
isn't too disappointed in you.

646
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,194
But you'll make another blunder!

647
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:52,408
When you're in a different situation,
you'll say or do other stupid stuff!

648
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,204
No. Just don't, ever.

649
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:02,042
You will never improve. Why do I say that?

650
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,212
Because you're awfully immature.

651
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,926
No. You saw the look on his face earlier.

652
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,138
He didn't seem that disappointed.

653
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,310
It's okay. You still have hope.

654
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:24,064
Min-ha, you still have one more chance.

655
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,983
Yes, you can do it.

656
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,822
Dr. Chu.

657
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,117
No one else is here, right?

658
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,620
Yes, why?

659
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:41,332
I swear, I heard a bunch of people

660
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,210
talking and arguing.

661
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,087
I heard at least three different voices.

662
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,008
I guess you're really tired, Yoon-hee.

663
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,678
Get some sleep. I'll wake you up.

664
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,139
Go to sleep. Go on.

665
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,974
Okay.

666
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,703
Hey, are you awake?

667
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,413
Yes.

668
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,957
What's wrong?

669
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,417
My head hurts a lot.

670
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,336
What? Why does your head hurt?

671
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,214
I fell out of bed last night.

672
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,841
I hit my head hard.

673
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,552
Turn the car around.
We're going to Yangpyeong.

674
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,264
Hello? You're coming now? Don't bother.

675
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,182
Why are you being so foolish?

676
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,144
Be quiet.
Just get dressed and wait for me.

677
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,146
I'm really okay.

678
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,203
I'm coming down now. You can go.

679
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,622
You're late for your meeting.

680
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,874
It's no big deal.
I can move it to tomorrow.

681
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,377
Hey, Jeong-won.
Your mom isn't seriously hurt. She's okay.

682
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,921
She kept joking around
on our way here. Take your time.

683
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,965
Thank you. I'm almost there.

684
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,601
Song-hwa is here.

685
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,147
Are you okay, Ms. Jeong?

686
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:12,941
You hurt your arm too?

687
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,986
She got a scratch from
something on the floor as she was falling.

688
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,656
-What about the CT scan?
-Yes, I checked it just now.

689
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,950
Did it look okay? No hemorrhage inside?
What about a skull fracture?

690
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,827
No hemorrhage or skull fracture.

691
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,080
Thank goodness.

692
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,500
Jeong-won, can you spare me a minute?

693
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,460
Sure.

694
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,642
Look, right here.
I see a bit of hydrocephalus here.

695
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,144
"Hydrocephalus"?

696
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,980
The CSF flow is obstructed.

697
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,234
Looks like that has caused
interstitial edema around the ventricle.

698
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,696
Have you noticed her becoming
more forgetful than usual as of late

699
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,616
or seen her suddenly
flop down as her legs gave out?

700
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,955
Come to think of it,
she has been more forgetful than usual.

701
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,042
Most recently, she totally forgot
about her favorite niece's wedding.

702
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,338
And I have noticed her unsteady gait.

703
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:20,551
She probably fell last night
because her legs gave out.

704
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,597
Let's check her in.

705
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,809
Let's drain some CSF
through lumbar drainage later today.

706
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,103
Okay.

707
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,023
If her symptoms subside after that,
then what do we do?

708
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,985
If her condition improves,

709
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,698
we may perform shunt surgery
to move the extra CSF into the abdomen.

710
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,911
All right. Thanks.

711
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,830
You must have appointments. Go, hurry.

712
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,999
I start late today. Don't worry.

713
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,500
I'll go say bye to your mother.

714
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,586
Okay.

715
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,757
It's okay.

716
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,719
Based on the CT scan, it's not serious.

717
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,512
Even if she needs surgery,

718
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,307
she'll recover quickly
if the surgery goes well.

719
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,018
How could I not know? I'm her son!

720
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,645
I visited her every weekend.

721
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,067
I saw it but still didn't know.
Am I really a doctor?

722
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,279
Her doctor son is useless.

723
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,448
Hey, it happens.

724
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,452
Most people would blame old age.
No one would suspect an illness first.

725
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,830
It's okay.

726
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,175
-Hello.
-Hi.

727
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,968
Song-hwa.

728
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,640
It's pretty bad, right?

729
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,853
-Well…
-I'll tell her. You should get going.

730
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,979
No.

731
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,650
I want to hear it directly from my doctor.

732
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,111
Be honest with me, Song-hwa.

733
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,405
I'm okay.

734
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,664
Hydrocephalus?

735
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,500
Yes. That's what I'm suspecting.

736
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,754
Well, it's like a buildup of fluid
within the brain.

737
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,092
I'm suspecting hydrocephalus
based on your CT scan.

738
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,637
I suggest you be hospitalized
for a few days so we can run some tests.

739
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,474
We'll insert a thin tube called
a lumbar drain into your lower spine

740
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,602
to drain some of the cerebrospinal fluid.

741
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,689
You'll try walking
after we perform this procedure.

742
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,901
If your gait stability
and alertness improve,

743
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,696
we'll confirm
the diagnosis of hydrocephalus

744
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,322
and discuss your treatment plans.

745
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,284
You may need surgery.

746
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,622
I don't have Alzheimer's?

747
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,083
Pardon?

748
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,668
It's not Alzheimer's, Mom.

749
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,462
We think it's hydrocephalus.

750
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,508
Well, the symptoms are similar
to those of Alzheimer's but--

751
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:11,263
But thankfully, such symptoms
caused by hydrocephalus are treatable.

752
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:15,350
We'll know more after the surgery,
and every case is different.

753
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,395
However, you only developed
the symptoms recently,

754
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,523
and you're still pretty young.

755
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,569
So just get it treated,
and you can fully recover.

756
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,865
Thanks.

757
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,368
Thanks, Song-hwa.

758
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,126
You're the only person who's thankful
to be diagnosed with hydrocephalus.

759
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,129
Hydrocephalus is a serious condition too.

760
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,342
Mom, did you think you had Alzheimer's?

761
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,344
Yes.

762
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,765
My gosh.

763
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,685
Song-hwa.

764
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:06,026
I can endure anything,
so do whatever you need to do.

765
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,529
Be it an operation or a procedure.
I can endure anything.

766
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,909
Hey, Jeong-won. Don't worry.

767
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,787
The surgery doesn't scare me at all.

768
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,167
Why do you look so upset, son?
I'm fine, okay?

769
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,024
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

770
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,946
-A brain tumor?
-Yes.

771
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,243
She was treated
for breast cancer three years ago,

772
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,455
and based on the shape of the tumor
and the swelling around it,

773
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,375
it's possible that
it's a metastatic brain tumor.

774
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:08,422
The MRI shows a tumor that's about 3.5cm.

775
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,799
But due to its tricky location,

776
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:14,052
the surgery won't be easy
even if you decide to go for it.

777
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,012
It can be done though.

778
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,516
But she underwent
breast cancer surgery three years ago

779
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,102
and received chemotherapy
as well as radiotherapy.

780
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,813
I'm sorry,

781
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,734
but it's highly likely
that the cancer has spread.

782
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,242
You must have had difficulty breathing.
Wasn't it hard to manage?

783
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:42,956
I always found it hard to breathe

784
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,626
while talking,

785
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,006
but I've always been like this
for as long as I can remember,

786
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,720
so I didn't find it too inconvenient.

787
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,639
But these days…

788
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,978
It suddenly got worse.

789
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:11,443
You see, it was never this bad.

790
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:16,490
My father always sounds
out of breath when he talks,

791
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,743
so we thought
that was just the way he talked.

792
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,997
We didn't know he had a hole in his heart.

793
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,000
Professor Kim,
what exactly is his condition called?

794
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:32,380
The heart ultrasound shows
that he has ASD, an atrial septal defect.

795
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,257
There is a wall between the atria,

796
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:38,345
and there's a hole in that wall.
That's what an atrial septal defect is.

797
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,681
He's also showing
symptoms of tricuspid insufficiency

798
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,434
and moderate lung insufficiency.

799
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,354
It's a condition
he's had since he was little.

800
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,147
He probably didn't notice it

801
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:53,068
until the symptoms started getting worse
when his tricuspid insufficiency worsened.

802
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,362
What causes it?

803
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,949
Most cases of congenital heart defect
have no known cause.

804
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:02,035
Will he need surgery to get it treated?

805
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:04,120
Surgery is the only solution.

806
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,665
Non-surgical procedures
aren't an option now.

807
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,708
Will the surgery be difficult?

808
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,627
That's not the main issue here.

809
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,005
Although, it won't be easy
as it'll be an open-chest surgery.

810
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,886
If you do undergo surgery,
you'll be the oldest ASD patient

811
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,013
I have ever operated on.

812
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:27,018
And some doctors say
elderly ASD patients like yourself

813
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,855
often tend to show
no clear improvement in symptoms

814
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,983
even after the defect
is fixed through surgery.

815
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,198
Can she undergo surgery?

816
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,909
Yes, she can.

817
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:47,122
The PET scan shows us
that it hasn't spread elsewhere.

818
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:50,083
But the tumor is quite big,
so combining surgery

819
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,753
with postoperative radiotherapy
will be the best solution at the moment.

820
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,258
Surgery at this age? Forget it.

821
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,345
Doctor, I don't want surgery.

822
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,057
Let's not do it.

823
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,394
Why bother?

824
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,480
I won't live much longer anyway.

825
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,234
I'm okay. Let's go.

826
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,280
-Goodness.
-Mom, what are you talking about?

827
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,824
She said you can get surgery,
so we must do it.

828
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,704
Hey, why are you hesitating?

829
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,164
Mom is getting this surgery.

830
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,501
Doctor.

831
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,338
If…

832
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,716
What will happen
if she decides not to get the surgery?

833
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,717
Hey!

834
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,055
Well…

835
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,390
It's okay, Doctor.

836
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,100
I know my situation very well,

837
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,688
so tell us your honest opinion.

838
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,985
If you feel that
the surgery would be too much,

839
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,864
we can forgo it
and just do the radiotherapy.

840
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,534
But it looks like a malignant tumor,

841
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,495
and it's quite big.

842
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,123
So even with radiotherapy,
if the tumor grows quickly,

843
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,086
you may pass away within six months.

844
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:24,469
Then what if I get the surgery?

845
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:28,473
We won't know until we do it
because every case is different.

846
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,851
But if the surgery goes well,

847
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,522
and if you follow up
with the radiotherapy and other treatment,

848
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,482
you can definitely live longer.

849
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,318
I think it's too early to give up.

850
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:46,199
My mother is 78 years old.

851
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,035
She's almost 80.

852
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,247
Is the surgery worth the trouble?

853
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,503
She is elderly,
and it is an open-brain surgery.

854
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,924
So I'm concerned about
whether she'll be able to handle it.

855
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,093
I'm worried about
postoperative complications.

856
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,763
Of course, we need
to do a biopsy to know more,

857
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,308
but here's what I think under the premise
that it's a metastatic tumor.

858
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,521
The size and number
of metastatic brain tumors

859
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:20,692
are the most important factors
in determining how they should be treated.

860
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,529
In this case,
there's only one but it's quite big.

861
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,158
It's a tricky location to operate on,

862
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,410
but it won't be too hard.

863
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,914
So as a neurosurgeon,
I think surgery will be beneficial.

864
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,000
And to tell you the truth,

865
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:41,713
surgery is your only option now.

866
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,758
But what if the surgery goes wrong?

867
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,594
I heard sepsis can occur.

868
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,348
What if something goes wrong,
or she doesn't wake up?

869
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:58,354
There could be some complications.
And yes, she might not wake up.

870
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:03,651
However, 70 is the new 50.

871
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,700
I have a patient
who underwent brain surgery at age 77

872
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,703
and has been coming in
for follow-up appointments for five years.

873
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,041
The choice is up to you.

874
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,252
I can't make this decision for you.

875
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,172
It is up to the patient

876
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,424
and you, her family.

877
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,388
Doctor, can we have
a quick meeting and let you know?

878
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,308
Yes, of course.

879
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:39,062
Of course, the symptoms
improve drastically in some cases.

880
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,606
But it's all case by case.

881
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,401
The decision is up to you, sir.

882
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,488
You decide, and I'll follow.

883
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,658
So to sum it up,
we can either decide to go for the surgery

884
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,286
knowing it's risky at age 77
and may not even help,

885
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,498
or decide against it
which is safer even though it means that

886
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,459
he has to continue
living with the condition.

887
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,006
Professor Kim.

888
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,885
-We'll just keep--
-I want the surgery.

889
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:13,972
Dad.

890
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,224
Please let me have the surgery.

891
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,435
Even if I die tomorrow,

892
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,897
I want to get the surgery.

893
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,901
Even if I have a day left to live,

894
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,990
I want to live
like everybody else does for once.

895
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,284
Doctor.

896
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,579
I'm getting the surgery.

897
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,747
Please…

898
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,418
let me get the surgery. Please?

899
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,884
Please help me.

900
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,888
Okay. I know this was
a difficult decision for you,

901
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:59,476
so I'll do my very best
to make sure everything goes well.

902
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,606
Thank you.

903
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,916
Mom.

904
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,043
Mom.

905
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,921
We'll go settle up. Stay here, okay?

906
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,439
If she gets the surgery,
she can live much longer.

907
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,399
We can't decide against it knowing that.

908
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,736
What if we decide against it
and Mom passes away?

909
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,240
Can you get on with your life
without feeling an ounce of guilt?

910
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,283
It's only if the surgery goes well.

911
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,453
She can only live longer

912
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,914
if the surgery
and the radiotherapy go well.

913
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,042
The surgery itself
doesn't guarantee anything.

914
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,382
Hey, Dae-jun.

915
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,426
Seriously?

916
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,513
They'll really sign with us?

917
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,186
I'm at the hospital now.
I'll call you back later.

918
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,982
Did you actually smile just now?

919
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,651
How can you smile
and get excited in this situation?

920
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,570
Is money everything?

921
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,446
Then will you pay Mom's hospital bills?

922
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,534
If she wants surgery,
we need money to make it happen.

923
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,329
I know you've done a lot
to look after Mom,

924
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,956
but I've been stressed out too.

925
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,333
Paying all her medical bills
behind my wife's back.

926
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,294
I've done a lot too.

927
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,297
-That's the least you can do for Mom.
-What?

928
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,217
How much money have you taken from her
for your business?

929
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,885
How much did you take

930
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,638
when you quit your job
and started your lighting business?

931
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:05,310
You should be very good to Mom
if you have a conscience.

932
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:09,647
You sponged so much money off Mom
for that darn business of yours!

933
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:13,026
-Ms. Lee Ae-gyeong?
-Yes, I'm here!

934
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,945
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

935
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,281
-My gosh.
-It's okay.

936
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,742
I'm sorry. My goodness.

937
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,993
What do you want to do?

938
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,122
I'll persuade Mom
to get the surgery no matter what.

939
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,041
She's almost 80.

940
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,170
Even if she passes away tomorrow,
it's nothing strange.

941
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,174
Brain surgery at her age?
She won't be able to handle it.

942
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,926
What if something goes wrong?

943
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,388
What will you do
if she gets worse after the surgery?

944
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,058
It's too much.

945
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,894
It really is.

946
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,399
Let's just see how things go.

947
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,027
I'm sure that's what Mom wants too.

948
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:57,820
What if it's not?

949
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,659
What if Mom wants to get the surgery?

950
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,704
She may actually want it.

951
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,957
What if she's just not saying it
because she feels bad?

952
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,293
Then what?

953
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,463
I'm sure that's not the case.

954
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,466
I bet she just wants to leave it.

955
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,178
Her breast cancer put her through hell.

956
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,140
With the chemotherapy
and the radiotherapy…

957
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,604
I'm sure she doesn't want
to go through that again.

958
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,525
Min-seo.

959
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,239
Let's not make Mom suffer again.

960
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,366
Okay?

961
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,412
I think we have…

962
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,542
We've done enough.

963
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,439
Betadine ball, please.

964
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,199
Pass me the needle.

965
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,422
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

966
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,386
Jeong-won, you're in surgery now, right?

967
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,430
I just finished. How did it go?

968
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,723
It is hydrocephalus.

969
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,768
Am I supposed to be relieved or not?

970
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,229
I'll check again at night to be sure,

971
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:59,567
but I had her walk for a moment
and noticed clear improvement.

972
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,652
She says she feels more alert.

973
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,780
Thanks. I'll come up now.

974
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:08,159
Okay. I've said this numerous times
to your mother and her caregiver as well.

975
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:12,163
We'll remove the drain in the evening,
but she must stay in bed until morning.

976
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,664
Keep an eye on her.

977
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,001
Okay. But she doesn't have a caregiver.

978
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:19,879
She does. His name is Ju Jong-su.
I have to go.

979
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,426
Hello?

980
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,969
Professor. About Byun Yeong-gyu,

981
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,972
the SDH patient who received
a craniectomy three days ago.

982
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,016
Patient's wheezing
and the status is stupor.

983
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,559
We should do a CT scan.

984
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,686
Do it right away
and get ready for intubation.

985
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,813
I'm coming now.

986
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,739
Right.

987
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,500
Hi, sweetheart.

988
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,418
Mom. You're here, right?

989
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,920
Yes, I got here a while ago.

990
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:04,048
Why did you come so early?
You should've come right on time.

991
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,679
Mom, I don't think I can go in with you.

992
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,097
I have to go into surgery.

993
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,684
Okay, no problem.
I'm not a kid. Don't worry.

994
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:19,522
I'll introduce myself and ask
your professor to take good care of you.

995
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,732
Mom! Why would you say that?

996
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,485
This professor is like my role model.

997
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,446
Don't say anything, Mom. Okay?

998
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,157
Just listen and don't say anything.

999
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,995
Gosh, okay. You always
tell me not to say anything.

1000
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:37,456
Song-hwa, when are you done?
How about we have dinner together?

1001
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,458
I have to go, Mom.

1002
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,879
I hope the appointment goes well.
I'm sure it'll be fine. Bye.

1003
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:49,677
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1004
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,226
You're very handsome, Doctor.

1005
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,812
Who's your mother?

1006
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,649
Ms. Jeong Rosa.

1007
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,652
I see, Ms. Jeong Rosa.

1008
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,155
Lucky her.

1009
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:13,534
Her son is so handsome and tall.
She has such a good son.

1010
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,080
I'm not a good son.

1011
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,253
You were stressed and weren't doing well,

1012
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,299
but I had no idea.

1013
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,595
I'm sorry, Mom.

1014
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,264
For not being there for you.

1015
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,268
Jeong-won.

1016
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,314
I'm in such a good mood right now.

1017
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,153
I thought it might be Alzheimer's disease.

1018
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,282
I was so scared.

1019
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,912
"What if I don't recognize
my sons and daughters

1020
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:03,250
and forget all my happy memories?"

1021
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:06,337
I was absolutely terrified.

1022
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,133
But it's not Alzheimer's.

1023
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,178
What I have is treatable.

1024
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,639
That's good enough.

1025
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,811
That makes me happy enough.

1026
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,152
You know,

1027
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:36,909
even small things like a random phone call
can totally change your life.

1028
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,830
No one knows what tomorrow holds.

1029
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,834
So, my sweet son,

1030
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:51,048
don't worry so much
about things like this, okay?

1031
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,467
All right?

1032
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,940
Yes, Professor. Thank you so much.

1033
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,233
Where are you?

1034
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,194
I just performed surgery
on an ICU patient due to a bleed.

1035
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,990
My mom has probably left by now.
Everything looks good, right?

1036
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,868
Have you noticed
anything strange about her recently?

1037
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,203
When she came in for an appointment,

1038
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,749
I noticed mild symptoms
of resting tremor and bradykinesia,

1039
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:29,253
so we did a PET scan
for Parkinson's disease.

1040
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,882
And I think that's what she has.

1041
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,642
I could tell the moment I met your mother.

1042
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:48,773
One of my patients
who had booked a PET scan didn't show up,

1043
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,441
so we did it just in case.

1044
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,319
Her dopamine transporter levels are low.

1045
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,654
You didn't know?

1046
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,034
I prescribed her L-DOPA,

1047
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,453
and her next appointment
is booked in two weeks.

1048
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,040
Hello?

1049
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:07,958
Song-hwa.

1050
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,294
Are you there?

1051
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,196
Hi, sweetheart.

1052
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,157
Hi, Mom. Are you home now?

1053
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:42,159
Yes, I got in just now.

1054
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,578
It's still the initial stage.

1055
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,749
I went through all the test results,
and you're still in the early stage.

1056
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,670
It's actually incredible
that we found out so early.

1057
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:56,632
Mom, there are so many good drugs
for Parkinson's disease these days.

1058
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,801
Just take care of yourself,
and you'll be fine.

1059
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,595
Don't worry too much. Okay?

1060
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:06,267
Your daughter is a neurosurgeon.
What's there to worry about?

1061
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,478
It's okay, Mom.

1062
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,108
Mom, I'm coming over
because I want to sleep at home today.

1063
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,487
There's no traffic right now,
so I'll be there very soon.

1064
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,613
I'll see you in a bit.

1065
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:24,201
Hey, I know how busy you are.
Why would you come all the way here?

1066
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:27,121
Just focus on work. I'm fine.

1067
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,541
You're always so busy.
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1068
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:36,130
Song-hwa. I'm really okay,
so just focus on work.

1069
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,883
Do you have to work all night again?

1070
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:40,843
Mom.

1071
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:45,723
I'm not busy now.

1072
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,518
I'm done for the day.

1073
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,774
And work isn't important now.

1074
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,528
I'll leave now.

1075
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,390
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1076
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,400
Well…

1077
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,282
My mom has Parkinson's disease.

1078
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,396
Shouldn't you go home?

1079
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,606
Yes.

1080
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,526
I'm going to head out now.

1081
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,655
Do you want a ride?

1082
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,581
Yes, please.

1083
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,337
Get changed and come down.

1084
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,256
I'll be out front.

1085
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,091
Okay.

1086
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,222
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1087
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:46,779
-Here.
-Thanks.

1088
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:49,907
Mr. Sun Du-ho.

1089
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,702
I'll order your dinner for you,

1090
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,497
but you know that
you have to fast starting midnight, right?

1091
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,332
Yes, he knows.

1092
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,085
Hold on. Was it Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul?

1093
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,545
-Right, Mom?
-Yes.

1094
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,631
When will Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul be here?

1095
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,925
She's off until today.

1096
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,051
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

1097
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,638
Well, then what about tomorrow?

1098
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,099
Will she be assisting
in my dad's surgery tomorrow?

1099
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:19,728
I was told that she'll be back tomorrow,

1100
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:22,940
but we don't know exactly
which surgeries she'll be assisting in.

1101
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:24,900
Oh, okay.

1102
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,861
We need you to sign
the consent form later today.

1103
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,029
Okay.

1104
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,497
Mom, she'll assist
in Dad's surgery tomorrow, right?

1105
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,749
But the surgery is booked early.

1106
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,460
Goodness, who cares?

1107
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,629
It's all pointless anyway.

1108
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,799
Close the curtains, Seong-hui.

1109
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:54,388
Okay.

1110
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:01,645
I see. So it can be done, right?

1111
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:06,150
Yes. I should double-check,
but I think the limit will be pretty high.

1112
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,944
Is it for buying a home
or a lease deposit?

1113
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,529
No, it's not.

1114
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:14,825
This may be TMI,
but my parents run a guesthouse.

1115
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,618
I see. Where?

1116
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,413
In Sokcho. In front of
the entrance to Mount Seorak.

1117
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:22,875
The view must be amazing.
The Ulsan Rock right before your eyes.

1118
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:26,295
No. It's in front of the entrance.

1119
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,088
There's quite a bit of distance.

1120
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,590
I see.

1121
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:33,177
It's about 7km away from Mount Seorak.

1122
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,221
You can see the Ulsan Rock
from the guesthouse.

1123
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,932
But you only see a snippet,
not the whole thing.

1124
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,225
I see.

1125
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,645
The guesthouse always
used to get good ratings,

1126
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:47,065
but we got some
not-so-good reviews recently.

1127
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,068
"It's clean, but the rooms
and facilities are too old.

1128
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,571
The owners are kind,
but the rooms are too old."

1129
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,032
My parents are very upset about it,

1130
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:57,618
so I want to send them
enough money for renovations.

1131
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,995
You're saying
I will be approved for a loan,

1132
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:03,457
so we should totally fix it up
and do a grand reopening.

1133
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,751
Oh, I'll be back next week.

1134
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,629
I'll bring all the documents
you mentioned.

1135
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,089
Have a good day.

1136
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,132
Bye.

1137
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,926
CREDIT UNION

1138
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,052
Let's see.

1139
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,386
Dr. Heo!

1140
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,097
Another installment savings account?

1141
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,601
You either don't know
how to use the app or just love to save.

1142
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,894
Today, it's a loan.

1143
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:24,978
Are you buying a home?

1144
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:29,149
No. I know this may be TMI,
but my parents run a guesthouse.

1145
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,485
Well, I'll tell you later.
Where are you off to?

1146
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:34,488
Professor Chae's office,
to get her advice on my thesis.

1147
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,241
I see. I've got surgery. I have to go!

1148
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:47,543
Professor, I tried rewriting it
as per your advice.

1149
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,044
Seon-bin.

1150
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:53,048
Can we skip this week?

1151
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,385
Oh, sure.

1152
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,428
Let's do it next week.

1153
01:15:58,512 --> 01:15:59,721
Okay.

1154
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,308
Can you let everyone know?

1155
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,768
Sure, no problem.

1156
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,608
-I'll be off, then.
-Bye.

1157
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,323
-Hello.
-Hi.

1158
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,285
Right, today's the day
when she helps you guys with your theses.

1159
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,870
I guess you're done.
Did the next person go in already?

1160
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,330
We're skipping this week.

1161
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:29,376
-Is Song-hwa busy with something?
-No, she wants to take it easy this week.

1162
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:32,462
She's been looking
pretty fatigued since yesterday.

1163
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,674
I've known her for a long time,
and I've never seen her this weary.

1164
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,759
She even canceled
the lab meeting next week.

1165
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,304
I'll be off, then.

1166
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,683
Let's come back another time.

1167
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,021
Hello?

1168
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,816
Yes, you can leave it
in front of my office. Thank you.

1169
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:53,942
-Was it a courier?
-Yes.

1170
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,569
-What did you get?
-It's a secret.

1171
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:57,154
Whatever!

1172
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,376
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1173
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:36,943
Hold on a second.

1174
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,071
Hang on.

1175
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,989
There. Better?

1176
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,200
You're really good at this.

1177
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,869
I've been doing this for years.

1178
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,124
-Do you want some water?
-Yes. My mouth keeps drying up.

1179
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,638
Have you not eaten yet?

1180
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:07,599
You have surgery tomorrow.
You have to eat dinner.

1181
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,935
You can eat until midnight, Mom.

1182
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,812
Okay. Did you have dinner?

1183
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:15,190
No. But I will, after my appointment
with a patient's guardian.

1184
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,568
Mom, Dong-il will be here soon.
Should I tell him to pick up something?

1185
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,739
Who just knocked? How courteous.

1186
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,534
It must be the kids.
They didn't have to come.

1187
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,036
Tell them not to come.
I don't want to bother them.

1188
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,581
I told them.
But they never listen to me, you know.

1189
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,166
Come in.

1190
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,140
My gosh.

1191
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,684
Look who's here.

1192
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,311
Hello.

1193
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,439
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul.

1194
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:57,524
Hello.

1195
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:59,109
Are you here to see me?

1196
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:00,777
Yes.

1197
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,113
Me, not him. Right?

1198
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,365
Yes.

1199
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,159
My gosh!

1200
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,044
VIP ROOM 2

1201
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,934
Bye again.

1202
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,102
Take care.

1203
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:38,774
You know, I was planning on acting up
during my surgery tomorrow.

1204
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:42,402
But I'll behave myself.
My surgery will go well, thanks to you!

1205
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:46,698
Goodness, you have the most random plans.

1206
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:47,991
Get home safely, Dr. Jang.

1207
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:49,409
Thank you.

1208
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,121
All right. Bye!

1209
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:57,250
Go. What?

1210
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:00,796
Go on in. Bye. Let's go in.

1211
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:04,382
-Go on in.
-Gosh.

1212
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,301
-Good night.
-Enough, go on in.

1213
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:07,385
Come on.

1214
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,067
When did you get back?

1215
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,110
In the morning.

1216
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,198
You should've called me.

1217
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,201
I wanted to surprise you.

1218
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,499
Is your mother okay?

1219
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:40,502
Yes. She's much better now,

1220
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:43,004
so I brought her to Seoul.

1221
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,091
I figured it'd be better
for her to stay with me.

1222
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:48,552
I see.

1223
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:54,641
Professor, why didn't you tell me
about your mother's surgery?

1224
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,770
I know you have a lot going on.
I didn't want to add to your stress.

1225
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,109
By the way, how did you find out?

1226
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,445
I stopped by the hospital
to go over some patient charts

1227
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,947
and happened to hear about it.

1228
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:13,451
Actually, everyone at the hospital knows.

1229
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,787
Right, I'm sure.

1230
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,825
Are you really okay?

1231
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:01,166
Shall we have dinner together?
I only have one appointment left.

1232
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,086
Next time. I have to hurry home.

1233
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,548
I see, all right.

1234
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:21,978
Someone's coming.

1235
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:26,816
Hello.

1236
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,531
Are we going down?

1237
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,242
Yes. You can go back up.

1238
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:38,453
Are you on your way to see my mom?

1239
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:41,373
She's probably having dinner now.
I'll stop by later.

1240
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,667
What's that?

1241
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:45,293
It's a secret.

1242
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:49,047
Wait, why are you here?

1243
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:53,385
You're off until today.
Enjoy your time off to the fullest.

1244
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:56,179
Don't do this. This is against the rules.

1245
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:58,264
I'm sorry, Professor.

1246
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:01,977
I'll get off on the second floor.
I have to make a quick stop.

1247
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,853
-All right.
-Rest up.

1248
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:22,455
Dad, you need to eat more.

1249
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,833
You have to fast after this.

1250
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,167
I have no appetite.

1251
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:29,587
You usually like fish,
but you didn't even touch it.

1252
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:31,548
Try to eat a little more.

1253
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:33,466
-Yes, you should.
-No, don't bother.

1254
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:36,845
Hello.

1255
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:39,014
My gosh! Dr. Jang is here.

1256
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,766
-Hello.
-Hello, Dr. Jang.

1257
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,102
How are you feeling, Mr. Sun?

1258
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:48,398
Good! I feel great.

1259
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:50,942
You barely touched your food.

1260
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,361
You have to fast from midnight.
You'll be hungry.

1261
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:57,157
Oh, I'm still eating. I'm not done yet.

1262
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:04,205
Doctor, his surgery is booked
early in the morning.

1263
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,790
You'll be coming in, right?

1264
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,127
Of course. We always book surgeries
first thing in the morning.

1265
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,546
I'll be there, so don't worry.

1266
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,590
Thank you, Doctor.

1267
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,385
I won't be the lead surgeon,

1268
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:21,723
but I'll assist Professor Kwon
to the best of my ability.

1269
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,267
Good night.

1270
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,811
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

1271
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:43,536
Hey, Seok-min.

1272
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,663
Professor, are you in your office now?

1273
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:49,084
Can I swing by for a moment?
I have a favor to ask.

1274
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,835
Sure, of course.

1275
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,003
Thank you.

1276
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:17,070
Actually, never mind.
I got it sorted out. Get some rest.

1277
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,098
CHAE SONG-HWA

1278
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,183
What was the date again?

1279
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:49,644
July 15.

1280
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:53,857
It'll be a 30-minute lecture.

1281
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,317
It'll be followed by a Q&A session.

1282
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,028
Thank you, Professor.

1283
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,739
Gosh, don't mention it. Get going.

1284
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,824
Bye.

1285
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:05,994
Hi.

1286
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,960
Hey, hold on. What's up?

1287
01:26:14,043 --> 01:26:15,712
The director sent me on an errand.

1288
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:17,797
Professor Chae is working
on the chronology

1289
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,758
for the 15th anniversary
commemorative book.

1290
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:21,968
I'm here to pick it up.

1291
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:25,805
She's still working on it.
Tell the director that it's not ready yet.

1292
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,765
Actually, I'll call the director

1293
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,685
and explain the situation. Bye.

1294
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:31,895
Take care.

1295
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,695
-Hello.
-Hi.

1296
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:43,489
Stop! Where are you going, Yun-bok?

1297
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:46,993
Professor Chae has been feeling tired,

1298
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:48,745
so I got her some coffee and cake.

1299
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:50,788
Sweet treats will cheer her up.

1300
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,583
Yes, hand them over.
I'll make sure she gets them.

1301
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,418
Song-hwa needs some alone time today.

1302
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:56,669
Okay, got it.

1303
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,880
I'll make sure she gets these. Thanks.

1304
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,466
No problem. Good night.

1305
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,681
-Hello.
-Hello. Wait.

1306
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:12,644
-Where are you going?
-Is Professor Chae in her office?

1307
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,688
-What's up?
-I need help with my grad school homework.

1308
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,691
Oh, you can ask me. I know everything.

1309
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:21,319
-Really?
-Yes.

1310
01:27:32,705 --> 01:27:34,999
DO YOU HAVE SOME TIME TO SPARE?

1311
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:39,545
-What is this?
-It's not from the restaurant.

1312
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:42,048
I scoured the Internet
all night to find the same one.

1313
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:45,718
What? You don't want it?

1314
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,930
I do! I love this. I really do.

1315
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,187
My gosh, this is crazy.

1316
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,275
You're nuts.

1317
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:01,651
It's the same one, right?

1318
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:03,278
Yes, it's exactly the same.

1319
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,447
I was so surprised when I got it
because it's the same one.

1320
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,741
-They sell this?
-Yes!

1321
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:13,079
This is perfect for a camping trip.

1322
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:15,373
How did you even think to get this for me?

1323
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:20,461
Seriously, this is nuts!

1324
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:27,760
Hold on, let's see.
We'll set it up like this

1325
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,096
and grill pork belly on it.

1326
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,598
-And some kimchi here, you know.
-That's right.

1327
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,809
-Totally.
-She seems to be in a good mood.

1328
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:36,644
Wasn't she feeling down all day?

1329
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:39,647
Professor Lee is here,
so we can put our worries to rest.

1330
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:40,982
Let's go eat.

1331
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,861
-All right.
-Let's try that.

1332
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,738
No. How?

1333
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,123
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1334
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:06,716
-Did you eat it?
-Eat what?

1335
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:07,675
My snack.

1336
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,137
It wasn't me. I buy my own snacks
at the convenience store.

1337
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,098
Are you sure?

1338
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,103
Are you becoming like me?
Why are you being so petty?

1339
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:21,105
Have you ordered the food yet?

1340
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,691
-Yes, I have.
-Did you order tuna gimbap too?

1341
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:24,609
Yes.

1342
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,500
What are you doing?

1343
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,335
I'm eating a cookie.

1344
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:44,545
-It's mine.
-Jeez!

1345
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:48,341
What? It's my only joy and happiness.

1346
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:50,510
Same here!
This is my only joy and happiness.

1347
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:52,678
Getting on your nerves.

1348
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:57,892
-Let go.
-Let go.

1349
01:29:57,975 --> 01:29:59,811
-You let go first.
-No, you do it first.

1350
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,187
-You little…
-Hey!

1351
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,608
Isn't Song-hwa coming?
And where's Seok-hyeong?

1352
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:07,652
She's at a conference.
Seok-hyeong has surgery.

1353
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,947
Hey. You're taking next Tuesday off?

1354
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:13,491
Yes. It's my mom's birthday.
I'll be in Changwon.

1355
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:14,992
Not on the weekend?

1356
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:18,329
We've always done it that way
but should celebrate her actual birthday.

1357
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:22,250
-Are you taking your car?
-No, I can't drive for four hours anymore.

1358
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,502
I'll take the express train
there and back.

1359
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,672
-Did you buy your tickets?
-Did you buy my tickets?

1360
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,092
Ik-jun still does it for you?

1361
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:33,803
Yes. Otherwise, I'd be buying
my tickets at Seoul Station.

1362
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:37,265
I bet he's the only one who's not
from Seoul and doesn't have a KORAIL ID.

1363
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:38,391
I don't want the app.

1364
01:30:38,474 --> 01:30:40,101
Then go on their website.

1365
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,854
It's such a hassle.
I don't even go to Changwon often.

1366
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,275
Please?

1367
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:49,193
If you get that face out of my sight.

1368
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,280
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

1369
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:11,591
Hello.

1370
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,801
Do you remember me?

1371
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,386
Yes, I do.

1372
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:19,599
You and your sister accompanied
your mother when she came to see me.

1373
01:31:19,682 --> 01:31:21,350
Yes, that's right.

1374
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,104
My gosh, I didn't expect
to run into you here.

1375
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:28,566
What brings you here?

1376
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:33,571
My friend of 30 years

1377
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,198
died.

1378
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:38,034
He had a heart attack

1379
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,120
and died overnight.

1380
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,084
My gosh.

1381
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:54,133
He was…

1382
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,844
only 50.

1383
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:01,140
He turned 50 this year.

1384
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:07,021
He recently made big money,
for the first time in his life.

1385
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:11,275
But this fool died overnight,
before he could even spend any of it.

1386
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:18,282
Life is so futile.

1387
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,535
Why do we live?

1388
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,163
How should we live our lives?

1389
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,750
I don't even know anymore.

1390
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:32,421
I'm sorry, Doctor. You must be busy.

1391
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:46,227
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1392
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,357
Who packed my stuff?

1393
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,734
Mr. Ju did it.

1394
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:56,946
I was going to do it,
but he already took care of it.

1395
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,115
He's so organized.

1396
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:01,367
Yes, he is.

1397
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,869
Are you wearing that to sleep?

1398
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:07,331
These are very comfortable.
They make perfect pajamas.

1399
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:08,666
My goodness.

1400
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,754
Should I turn off the lights?

1401
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:16,215
No. I want to chat
with my son before I fall asleep.

1402
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,017
Mom.

1403
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,478
After you get discharged tomorrow,

1404
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:33,024
make sure you go for walks often

1405
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,443
and start exercising regularly.

1406
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,028
Okay, I will.

1407
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:41,741
And go out
for nice meals with Mr. Ju often.

1408
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:44,327
Nothing's better than home-cooked meals.

1409
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:49,582
Mom.

1410
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:55,963
I want you to be selfish.

1411
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:04,180
Stop worrying about your children.

1412
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:11,729
And don't worry about
falling ill when you're older.

1413
01:34:14,648 --> 01:34:16,567
Only think about yourself from now on.

1414
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:22,990
And if, later on…

1415
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:27,161
Even if you are diagnosed
with Alzheimer's…

1416
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,289
don't worry.

1417
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:35,086
Even if you don't recognize us,

1418
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,006
we'll recognize you every single day

1419
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,509
and tell you

1420
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:46,514
that you're our mom, every single day.

1421
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:00,528
Mom.

1422
01:35:03,155 --> 01:35:06,367
So live every day to the fullest.

1423
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,664
I want you to live like that, Mom.

1424
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,177
Jeong-won.

1425
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,557
I want to get back into it.

1426
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:31,767
What?

1427
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,561
Can you buy it for me?

1428
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:11,140
Ik-jun, I have to go
to the hospital for an emergency.

1429
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:14,059
You get it sorted out.
Change the song or something.

1430
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,439
But the keyboard is what makes the song.

1431
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:20,316
We can't practice without the keyboard.

1432
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,568
Pick a different song.

1433
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:26,405
Hey, goodness. I'm not done talking.

1434
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:29,867
So we invited a stand-in keyboardist.

1435
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:32,453
She's a busy lady.

1436
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:34,079
And she's expensive.

1437
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:35,998
We had to bribe her with daisy seedlings

1438
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:38,876
and two boxes of dried large-eyed herring.

1439
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:03,734
Let's give her a big hand!

1440
01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:08,697
Shall we begin, ma'am?

1441
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,784
Sure. Please go easy on me.

1442
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:13,661
Will do. Thank you for helping us out.

1443
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:43,816
At first, it was nice to be alone

1444
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:51,198
Being able to do whatever I want
Whenever I want

1445
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:58,706
So I thought I had erased
All my memories of you

1446
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:06,255
I really believed that I did

1447
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:10,301
But you see

1448
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:14,346
When I wake up alone early in the morning

1449
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:17,516
And realize

1450
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:23,314
That you're no longer with me

1451
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:32,698
I cry without even realizing it

1452
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:38,329
Have you changed at all?

1453
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:43,834
The way you talked
Always put a smile on my face

1454
01:38:43,917 --> 01:38:48,672
Do you still talk like that?

1455
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:53,052
I have changed

1456
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:58,265
I don't smile as often as I used to

1457
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:02,645
And I've lost some weight

1458
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:10,152
Compared to when we were together

1459
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:19,912
You understood me

1460
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:27,086
But I thought
You were trying to control me

1461
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:34,760
And thinking a real man
Should never show his emotions

1462
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:41,809
I never once told you that I loved you

1463
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,813
But you see

1464
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:53,153
When I fill a blank piece of paper
With your name

1465
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:59,410
And call you to hear your voice

1466
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:08,752
I cry without even realizing it

1467
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:14,341
Have you changed at all?

1468
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:19,888
I used to love your smile so much

1469
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:24,727
Do you still have that beautiful smile?

1470
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:29,231
I have changed

1471
01:40:29,314 --> 01:40:34,278
I don't smile as often as I used to

1472
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:38,574
And I've lost some weight

1473
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:45,372
Compared to when we were together

1474
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:50,919
How's he doing?

1475
01:40:51,503 --> 01:40:56,842
Does he treat you well enough

1476
01:40:56,925 --> 01:41:01,221
That you can forget
All our moments together?

1477
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:05,809
You should be happy

1478
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:11,148
Because you met

1479
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:15,903
A wonderful person

1480
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:20,032
Who can do the things

1481
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:27,080
That I wasn't able to do for you

1482
01:41:40,385 --> 01:41:41,386
Well done!

1483
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,978
I'm getting teary-eyed.

1484
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:56,235
Gosh, seriously.

1485
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:57,528
I'm sorry.

1486
01:41:59,154 --> 01:42:01,698
Did he make a mistake again?

1487
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:04,827
It's about Dr. Chu
fainting from her stomach cramps.

1488
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,037
Instead of messaging the residents,

1489
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,498
he sent the message
to the OB-GYN group chat.

1490
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:10,999
All the professors are there.

1491
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:14,503
I'm sorry.

1492
01:42:15,712 --> 01:42:17,756
It's okay. It happens.

1493
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:21,844
-So? Did all the professors come?
-No.

1494
01:42:22,761 --> 01:42:26,056
They just messaged back and said,
"Get well soon." It's the weekend.

1495
01:42:27,724 --> 01:42:29,142
One of them came.

1496
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,727
Who?

1497
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:32,938
Professor Yang Seok-hyeong.

1498
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,452
Nurse…

1499
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,455
Hui-su…

1500
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,125
I'm delirious.

1501
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:58,130
I'm seeing things.

1502
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:11,059
Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul?

1503
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:15,230
Yes, Min-ha. Are you uncomfortable?
Should I raise the bed more?

1504
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:18,025
No. Who's the person standing next to you?

1505
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:25,157
Beside you… Is that…

1506
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:28,410
Professor Yang, is that you?

1507
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:30,370
Yes, it's me.

1508
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:34,750
Are you all right?

1509
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,126
Are the cramps gone?

1510
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:50,015
Professor…

1511
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:52,517
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

1512
01:43:55,103 --> 01:43:57,230
Does it hurt? Are you in pain?

1513
01:43:57,314 --> 01:43:59,191
Should I call Gwang-hyeon?

1514
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,320
No. I'm just so happy.

1515
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,281
Don't call anyone.

1516
01:44:07,991 --> 01:44:08,909
What?

1517
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:28,845
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1518
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:32,057
You can go home tomorrow.

1519
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:34,601
Everything looks good,
including the ultrasound.

1520
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:37,813
It's all thanks to you, Professor Kim.

1521
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:41,483
I think the surgery went very well.

1522
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:47,030
One thing though.
The surgery site feels okay,

1523
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:49,950
but my chest feels tight. It hurts.

1524
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:52,202
My back and spine hurt too.

1525
01:44:52,285 --> 01:44:53,537
Is that okay?

1526
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:56,206
The pain is caused by the pressure

1527
01:44:56,289 --> 01:44:58,291
applied on your ligaments
and cartilaginous joints

1528
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,584
during the open-chest surgery.

1529
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:02,504
We'll make sure
to give you enough pain killers.

1530
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:05,382
The doctor here will go over

1531
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:08,844
all the post-discharge instructions
with you again.

1532
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:10,887
Talk soon.

1533
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:18,020
Dad, I'll just throw this out.

1534
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:30,532
I get to go home
before you do, young man. Be well.

1535
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:34,244
Thank you, sir.

1536
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:39,207
Take care of yourself and stay healthy.

1537
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,712
Heart surgery after a liver transplant.

1538
01:45:43,795 --> 01:45:45,380
It's very impressive.

1539
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:47,674
You're invincible, young man.

1540
01:45:50,218 --> 01:45:52,763
No, you're more impressive.

1541
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,265
At your age,

1542
01:45:56,475 --> 01:45:59,561
you managed to endure
such a difficult surgery.

1543
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,857
I have huge respect for you, sir.

1544
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:06,318
I was just being greedy.

1545
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:11,114
I got greedy
because I wanted to live long.

1546
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:14,367
But you still have
a long life ahead of you.

1547
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:20,499
Don't let your illness beat you down.

1548
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:24,252
Survive no matter what, okay?

1549
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:27,547
Yes. I will, sir.

1550
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,054
Hello.

1551
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:38,225
You seem well today.
You've been eating well, right?

1552
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:39,559
Yes.

1553
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:43,021
All the nurses here
take such good care of me.

1554
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,273
It's nicer than being at home.

1555
01:46:47,025 --> 01:46:50,028
We have to run
a few more tests before the surgery,

1556
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:51,321
but they're all easy ones.

1557
01:46:51,404 --> 01:46:52,906
It's okay.

1558
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:56,701
I even got through chemotherapy, you know.

1559
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:01,623
Getting these tests done
and undergoing surgery is no big deal.

1560
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,209
I can get through it, no problem.

1561
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:08,964
Your family is here, right?

1562
01:47:10,048 --> 01:47:11,591
Who's looking after you?

1563
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:13,552
Hello.

1564
01:47:15,428 --> 01:47:17,264
Your son is looking after you?

1565
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:18,306
Yes.

1566
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:22,310
Yes. My daughter got a job,

1567
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,687
so he'll stay here with me.

1568
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,647
Mom, aren't I better than your daughter?

1569
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,607
Aren't I better at this than she is?

1570
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:32,070
I'm a better cook than Min-seo is.

1571
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:35,699
Gosh, don't be silly.
This isn't a competition.

1572
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,578
-Hey, it hurts.
-Hang in there!

1573
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:42,789
-You brat.
-Hold on. This side too.

1574
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:43,748
My gosh!

1575
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:45,041
CHANGWON
TAXI

1576
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,710
The earliest one.

1577
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:49,629
The earliest one? Hold on.

1578
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:52,966
Is there a seat left?
No, not for the earlier ones.

1579
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:54,217
Then it doesn't matter.

1580
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:57,387
Hey, who did you drink with
that you missed the last train?

1581
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:59,723
Gosh, those drunkards.

1582
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:02,893
Both of my parents
and even my sister can drink a lot.

1583
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:05,520
I see. You drank at home?

1584
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:08,773
Your mom got to see
both of her children on her birthday.

1585
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:10,317
She must have been so happy.

1586
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,234
Yes.

1587
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,403
I booked it. I'll text you the details.

1588
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,155
Thanks.

1589
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:17,574
You're thanking me? You must be drunk.

1590
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:31,838
CHANGWON, SEOUL

1591
01:50:22,907 --> 01:50:25,952
Did you hear? They went to
the finals without losing a point.

1592
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:27,746
Their opponents
never got more than five points.

1593
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:29,205
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

1594
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,999
It's going to be fierce.

1595
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:33,251
- I'll be back. I can do this!
- You can do this!

1596
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:34,336
You can do this.

1597
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:35,545
Let's go.

1598
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:40,550
I'll come back victorious.

1599
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:43,386
Let's do this.

1600
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:48,391
I was hoping
we could meet up and just talk.

1601
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:51,644
Is something up? It's nothing bad, is it?

1602
01:50:51,728 --> 01:50:54,397
I'll tell you everything later.

1603
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:57,567
Right now, my head is all over the place.

1604
01:50:57,650 --> 01:50:59,611
Jun-wan knows you're in Korea.

1605
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:02,781
I thought you were meeting
Professor Kim today.

1606
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:04,199
What's going on?

1607
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:09,871
I performed a transfusion,
but the vitals are dropping.

1608
01:51:09,954 --> 01:51:14,959
When I was sick, I refused
to listen to what others were saying.

1609
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:17,253
So, Rosa,

1610
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:22,217
think only about your life
and just have fun every day.

1611
01:51:24,594 --> 01:51:29,599
