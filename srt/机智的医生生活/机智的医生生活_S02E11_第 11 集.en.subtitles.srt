00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:29,047
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LEE IK-JUN

2
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,302
My purse.

3
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,559
Gosh, seriously.

4
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,124
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

5
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,962
-Hello, Professor Chae.
-Hello.

6
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,964
You had to work late again?

7
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,135
I actually got to leave early for once
but had to come back.

8
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,387
Over and over again.

9
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,307
Maybe it's a sign that
I should get ready for the conference.

10
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,934
-Are you on duty tonight?
-Yes.

11
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,896
Professor Kim went to Itaewon.

12
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,147
I know.

13
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,399
I ran into Professor Ahn
in the hallway earlier

14
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,610
and saw Professor Yang leave for the day.

15
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,363
As for Professor Lee,
he has a team dinner in Gangnam.

16
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,240
How do you know everything?

17
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,869
I'm usually with Professor Kim all day,

18
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,370
so I just hear these things.

19
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,123
Isn't it Professor Lee's birthday today?

20
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,792
Tell him I said, "Happy birthday."

21
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,754
I won't see Ik-jun today.

22
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,005
Just in case though.

23
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,009
If you do see him,
please wish him a happy birthday for me.

24
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,053
Okay, I will.

25
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,685
The pain is severe. Get that under control

26
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,063
and take an X-ray to check the bones.

27
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,147
Sure.

28
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,153
Yulje Emergency Center.

29
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,822
We have a trauma patient.
A male in his 40s.

30
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,283
Mental status, drowsy. BP 150 over 90.

31
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,244
Heart rate is 80, 12 breaths per minute.

32
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,704
And his temperature
is 36.7 degrees Celsius.

33
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
He collapsed

34
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,084
after getting hit by someone
in the back of the head.

35
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,711
We checked his ID
while checking his mental status,

36
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,213
and he's a doctor at Yulje.

37
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,589
He's a doctor here?

38
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,593
What's his name?

39
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,674
BONG GWANG-HYEON

40
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,975
Hello?

41
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,731
119 RESCUE SERVICES

42
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,525
What happened? Was it a robbery?

43
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,194
I think so. We went there
because someone called it in.

44
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,698
According to the witnesses,
he was hit with a rock from behind.

45
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,541
Let's move him. One, two, three.

46
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,389
LEE IK-JUN

47
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,935
Ik-jun, do you know
where you are right now?

48
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,317
Lee Ik-jun. Can you hear me?

49
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,568
Hey, Lee Ik-jun!

50
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,780
Yes, I can hear you very well.

51
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,658
You'll blow out my eardrums.

52
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,746
Keep it down. We're in the hospital.

53
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,167
How's your neck? Does it hurt?

54
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,503
No, it's okay.

55
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,891
He can obey commands.
Let's do an IV injection and a CT scan.

56
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,227
Okay. Then I'll go book the CT scan first.

57
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,692
Did you fly?
I know you were already here, but still.

58
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,903
Song-hwa is here.

59
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,618
We haven't done a CT scan yet,
but his pupils are okay and…

60
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,788
Can you hear me?

61
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,835
Hey, Ik-jun. Can you hear me?

62
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,139
Can you raise your left arm?

63
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,689
Can you clench your right hand?

64
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,834
I'm so sleepy right now, Song-hwa.

65
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,795
I'm going to get some sleep.

66
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,760
-Let's do a CT scan right away.
-Yes, we should.

67
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,974
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

68
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,225
LEE IK-JUN

69
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,199
He's okay. Don't worry too much.

70
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,370
He has a subdural hematoma
on the right side.

71
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,206
Is the bleeding bad?

72
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,874
Thankfully, it's not too bad.

73
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,543
There is a skull fracture.

74
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,088
But as for the bleed, it's just forming
a thin layer at the bottom,

75
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,341
so I don't think he needs surgery
at the moment.

76
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,344
But more blood could seep out,

77
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,264
so I want to keep him in the ICU
and monitor him for the next two days.

78
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,225
-He's conscious, right?
-Yes.

79
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,560
He was chatting with me earlier.

80
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,688
Drowsiness can occur in the presence of

81
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,024
a cerebral hemorrhage
caused by blunt head trauma.

82
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,487
If we keep the bleeding
under control and treat it,

83
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,323
his alertness
will be restored in a few days.

84
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,829
Hey, Ik-jun.

85
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,541
Ik-jun, wake up.

86
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,004
Ik-jun, where do you live?

87
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,521
Hey, don't. The light is hurting my eyes.

88
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,318
My pupillary light reflex is intact.

89
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,197
Enough with the light, Andrea.

90
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,501
How did they catch the culprit?

91
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,795
There was a surveillance camera.

92
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,547
The police called us.

93
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,550
Jeong-won has reached out
to Mr. Pyeon, the lawyer.

94
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,510
He's getting things sorted out now.

95
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,222
Shouldn't we contact Ik-jun's family?

96
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,267
I already called Auntie Wang.

97
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,728
I told her not to tell U-ju.

98
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,188
But I didn't call his parents.

99
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,024
We should tell his parents.

100
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,443
I don't have his parents' numbers,

101
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,112
but I know his sister's.
I'll give her a call.

102
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,240
Ik-sun? Is she back in Korea now?

103
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,451
I thought she was in the UK.

104
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,786
She came back. A while ago, actually.

105
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,040
What about all the surgeries
he has booked?

106
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,000
Although that's not important now.

107
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,918
I talked to his chief.

108
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:32,465
He'll take care of the ones booked
for tomorrow and the rest of the week.

109
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,135
As for the ones booked after that,
we'll speak with the patients

110
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,762
and try to reschedule them.

111
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,475
You're going to stay here tonight, right?

112
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,643
Yes.

113
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,186
I'll watch him tomorrow night.

114
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,355
I got it.

115
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,609
You guys can just help me out
a couple of times if need be.

116
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:55,071
You'll be exhausted.
You can stay and watch him tonight,

117
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,989
but we'll take turns starting tomorrow.

118
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,366
I want to…

119
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,827
stay by his side.

120
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,792
Let me, okay?

121
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,503
All right.

122
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,630
Okay.

123
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,886
Get going, guys.

124
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,437
Go home.

125
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,272
It's 2 a.m. already.

126
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,943
You have to come back
in five hours anyway. Go home.

127
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,319
We'll be off, then.

128
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,404
Bye.

129
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,572
Bye.

130
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:32,209
MAY, 1999

131
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,986
Hey.

132
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,114
What are you doing today?

133
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,783
Me?

134
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,077
Why?

135
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,496
Let's go for dinner.

136
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,625
It's your birthday today.

137
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,004
Let's have dinner together
if you've got no plans for this evening.

138
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,842
I'll have dinner with you.

139
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,931
I've got plans.

140
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,852
I have a blind date.

141
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,190
Oh, really?

142
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,737
Does it have to be today?

143
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,866
Can't you move it to another day?

144
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,909
I asked my friend to set it up for me,

145
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,786
so I can't move it.

146
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,415
Maybe another time.

147
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,208
We'll do it another time.

148
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,506
Okay, sure.

149
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,719
Good luck on your blind date. Bye.

150
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,373
He has a minor skull fracture

151
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,249
and a bleed, but it's nothing serious.

152
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,460
We'll monitor him
in the ICU until tonight.

153
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,380
If his condition improves,
we'll move him to a regular ward.

154
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,507
I didn't call you last night

155
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,842
because it's nothing too serious.

156
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,890
He's really okay. Don't worry.

157
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,978
I would've called you last night
if he were in serious condition.

158
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,939
He's conscious
and has no motor control problems.

159
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,857
Song-hwa is with him, right?

160
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,319
Of course. She's his doctor.
You really don't need to worry.

161
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,240
What about your parents though?
Shouldn't we tell them?

162
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,326
They're away on a trip.
They're in Europe now.

163
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,287
I think it'd be best not to tell them.

164
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,831
I'll go to Seoul.

165
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,958
If I submit a time-off request today,

166
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,085
I should be able to leave within two days.

167
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,963
Don't sweat it. We have many people
who can look after him.

168
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,049
Just come once you have
your work schedule sorted out.

169
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,468
No. U-ju will want to know
where his dad is.

170
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,263
I should be there.

171
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,765
Are you sure? All right, then.

172
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,309
None of us can stay
by his side during the day,

173
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,936
so it'd be good to have you there.

174
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,398
-Travel safely.
-Okay.

175
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,607
All right, then.

176
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,695
I guess you and Ik-jun's sister
are pretty close.

177
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,613
I didn't know.

178
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,783
We are close.

179
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,536
She's my buddy's sister.

180
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,538
Of course, we're close.

181
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,582
Let's go. We'll be late.

182
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,461
Mr. An, you said you went to the clinic

183
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,421
due to severe headaches, right?

184
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,922
Yes.

185
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,884
They did an MRI and a CT scan

186
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,761
and told us to go to a bigger hospital.

187
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,098
Doctor, is it something serious?

188
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,441
See this white part
on the right side of your brain?

189
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,943
It's a tumor.

190
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,780
We'll have to do a biopsy to be sure,

191
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,990
but based on the MRI results,

192
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,493
I think it's a meningioma,
which is a type of tumor.

193
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,956
But meningiomas are usually benign,

194
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,043
so they're not as worrisome as cancer.

195
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,505
But as you can see here,

196
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,259
the MRI results show
that it's about 3.2cm which is quite big,

197
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,054
so I recommend surgery.

198
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,895
I also see some swelling in the brain.

199
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,358
If the tumor grows further,
the swelling will get worse too.

200
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,569
Then neurological conditions
such as hemiplegia and convulsions

201
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,531
could occur due to
the increased intracranial pressure.

202
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,409
I suggest we remove the tumor
before that happens.

203
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,789
So you're saying
I have a brain tumor, right?

204
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,251
I never once thought

205
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,338
I'd develop a brain tumor.

206
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,678
We'll need to run additional tests
once we check you in,

207
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,430
but meningiomas have
a low risk of recurrence

208
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,891
after complete resection,

209
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,936
and they don't spread,

210
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,980
so the prognosis is pretty good.

211
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,984
And it's not a difficult location
to operate on.

212
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,571
Don't worry too much.

213
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,699
Can he be admitted today?

214
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,035
Can he undergo surgery
as soon as possible?

215
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,122
We should be able to admit him today.

216
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,333
The nurses outside
will go over the details with you.

217
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
Thank you.

218
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,386
My gosh.

219
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,266
Let's go have lunch.

220
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,642
Would you like to join us?

221
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,687
My wife has her OB-GYN appointment,
so we'll have lunch together.

222
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,398
Then I'll pass.
You two can enjoy your lunch.

223
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,984
-Then who will you eat with?
-I'll figure it out.

224
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,322
Wait. Shouldn't you start
taking appointments now?

225
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,950
How about Friday mornings?

226
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,244
No, it's okay.

227
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,290
It's not okay. You should start
because you're a second-year fellow now.

228
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,958
We'll start soon, so get ready.

229
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,503
No! It's really okay.

230
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,797
I'm totally okay with not starting yet.

231
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,800
Have a good lunch.

232
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,944
Can we have a ten-minute venting session?

233
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,320
Come to the center garden.

234
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,869
Are those in first year
still having a hard time?

235
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,748
One of them is
way too comfortable around us,

236
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,668
while the other one is
still having such a hard time.

237
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,672
Do you know Yoon-hee? Seo Yoon-hee.

238
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,383
She's very hardworking and smart.

239
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,593
She's a true asset,
which is rare these days.

240
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,970
Okay, what about her?

241
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,266
Clearly,
she's too comfortable around us now.

242
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,185
She talks to us as if we're her friends.

243
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,524
Yoon-hee, did you dress
patient Lee Da-rae yet?

244
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,150
Yeah.

245
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,694
I see. Great.

246
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:23,282
And Professor Yeom asked us to gather
all the materials for the conference.

247
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,409
Right.

248
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,868
On preeclampsia cases.

249
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,249
That's right. Are you done with that?
When will it be done?

250
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,919
I'm almost done. I can show you tonight.

251
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,462
Okay, thanks.

252
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,672
All right.

253
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,595
It's her habit. A speech habit.

254
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,140
I've seen people like that.

255
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,643
I know she means well,
so I can't say anything about it.

256
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,603
She's a really good kid.

257
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,399
-Who's the other one?
-Well…

258
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,443
There she is.

259
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,862
Eun-mi. Dr. Ki Eun-mi!

260
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,906
Oh, hello.

261
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,033
Did you have lunch?

262
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,327
I'm going to eat now.

263
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,953
I see. Why don't you join us…

264
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,749
Enjoy your…

265
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,959
Enjoy your lunch.

266
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,175
Out of all the introverts I've met,
she's the quietest one.

267
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,886
She was going to join Internal Medicine,

268
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,637
but her parents are OB-GYN doctors

269
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,515
and want her to take over their clinic,
so she joined OB-GYN.

270
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,726
But she has realized
that she's better suited

271
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,353
for studying and writing papers
than treating patients.

272
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,107
She'll stay until the end of the year
for her colleagues

273
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,859
but wants to leave next year.

274
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,404
I'm surprised she told you these things.
You said she's an introvert.

275
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,573
I kept asking her.

276
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,659
I took her out to lunch
and even went to drink together

277
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,662
because she didn't seem to get along
with others.

278
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,332
But that's just her personality.

279
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,586
But she's a good kid.

280
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,006
-You say that about everyone.
-I really mean it.

281
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,676
She's quiet and a bit antisocial,
but she's diligent and thorough.

282
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,679
Gosh, anyway…

283
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,017
Should we go to the movies this weekend?

284
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,769
I have some time in the evening.

285
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,607
I have a date with him this weekend.

286
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,777
We're going to the movies together.

287
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,695
No way.

288
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,700
Finally, my dream has come true!

289
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:38,083
Dreams come true
I will protect you

290
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,670
And all my love for you

291
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,298
Today, we did
a nuchal translucency screening.

292
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,761
The baby's crown-rump length is 5.2cm,

293
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,763
which is ideal
for this stage of pregnancy.

294
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,517
And the nuchal translucency
is about 1.5mm,

295
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,394
which is normal.

296
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,067
And look.
The fetus is moving a lot, right?

297
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,738
We did see some limb movement last time,

298
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,117
but the movements are stronger
and bigger now.

299
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,120
I guess our baby takes after me.

300
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,456
I hope it doesn't tire out my wife though.

301
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,959
It's a good thing the baby is active.

302
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,087
Hyo-ju, have you been eating well?

303
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,757
Not really.
She can't eat as much as she used to.

304
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,720
You need to eat well

305
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,221
to get through chemotherapy.

306
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,808
-It'll help the baby too.
-Okay, Professor.

307
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,061
I'll see you again in four weeks.

308
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,732
Your baby is doing well,

309
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,151
so just focus on your health.

310
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,528
Thank you, Professor.

311
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,239
Thank you, Professor Yang.
Next time, I will--

312
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,199
Buy me dinner.

313
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,408
Yes, for sure.

314
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,997
Geon-tae is back? When did he arrive?

315
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,790
Yesterday.

316
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,460
Tae-ung texted me.

317
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,629
He didn't even call you?

318
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,714
No.

319
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,177
He hasn't called me once
ever since I said no to him

320
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,387
when he asked me for money.

321
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,681
I tried calling him, but he didn't answer.

322
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,356
Maybe I should've just given him the money
so I could see him.

323
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,613
I miss the kids.

324
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,325
I may never see them again.

325
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,249
Do you want some soju?

326
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,416
Sure, sounds good.

327
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,046
-I'm going to sleep here tonight.
-Sure.

328
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,010
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

329
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,568
You're smiling?

330
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,616
You're taking your meds, right?

331
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,129
You haven't told Mom and Dad, right?
Don't tell them.

332
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,090
No, I haven't. But I'll tell them
when they're back next week.

333
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,844
Why? They'll be worried. Don't tell them.

334
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,054
I have to. Their dear son hurt his head.

335
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,308
They need to know.
Why should this be a secret?

336
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,476
Go stay in Changwon for a while.

337
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,895
What do you mean?

338
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,981
You won't be able to work
for a while anyway.

339
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,608
Go to Changwon and stay with Mom and Dad.

340
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,945
Eat Mom's home-cooked meals
and rest up before you return to work.

341
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,074
This rings a bell.

342
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,286
Yes, right back at you.

343
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,372
Just leave it to me. I'll figure it out.

344
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,249
U-ju will be here later.

345
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,045
-You told him?
-Yes.

346
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,629
I told him, "Daddy is in the hospital,

347
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,341
so come and give him kisses
so he can feel better soon."

348
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,842
Auntie will bring him later.

349
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,677
U-ju thinks that I'm on night duty.

350
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,596
No, he knows that's not true.

351
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,642
Auntie told him
you were on night duty for a few days.

352
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,563
But U-ju said, "Dad has never worked
two night shifts in a row."

353
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,776
He said he's seen you
going in for emergencies,

354
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,611
but never consecutive night shifts.

355
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,823
My nephew is such a smarty-pants.

356
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,870
I didn't want to lie to U-ju

357
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,832
because your condition isn't too serious.

358
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,045
I explained the situation to U-ju,
and he understood.

359
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,797
He really misses you.

360
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,591
I know you miss him too.

361
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,595
Yes, good job.

362
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,143
Hold on.
My sister deserves a prize for this.

363
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,147
I'm not sure if I can still do this but…

364
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,440
Don't do it.

365
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,234
Coo.

366
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,821
Coo.

367
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,825
Hey, how are you feeling?

368
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,202
Coo.

369
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,037
Don't you have surgery?

370
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,373
There's a delay.

371
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,170
Say hi. This is my sister.

372
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,719
Hey, you're here.

373
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,221
Hi, Jun-wan.

374
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,556
When did you get here?

375
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,683
About an hour ago.

376
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,563
Where is Song-hwa?

377
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,066
-Where is she?
-She said she'd come

378
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,736
after her appointments,
but I guess she's running behind.

379
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,281
She said she'd cut down on work,
but she's busier now

380
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,701
because I haven't been nagging her.

381
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,874
Professor Chae.

382
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,710
About An Sang-mo,

383
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,004
the convexity meningioma patient
from yesterday.

384
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,090
Yes. What about him? Did you
find something in the CT angiogram?

385
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,427
Yes, we took one just now. It's showing
an ophthalmic artery aneurysm.

386
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,139
-An ophthalmic artery aneurysm?
-Yes.

387
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,808
Oh, dear.

388
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,186
Should we proceed with DSA?

389
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,313
Is the aneurysm
clearly visible in the CTA?

390
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,397
Yes, it is.

391
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,486
If he has an ophthalmic artery aneurysm,
we'll have to use coils.

392
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,155
But his kidney function is borderline,

393
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:45,366
so he can't handle frequent administration
of contrast agents.

394
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,078
If he needs coils, we'll do it right away.
Send me the results.

395
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,122
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

396
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,047
Suction.

397
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,303
Hey, you can't even
pass it to me properly?

398
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,513
I'm sorry, sir.

399
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,979
What can you do when you can't
even hand over a tool properly?

400
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,023
I apologize.

401
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,317
How did you even become a doctor?

402
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,821
Your parents know
that you're dull-witted, right?

403
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,033
I bet they're over the moon
that you're a doctor now.

404
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,869
I'm sorry, sir.

405
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,163
Is that all you can say?

406
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,292
You're not smart and are slow-witted.
What am I going to do with you?

407
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,547
-Bipolar forceps.
-Yes, Professor.

408
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,814
Another all-nighter?

409
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,651
-Me? No, I slept well.
-No, Jun-wan.

410
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,070
Oh, he got no sleep last night.

411
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,866
He was on duty last night.
We chatted for a while,

412
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,952
then he had to go into emergency surgery
and left the OR at 5 a.m.

413
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,081
This morning, he did rounds
and had two conferences,

414
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,416
so he didn't get any sleep.

415
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,963
Jae-hak, do you need me now?

416
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:29,178
Five minutes? Okay.
Then I'll grab a coffee and come down.

417
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,263
All right.

418
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,391
Ik-sun, I want cake.

419
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,476
Can you get me
a piece of cake from the café?

420
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,187
And get ten cups of coffee
for the nurses too.

421
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,397
Sure, no problem.

422
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,443
-Can I have your card?
-Hey!

423
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,111
I was just kidding.

424
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,030
Let's go. It's on me.

425
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,948
Okay.

426
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,576
You can pay for things with that badge?

427
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,830
Yes. We can use this at the cafeteria
and the convenience store.

428
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,458
I see. When did you take that photo?

429
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,459
Last year.

430
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,686
I'm looking at it now.

431
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,563
We should tell him right away, right?

432
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,564
For sure.

433
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,318
Prior to every brain tumor surgery,

434
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,072
we take a CT angiogram
to check the cerebral arteries.

435
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,782
And the results show…

436
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,825
I'm not sure if it's good or bad,

437
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,538
but we found an ophthalmic artery aneurysm
that's about 8mm in diameter.

438
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,248
An aneurysm?

439
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,127
A ruptured aneurysm can kill you, right?

440
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,879
Not always.

441
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,132
Unruptured brain aneurysms
usually have no symptoms,

442
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,260
so they could rupture suddenly.
And in such cases,

443
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,763
the mortality rate is very high.

444
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,182
Doctor.

445
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,936
Does it mean he'll undergo
two different types of surgery at once?

446
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,064
No. The thing is, that can't be done.

447
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,567
He'll require general anesthesia
for the surgery.

448
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,653
But the change in his blood pressure

449
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:12,031
during induction and recovery
could cause the aneurysm to rupture.

450
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,368
So it'd be safer
to treat the aneurysm first.

451
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:19,455
I suggest we remove the tumor after that.

452
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,713
But the problem is…

453
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:31,426
In this case, the aneurysm
is in the ophthalmic artery.

454
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,137
The tests we've done

455
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,640
show that your ophthalmic artery
is branching off of the aneurysm.

456
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,475
In other words,

457
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,396
the aneurysm and the ophthalmic artery
are stuck together.

458
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,900
In cases like this, we perform
a procedure called coil embolization

459
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,361
where a catheter is inserted
into the femoral artery

460
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,739
to treat the aneurysm in the brain.

461
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,658
But while performing this procedure,

462
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,369
if we fill the entire aneurysm with coils,

463
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,539
the ophthalmic artery will be blocked,
which may cause vision loss.

464
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,124
That's why

465
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:07,545
we must make sure
the opening of the artery is not filled.

466
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,300
But in Mr. An's case,
the aneurysm and the artery are adjoined,

467
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,720
so it'll be difficult
to just fill the aneurysm.

468
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,807
And the chances are low,

469
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,811
but if there's a weak spot,

470
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,441
the aneurysm could rip,
leading to bleeding during the procedure.

471
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,153
If that happens, our priority will be
to block that spot as quickly as possible,

472
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,155
so we won't be able to save the artery.

473
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,492
We'll have to stop the bleeding
at all costs and wrap up.

474
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,787
That could also result
in ophthalmic artery blockage

475
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,705
and vision loss.

476
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
Doctor.

477
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,834
I don't want the surgery.

478
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,757
How could I undergo the surgery
knowing I could lose my eyesight?

479
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,344
Forget it. I'll just live with this.

480
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,848
You may experience vision loss,

481
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,852
but if the aneurysm ruptures,
your life will be at risk.

482
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,566
I wasn't asking you to decide
whether you want to treat the aneurysm.

483
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,487
I was just trying to explain
your treatment plan.

484
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,699
We'll do our very best to make sure
you do not lose your eyesight.

485
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,452
And even if it were to occur,

486
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,789
I'd like to emphasize that
you should get your aneurysm treated.

487
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,835
No. I'll just leave it.

488
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,837
I don't want to go through the procedure.

489
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,464
Honey, I don't want to do it.

490
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,550
I won't do it.

491
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,469
Then you could collapse
from a brain hemorrhage anytime.

492
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,304
Stop talking nonsense!

493
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:49,355
I understand he's scared, but he won't
decide to leave the aneurysm untreated.

494
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:53,734
It could cause vision loss,
but a ruptured aneurysm will be fatal.

495
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,572
He suddenly found out
about his brain tumor and the aneurysm.

496
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,574
On top of that, he could lose his vision.

497
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,909
Anyone would have a hard time
accepting that.

498
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,120
Check in on him often
and explain it in detail.

499
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,204
Okay.

500
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,290
You should have lunch.

501
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,335
Yes, I should. I'll eat in Ik-jun's room.
What about you?

502
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,006
Seon-bin said she ordered burgers
because Seong-yeong was craving it.

503
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,133
Is something up with him?

504
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,719
He's going through hell right now.

505
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:33,983
Seong-yeong, you're probably angry
and upset but hungry at the same time.

506
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,568
Yes.

507
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:40,281
Why would he scold me so much
when I made a tiny mistake?

508
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:45,244
I was the one who made the mistake.
He didn't have to talk about my parents.

509
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,915
Just think of them
as auto-completed sentences.

510
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,792
Just like, "I'm a boy, you're a girl."

511
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,296
Did he ask you if your parents knew
how dull-witted you were?

512
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,173
Yes.

513
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,176
That means you're still in stage one.

514
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,094
In stage three,

515
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,139
he'll say he's going to stop you
from taking the board exam.

516
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,476
Then what's stage two?

517
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,272
"This idiot can't scrub in for my surgery!

518
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,441
I don't even want to see him
when I do rounds!"

519
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,818
I heard them all.

520
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,654
Of course, we all have.

521
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,156
Everyone hears it
when assisting Professor Min Gi-jun.

522
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,453
Seong-yeong, I'm afraid
I don't have any helpful advice for you,

523
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,583
Just hang in there.
You've been through so much.

524
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,419
I'm not quitting.

525
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,631
After next week,
I can assist Professor Chae.

526
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,424
Professor Chae can be scary too.

527
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,219
I know, but at least
she doesn't react emotionally.

528
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,763
I'm never insulted
even when she scolds me harshly.

529
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,183
In fact, she helps me reflect
on what I did and learn what I did wrong.

530
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,435
And naturally, you'll study all night.

531
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,480
That's exactly why we joined Neurosurgery.

532
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,483
Oh, hello.

533
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,068
And she will too.

534
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,403
Sorry?

535
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,487
Nothing. Come and eat.

536
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,199
Is this lunch or dinner?

537
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,744
Thanks for the food.

538
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,089
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

539
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,724
This time, let's do…

540
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,602
spades.

541
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,324
That's a fake.

542
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,871
My gosh!

543
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,624
Let's do hearts this time.

544
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,043
That's a fake.

545
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,797
Are you sure?

546
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,553
Can I take it back?

547
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,514
Are you sure?

548
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,100
Gosh…

549
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,231
No, I'm sticking with it. It's a fake.

550
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,399
Darn it.

551
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,035
I'm totally at a disadvantage here!

552
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,621
Hey, you were the one
who wanted to play this.

553
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,165
Look. I can't even hold the cards.

554
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,626
It's okay. Who cares?

555
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,087
If you don't mind,
can I put this one in there too?

556
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,588
No!

557
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,632
-Come here.
-Hold on.

558
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,050
-What?
-Will you hit me hard?

559
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,552
-No. Wait, your hair.
-For real?

560
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,101
Is U-ju here?

561
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,602
Don't go in now.

562
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,651
They're all lovey-dovey right now.

563
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,947
Who's he with?

564
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,073
Song-hwa.

565
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,327
When did they start going out?

566
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,122
They're not dating.
They just hang out all the time.

567
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,125
See for yourself. They're clearly dating.

568
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,423
Gosh, what do I do? Oh, boy.

569
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,808
-Come here. Come on.
-No! Wait.

570
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,352
-Hold on. All right.
-Come on, look.

571
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,647
Take off your glasses.
Come on, take them off.

572
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,900
-Take them off.
-Go easy on me.

573
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,818
-Okay, I will.
-It'll really hurt!

574
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,821
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

575
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,329
Dad!

576
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,539
Gosh, U-ju.

577
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,750
You missed me, right?

578
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,712
-Hello.
-Hello.

579
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,302
My goodness, U-ju.

580
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,388
At home, he never once brought up
how much he missed Dad.

581
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,933
He was keeping it all inside.

582
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,394
I'm okay, U-ju.

583
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,648
Look at me. I'm totally fine.

584
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,817
I just fell
and got a small scratch on my face.

585
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,196
You're not going to show me
your face, sweetie?

586
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,326
See? I'm totally fine. My goodness.

587
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,538
Blow me a kiss right here.

588
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,748
And another kiss here.

589
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,298
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way here at this late hour.

590
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,343
Don't say that.
I should be here, of course.

591
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:38,722
I've been so worried
ever since I heard about what happened.

592
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,142
My heart sank when I heard the news,
and it's still not back up.

593
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,144
I can fix that for you.

594
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,064
Don't laugh.

595
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,941
Your brother is so funny.

596
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,740
I'm relieved to see you cracking jokes.

597
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,659
Don't worry about U-ju.

598
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,579
Just focus on your recovery
and come home soon.

599
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,955
I will, Auntie.

600
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,541
I'll have U-ju sleep in my room with me.

601
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,293
I can go home, right?

602
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,004
Yes. Just stay for dinner
and leave with Auntie.

603
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,839
I'll figure it out.

604
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,340
You should sleep at home too.

605
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,135
I heard you haven't been home
in three days. My gosh.

606
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,637
-Yes, I want to go home today.
-Good.

607
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,264
Seok-hyeong will be here, right?

608
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,141
Yes, he's on duty tonight.

609
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:26,103
Gosh, you guys think
this is the on-call room.

610
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,030
Hey, bear.

611
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,323
What?

612
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,907
How's my Chuchu doing?

613
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,161
Wasn't she here earlier?

614
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,912
She said she had ice cream with you.

615
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,248
Well, what's happening between you two?

616
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,585
Any progress?

617
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,716
I'm having dinner with her this weekend.

618
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,642
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

619
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,518
Why should I tell you?

620
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,146
Do you need my help at all?

621
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,447
Yes, go for dinner and…
Maybe go to the movies too?

622
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,700
Just go to sleep.
That's what you can do to help me.

623
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,883
I know I taught you how to smoke,

624
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,761
but I never taught you
how to fold clean laundry.

625
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,223
Where did you
learn to do this so perfectly?

626
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,144
You're so good at housework.

627
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,980
I really don't know
why you're still not married yet.

628
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,192
What are you getting at, Mom?

629
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,944
You didn't break up

630
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,114
with Ms. Jang, right?

631
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,410
Things are still good
between you two, right?

632
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,037
Yes. In fact,
things are even better between us now.

633
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,956
Why are you worried?

634
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,210
You've been together for a while
but haven't brought up the marriage talk,

635
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,504
so I was wondering if you broke up.

636
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,132
That won't happen, Mother.

637
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,426
Then when are you two
going to get married?

638
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,723
I'm not trying to rush you.
I'm just curious, that's all.

639
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,688
She'll be my one and only
daughter-in-law, you know.

640
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,025
I have lots of things
I want to give to my daughter-in-law.

641
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,696
I've collected many beautiful things
for my future daughter-in-law.

642
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,657
From rings and necklaces to plates…

643
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,411
Mom, I have something to tell you.

644
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,418
My gosh. How could he
do such a thing as a father?

645
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,337
Is her mother okay now?

646
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,632
Yes, she's doing much better.

647
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,759
Last week,
she went out for a walk by herself

648
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,679
and even dropped off dinner for Gyeo-ul
when she was on duty.

649
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,515
Did you meet her?

650
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,101
I wanted to go say hello

651
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,979
but didn't because I thought
it might make her uncomfortable.

652
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,025
I'm waiting for Gyeo-ul to give me a cue.

653
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:26,158
I'm planning to bring up the marriage
once her situation is sorted out.

654
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,452
Now's not a good time.

655
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,871
Okay.

656
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:37,628
Mom, you're not bothered
by her family's situation, right?

657
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,256
It does bother me,

658
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,385
but we both know that it's not her fault.

659
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,308
Despite her situation,
she turned out just fine.

660
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,977
I'm proud of her for that

661
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,271
and feel sorry for her.

662
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,109
You can take good care of her later on.

663
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,488
Give her the rings
and necklaces you mentioned earlier.

664
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,661
Goodness, you're head over heels for her.
Okay, I will!

665
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,162
Right.

666
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:16,041
Is Seok-hyeong really going to the US?
Is it decided?

667
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,548
I heard he may have to move to the US.
His mother is very worried.

668
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,509
He didn't tell me about it yet.

669
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,054
I'm sure it's not happening.
He would have told us if he was leaving.

670
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,391
Why don't you ask him?
Ask him and tell me what he says.

671
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,434
Okay.

672
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,479
-You'll stay over tonight, right?
-Of course.

673
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,149
Right, I have plans this evening.
I have to go out.

674
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,026
This evening? Where are you going?

675
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,861
Jong-su and I are going to the movies.

676
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,030
He's been having trouble falling asleep,

677
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,199
so we'll stay up
and watch a movie together.

678
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,577
-Do you need a ride?
-No, he'll pick me up.

679
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,954
-What about dinner?
-I'll have dinner with him.

680
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,497
You should fix yourself dinner.

681
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,800
Thank you for the dinner, Professor Yang.

682
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,596
You didn't even eat much.

683
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,890
I know. I was so nervous
that I couldn't really eat.

684
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,520
I'm impressed by how
you can just blurt those things out.

685
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,606
Because it's true.

686
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,984
I say these things
without even realizing it.

687
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,490
-We still have some time, right?
-Yes, we have time to buy some popcorn.

688
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,745
Are you cold? Do you want the heater on?

689
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,996
No, I'm okay.

690
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,914
Tell me if you get cold.

691
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:04,149
-Are you sure you can finish them?
-Yes. I'm hungry.

692
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,568
-Let's go, then.
-Okay.

693
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:31,677
This is Theater 5.

694
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,470
The exits on the left

695
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:38,100
and at the center
will lead you to the fire escape.

696
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,352
Please follow instructions from our staff

697
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,270
-Hello.
-in case of an emergency.

698
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,522
My gosh, Seok-hyeong!

699
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,650
Are you here for this movie?

700
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,777
-Hello.
-Hello.

701
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,114
Let's talk later.

702
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,365
Okay.

703
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,451
We're profiting
from the misery of others anyway.

704
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,495
Just enjoy it!

705
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,252
I'm a lawyer and Seo-jun's friend.

706
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,545
She is Jeong-won's mother.

707
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,298
I see.

708
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,843
Vishing is
all about empathizing with victims.

709
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,179
She's Professor Ahn's mother,

710
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,432
and the man sitting next to her
is Chairman Ju.

711
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,171
I had a lot.

712
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,286
You're okay with meeting them, right?

713
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,914
If not, I'll just go say hello. It's okay.

714
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,582
I'm totally fine with it.

715
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,043
Have you never met Mr. Ju?

716
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,712
No, I've only seen photos of him.

717
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,715
They've been friends for many years.
They're just friends.

718
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,927
Then how come they're watching
a movie together at this late hour?

719
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,430
I don't know. I always see them together.

720
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,098
I see.

721
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,267
-Hello.
-Hello.

722
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,602
Did you like the movie?

723
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,313
I enjoyed it. It was good.

724
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,399
You watched the whole thing
without falling asleep.

725
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,652
It was fun. It's a well-made movie.

726
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,363
He doesn't look like he enjoyed it at all.

727
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,491
He always looks grumpy.
This is his happy face.

728
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,328
But you two, on the other hand…
Is this a date?

729
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,540
Yes.

730
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,630
I'll pretend I know nothing.

731
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,590
Your mom will hound you if she finds out.

732
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,968
Right, thank you.

733
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,178
Wait here. I'll go bring the car.

734
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,721
I'll go with you.

735
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,849
I hope to see you again soon.

736
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,184
Me too. Good night.

737
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,353
-We'll be off, then.
-Okay, get home safely.

738
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,614
She looks familiar for some reason.

739
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,993
Maybe she works at Yulje.
Then you must've seen her before.

740
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,787
Right, I should have asked her.

741
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,665
No, why would you?
This was your first time meeting her.

742
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,959
Can you drive? I'm sleepy.

743
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,043
Sure.

744
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,463
You scared me. Hey! Goodness.

745
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,132
I'm so sleepy right now.

746
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,134
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

747
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,512
This evening? Sure, I have time.
We're eating meat?

748
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,389
Yes. Ik-jun will order the food.

749
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,892
Then I'll ask Song-hwa. Why don't you…

750
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,602
Seok-hyeong is here. I'll ask him.

751
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,149
They want to have
a barbecue dinner in Ik-jun's office.

752
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,442
Sounds good.

753
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,069
Beat Song-hwa and Jun-wan by ten minutes?

754
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,907
Yes. Wait, Seok-hyeong.
Are you moving to the US?

755
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,287
What?

756
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,750
Tell her that you think
I'm moving to the US.

757
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,210
But you're not.

758
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,130
Of course not. Why would I move to the US?

759
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,967
But…

760
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,847
just tell your mother
that you think it's happening.

761
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,726
-Why?
-I'll tell you later.

762
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,145
I'll explain everything later.

763
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,440
All right.

764
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,694
Thanks.

765
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,492
I'm not sure what you're plotting,
but I hope it goes well.

766
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,954
Thanks.

767
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,207
Patient Lee Ik-jun is
the biggest troublemaker?

768
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,878
Yes. Every time I'm there,
I see him viewing his patients' charts

769
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,964
at the nurses' station.

770
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,968
Leave him be. At least
he's not doing rounds in his patient gown.

771
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,304
My gosh, hello.

772
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,100
Hello, Professor Chae.

773
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:34,521
How have you been? You look tired.

774
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,148
Ask the other family members
to take turns with you.

775
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,527
I'm okay. My daughter's the one
who's having a hard time.

776
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,655
All I do is just stay by her side.
I don't do anything else.

777
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,699
What are you talking about?

778
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,410
You're staying strong
to be there for your daughter.

779
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,328
Not everyone can do what you're doing.

780
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,623
Du-na takes it out on you, doesn't she?

781
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,752
Yes. I'm used to it now.

782
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,507
This must be awfully frustrating for her.

783
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:06,219
She's a great dancer,
and she always loved to sing.

784
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:10,181
But now, she can't even say
the things she wants to say

785
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,559
and struggles to do up a button
on her own.

786
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,645
She must be more frustrated
than anybody else is right now.

787
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:20,608
Her recovery is slowing down,
so you're probably exhausted.

788
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,403
But she's really come a long way.

789
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:28,616
If we get over this hurdle,
Du-na will be able to talk

790
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,703
and use her limbs freely again.
I really believe that she will,

791
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,247
so please hang in there.

792
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,207
Yes, I will.

793
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,543
Thank you.

794
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,627
Talk soon.

795
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,689
Du-na, let's try opening this.

796
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,207
It's okay. You did well.

797
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,168
Good job, Du-na. Let's try just once more.

798
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,629
Let's try just one last time.

799
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,175
No.

800
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,887
You're almost there.

801
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,186
I don't want to do it.

802
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,939
Don't make me do it.

803
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,621
I hope it's good news.

804
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,874
He said he wanted
to speak with you in person,

805
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,626
so it can't be bad news.

806
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,799
Hey, Hong-do. Can you keep your eyes open?

807
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,717
Yes, I'm fine.

808
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,599
-Hello.
-Hi, guys.

809
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,018
-Where are you going?
-To see a patient. You?

810
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,019
I'm going for a nap.

811
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,817
Hong-do.

812
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,734
Yes, Professor.

813
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,028
You're in Pediatric Surgery now?

814
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,948
Yes, I just assisted in TEF surgery.

815
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,159
I see.

816
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,996
You must've inserted a chest tube.

817
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,499
Then how is two-bottle different
from three-bottle?

818
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,713
Well…

819
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,009
Jeez.

820
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,218
Well…

821
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,390
Could you give me a hint?

822
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,475
What?

823
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,020
Could you give me a hint?

824
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,148
Really?

825
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,316
Yes.

826
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,237
The coil something…
I want to undergo that procedure.

827
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,116
I understand it may result in vision loss,
but it may not.

828
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,455
And I'd rather just get it over with
so I could have a peace of mind

829
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:26,169
than live with
a ticking time bomb inside me.

830
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:31,508
Definitely. I'll be well prepared for it.
You made a wise decision.

831
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,552
This doctor here explained everything
so clearly to us.

832
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,765
Thanks to you, he changed his mind.

833
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,146
I don't want to do it, Doctor.

834
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,858
I don't want to undergo that procedure
or the tumor removal surgery.

835
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,152
You should do it, Dad.

836
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,613
I did a lot of research on the Internet.

837
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,659
You're so lucky they found
the brain aneurysm unruptured.

838
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:01,120
I read that many people
collapse in the streets and die.

839
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,789
You should just get it done.

840
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,873
Doctor.

841
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,210
We live hand to mouth.

842
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,170
I'll wait until my kids go to college,

843
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,881
then reconsider it.

844
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:17,095
I can't make such a risky choice
at the moment.

845
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,013
Dad!

846
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:25,144
Well, I can understand
why you're against it,

847
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:32,277
but please allow me
to explain the situation in detail.

848
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,615
This is the CT angiogram
of your cerebral arteries.

849
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,327
I magnified the part
with the aneurysm and printed it for you.

850
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,913
This is the aneurysm.

851
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,623
And this is your ophthalmic artery.

852
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:50,044
As you can see here,
they're almost connected.

853
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,047
We'll place coils into the aneurysm
to block the flow of blood.

854
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,134
I'll be honest. It will be a little risky,

855
00:59:56,217 --> 01:00:00,013
but if we block this side very carefully…

856
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,223
Yes.

857
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,851
You won't lose your eyesight.

858
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,314
Also, the eyes
don't solely rely on this artery.

859
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,108
There are collateral circulation pathways.

860
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,069
If we check
when we're starting the procedure

861
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,280
and see that
those pathways are well developed,

862
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,618
we may be able to prevent vision loss
even if the artery gets blocked

863
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,369
due to bleeding.

864
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,838
With regard to vision loss…

865
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:38,301
We really have no way of knowing.

866
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:42,889
But the risk of death will be much higher
if you decide not to treat the aneurysm.

867
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,768
It'll be like living
with a ticking time bomb inside your head.

868
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:52,231
The statistics show that two-thirds
of subarachnoid hemorrhage cases

869
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,525
caused by a ruptured aneurysm are the ones

870
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,986
where the patients die
before or after arriving at the hospital.

871
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,946
Only one-third of the patients survive.

872
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,366
Even if you get it treated and survive,

873
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,117
you'll likely suffer complications.

874
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,665
I'm aware
that this is a difficult decision.

875
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,792
But if I were you…

876
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,878
Or if you were my family,
I would perform the procedure

877
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,714
and tell you without hesitation
that you need to get it done.

878
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,846
Why don't you discuss it
with your family again?

879
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,725
If you decide against it even after that…

880
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,606
I'll come back
and explain everything one more time.

881
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,447
Seok-min, do you know
what your biggest strength is?

882
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,158
What is it? Do I have a strength?

883
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,995
You're not perfect,
but you always strive to be so.

884
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,080
I see.

885
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,749
It's your biggest charm.

886
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,042
It's a compliment, right?

887
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,711
Of course.

888
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:59,173
I see that you're always doing your best.
I really appreciate that.

889
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,551
Thank you.

890
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:09,225
You're on the right track
to becoming the biggest villain at Yulje.

891
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,236
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

892
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,323
Well, everyone's good.
There's nothing to note.

893
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,367
Just check on Kim Bo-ri for contractions.

894
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,702
Will do.

895
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,254
Dr. Chu, about Yeon Ho-jeong in Room 9.

896
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,465
Her family wants to know what's going on.

897
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,799
Sorry? With what?

898
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,511
Dr. Myeong said she'd talk to them,
but I think you should.

899
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,804
What do you mean?

900
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,556
The patient with the wound problem.

901
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,018
We had a patient like that?
No one told me about this. Hold on.

902
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,895
Patient Yeon Ho-jeong…

903
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,355
Let's see.

904
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,399
She had surgery elsewhere two weeks ago.

905
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:02,737
They stitched it twice but sent her here
because the wound wouldn't close.

906
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,199
It's pretty bad, so we dressed it
and put her on antibiotics.

907
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,160
But no one told me anything
about this patient.

908
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,662
Try calling Dr. Myeong Eun-won.

909
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:15,041
Okay. Gosh, hold on.

910
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,420
The phone is turned off.

911
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,589
Please leave a message after the tone.

912
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,300
What's wrong?

913
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,803
Her phone is off.

914
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,189
I've had the same surgery
but have never even heard of this.

915
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,983
How long will it take
for my sister to recover?

916
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,152
It keeps oozing pus.

917
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,072
And it's opening up again. It's a mess.

918
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,324
She gave birth over two weeks ago.

919
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,992
This is ridiculous.

920
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,372
We kept asking to speak with the doctor,
but she said she was busy

921
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,123
and that she'd come in the evening.

922
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,294
She said she'd wait
until the whole family was here.

923
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,881
Where is she? The doctor with long hair.

924
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:10,930
Gosh, Dr. Chu will be blamed
for everything.

925
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,683
Really?

926
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,061
Yes, Ms. Yeon's mother is intense.

927
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,771
She keeps calling every 30 minutes

928
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,232
with the same questions,
asking for Professor Yang.

929
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,486
Ms. Yeon was admitted only a day ago,
but she keeps complaining.

930
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,156
I'm sure Dr. Myeong knows about this.

931
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,034
I thought she'd talk to them
before she left for the day.

932
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:44,714
This must have been
very stressful for you.

933
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,091
You must feel frustrated and anxious.

934
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,469
But she was transferred here
because her wound opened up again

935
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,055
after they stitched it
for the second time,

936
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,850
so we can't stitch it up again right away.

937
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:01,105
First, we have to get the infection
under control to reduce pus.

938
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,609
Without that,
it'll be pointless to stitch it up again.

939
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:08,988
I'll speak with Professor Yang
and find the most ideal time to treat it

940
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:13,284
to make sure it won't open up again,
so please don't worry.

941
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,083
Even if it's
the exact same surgical procedure,

942
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,086
everyone can react differently,

943
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,047
so recovery is different for everyone.

944
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,174
Well…

945
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,843
Ms. Yeon's doctor

946
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,680
had to leave early today
because something urgent came up.

947
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:39,393
But she knows the situation very well,
so she'll take good care of Ms. Yeon.

948
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,396
I'll remind her one more time.

949
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,440
My goodness.

950
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,444
All right, then.

951
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,213
Gosh, what should I do?

952
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,928
Yes, Professor.

953
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,054
Did you have dinner?

954
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,723
-Not yet.
-Should I pick up some food for you?

955
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:21,435
Something with meat. I want meat.

956
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,561
Try the grilled onion.

957
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,856
Go your own way. I'll do the same.

958
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,442
Gosh, you need to try this.

959
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,653
Those pigs. I didn't know
they'd get here 15 minutes early.

960
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,239
Seriously, we can never beat you two.

961
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,742
You got here before we did
and even picked these up.

962
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,077
-Which sauce?
-Calamansi-wasabi sauce.

963
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,749
Is the pork belly still warm?

964
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,001
Yes, totally.

965
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,130
What? Is this it?

966
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,923
The piggies already devoured it all.

967
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,680
No, I ordered a lot of food.

968
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,849
Seok-hyeong, where's the receipt?

969
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,060
Where did you put it? There it is.

970
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:48,647
I ordered a ton of food. Let's see.

971
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,860
Two, three…

972
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,118
These jerks.

973
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:07,583
When did you have time to order food?
We've been so busy.

974
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,751
I know, right?

975
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,675
My gosh.

976
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:27,103
Hey, Eun-mi! Have some meat.
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

977
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,356
I'm good. Enjoy your dinner.

978
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,526
Okay.

979
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,452
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

980
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:49,875
Is it a difficult case?

981
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,087
A little.

982
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,299
More than a little.

983
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,179
His ophthalmic artery and aneurysm
are almost stuck together.

984
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,058
I've never treated
a case like this before,

985
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,228
so I'm worried.

986
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,531
Get going. You'll miss your train.

987
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,953
You know, right? Even in Changwon,
you can go for short walks,

988
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,663
but avoid strenuous exercise.

989
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,747
All right.

990
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,085
Two weeks will fly by.

991
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,309
RADIATION CONTROLLED AREA

992
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,237
AN SANG-MO

993
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:05,409
The ophthalmic artery
is even closer to the aneurysm

994
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,620
than we saw in the CT angiogram.

995
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,498
And there's no ECA collateral flow.

996
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,002
We have to save the ophthalmic artery
no matter what.

997
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,429
We'll begin now. 8-20, please.

998
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,232
Here's 8-20.

999
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,748
Here.

1000
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:08,097
One more of the same one, please.

1001
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,306
Sure.

1002
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,442
We need 7-15.

1003
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,527
Sure.

1004
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,074
Here's 7-15.

1005
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,296
Let's see
if the ophthalmic artery is okay.

1006
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,755
Okay.

1007
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:13,037
It looks good, right?

1008
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,497
Yes, the flow is good.

1009
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,708
And no blood clots.

1010
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:20,836
Well done.

1011
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,255
Thank you, Professor.

1012
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,345
It went well.

1013
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:34,266
There was no bleeding,
and we managed to block the aneurysm.

1014
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,851
When doing the final check,

1015
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:39,146
we confirmed the blood flow
into the ophthalmic artery,

1016
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,607
so the chances of him
losing his eyesight are slim,

1017
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,861
but we'll do a visual field test
to be sure once he wakes up.

1018
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,446
We're waking him up now.

1019
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:51,283
We'll move him to the ICU right away.
You can see him there.

1020
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,535
So he won't lose his eyesight?

1021
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:55,454
He's okay, right?

1022
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,374
At the moment, yes. I think so.

1023
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,627
But we'll have to do a vision range test
after he wakes up.

1024
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,295
Then we'll talk again.

1025
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:05,005
Okay, Doctor.

1026
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,800
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1027
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:08,926
Thank you, Doctor.

1028
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,344
Talk soon.

1029
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:19,937
Mr. An.

1030
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,107
Can you open your eyes?

1031
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:29,279
Everything went well.

1032
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,872
Mr. An, can you see me?

1033
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,048
Can you cover your right eye?

1034
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,265
Can you see this?

1035
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,435
How many fingers do you see?

1036
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:01,979
Two.

1037
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,733
Can you see them clearly?

1038
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:10,070
No double vision or blurriness?

1039
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,196
No.

1040
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:13,991
I see them clearly.

1041
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,290
Have you arrived yet?

1042
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,792
Probably not.
You're still on the train, right?

1043
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,586
Did it go well? How did it go?

1044
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:28,714
It went well.

1045
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,176
My gosh, that's great.
Well done. You did it.

1046
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:34,887
I called you to brag about it.

1047
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,930
Whereabouts are you now? Daejeon?

1048
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,433
Good job. My gosh.

1049
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,602
I knew you'd pull it off.

1050
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,732
You didn't go?

1051
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,360
No. Seeing how worried you were earlier,

1052
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,071
I had to change my ticket
to see you before I leave.

1053
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,094
So will Professor Lee be back
in two weeks, then?

1054
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,805
Yes. He went to Changwon today.

1055
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,100
-It's over there, right?
-Yes.

1056
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,857
Thank you.

1057
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,942
No problem.

1058
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:34,988
What?

1059
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,617
I'll walk you to your door.

1060
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,578
-Is it this way?
-Yes.

1061
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,394
Professor.

1062
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,687
Yes?

1063
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,189
I'm curious about something.

1064
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,986
I'm already scared. What is it this time?

1065
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,320
Go ahead. What is it?

1066
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:17,364
Well…

1067
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:31,628
Are you not going to tell me
how you feel about me?

1068
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:38,176
If you ask me out, my answer is yes.

1069
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,309
Don't laugh.

1070
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,231
We are…

1071
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,193
seeing each other now, right?

1072
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,450
But you're not asking me
to be your girlfriend

1073
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:03,910
and won't tell me how you feel.

1074
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,960
I'm just wondering
if I got the wrong idea.

1075
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,011
What will you do

1076
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,349
if I'm not a good person?

1077
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:31,021
What if I'm a freak?

1078
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:37,069
You're quite reckless, I must say.

1079
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,155
If that's the case…

1080
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:44,159
It is what it is. I'll just blame my fate.

1081
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,416
But Professor.

1082
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,295
You know…

1083
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:59,007
I'm a good person.

1084
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:07,140
I'm actually a better person

1085
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,103
than you think I am,

1086
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,689
so you don't need to worry about me.

1087
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:20,987
But we are…

1088
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,701
seeing each other, right?

1089
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,412
You do have…

1090
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,125
feelings for me, right?

1091
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,341
Do I

1092
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,177
have to say it?

1093
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,021
I like you.

1094
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:01,111
I like you too.

1095
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,702
So…

1096
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,246
you can stop…

1097
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,835
confessing your feelings now.

1098
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:07,761
Kim Geon? Dr. Kim Geon in second year?

1099
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:11,306
Yes. He didn't come in to the ICU
this morning, and his phone is off.

1100
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,560
-Can someone go to his place?
-Ji-woo did.

1101
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,438
He's not there,
and he's not at his parents' place either.

1102
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:22,609
Maybe he fell asleep in the sauna,
or his phone died.

1103
01:20:22,692 --> 01:20:24,528
Wait another hour or two

1104
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,446
and call me if he still hasn't called.

1105
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,156
-Okay.
-All right.

1106
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,661
A second-year resident has gone AWOL?

1107
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,204
Yes, I think so.

1108
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:38,083
He's been covering the ICU.
It's physically exhausting, you know.

1109
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,584
Someone probably picked on him.

1110
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,754
Who? Even the chiefs
are in their second year.

1111
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,506
Right.

1112
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:49,553
Gyeo-ul, Dr. Jong, and the fellows
are his only senior colleagues,

1113
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:54,641
but none of them
would ever pick on anyone.

1114
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,019
And the professor?

1115
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:03,024
When a resident goes AWOL, the professor
and senior residents are usually to blame.

1116
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:06,236
There are no third-year residents,
so it must be the professor.

1117
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:20,417
Let's see.

1118
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,629
The bleed in the superior sagittal sinus
must've been severe.

1119
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,716
You did a good job
getting it under control.

1120
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:30,176
You must have been nervous
as it was close to the sinus,

1121
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,928
but the dura opening looks good too.

1122
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,305
Thank you.

1123
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,349
-The microscope can come in now.
-Okay.

1124
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:52,282
Ko Ye-jin's constipation got really bad,
so we gave her magnesium oxide.

1125
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:56,536
Good call. But prolonged use
could cause loose stools,

1126
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,039
so either reduce the dose
or take her off it soon.

1127
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,373
Okay, will do.

1128
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:04,377
Dr. Ki Eun-mi,
Jung Si-eun who was admitted yesterday

1129
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,296
has received dinoprostone, right?

1130
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:10,342
Yes, we gave her dinoprostone
last night and--

1131
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,718
I can't hear you.

1132
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:16,181
She's having contractions
every two to three minutes now,

1133
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:20,018
and her cervix was dilated to about 3cm
when I checked a moment ago.

1134
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:24,689
It's great that dinoprostone
was enough to induce labor.

1135
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,524
The contraction rate is good too.

1136
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,110
She won't need oxytocin.

1137
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:33,949
Monitor the patient carefully with Dr. Ki
and keep me updated.

1138
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:34,991
Sure.

1139
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:39,496
Really? Do you think
that's why he's gone AWOL?

1140
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:41,247
Not because someone picked on him?

1141
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:46,628
Yes. He said he thinks the patients
are getting worse because he's stupid.

1142
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:51,633
He's been under a lot of stress
since he started covering the ICU.

1143
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,469
He had been doing his best,

1144
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:58,181
but after seeing a few patients
pass away last week,

1145
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:03,103
he said he was no longer sure
if he should stay on this career path.

1146
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,358
He chose a vital department to save lives,

1147
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:12,821
but he feels that
all he can do is ask for help.

1148
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:14,739
Oh, dear.

1149
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:20,996
But don't worry too much, Dr. Jang.

1150
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:25,166
Geon will be back tomorrow
or the day after.

1151
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,585
He left all of his stuff
in the on-call room.

1152
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:32,048
He would've taken everything
if he'd really decided to quit,

1153
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:33,216
but it's all still here.

1154
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:36,511
I'm relieved to hear that,

1155
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:39,472
but you'll be swamped now, Ji-woo.

1156
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,559
I'll help you wherever I can.

1157
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,313
Yu-ri and I can cover for him
for a couple of days, no problem.

1158
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:50,025
And my hunch tells me

1159
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:54,738
that Geon will be back tomorrow.
I'm sure of it.

1160
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:57,240
He's such a model student.

1161
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:00,577
I bet he's already regretting it now.

1162
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:07,000
He'll probably get an earful
when he's back,

1163
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,377
but I hope he gets to
catch up on sleep at least.

1164
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,220
Thanks to you,
we could finish the surgery an hour early.

1165
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:23,725
The bleeding was minimal,

1166
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,519
and it went so smoothly
thanks to the perfect incision.

1167
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,605
Great job, everyone.

1168
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:30,774
Good job, Seong-yeong.

1169
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,443
You worked all night
because of an emergency

1170
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,320
but managed to get through this.

1171
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,573
Wrap this up well and enjoy your day off.

1172
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,742
I will. Thank you.

1173
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:49,459
Dr. Heo, if Professor Chae says
that she wants to start a new country,

1174
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:52,212
I'll go there and happily till the soil.

1175
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:55,215
Many people would be happy to do that.
Let's wrap this up.

1176
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,217
Okay.

1177
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:05,183
Dr. Chu, Jung Si-eun who's being induced
is showing signs of deceleration.

1178
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,726
Can you please check?

1179
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,436
She was okay five minutes ago.

1180
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,189
Professor, I'll check again
and let you know.

1181
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:14,442
It seemed to be moving too fast,
so I checked the monitor.

1182
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,610
I'm a little concerned.

1183
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,074
-Hey.
-Professor.

1184
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,076
Jung Si-eun has a prolonged deceleration.

1185
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,286
She recovered briefly,
but it's dropping again.

1186
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,330
And the variability is minimal as well.

1187
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:30,375
I checked,
and her cervix is fully dilated.

1188
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,835
I'll come now.

1189
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,465
The baby's having a hard time,
so we should expedite the delivery.

1190
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:41,845
It's common for a baby's heart rate
to drop slightly during labor,

1191
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:44,764
but it's usually restored
within a minute or two.

1192
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:47,851
But the abnormal heart rate
has been continuing for eight minutes.

1193
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:51,187
Even when it's restored,
it keeps dropping right away.

1194
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:55,984
The baby must be having
a very hard time right now.

1195
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:00,321
The baby has already dropped quite a bit.

1196
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:03,491
In cases like this, expediting
the delivery is the best solution.

1197
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,119
We'll proceed with surgery if need be.

1198
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,373
Min-ha, let's get ready.

1199
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:11,457
Okay.

1200
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,880
This is not a rare case.

1201
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:20,550
A sudden change in fetal heart rate
can occur during labor.

1202
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:23,178
This is something we see pretty often.

1203
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,848
We'll expedite your delivery
and do our very best,

1204
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:31,394
so keep on taking deep breaths
to deliver oxygen to your baby.

1205
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:32,478
Okay.

1206
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:42,530
The fetal heart rate isn't going back up.
We should hurry.

1207
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:46,034
What is your baby's nickname?

1208
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,037
Tough Cookie.

1209
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,207
Tough Cookie is stuck
in your narrow birth canal right now

1210
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,667
but is staying strong and doing great.

1211
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:58,046
You have to push a little harder.

1212
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:02,175
If you don't,
things could get dangerous for the baby.

1213
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:05,803
It's very important
that you keep pushing from now on.

1214
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,389
Okay. I can do it.

1215
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,891
What's the fetal heart rate?

1216
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:11,601
Has it gone back up?

1217
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:14,520
It's 100 now.

1218
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,690
I think we can get the baby out
if you push just five times.

1219
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,027
Just five times, okay?
Then the baby will be out.

1220
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,320
Okay.

1221
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:27,367
All right, one, two, three. Push!

1222
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,048
Fast breathing will cause dizziness.

1223
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:44,008
Take slow, deep breaths.

1224
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,888
All right. Push once more.

1225
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:51,641
One, two, three. Push!

1226
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,322
You're doing great.
Let's push one more time.

1227
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,742
One, two, three. Push!

1228
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:55,830
Current time, 10:35. It's a baby boy.

1229
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,984
ELAPSED TIME
CURRENT TIME

1230
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:34,994
Congratulations. You did very well.

1231
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:37,413
Doctor.

1232
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:41,667
My baby is okay, right?

1233
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,628
Yes, he's fine.

1234
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:53,179
It looks like the umbilical cord

1235
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:55,890
got wrapped around the baby
as he was descending.

1236
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,937
The sudden fetal heart rate decelerations

1237
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,815
were probably caused by the nuchal cord.

1238
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:08,861
This can totally happen during labor.

1239
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:13,157
A triple nuchal cord is rare,
but it does happen.

1240
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,285
Thank you, Doctor.

1241
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,454
Thank you so much.

1242
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,873
It took some superhuman strength
to push like that.

1243
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,460
Great job. You did so well.

1244
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,838
Dr. Ki, suture.

1245
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,675
Professor, Eun-mi is crying.

1246
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:37,723
Hey, why are you crying?

1247
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,813
Ms. Jung,
our first-year resident is crying.

1248
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,071
Thank you, Doctor.

1249
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:55,283
I'll be a great mother.

1250
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:58,327
Congratulations, Ms. Jung.

1251
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,252
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1252
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:09,213
A triple nuchal cord?

1253
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:12,216
Yes. Even the residents
were surprised to see it.

1254
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:15,720
It is uncommon,
but it does happen from time to time.

1255
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:16,971
It's not super rare.

1256
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,181
So how are they now?

1257
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:21,559
The baby is healthy,
and the mother is recovering well.

1258
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,227
Gosh, thank goodness.

1259
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:28,024
Will Ik-jun be back in two days?
Are we going to practice this week?

1260
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,612
It's still chilly, Professor.

1261
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:34,864
I'm off.

1262
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:49,212
If that's why, then I'm surprised.

1263
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,631
I know. I was quite surprised too.

1264
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:54,342
I knew he was the serious type,

1265
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,552
but I had no idea
that he was this thoughtful.

1266
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,472
Did you try calling him?
Is he still not answering?

1267
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:01,015
Ji-woo spoke to him earlier.

1268
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:02,558
Is he coming back?

1269
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:06,354
Ji-woo said he wants to come back,

1270
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:08,981
but he's hesitant
because he's embarrassed.

1271
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:13,778
Call him and tell him
to come to work tomorrow no matter what.

1272
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:16,072
Tell him I'll take care of the rest.

1273
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:17,448
-Okay.
-Hold on.

1274
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:20,076
It'd be better to hear that
from his friend,

1275
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,703
so ask Dr. Hwang Ji-woo to tell him that.

1276
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,747
Okay, I will.

1277
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,294
Aren't you cold?

1278
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,296
-Hello!
-What?

1279
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:36,968
Hey, Ahn Jeong-won. Stop bugging Gyeo-ul.

1280
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,262
-Stop nagging her already.
-Exactly.

1281
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:42,098
My goodness.

1282
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,528
The moment I heard
the baby's heartbeat go like this,

1283
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:57,655
I almost fainted.

1284
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:00,199
When the mother held her breath to push,

1285
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,910
I held my breath and pushed with her
without realizing it.

1286
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:07,498
But the baby wasn't really moving
when he came out, you know.

1287
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:11,877
I thought something was wrong with him,
so I just burst into tears.

1288
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:13,587
Gosh, that was crazy.

1289
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:16,882
But right at that moment,
the baby started crying.

1290
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,884
Did it take about 30 seconds?

1291
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:21,137
The moment I heard him cry,

1292
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:24,807
I thanked God
and every deity I could think of.

1293
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:26,934
"Thank you, God. Thank you, Buddha.

1294
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:30,563
Thank you so much, Household God."

1295
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:31,647
Eun-mi.

1296
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:35,234
Dr. Ki, stop talking and have some gimbap.

1297
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:37,570
Right, I should eat.

1298
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,949
The baby had the cord
wrapped around his neck three times.

1299
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,036
When I saw that, my heart started racing.

1300
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,580
But the baby's heart rate
kept on dropping.

1301
01:33:47,663 --> 01:33:51,417
Instead of beating normally like this,

1302
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:56,630
the heart was going like this
because the FHR kept decelerating.

1303
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,466
Okay, we heard you.

1304
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:01,635
So please stop talking
and have some food now.

1305
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:02,595
Okay.

1306
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:07,266
But have you all felt that before?

1307
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:10,644
When the baby started crying,
I felt such a great sense of relief.

1308
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,022
I mean, I didn't even do anything.

1309
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:16,817
But I was ecstatic
as though I saved the baby's life.

1310
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:20,738
My gosh, I was so grateful.

1311
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,657
Did you feel the same way too?

1312
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:24,992
-Of course.
-You did, right?

1313
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:27,495
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1314
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:38,714
What?

1315
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,735
Shouldn't we give him a big hand?

1316
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:01,821
Please stop. I'm too embarrassed.

1317
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:04,532
Hello.

1318
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,742
-Hello.
-Hey, you.

1319
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:10,162
Hello.

1320
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,747
Hello, everyone.

1321
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:14,917
Jeong-won, Geon is back.

1322
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:21,340
Hey, why did you leave
if you were going to come back in a day?

1323
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:24,385
You should have partied hard
for at least a week.

1324
01:35:27,513 --> 01:35:30,975
He didn't want to come back
but I practically begged him.

1325
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,227
Really?

1326
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:37,106
Yes. I talked to him on the phone
for over two hours to persuade him.

1327
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:40,317
So you'd better not
say anything to Geon today.

1328
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:44,071
Hey, what would I even say to him?

1329
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:46,991
Let's go.

1330
01:35:50,744 --> 01:35:56,917
All my longtime dreams
Felt like vain, naive delusions

1331
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:05,009
When I swallowed my tears
And whispered your name in secret

1332
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:10,014
I heard your warm voice ringing in my ears

1333
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:13,017
That gave me hope

1334
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,896
If only I could run across the dry sky

1335
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:21,275
And fall into your arms

1336
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:28,199
I wouldn't care
Even if my body broke apart

1337
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:32,745
Even if I fly too close to the sun

1338
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:37,666
And both of my legs melt away

1339
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:44,673
My heart will follow you

1340
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,635
And run toward your heart forever

1341
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:55,976
My weak soul

1342
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:06,820
If only I could put wings on it

1343
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:30,219
If only I could run across the dry sky

1344
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:34,598
And fall into your arms

1345
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:41,522
I wouldn't care
Even if my body broke apart

1346
01:37:41,605 --> 01:37:45,818
Even if I fly too close to the sun

1347
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:50,823
And both of my legs melt away

1348
01:37:50,906 --> 01:37:57,538
My heart will follow you

1349
01:37:57,621 --> 01:38:00,457
And run toward your heart forever

1350
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:51,925
There was a patient named Sun Chun-sik.

1351
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,597
His pancreatic cancer surgery went well,

1352
01:38:57,348 --> 01:39:00,017
and he shook my hand
the day he was discharged.

1353
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:03,270
But he came back with a twisted bowel.

1354
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,983
When we opened him up, it was too late.

1355
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:11,779
We removed a big portion of the bowel,

1356
01:39:14,573 --> 01:39:16,617
but he ended up dying of septic shock.

1357
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:20,204
Dr. Kim, patient Sun Chun-sik's vitals
are unstable.

1358
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:22,539
His BP and EKG are dropping.

1359
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:32,633
Do an announcement for CPR.
Is his guardian here?

1360
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,009
Yes.

1361
01:39:45,979 --> 01:39:48,232
-Let's check the pulse.
-Yes, Professor.

1362
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:51,318
-No pulse detected.
-We're performing CPR on Sun Chun-sik.

1363
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:54,113
I can't come right now.
I'm in emergency surgery.

1364
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:00,536
Okay.

1365
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:03,789
Right, okay.

1366
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:07,584
We performed CPR for over an hour

1367
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:11,171
but couldn't bring back the patient.

1368
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:14,508
I don't think we can revive him.

1369
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:19,680
I think it's time we let him go.

1370
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:30,649
We'll stop the chest compressions.

1371
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:38,240
That experience taught me
how incompetent I really am.

1372
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,368
I realized

1373
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:45,622
that asking others for help
was the only thing I could do.

1374
01:40:50,419 --> 01:40:53,964
We can't save every single patient.

1375
01:40:56,216 --> 01:41:00,220
You did your best.

1376
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:06,435
You did everything
in your power to save him.

1377
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:12,941
And I think the fact
that you thought about these things

1378
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:15,903
proves that you're a good doctor.

1379
01:41:18,989 --> 01:41:22,367
Well, your residency itself is a process

1380
01:41:23,452 --> 01:41:26,497
where you experience
and learn these things.

1381
01:41:27,539 --> 01:41:29,958
These experiences…

1382
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:35,464
will teach you to be a better doctor,

1383
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:38,509
so don't beat yourself up.

1384
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:42,971
Let's just do our best at all times
and be satisfied with that.

1385
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:46,308
Okay.

1386
01:41:49,728 --> 01:41:50,979
Thank you.

1387
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:55,150
You should go back inside.
I'll be right in too.

1388
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,236
Yes, sir.

1389
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,363
See you inside.

1390
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:14,127
How did you manage
to survive your residency?

1391
01:42:15,045 --> 01:42:16,046
Me?

1392
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:18,382
I had someone to rely on.

1393
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:25,097
All my fellow residents suffered so much
because of Dr. Yong.

1394
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:36,316
But I held out and survived
thanks to my fellow residents.

1395
01:42:38,777 --> 01:42:40,571
Hold on. We already checked that.

1396
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:42,239
Around May of your first year,

1397
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:45,158
the senior doctors
stop going easy on you, you know.

1398
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,744
I had to work the night shift alone
for the first time.

1399
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:50,205
-I was terrified.
-And?

1400
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:51,540
MAY, 2017

1401
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:53,709
Let's say
there are ten night shifts per month.

1402
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:56,044
Chi-hong and I always did it together,

1403
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:59,298
so we worked 20 night shifts together
every month.

1404
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:09,600
What are you doing?

1405
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:14,938
Just trying to see
if many hands can make light work.

1406
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,567
Two hands are probably better than one.

1407
01:43:19,067 --> 01:43:21,320
Although that can't make one become two.

1408
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:24,406
But 1.2 may be doable.

1409
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,539
All right. Keep it up.

1410
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:40,339
I really wasn't aware of it. My apologies.

1411
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:43,216
What should I do? I really didn't know.

1412
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,094
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay, Yoon-hee.

1413
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:50,015
You don't need
to keep apologizing like that.

1414
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:54,853
Just consider it
a piece of advice from a friend.

1415
01:43:54,937 --> 01:43:59,566
I won't get the wrong idea,
but the other doctors might.

1416
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:02,653
So make sure
you never drop the honorifics,

1417
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:05,238
no matter what you say. Okay?

1418
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:06,823
Yeah.

1419
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,787
Gosh, what is wrong with me?

1420
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,508
Hey, Hwang Ji-woo.

1421
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:25,592
What's up?

1422
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:31,223
Are you on duty next Saturday?

1423
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,392
Yes.

1424
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:35,686
I'll cover it for you.

1425
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:40,357
Go see your boyfriend.

1426
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,484
You said you guys would break up
at this rate.

1427
01:44:43,276 --> 01:44:44,611
Are you sure?

1428
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:47,739
Just say yes before I change my mind.

1429
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:50,283
Thanks.

1430
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:01,795
U-ju didn't come with you?

1431
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:03,547
He wants to stay longer.

1432
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:07,050
He'll come back with Ik-sun
the next time she's visiting Seoul.

1433
01:45:07,759 --> 01:45:10,095
He must be having fun
with his grandparents.

1434
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:13,557
No. He already made new friends
in the playground.

1435
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:17,269
-In just two weeks?
-Yes. My goodness.

1436
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:20,605
They all live in the same building,
but they're already best friends.

1437
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:23,984
He's Mr. Popular. And he loves to play.

1438
01:45:24,067 --> 01:45:26,153
Who does he take after?

1439
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,365
No one else in the family is like that.

1440
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:32,659
What?

1441
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:36,121
-I saw lightning just now.
-I saw it too.

1442
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,666
Three, two, one.

1443
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,044
My gosh.

1444
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:45,172
Shall we stop
and watch the rain for a bit?

1445
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:47,257
Sure, I'd love that.

1446
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,384
Do you want coffee?

1447
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:04,900
You should've waited
until the rain died down. You're soaked.

1448
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:06,943
It's okay. I can shake it off.

1449
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:10,113
I took less than ten seconds, right?
I'm so fast.

1450
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,157
You almost slipped and fell.

1451
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,993
No, I'd never. I have such quick reflexes.

1452
01:46:17,412 --> 01:46:18,371
Enjoy your coffee.

1453
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:22,292
Let's have our coffee first.

1454
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:24,961
I'm not in a rush.

1455
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:27,255
You can take your time.

1456
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,466
Sure.

1457
01:47:07,129 --> 01:47:08,421
Do you want the radio on?

1458
01:47:10,048 --> 01:47:11,049
No.

1459
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,494
Aren't you cold? It's a bit chilly.

1460
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:44,082
No! It's hot in here.

1461
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,252
-Stop fiddling with things.
-Okay.

1462
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:21,203
Ik-jun.

1463
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:22,746
Yes.

1464
01:48:36,384 --> 01:48:38,011
I'm a little embarrassed,

1465
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:42,098
so I'm only going to say it once, quickly.

1466
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:44,768
Listen carefully, okay?

1467
01:48:47,729 --> 01:48:49,189
Don't look at me.

1468
01:48:51,274 --> 01:48:52,359
Keep your eyes ahead.

1469
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,871
Do you know what was the first thought

1470
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:09,042
that crossed my mind
when I heard you were attacked?

1471
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:20,887
"I should have told him…

1472
01:49:25,308 --> 01:49:26,768
that I like him.

1473
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,188
I really should've told him."

1474
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:38,029
That was the first thought
that popped into my head.

1475
01:49:47,789 --> 01:49:48,623
Look ahead.

1476
01:49:55,463 --> 01:49:56,756
So with that said…

1477
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:04,222
If your feelings for me haven't changed,

1478
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:12,314
how about we…

1479
01:50:23,658 --> 01:50:25,201
start seeing each other?

1480
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,068
I'll give you my answer.

1481
01:52:51,055 --> 01:52:53,475
Ik-jun, let's go eat.

1482
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:57,770
Song-hwa, let's do what other couples do.

1483
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,939
What are you doing this weekend?

1484
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:02,066
I'm sure you both have no plans.

1485
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,194
We're going out on a date.

1486
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:08,531
I'm going to have dinner with him
this weekend.

1487
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,658
And we'll go for a walk too.

1488
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:13,453
Now I get why people get married.

1489
01:53:13,536 --> 01:53:15,747
I really don't want to say goodbye here.

1490
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:20,668
We still have a long way to go,
but we're holding up well.

1491
01:53:20,752 --> 01:53:23,546
It's a difficult case
and the success rate isn't very high.

1492
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,673
I think you should prepare yourselves.

1493
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,217
What is it? Did something happen?

1494
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,636
But they still want to try it

1495
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:31,763
even if it's dangerous.

1496
01:53:31,846 --> 01:53:34,224
It's a difficult decision to make.

1497
01:53:35,016 --> 01:53:36,976
You will have to make a decision now.

1498
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:49,197
