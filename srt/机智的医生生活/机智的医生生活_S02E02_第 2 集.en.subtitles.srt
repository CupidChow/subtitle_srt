YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,700
Good morning, Dr. Jang.

3
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,993
Hey, good morning.

4
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,537
Nice, right on time.

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,205
I'm five minutes early.

6
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,084
I didn't expect there
to be a line already.

7
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,128
Why is everyone here at the crack of dawn?

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,048
I'd call this "morning."
It's five to seven.

9
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,139
I remember everything about you
all through middle and high school.

10
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,099
You were so cute even back then.

11
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,559
-Liar.
-What?

12
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,770
You didn't even remember me.

13
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,356
Ik-jun told me that you were confused
between me and Micky.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,859
You two talk about everything.

15
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,362
We always tell each other everything
that makes us laugh.

16
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,114
At work already? Did you just park?

17
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,408
Yeah, I have a conference
early in the morning.

18
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,619
Don't you usually go to work
with Jeong-won?

19
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,788
He had to go in early
for an emergency surgery.

20
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,956
I'm going to buy him coffee.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,251
Are you guys married or what?
You're so good to him.

22
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,171
I know, right?
Why am I doing this for Father Andrea

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,215
when I should be doing it for you?

24
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,592
Ik-sun, I'm getting in the elevator.
Hold on.

25
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,053
Hold on a moment.

26
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,441
PICU

27
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,109
Please check Jeong-hun's JP drain

28
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,571
for any changes
and see if the output is increasing.

29
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,948
Will do, Professor.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,578
I'll get one iced Americano,
one hot Americano and…

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,082
-A hot cappuccino, please.
-And one hot cappuccino.

32
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,876
Who's the second one for?

33
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,419
They're both for me.

34
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,130
I see.

35
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,299
-Here you go. I have my professor's card.
-Really?

36
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,844
Yes, you should have come to GS too.

37
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,345
Good morning.

38
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,848
-Hi, guys.
-Good morning.

39
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,560
Good morning.

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,311
Yes, good morning.

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,191
-Aren't you cold?
-No.

42
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,861
-Here's your card.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,571
Which professor's card is it?

44
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,656
It can't be the chief's.

45
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,991
A professor's card?

46
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,826
-Is it yours?
-No.

47
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,077
Professor Lee Ik-jun.

48
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,955
I was on duty last night,
so he gave it to me to buy snacks.

49
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,915
Love's in the air in GS.

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,333
Give me that.

51
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,087
You have to return it to him anyway.
I'll drop it off.

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,548
Okay.

53
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,177
Let's order everything on the menu
and put it on Ik-jun's card.

54
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,929
I'll get everything from café mocha

55
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,141
to the sparkling tangerine-ade
at the bottom. One of each.

56
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,311
For every nurse in the PICU.

57
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,062
Then I'll get…

58
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,416
14,800 WON
JANUARY 23, 6:57 A.M.

59
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,516
Darn it.

60
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,367
What's with Jang Gyeo-ul?

61
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,870
Is she having a premium steak
for breakfast? 182,000 won?

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,669
Wait, at the café on the second floor?

63
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,881
What?

64
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,051
What? I'm waiting for the elevator.

65
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,552
I'm not in the elevator yet.

66
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,846
Don't act like you can't hear me.

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,431
By the way, who is it?

68
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,767
Who's having a steak at the café
with my card?

69
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,437
You'd better tell me.

70
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,232
I'm in the elevator now.
I'll call you back.

71
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:39,779
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

72
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,283
Why won't the doors close? I'm in a rush.

73
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,411
Jeez, nothing's going my way.

74
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,707
I hope she can hold out until Week 23.

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,834
-I know.
-Is her husband here too?

76
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,753
Yes, he took time off from work
to be with her.

77
00:04:55,837 --> 00:05:00,174
-She really is putting in a lot of effort.
-I know.

78
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,510
She's feeling cooped up
but is not leaving her bed

79
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,805
and is even relieving herself
in the room just in case.

80
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,142
If we tell her this,
she won't be able to sleep.

81
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,269
We should still tell her though.

82
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,354
Okay.

83
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,984
Your cervix is a little open.

84
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,610
And because your baby is breech,

85
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,656
the ultrasound shows its feet
moving in and out of the cervix.

86
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,118
But they're not completely
out of the uterus.

87
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,164
Dr. Chu is monitoring it
throughout the day at the moment.

88
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,625
But if we find that your cervix
has dilated further by Week 23,

89
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,171
and if the baby's feet and umbilical cord
come out completely,

90
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,506
it may require emergency surgery.

91
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,674
Okay.

92
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,305
What should we do?

93
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,934
It's okay. He's just saying
it's a possibility.

94
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,227
The feet are not out yet.

95
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,645
Yes, that's right.

96
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,733
If you notice that your belly
feels tighter than usual

97
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,444
or experience bad cramps,
let us know right away.

98
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,321
We'll keep checking, of course,

99
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,531
but you'll most likely be the first
to feel it.

100
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,992
Okay.

101
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,120
We'll monitor everything more carefully.

102
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,748
We'll talk soon.

103
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,092
Keep checking the monitor
for signs of contractions.

104
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,301
Check for bleeding,

105
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,096
and see if she's feeling heaviness
in her pelvic region.

106
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,600
I really hope she can hold out
until Week 23.

107
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,980
Our goal is to get the baby out safely.

108
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,441
She'll need surgery
in case of notable decelerations

109
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,068
or cord prolapse at Week 23, okay?

110
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,195
-Yes.
-Double-check everything.

111
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,490
-I'm counting on you.
-Yes, Professor.

112
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,738
-Free this weekend?
-Why?

113
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,990
-We need to talk.
-Talk.

114
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,617
I'll tell you when we're all together.

115
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,204
Don't tell me…

116
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,000
you took out a private loan.

117
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,806
All right.

118
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,934
Ta-da!

119
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,353
-It looks delicious!
-Mom.

120
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,523
I'm having ramyeon for dinner.
I had a sandwich for lunch.

121
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,567
Jeong-won said
he has something to tell us.

122
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,819
Jeong-won makes the best ramyeon.

123
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,242
Oh, no. Hey, are you all right?

124
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,286
Are you okay?

125
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,333
I got it.

126
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,397
It's so sweet. It's really good.
Who bought these?

127
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,107
Me. They were on sale.

128
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,317
-Aren't they good?
-Yeah.

129
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,569
They're good,
but it looks like we should hurry.

130
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,737
Hurry and eat.

131
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,989
Why? Is someone else coming?

132
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,867
He'll perform surgery here.

133
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,746
How many times do you need
to clean your hands?

134
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,123
Do the strawberries need surgery?
Are they ill?

135
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,546
Eat, before these hungry bums
finish everything.

136
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,924
There's still a lot left.

137
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,221
Hey, it's so sweet.

138
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,517
It's like springtime.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,311
What do you mean? It's January.
It's minus ten degrees Celsius out.

140
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,105
Maybe in his heart, it is.

141
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,817
Jeong-won, you said
you had something to tell us.

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,318
Isn't that why we're all here?

143
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,737
Yes.

144
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,660
-Guys.
-Oh, do you have surgery on Thursday?

145
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,579
I heard it's for Yoo Gyeong-jin.

146
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,415
Who is Yoo Gyeong-jin?
You mean the violinist?

147
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,293
I know who it is, Yoo Yeong-jin.

148
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,795
-"Yoo Gyeong-jin."
-Right, Yoo Gyeong-jin.

149
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,505
Isn't she a famous musician?

150
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,340
Where does she live now?

151
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,134
-Who?
-Yoo Gyeong-jin.

152
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,927
Guys, listen carefully.

153
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,929
I'm only going to say it once. That's it.

154
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,055
Mapo.

155
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,682
-Wrong.
-Then Banpo?

156
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,226
I think she's based in Europe
and lives in Germany.

157
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,936
What's wrong with her?

158
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,771
I think she has a brain tumor.

159
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,939
She was tested there,

160
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,358
but she returned this week
to get surgery here.

161
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,737
Her mother and the hospital director
are close friends.

162
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,822
They don't care for famous doctors.

163
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,868
They asked for the best neurosurgeon
at our hospital.

164
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,786
And Song-hwa was chosen.

165
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,414
What? You're coming back again
this Thursday?

166
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,751
You should move to Hoengseong or Wonju.

167
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,170
Or get a room
near the Naerincheon Service Area.

168
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,922
I'll be back on Wednesday.

169
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,759
I need to meet the patient
the day before the surgery.

170
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,804
Seon-bin is updating me on the lab results
and the patient's condition.

171
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,183
That sounds intense.
I think you can just turn it down.

172
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,060
No, I want to do it.

173
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,270
I love doing VIP surgeries.

174
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,152
I used to do it out of a sense of duty
because of the agreement I had signed,

175
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,488
but something else
is keeping me motivated now.

176
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,156
What's that?

177
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,991
You don't need to know.

178
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,410
Anyway, I'll do my best,

179
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,871
so I can operate on more patients.

180
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,081
What do you mean?

181
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,500
It's nothing.

182
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,794
Hey, Jeong-won. Why aren't you talking?

183
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,464
Right, you called us here.
Stop eating strawberries and talk.

184
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,633
Did you call us
to have strawberries with us?

185
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,515
Don't even say a word from now on.
Just let me talk.

186
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,225
-Talk!
-Knock yourself out.

187
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,309
-Go for it.
-Go ahead.

188
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,394
-Tell us.
-What is it?

189
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,190
I'm seeing Gyeo-ul.

190
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,027
So am I.

191
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,239
I saw her yesterday and today too.
I see her every day.

192
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,198
No, I mean…

193
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,327
We're dating.

194
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,460
It's been about a month.

195
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,715
Is that why you decided to stay?

196
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,553
That was one of the biggest reasons.

197
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,138
I'm so happy for you.

198
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,974
I always thought you'd make a good couple.

199
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,226
Thanks.

200
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,856
-Hey.
-Don't mind me.

201
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,860
I'm just happy for you.
You made the right decision.

202
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,488
No one can be happier than I am right now.

203
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,786
I already knew
because my mom told me last week.

204
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,872
You're very discreet.

205
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,499
Hey, how does your mother know?

206
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,877
Your mother probably told her.

207
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,044
I didn't know who, though.

208
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,675
We'll keep it a secret at the hospital.
Don't worry.

209
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,261
I want to tell everyone,

210
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,722
but I won't, for dear Gyeo-ul's sake.

211
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,432
What? "Dear Gyeo-ul"?

212
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,351
You can't say that anymore.
You'd better watch out.

213
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,022
I can.

214
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,774
You can't. You'd better watch out.

215
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,320
Right, okay.

216
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,729
It won't be easy.

217
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,816
The location is bad.

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,154
This is my first olfactory groove
meningioma surgery, Professor.

219
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,241
The symptoms are quite unusual.
You become lethargic and…

220
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,911
You have no energy
and lose interest in everything.

221
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,995
Frontal lobe syndrome.

222
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,789
I know what it is.

223
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,041
-Look at you.
-I've been studying.

224
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,168
Well done.

225
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,129
-Shall we go meet her?
-Sure.

226
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,092
Heo Seon-bin speaking.

227
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,220
Got it.

228
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,931
The ER needs me.

229
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,309
Hurry. I can do rounds by myself.

230
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,894
-Go, hurry.
-Okay.

231
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,733
By the way, Yoo Gyeong-jin's guardian.

232
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,485
Her mother…

233
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,198
She's intense.
I've never dealt with anyone like her.

234
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,245
This week alone, I went there
more than five times a day

235
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,205
to explain the symptoms in detail,

236
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,374
book the time slots they wanted
for the tests,

237
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,376
and explain everything about the surgery.

238
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,211
Great. And?

239
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,756
But she didn't uncross her arms once.

240
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,677
I don't expect her to thank me,

241
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,556
but that doubtful look in her eyes…

242
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,476
The way she looks at me
screams that she doesn't trust me.

243
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,437
Hurry to the ER. What are you doing?

244
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,564
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,032
I'll go explain the situation
to Min-chan's mother.

246
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,200
I'll tell her.

247
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,331
I'm not seeing things.

248
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,583
You're stepping out often.

249
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,293
Professor.

250
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,255
Are you trying to encourage
or criticize me?

251
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,215
Pick one.

252
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,593
Plus, this is the first time in a week.

253
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,679
They needed all the documents
for the loan by today.

254
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,348
-You're taking out a loan?
-Yes.

255
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,143
My wife's having a hard time
commuting from Paju,

256
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,812
and we haven't lived apart in so long,

257
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,482
so we decided to take out a loan
to rent an apartment.

258
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,401
That scammer hasn't been caught, right?

259
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,196
No, but the police are still
on the lookout for him.

260
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,198
Are you off to see Eun-ji? I'll tag along.

261
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,408
-No. Min-chan, not Eun-ji.
-Min-chan?

262
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,371
A patient with DCMP.
We may need to implant another VAD.

263
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,457
DCMP? Then he must have a history.

264
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,585
He was told last year
that his heart wasn't beating properly

265
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,170
and that it was enlarged.

266
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,338
Did he come to the ER?

267
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,340
Yes, two days ago.

268
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,258
We've been monitoring him,

269
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,512
but the heart rhythm problem is
getting worse even with inotropes.

270
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,306
He needs something,
whether it's an ECMO or a VAD.

271
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,350
I want to use a VAD if it's approved soon.

272
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,938
He was playing in the playground
up until two days ago.

273
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,983
If his mother hears
that he now needs a heart transplant,

274
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,317
she'll be heartbroken.

275
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,070
I'll bring it up carefully.
I'm on my way to meet her now.

276
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,114
-How old is Min-chan?
-Four.

277
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,532
-Weight?
-He weighs 13kg…

278
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,952
What are you doing?

279
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,955
Why am I reporting this to you right now?

280
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,790
I don't know.

281
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,672
I'll be off, then.

282
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:58,100
A VAD is a mechanical pump
that's used to support heart function,

283
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,227
so it can't support the lungs,

284
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,314
whereas the ECMO replaces
the function of the heart and lungs.

285
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,162
So he needs to depend on a machine.

286
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,081
It means he's in serious condition, right?

287
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,375
Well…

288
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,213
I don't think his heart
can hold out any longer.

289
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,842
It's too risky to let him go on like this.

290
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,180
Ultimately, he'll need a heart transplant.

291
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,474
He needs to be supported with a VAD

292
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
until we can find the right donor for him.

293
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,397
Could his condition improve

294
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,026
with the VAD alone?

295
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,696
That can happen in some cases.

296
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,241
But the chances are slim,
so I don't want to get your hopes up.

297
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,245
The VAD is just temporary.
It's not a permanent solution.

298
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,373
So I can't say he'll recover
with the VAD alone.

299
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,960
It only supports heart function,

300
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,090
so many issues will arise
in the lungs such as infections.

301
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,260
If he can't hold out until it's approved,

302
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:20,057
we may need to put him on the ECMO
as an emergency measure.

303
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:31,235
But at the moment,
I think the VAD is the best solution

304
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:36,615
to help Min-chan hold out
until we find the right donor for him.

305
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,618
I'll get the screening started today.

306
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,287
The results will be out
in three to four days.

307
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:47,126
Our coordinator will walk you through
the steps and costs.

308
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,713
Okay.

309
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,135
We'll do our best.

310
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,409
A VAD is a mechanical pump
that's used to support heart function,

311
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,119
so it can't support the lungs.

312
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
Hello, Professor. I'm Jang Hong-do.

313
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes, hi.

314
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,130
You're shadowing Dr. Im Chang-min, right?

315
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,884
Yes, I'm shadowing him
in Cardiothoracic Surgery.

316
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,679
-Professor, a VAD is--
-It looks like you know.

317
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,766
Then how is a pediatric VAD different?

318
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,563
-Well…
-How are the ones in the ICU

319
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,815
different from the ones
you've seen in the PICU?

320
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,911
Have the answer ready
the next time I see you.

321
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,505
It's okay.

322
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,424
It's okay.

323
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,468
Everything will be okay.

324
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,766
My kid has had a VAD
for over three months now.

325
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,396
And she's staying strong.

326
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,107
I see.

327
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,610
This is like a marathon.

328
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,158
We're like marathoners.

329
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,662
It has only just begun.

330
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,623
Come on. You're a mother.
You can't break down so soon.

331
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,336
Your kid's staying strong,
and so should you.

332
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,006
Thank you.

333
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,888
And about Professor Kim Jun-wan…
He's blunt and to the point,

334
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,308
but he's very thorough.
He's a wonderful person.

335
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,104
I've been observing him
for over three months.

336
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
I see.

337
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,359
Every time my dear Eun-ji faced a hurdle,

338
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,028
he helped and protected her
so she could overcome it.

339
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,368
So only think positive thoughts.

340
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,538
Trust that your child
can get through this.

341
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,590
Cheer up, okay?

342
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,218
The real marathon begins now.

343
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,055
Yes, thank you.

344
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,739
Hello.

345
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,325
Ms. Yoo Gyeong-jin, right?

346
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,951
Yes, hello.

347
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,662
I heard you had a headache. How is it now?

348
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,039
I still have it.

349
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,666
-My head still hurts a little.
-I see.

350
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,418
And you feel listless.

351
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,213
That's right. I don't want to do anything.

352
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,551
The tumor in front of the brain
can cause listlessness and lethargy.

353
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,139
We suspect that you have
an olfactory groove meningioma.

354
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,060
The symptoms include fatigue,
listlessness, and headaches.

355
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,855
Her condition seems to have gotten worse
since coming here.

356
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,941
I asked for pain meds
to get rid of her pain at least,

357
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,402
but what you gave her
wore off in half a day.

358
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:48,241
I came all this way because
of a recommendation, but I'm so worried.

359
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:54,456
We can't prescribe pain medications
every time patients or guardians ask.

360
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:59,127
They can cause liver damage
and gastrointestinal bleeding,

361
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,296
so we can't go over the approved amounts.

362
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,298
Yes, I know that much.

363
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,344
Then I'll see you in the evening.

364
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,096
You have to sign the consent form,

365
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,723
and we'll go over a few things
before your surgery.

366
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,725
I'll see you later.

367
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,899
Where's the professor
who's operating tomorrow?

368
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,693
They keep sending these young residents.

369
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,364
The professor is in Sokcho now.

370
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,325
She'll probably get here tonight.

371
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,037
I'm excited to meet her.

372
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,499
The tenth female Professor of Neurosurgery
in the country.

373
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,127
I even like her name, Chae Song-hwa.

374
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,963
Isn't that impressive?

375
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,842
We'll have to see.

376
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,638
Gosh, we donated so much money
to this hospital.

377
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,182
I'm sure Mr. Kettle gave you
the best neurosurgeon

378
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,810
if he has a conscience.

379
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,400
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

380
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,200
You're still here?

381
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,536
Yes, I want to see a patient
before I head out.

382
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,205
It's Yoo Gyeong-jin.

383
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,623
Is it a difficult surgery?

384
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,835
Olfactory groove meningioma.

385
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,296
I'm sure you've heard of it.

386
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,342
It's a meningioma in the olfactory nerve,
just like the name suggests.

387
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,970
But the tumor is located pretty deep.

388
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,308
-Are you on duty tonight?
-Yes, I am.

389
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,353
But you're not. You should go home early.

390
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,522
I will,
after I check in on Yoo Gyeong-jin.

391
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,234
She must be very nervous
about the surgery.

392
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,988
Song-hwa, you really are…

393
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,452
How can you be so focused
whenever you start something?

394
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,538
You should never be put in charge
of anything.

395
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,084
I had five phone calls about
Daddy-Long-Legs this month.

396
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,878
I need to work harder.

397
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,714
To turn all your plans into reality,

398
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,549
I definitely need to work harder.

399
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,927
If you're going to keep this up,
I'm really…

400
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,095
I'm going to take it off your plate.

401
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,724
I don't want your life to be
consumed by work because of it.

402
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,184
But I love it.

403
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,020
Please, keep me on it.

404
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,402
There aren't many patients in Sokcho,
so I have time to work on it.

405
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,905
Timing-wise, it's perfect.

406
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,573
Oh, boy.

407
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,118
You're too busy these days.
You're taking care of all the surgeries.

408
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,330
Without you, the entire Pediatric Surgery
will shut down.

409
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,208
Where will all the kids
in the PICU and NICU go?

410
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,671
I should've asked Ik-jun to do it.

411
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,923
He's busy too.

412
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,009
He's had transplant surgeries
for two days in a row.

413
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,698
Have we picked a song for this week?

414
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,034
Yes, but I'm not telling you.

415
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,871
It's in our group chat, you freak.

416
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,293
Nothing's going my way.

417
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,129
Jeez, what is this?

418
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,305
-What was that?
-What?

419
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,556
What was that?

420
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,725
-Nothing.
-What? It was you.

421
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,184
No, it wasn't me.

422
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,062
That was just her ringtone.

423
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,316
What's this twerp saying?
Are you confused?

424
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,859
Hey, it's me.

425
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,944
I know you're Daddy-Long-Legs.

426
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,365
Oh, right. You already know.

427
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,492
-He knows.
-How?

428
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,411
How did you know?

429
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,912
Is that important now?

430
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,335
I'm going to be Daddy-Long-Legs
from now on.

431
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,921
You? But you're short.

432
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,798
Jeez, that was lame.

433
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,552
Wasn't it kind of funny?

434
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,681
You like his jokes.

435
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,436
Anyway, I'm Daddy-Long-Legs now.
It's been decided.

436
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,356
Don't tell anyone, okay?

437
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,611
Okay, I heard you.
Take off that pain relief patch, will you?

438
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,822
This is part of me now.

439
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,157
It's like a tattoo.

440
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,039
Hey, I'm coming now.

441
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,086
Hey, whether it's a tattoo
or whatever else…

442
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,505
Take it easy, okay?

443
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,971
Has Seok-min lost his mind?

444
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,640
Why? The two of us can do it.

445
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,518
The fellow was really stressed out,

446
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,645
so Seok-min volunteered to scrub in.

447
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,023
His wife's surgery is tomorrow,
and it's for cancer.

448
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,402
He won't be able to focus,
so Seok-min volunteered to cover for him.

449
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,946
Did you tell him?

450
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,865
No, he knew about it
even before I told him.

451
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,453
He went through hoops to get out of here.

452
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,956
Why volunteer to come back?

453
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,462
This surgery is for a brain tumor,
and it'll be open brain surgery.

454
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,215
The tumor is located deep,
so there are risks,

455
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,384
and you may lose a lot of blood.

456
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,719
After the surgery, you may experience

457
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,180
unexpected neurological complications
or infection.

458
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,101
I'll go over the details
when you sign the consent form.

459
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,853
Okay.

460
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,440
You must be very nervous.

461
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,150
Yes.

462
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,069
My team is very experienced,

463
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,697
and we'll be fully prepared,
so don't worry.

464
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,031
Doctor.

465
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,994
I know the hospital director very well.

466
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,789
Are you well versed in this type of tumor
and how to treat it?

467
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,793
I have many questions about it.

468
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,463
I'd like to speak to someone

469
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,591
who's more knowledgeable
and can give us an in-depth explanation.

470
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,302
When will the professor be here
and go over it with us?

471
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,721
Professor Chae Song-hwa.

472
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,057
The surgery is tomorrow.

473
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,103
Shouldn't she go over everything with us
the day before the surgery?

474
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,940
I am Chae Song-hwa.

475
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,362
I'm Professor Chae Song-hwa.

476
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,823
Oh, I see.

477
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,576
This is Professor Chae Song-hwa.

478
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:54,417
My gosh, Professor Chae. You're so young.

479
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,920
I thought you were a resident.

480
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,467
I think your daughter has
an intracranial meningioma.

481
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,053
It's a brain tumor.

482
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,263
We'll remove the tumor during the surgery.

483
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,641
The tumor is pretty big,

484
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,976
and it's a long, complicated surgery,

485
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,103
so there could be
post-surgical complications.

486
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,273
We'll need to monitor her in the ICU
after the surgery.

487
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,360
But this meningioma

488
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,112
is a benign tumor,
so don't worry too much.

489
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,406
Okay, thank you.

490
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,037
And ma'am.

491
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,293
The residents are neurosurgeons too.

492
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,673
They studied this field
for almost or over ten years.

493
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,593
They have all the necessary
medical knowledge,

494
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,013
and they actually know more
about the patients than I do.

495
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,725
So they'll be able to answer
all of your questions.

496
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,310
Right.

497
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,859
You need to sleep well
to be ready for the surgery tomorrow.

498
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,653
We'll be fully prepared,
so see you tomorrow with smiles on.

499
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,572
Okay, Professor.

500
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,490
Good night.

501
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,420
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

502
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,717
Hello, how are you feeling today?

503
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,177
Doctor.

504
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,515
Gosh, my belly feels tight today.

505
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,437
It feels a little heavy down there.

506
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:43,151
I can feel something running…

507
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,695
Just a moment. I'll check right away.

508
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,031
MATERNAL FETAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

509
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,200
Nurse! Can I have a speculum set? Hurry!

510
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,580
Professor Yang,
Kim Su-jeong's baby is in the external os.

511
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,291
Both the feet and the cord are out.
She needs surgery now.

512
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,044
Get ready and call Pediatrics now.
I'll be right there.

513
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,922
Tell Anesthesiology
that she'll need general anesthesia.

514
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,966
Sorry, I have emergency surgery.
My apologies.

515
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,384
It's okay.

516
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,353
Let's move her quickly.

517
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,688
We're ready, right?
Can we go ahead and drape her?

518
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,065
DRAPING: STERILIZATION

519
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,080
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

520
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,365
-Why do you look so serious?
-Hey.

521
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,117
What kind of surgery do you have?

522
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,079
It's for ALCAPA, an anomalous left
coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.

523
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,624
But the heart rhythm is uneven,
and the coronary artery is pretty far.

524
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,751
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I'm worried.

525
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,422
It's likely that the patient will leave
the OR with the chest open or on ECMO.

526
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,093
Anyway, wish me luck.

527
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,681
Wish me luck too.

528
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,689
This patient, Kim Jang-ho.

529
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,775
The immunosuppressant levels are too high.

530
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,778
I told him to come back in two weeks
because they were low.

531
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,614
I think he's been drinking again.

532
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,994
Who?

533
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,580
He had a liver transplant
from his daughter a year ago.

534
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,041
And from his elder daughter
three years ago.

535
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,126
What?

536
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,003
Let me examine the next patient first.

537
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,713
Sure.

538
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,842
-Mr. Choi Sang-ha.
-Yes.

539
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,094
Let me check your name
and registration number.

540
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,805
It's 3978654…

541
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,646
Then I'll remove it
while you're holding him like that.

542
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,816
Yes, it looks like
you'll just have to do it like this.

543
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,360
Seung-won, it won't hurt at all.

544
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,863
The doctor will remove
all the stitches for you today.

545
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,825
Let's see.

546
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,537
No, it hurts!

547
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,289
Hold on.

548
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,459
There, it's done!
It's all done, Seung-won.

549
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,420
See? It didn't hurt at all.

550
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,256
I have to say, the wound looks clean.

551
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,341
Here.

552
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,221
It'll sting a little, Seung-won.
But it'll be quick, okay?

553
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,348
Today, we have to remove…

554
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,392
One, two, three, four, five…

555
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,311
We have to remove seven stitches today.

556
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,980
It's okay, Seung-won.
It'll be done before you know it.

557
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,485
I'm going to disinfect it first.
This will feel nice and cool.

558
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:16,823
No! Stop! I don't like this. It hurts!

559
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,366
I don't want to do this!

560
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,035
Seung-won, it doesn't hurt at all.
It feels nice.

561
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,580
No! Stop! I don't like this!

562
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,666
I don't want to do this!

563
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,376
It feels nice and cool.

564
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,294
There, it's done. It's all done.

565
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,381
Doesn't it feel nice?
It doesn't hurt at all.

566
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,800
So far, so good.

567
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,219
You're doing great, Seung-won.

568
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,388
All right.

569
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,516
It hurts!

570
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,228
No! Stop! I said I don't want to do this!

571
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,647
Seung-won, it doesn't hurt at all.

572
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,650
Be honest.
The doctor hasn't even done anything yet.

573
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,610
Stay still, so he can be quick.

574
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,154
If not, it'll take forever.

575
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,781
I'll do it quickly
and make sure it doesn't hurt.

576
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,285
No! I don't want to do this!

577
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:07,206
Seung-won, the doctor hasn't even done
anything yet, okay?

578
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,126
He can't even get started
because you keep crying.

579
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:17,133
No! Stop! It hurts!

580
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,264
This won't work. Step out and do something
that will put you in a better mood.

581
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,895
Ma'am, I'll treat the other kids first.

582
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,398
Why don't you step out with Seung-won
and make him feel better?

583
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,861
And it looks like you'll have to
negotiate with him a little.

584
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,780
Okay, Professor Ahn.

585
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,408
I'm sorry.

586
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,703
Get down.

587
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,671
-You can let Da-eun in.
-Okay.

588
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,142
The adhesion is quite strong.

589
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,062
Gosh, I'm having a hard time
dissecting the tumor.

590
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,357
Should I pull it this way
with the retractor?

591
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,691
Yes, please.

592
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,200
Don't touch the heart.

593
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,452
It'll cause fibrillation.

594
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,287
FIBRILLATION: VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION

595
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,748
I'll tent the pericardium now.

596
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,333
TECHNIQUE FOR CREATING A PERICARDIAL TENT

597
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,882
We did a biopsy during the surgery
and confirmed that it's not cancerous.

598
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,511
We did everything we could,

599
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,097
so keep taking your meds,
and we'll see how it goes.

600
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,599
-Thank you, Professor Lee.
-No problem.

601
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,694
Is Mr. Kim Jang-ho next?

602
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,904
Yes.

603
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,284
Hello, Professor Lee.

604
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,244
-Hello.
-Hello.

605
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,178
Mr. Kim, have you been taking
your medications?

606
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,139
Yes, of course.

607
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,934
It doesn't seem like you have.

608
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,482
The immunosuppressant levels are too high.

609
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,984
Maybe you suddenly

610
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,195
started taking them
because of this appointment.

611
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,323
No, not at all.

612
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,532
Mr. Kim.

613
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,910
I think you've been drinking again.

614
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,912
No.

615
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,748
Not at all.

616
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,045
Please. These numbers
are telling me the truth.

617
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,504
Your blood work shows it all.

618
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,298
How much did you drink?

619
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,011
Just a little. I only drank a little.

620
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,680
How many bottles at a time?

621
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,057
A bottle and a half…

622
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,936
A bottle and a half? Give me a break.

623
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,980
I wasn't going to drink any.

624
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,816
I went out for dinner,
but my friends forced me to drink.

625
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,986
Did you tell them
that you've had a liver transplant?

626
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,696
Yes, I told them.

627
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,451
Who tells their friend to drink,
knowing he's had a liver transplant?

628
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,081
I wouldn't call that person a friend.

629
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,249
Professor Lee.

630
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,589
He drank five days straight,
last week alone.

631
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,758
Every time,
he drinks until the crack of dawn.

632
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,135
How could he do this?

633
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,763
No one in his right mind would do this!

634
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,391
Why bring up such nonsense? Be quiet!

635
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,359
You're Ms. Kim Su-jeong's husband, right?

636
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,444
Yes, how did it go?

637
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,321
I'm Kim U-jae in Pediatrics.

638
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,534
I heard the staff in OB-GYN worked hard
to help you keep the baby,

639
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,869
but the fetus was too young,

640
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,664
and the situation was worse
than we had expected.

641
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,042
Unfortunately, we were unable
to send the baby to the NICU.

642
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,836
It didn't go well.

643
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,965
We did our best,

644
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,135
but we couldn't save the baby.

645
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,434
How's my wife? Is she okay?

646
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:40,896
Professor Yang is operating on Ms. Kim
at the moment.

647
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,150
He'll update you on everything
when he's out of the OR.

648
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,999
Pass me the thread.

649
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,126
Her vitals are okay, right?

650
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,586
Yes, they seem fine.

651
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,171
Okay.

652
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:15,014
I'll start counting.
One, two, three, four, five,

653
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:19,393
six, seven, eight, nine…

654
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,450
It hurts!

655
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,662
It hurts so much! I said it hurts!

656
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,290
He needs to do this
to make your pain go away.

657
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,084
He promised that it'll be quick
and painless.

658
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,544
It'll only take a moment.

659
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,880
It'll sting three times. That's it.

660
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:52,176
Seung-won, I'll make sure
it doesn't hurt at all. All right.

661
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,680
It hurts! I don't want to do this!

662
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,309
I said I don't want to do this!
I hate this!

663
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,939
Park Seung-won,
are you going to keep this up?

664
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,900
The doctor can't do anything
because of you!

665
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,487
He did your surgery and treated you.
Must you do this?

666
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,167
It's okay. I can take care
of the other appointments first.

667
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,503
Why don't you try to calm him down?

668
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,590
You can come back
after my last appointment.

669
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,469
Talk to him
and try to calm him down again.

670
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,388
Come back in anytime if he's ready.

671
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,348
Okay, thank you.

672
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,017
My goodness.

673
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,273
Let's go, Seung-won. I'm sorry.

674
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,859
The patient's losing quite a bit of blood.

675
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,570
What's the BP now?

676
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,488
It's dropping. It's 90 over 70 now.

677
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,284
If we have blood ready, go get it quickly.

678
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,368
Sure.

679
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,467
The doctor from Pediatrics came

680
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:21,265
and performed CPR on the baby
for 20 to 30 minutes,

681
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,227
but that failed as the baby was too young.

682
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,113
You've been doing so well
for almost four weeks.

683
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,659
We did our best,

684
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,078
but we're sorry that this happened.

685
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:47,958
Ms. Kim, you should focus
on your recovery now.

686
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,212
You were under general anesthesia,

687
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,341
so we're going to focus
on helping you recover…

688
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,469
from the surgery.

689
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,258
Mr. Kim, we met three years ago.

690
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,470
Yes. You saved my life back then, Doctor.

691
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,722
Three years ago,

692
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,226
when you collapsed while drinking
and lost consciousness,

693
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,811
your eldest daughter became your donor.

694
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,398
Doctor.

695
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,984
It's all my fault, Doctor.

696
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,153
What did you do after that?

697
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,949
You started drinking again.

698
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,286
So your younger daughter had to
donate her liver last year.

699
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,371
And you're back at it?

700
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,424
Your children volunteered,
but you should not take it for granted.

701
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:19,925
Okay?

702
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,557
It rarely happens now
thanks to the technology,

703
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,560
but many people died
during liver surgeries back in the day.

704
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,479
Donors have to risk their lives
to get the surgery.

705
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,773
Your daughters risked their lives for you.

706
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,444
Countless people die
because they can't find donors.

707
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,865
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,576
If you come back here
with liver damage again,

709
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,786
you'll have to find
a brain-dead liver donor.

710
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,122
But why should I bother
if you'll drink again?

711
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,043
For the sake of the donor
and the donor's family…

712
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,879
I can't. I refuse.

713
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,840
You'll drink again anyway.

714
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,092
I refuse to treat you from now on.

715
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,721
I'll refer you to a clinic near your home,
so please…

716
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,557
don't come back.

717
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,810
Professor Lee, I'm sorry.

718
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,899
I won't drink again. Never, I promise.

719
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,067
I'm sorry.

720
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,694
The next patient, please.

721
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,030
Okay.

722
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,831
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

723
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,001
I think we're almost done.

724
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,754
Yes, Professor. It looks good.

725
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,141
The heartbeat is strong and solid.

726
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,602
Thank goodness.

727
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,605
We can close up the chest.
We won't need an ECMO.

728
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,398
Let's keep this up.

729
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,858
Okay.

730
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,864
Goodness.

731
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,663
Gosh.

732
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,307
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

733
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,359
Do you see that the tumor's been removed?

734
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,944
Yes, Professor.

735
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,739
You can remove the microscope now.

736
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,949
Got it.

737
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,245
What's the BP now? Is the blood going in?

738
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,621
Yes, everything looks fine.

739
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,584
That was a hard one.

740
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,212
We'll close up the dura and the rest.

741
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,923
We'll take care of the rest, Professor.

742
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,552
Okay. Close up the dura thoroughly
so the CSF won't leak.

743
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,597
Keep the bleeding under control
and wrap it up well.

744
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,806
Will do.

745
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,939
We removed the tumor.

746
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,612
Thank you, Professor Chae.

747
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,196
Thank you. Thank you so much.

748
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,198
Thank you so much.

749
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,494
A resident doctor is wrapping up
the surgery at the moment.

750
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,580
The patient will be moved to the ICU soon.

751
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,665
I'll check in on her
when she's in the ICU.

752
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,668
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

753
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,045
Thank you.

754
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,653
Why are you sitting out here all alone
on this cold day?

755
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,822
What about you?

756
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,708
I just have a lot on my mind.

757
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,467
The baby…

758
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,805
I guess you couldn't save it.

759
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,943
It happens very rarely.

760
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,072
A baby expiring as soon as it's out
in the OR.

761
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,495
The mother did her very best

762
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,541
to keep the baby until Week 23.

763
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,221
I have to go do rounds now,

764
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,892
but I really don't want to.

765
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,894
I know what you mean.

766
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,946
I'm at a loss for words.

767
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,494
There's nothing I can say to comfort her.

768
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,999
I really have no idea…

769
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,794
what I should say to her.

770
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,859
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

771
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,328
-Hello?
-Hey, you.

772
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,704
Ik-sun, before the surgery,

773
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,832
I had thought the patient would need
the heart-lung machine,

774
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,959
but the heart was beating so well after…

775
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,506
Are you okay?

776
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,801
-I had an encounter with a racist earlier.
-What?

777
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,303
I went to a café earlier

778
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,431
and ordered a latte.

779
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,558
But the person taking my order
kept asking me,

780
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,477
as if she couldn't understand me.

781
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,978
I only said two words.

782
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,483
I'm pissed right now.

783
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,693
Did you confront them and call them out?

784
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,196
I was so flustered
that I couldn't say anything.

785
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,740
I told Se-gyeong about it
after I left the café,

786
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,201
and Se-gyeong said what I experienced
was racism.

787
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,995
I'm really upset.

788
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,999
By the way,
weren't you saying something earlier?

789
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,711
Right, it was nothing important.

790
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,340
Did you have lunch? Not yet, probably.

791
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,427
I see. I should have dinner too.

792
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,012
Right.

793
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,826
-Hello.
-Hello, Professor Chae.

794
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,704
I just checked the CT scan.

795
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,124
It shows that the tumor
has been completely removed.

796
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,044
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

797
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,546
Everything went as planned.

798
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,007
And she's waking up from anesthesia now.

799
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,968
It is still a bit too early
to say anything,

800
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,762
but we'll see how she recovers
in the ICU for a day or two

801
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,931
and move her back to the room
if all's good.

802
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,099
Okay, thank you.

803
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,809
Thank you so much, Professor Chae.

804
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,438
Our residents will monitor her thoroughly,

805
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,066
and I'll check in on her often as well,
so please don't worry.

806
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,944
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

807
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,029
We'll talk again soon.

808
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,670
Third floor.

809
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,798
Doors are opening.

810
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,135
Professor Chae, you're still here?

811
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,846
I saw the patient, so I'll get going.

812
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,475
Don't tell me you'll go to Sokcho
at this hour.

813
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,560
I'm going to leave in an hour.

814
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,104
But I'll come back right after
my morning appointments.

815
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,649
I have to check in on her
for postoperative hemorrhage.

816
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,067
What?

817
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,237
Then can't you move those appointments
to another day? My goodness.

818
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,366
I can't. I only take
outpatient appointments once a week.

819
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,036
Some patients come all the way
from Samcheok and Donghae.

820
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,955
I'll be back quickly.

821
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,791
Get some sleep before you leave.
You were in surgery all day.

822
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,584
I'll sleep when I get there.

823
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,378
Good job today, Seon-bin.

824
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,338
Thank you for everything, Professor Chae.

825
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,633
Doors are closing.

826
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,218
Hello.

827
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,178
How are you feeling?

828
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,250
Hello, ma'am.

829
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,585
Hello.

830
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,129
You're still here.

831
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,173
Where is Seung-won?

832
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,593
He went to get dinner with his dad.

833
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,636
I see.

834
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,721
I didn't go…

835
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,307
because I was so angry at him.

836
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,817
We couldn't even remove
the stitches today.

837
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,779
He just tired you out.

838
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,117
I'm so upset.

839
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,873
I wonder what's wrong with him.

840
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,417
Why can't he just suck it up and do it?

841
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,253
Gosh…

842
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,424
Oh, boy.

843
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,928
Ma'am.

844
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,475
Seung-won even endured
and recovered from his cancer surgery.

845
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,858
He's had to endure a lot of pain,
so he must know more about it than we do.

846
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,696
I understand why you're upset.

847
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,575
But you came this far
because you've been so patient with him

848
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,869
and have been taking
such great care of him.

849
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,580
So, removing a few stitches…

850
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:02,001
Compared to the time when he was ill
and had to go through surgery,

851
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,964
what happened today is nothing
compared to that.

852
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,719
I'm totally fine,

853
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,431
so please don't worry about it.

854
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,852
We can try again in about a week.

855
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,362
Professor Ahn.

856
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,532
Do you know what people call you?

857
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,242
Pardon me?

858
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,244
You're Catholic,

859
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,788
but your nickname is Buddha.

860
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,415
Oh, that.

861
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,045
Professor Ahn.

862
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,717
I heard rumors that you may be quitting.
It's not true, right?

863
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,721
Why would I quit? No, it's not true.

864
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,806
Thank goodness.

865
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,562
You know,

866
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,398
the thought of you leaving this hospital

867
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,776
worries me more
than my husband quitting his job.

868
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,239
I'll remove Seung-won's stitches

869
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,284
and stay here
until he graduates from high school,

870
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,746
so don't you worry about a thing.
Just go have dinner now.

871
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,708
Seung-won must be waiting for you.

872
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,838
Thank you, Professor Ahn.

873
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,008
Go on.

874
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,429
-I'll get going, then.
-Bye.

875
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:16,344
All the beautiful things in the world

876
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:22,892
How long will they last?

877
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:29,148
Like the flowers that withstood

878
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:35,154
The summer rain showers

879
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:41,452
And the trees that withstood

880
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:47,750
The snowstorm last winter

881
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:54,173
Can everything under the sky

882
00:59:54,257 --> 01:00:01,097
Stand alone?

883
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:07,312
One autumn day

884
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:14,277
While waiting for you
In front of the post office

885
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:20,408
I got carried away by my thoughts

886
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:26,205
And didn't even realize
The sun was setting

887
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:31,961
I didn't even realize

888
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,506
The sun was

889
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,262
Setting

890
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,485
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

891
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,159
How many cups of coffee have we had?

892
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,452
Just four.

893
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,789
I don't think the coffee here
has any caffeine.

894
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,792
I only drink decaf coffee.

895
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,462
Doors are opening.

896
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,298
-Hello, Professor Yang.
-Hello.

897
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,508
Hello.

898
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,887
Hello.

899
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,684
Have you had lunch yet?

900
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,893
Yes, I have.

901
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,770
Hello.

902
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,772
-Hello.
-Hello.

903
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,826
-What are you doing?
-What? Why?

904
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,494
You're pressing the open button.

905
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,287
Oh, right.

906
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,622
Doors are closing.

907
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:51,916
Doors are opening.

908
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,002
Look who's here. The tteokbokki lover!

909
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,088
It's you, Chuchu!

910
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,756
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hi.

911
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,925
-Hello.
-Hello.

912
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:01,884
Hi.

913
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,102
Hey, hit the close button.

914
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,478
Yes, sir.

915
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,690
Doors are closing.

916
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,952
Hello, Director Ju.

917
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,872
Yes.

918
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,793
Okay, I'll do it.

919
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,797
I have some time on the weekend,

920
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,718
but let me check one thing
and call you right back.

921
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,052
Don't confirm it yet.

922
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,138
Okay.

923
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,479
Professor Chae, have some cake.

924
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,856
I was just about to call you.

925
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,400
-Take a seat.
-Me? Why?

926
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,986
Are you free this Saturday?

927
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,362
I'm on duty.

928
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,073
I have to do rounds in the ICU too,

929
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,367
so I can't go anywhere
even if I win the lottery.

930
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,119
What about Seok-min?

931
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:14,207
Right! He has the test, doesn't he?
The second one.

932
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,875
Is it this Saturday?

933
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,919
Yes, he's cramming for the test right now.

934
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,462
I see.

935
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,255
-Why do you ask?
-Nothing.

936
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,179
This cake is good.

937
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,890
You should have bought the whole cake.

938
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:32,892
Just for the two of us?

939
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,977
Yeah, the whole thing.

940
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:38,940
-Oh, right.
-What?

941
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,150
Yoo Gyeong-jin's mother
was looking for you.

942
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,903
Me? Why?

943
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,197
I checked in on her earlier.

944
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,950
I think she wants to talk to you
about something.

945
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,376
Obstetrics.

946
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:02,255
-Studying your textbooks again?
-Put that down. Don't touch anything.

947
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,715
Just ask your questions
and get lost, will you?

948
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,851
You have two surgeries today.
Aren't you busy?

949
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,061
I am, but I came to see you.

950
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,187
Why?

951
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,690
-I need answers when I'm curious.
-What is it?

952
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,984
Are you and Sin-hye back together?

953
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,531
Why did you two meet up today?
Her father has been discharged.

954
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,910
Are you guys trying to see
if you can make things work?

955
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,414
No.

956
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,834
Her father had an appointment here today,

957
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,586
and I ran into her in the elevator.

958
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,630
I see. My goodness.

959
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,551
Any possibility
that you could get back together?

960
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,970
Zero.

961
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,807
"Zero"?

962
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,436
Yes, zero.

963
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,397
There's zero chance that will happen.

964
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,741
I came here to have dinner with you.

965
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,662
Let's…

966
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,208
meet up like this and have dinner together
once in a while.

967
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,962
Can we do that?

968
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,066
To be honest, seeing you like this…

969
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,403
makes me uncomfortable.

970
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,661
When I see you, I still feel bad.

971
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,081
And I feel guilty

972
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,668
for not being there for you
when you were having a hard time.

973
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,426
But you know, I think…

974
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,765
we should put our relationship behind us
and move on.

975
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,146
I'm fine with running into you like this,

976
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,983
but that's it.

977
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,405
Okay.

978
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,534
I understand what you're trying to say.

979
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,725
DIRECTOR JU

980
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,565
Hello, sir.

981
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,942
You said you'd call me right back.

982
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,654
-I don't think I can do it.
-What? Why not?

983
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,532
Others would kill
for an opportunity like this.

984
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,493
Can they do a different day?
Does it have to be this Saturday?

985
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,163
It's the only day that works for them.

986
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,832
You performed the surgery,
so you should do it.

987
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,792
You said you were available.

988
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,004
I'll pass.

989
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,841
-Why don't you do it in my place?
-My goodness.

990
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,926
Why should I?

991
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,889
Anyway, all right.
I'll politely turn it down.

992
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,015
Okay.

993
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,809
Professor Chae, thanks for everything.

994
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,729
I promise I won't overwork you like this
anymore.

995
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:49,690
No, it's fine.

996
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,859
If it's surgery for VIP patients,
don't worry.

997
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,570
Send them over to me right away.

998
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:58,157
I didn't know you had this side to you.

999
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,327
Anyway, take it easy.

1000
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,912
-Will do.
-Bye.

1001
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,182
My gosh. What's with the flowers?

1002
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,476
We can't accept gifts,

1003
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:29,605
but Ms. Kim Su-jeong asked me
to make sure Professor Yang gets it.

1004
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,819
I guess he didn't get to see her leave.

1005
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,322
-He's still in surgery, right?
-Yes.

1006
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,910
He texted her last night.

1007
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,539
Who? Professor Yang?

1008
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,250
-Yes.
-That's very unlike him.

1009
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:53,170
He asked me for her contact information
last night.

1010
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,340
He said he had never texted a patient
since passing the board exam.

1011
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:58,134
I see. So what did he say to her?

1012
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,680
-Hello, Professor Yang.
-Hello.

1013
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,224
Yes, hi.

1014
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,813
What are these flowers for?

1015
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,524
Patient Kim Su-jeong
dropped them off for you.

1016
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,733
There's a card inside.

1017
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,155
We can't accept flowers.

1018
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,448
-Professor Yang.
-Take it easy.

1019
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:37,006
-Where are you going?
-The VIP Ward. You?

1020
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,133
-The ICU. Do you have surgery?
-Yes.

1021
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,552
But I'm going there while they get ready.

1022
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:42,845
A new optician's shop?

1023
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,763
Yes, so everything's 30 percent off.

1024
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,934
Hi! Look who's here.

1025
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,478
It's Dr. Heo Seon-bin,
the third-year NS resident

1026
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,190
who is suspected to be dating Dr. Yong.

1027
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,608
You know everything.

1028
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,401
Hello.

1029
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,530
-Professor, did you hear?
-About what?

1030
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,991
Is this the start of an interesting story?

1031
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,702
A German TV station
wants to cover the story.

1032
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:09,455
I don't think Ms. Yoo is well enough
to be interviewed yet.

1033
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,457
They want to interview Professor Chae.

1034
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,084
-Song-hwa?
-Yes.

1035
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:20,049
The best neurosurgeon in Korea
who saved the world-famous violinist.

1036
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,592
They want to interview you.

1037
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:24,595
I know. Director Ju told me about it.

1038
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,554
Really?

1039
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,182
But I already declined the request.

1040
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:32,019
Why? Why did you decline the request?

1041
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,812
Just because. No reason.

1042
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:37,858
I bet it's because of her mother.

1043
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,488
You turned it down because
you don't like her mother, right?

1044
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,407
No, I don't dislike her mother.

1045
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:49,328
And even if I did, why would I
turn down the interview because of that?

1046
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,704
That's not it.

1047
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,332
Then why? Why did you turn it down?

1048
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,256
Because none of you would be available.

1049
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,760
How could I do it alone
when we all worked hard together?

1050
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,764
I thought it'd be great
to have you guys join me,

1051
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,058
so I suggested a few different time slots,

1052
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:14,061
but they can only do this Saturday.

1053
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,480
That's why I turned it down.

1054
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,856
This is nuts.

1055
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,318
Professor Chae…

1056
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,529
I told them we'd find another time

1057
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,948
when everyone is available.

1058
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,705
What are you doing?

1059
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,165
I made a statue of Song-hwa.

1060
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,211
What? Seriously?

1061
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,629
-Is that me?
-Yes.

1062
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,256
Next time, it'll be a bronze one.

1063
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,925
Forget it. I'm off.

1064
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:50,306
Hey, try it on.

1065
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,267
-Cut it out.
-It doesn't look so bad.

1066
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,601
Try it on.

1067
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,061
-Try it on.
-You try it on.

1068
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,023
No, Song-hwa! No!

1069
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,483
-Stop it.
-Are you all right?

1070
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,528
-Try it on.
-Hand it over. Let me try it on.

1071
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,573
-Song-hwa!
-Hey, it ripped! My face is torn.

1072
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,410
Next time,
it will be a full statue made of bronze.

1073
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,509
Hello, Professor Yang.
It's me, your patient Kim Su-jeong.

1074
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,346
I really wanted to see you before I leave,

1075
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,973
but you were in surgery,
so I'm writing to you instead.

1076
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,603
Professor Yang, I cried so much

1077
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,688
when I got your text last night.

1078
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:42,358
I wanted to leave
with a big smile on my face,

1079
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,235
but your text message moved me
and my husband to tears.

1080
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,990
Professor Yang, please don't be sorry.

1081
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:55,746
Thanks to you, we had a meaningful month
listening to our baby's heartbeat

1082
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,082
and feeling our baby
for the very first time.

1083
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,418
You probably have no idea

1084
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,588
how precious those moments were to me
and my husband

1085
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,423
even though they were short-lived.

1086
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:13,597
Professor Yang,
if another angel comes to me,

1087
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:18,185
I'd like you to protect me
and my baby again.

1088
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:23,482
Thank you so much
for everything you did for us.

1089
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,319
Oh, my husband

1090
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:31,407
already printed the quote you sent us
and framed it.

1091
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:02,729
I found this quote on the first page
of my Obstetrics textbook.

1092
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,275
"Bad things at times…

1093
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:12,114
do happen to good people."

1094
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,457
Professor Chae.

1095
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,750
Yes?

1096
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:25,377
Are you still single?

1097
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,505
Pardon me? Oh, yes.

1098
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,551
Would you like to meet
Gyeong-jin's brother?

1099
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,474
I think the two of you
are around the same age.

1100
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,894
He doesn't take after me,
so he's kind and diligent.

1101
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,312
I see.

1102
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,939
He has his own pharmacy.
A pretty big one in Gangnam.

1103
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,152
If you're okay with it,

1104
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,280
I'd love to introduce you to each other.

1105
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,732
THIS HAS AN EXTRA SHOT OF ESPRESSO

1106
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,822
IF YOU'RE NOT SLEEPY,
DRINK THIS DECAF COFFEE

1107
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,725
-He's coming?
-He moved all his appointments

1108
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,685
-to come here right away.
-I'm coming now.

1109
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,103
Isn't there a guardian?

1110
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,356
There's no one. No family or relatives.

1111
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:33,982
And she's always alone.

1112
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,610
The patient's not doing well,
so we don't have time.

1113
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,987
-Can you take a look?
-Is it someone you know?

1114
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,155
Who is it?

1115
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,533
If you think the surgery can't be done,

1116
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,118
then I'll give up.

1117
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,411
Don't worry too much.

1118
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,748
I believe in miracles.

1119
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,209
We'll go into surgery now.

1120
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:56,546
Are you not seeing anyone?
I mean a girlfriend.

1121
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,716
Just pick one of your friends
and say he's your boyfriend.

1122
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:01,885
I have a date.

1123
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,597
The owner of Yulje Medical Center.
A rich heir.

1124
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,642
You know that your mother owns
some land in Hwaseong, right?

1125
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:11,895
-She'll give it to you, as inheritance.
-Really?

1126
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:13,605
If it's him, they'll believe you.

1127
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,440
Your best friend.

1128
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:19,194
They brag every day
about going camping with their dad.

1129
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:21,571
We can go too. Let's go camping.

1130
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,781
-Really?
-Yes.

1131
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,534
What if people see us?

1132
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,452
Everyone will find out at this rate.

1133
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,621
She probably won't give up.

1134
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:38,630
