1
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,067
-Hello, I'd like an iced hot cappuccino.
-Me too.

2
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,321
"Iced hot cappuccino"?

3
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,658
Hot or cold?

4
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,617
Cold, please.

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,995
Thank you.

6
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,331
The new interns who are scarier
than the devil have arrived.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,792
They say

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,714
you should never get sick in March.

9
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,425
They were just med students
up until February 28.

10
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,135
But as of March 1, they're interns.

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,472
They know nothing
but suddenly become interns overnight.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,268
I'm really hoping
for a not-so-eventful year.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,772
Only small blunders, nothing major.

14
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,983
Were you a troublemaker
when you were an intern?

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,610
I sure was.

16
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,613
Once, I cried four times in just a day.

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,949
Even just doing an arterial blood test.
By December, it was so easy.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,620
But I wasn't used to it in March,
so I tried it multiple times.

19
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,664
I got teary-eyed, and so did the patient.

20
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,291
And when patients were in pain,

21
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:27,378
I wasn't sure which pain medicine to use
and how to notify the others.

22
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,589
The worst was
when I had to call my professor.

23
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,757
Totally.

24
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,842
I had to call my professor,

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,262
but I could feel my heart
racing like crazy.

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,640
I always wrote down
what I was going to say.

27
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,475
I made a script

28
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,228
and read off of it,
as if my professor was in front of me.

29
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,896
I remember how scared I was.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,482
I even wrote down how it should be read.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,903
I'd write "In a polite
but urgent manner" in parentheses.

32
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,988
Professor, I'm really sorry.

33
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,241
-Hello.
-Hello.

34
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,786
Hi. The scrubs look good on you.

35
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,663
Where are you interning?

36
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,581
-In OB-GYN.
-I'm in Surgery.

37
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,584
Right, you should start
with the four main departments.

38
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,671
Gosh, then when will we meet?

39
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:15,760
Hong-do, Cardiothoracic Surgery
is calling you

40
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,680
"Yes!"
And he runs over

41
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,516
But they say, "Yun-bok, not you"

42
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,646
Hong-do, I know you're coming
to Cardiothoracic Surgery.

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,691
Yun-bok, I hope
you make a wise decision too.

44
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,068
Cardiothoracic Surgery is trying
to reduce the work hours.

45
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,778
The professors said

46
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,949
that they'll guarantee
the quality of life of residents.

47
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,076
Is CS getting
zero new residents this year?

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
Your coffee is getting cold. Drink up.
Oh, it's cold.

49
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,791
Yun-bok, after you're trained
in the four major departments,

50
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,587
come join us. Don't make me wait too long.

51
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,840
I hope to see you
in the CS Medical Office.

52
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,176
Well, I've already made up my mind
to join Neurosurgery.

53
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,306
Yun-bok, do you want some cake?

54
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,058
Let's go. It's on NS.

55
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,478
NS is rich. We have a lot of people.

56
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,980
Let's go.

57
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,117
Here! Fellow Jang Gyeo-ul.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,076
Come join me.

59
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,329
Hello.

60
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,122
Hello.

61
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,629
That short coat looks great on you,
Fellow Jang Gyeo-ul.

62
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,050
Thank you. It's the only thing
that I get dry-cleaned.

63
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,595
Of course. You finally got it
after coveting it for years.

64
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:45,558
I heard GS got
three new residents this year.

65
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,144
-It can't be true.
-It is true.

66
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,857
-Are you that excited?
-Yes, I'm so excited.

67
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,776
I've always worked alone,

68
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,278
so I'm happy to have
lots of interns and residents.

69
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,696
I'll be so good to them.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,032
We had two interns join us last year,

71
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,910
but both of them had to work
at our branches

72
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,578
in Jongno, Sokcho, and Sejong.

73
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,038
This year, they all came here.

74
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,832
Two in their second year
and three in their first year.

75
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,253
One of them went to our Jongno branch,
but four of them came here.

76
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,755
It's all thanks to you.

77
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,259
I bet all the interns applied
because they saw how well you were doing.

78
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,179
No. There are new benefits now,
and it's changed to three years.

79
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,806
It's not because of me.

80
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,352
By the way, did Cardiothoracic Surgery

81
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,772
not get a single new resident this year?

82
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,816
No.

83
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,029
But you have senior residents.

84
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,781
Yes, in their third and fourth year.

85
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,536
Gosh, poor Chang-min.
He has to do everything again this year.

86
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,999
NS has four new residents this year.

87
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,837
Even the one who had left came back.

88
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,840
What was that?

89
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,342
-Hi.
-Hello.

90
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,054
I can't have breakfast today.
I have a conference. Bye.

91
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
I have to head out too.

92
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,182
Have this on the way.

93
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,229
My gosh, the coffee smells so good.
Can I have a sip?

94
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,444
You got home late last night.
I heard you come in.

95
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,572
Yes. Gyeo-ul was
feeling under the weather,

96
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,574
so I was with her until pretty late.

97
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,082
Her brother is getting married soon.

98
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,168
He's already moved in with his fiancée.

99
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,132
What?

100
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,884
When are you…

101
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,470
getting married?

102
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,017
I'm planning to propose to her soon.

103
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,150
Can I live with you guys?

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,780
You're a freak.

105
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,799
You have steered off course.

106
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,635
Recalculating route.

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,930
No, this is a faster route.

108
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,099
You always get confused here.

109
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,600
But I forgive you.

110
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,269
To get to Yulje Medical Center,
turn right in 300m

111
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,646
into the four-lane road.

112
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,273
No, I'm taking the three-lane road.
It's the same.

113
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,026
INCOMING CALL
CHAE SONG-HWA

114
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,363
I want an iced vanilla latte.

115
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,615
All right. Are you in the parking lot?

116
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,409
I'm five minutes away.
Stay there. I want coffee too.

117
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,662
Okay, I'll be at the café.

118
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,913
Okay, see you in a bit.

119
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,797
Will you not regret this?

120
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,883
What? Coming back?

121
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,970
I won't regret it.

122
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,974
I got a serious reality check

123
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,476
and came back
because I regretted leaving this place.

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,311
Why would I regret doing a fellowship?

125
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,814
I don't regret my decision.

126
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,567
Do you plan to stay
with the goal of becoming a professor?

127
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,903
No. He wants to receive more training
on surgery from Professor Chae

128
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,405
and leave again in two years.

129
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,702
My experience taught me
that I still have a lot to learn.

130
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,247
I told you to wait until
after the first year of your fellowship.

131
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,958
Why did you leave in such a hurry?

132
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,837
At first, I was told to specialize
in spine surgery, so I said yes.

133
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,798
I'm not sure if this is a good thing,

134
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,425
but I was asked to take over

135
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,802
when the cerebrovascular
disease specialist left.

136
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,972
Cerebrovascular disease intrigues me…

137
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,686
but I don't feel experienced
or skilled enough for the surgeries.

138
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,356
The same goes for the spine.
I had no experience whatsoever.

139
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,443
At the other hospital,

140
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,488
there were so many smart,
experienced senior surgeons

141
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,742
that I felt I'd never get a chance
to perform surgery on my own.

142
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,245
So I felt lost for about half a year.

143
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,041
Then Professor Chae told me there was
a vacancy for a fellow, so I applied.

144
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,129
I hear you. I feel the same way.

145
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,925
I still don't feel confident when
I have to perform surgery on my own.

146
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,053
The others and I talk about it
every day in the on-call room.

147
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,138
"Can we perform surgery?"

148
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,932
I ask myself that too.

149
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,392
All right, let's stop
being so hard on ourselves.

150
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,312
But don't you regret taking a pay cut?

151
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,482
Your salary was three times higher
than what you'd make as a fellow.

152
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,400
You see,

153
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,113
you can make more money
when you're a skilled doctor and surgeon.

154
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,325
Learning how to do
aneurysm coiling and clipping

155
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,826
will broaden my surgery skills.

156
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,789
You were only gone for a year,
but it sounds like you learned a lot.

157
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,043
I want to make a lot of money.

158
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,963
I'll earn a lot of money

159
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,423
so my parents
who worked hard to pay for my education

160
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,675
can live comfortably.

161
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,970
I came back so I can earn more money.

162
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,305
Is money everything to you?

163
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,432
Yes, it is.

164
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,604
I need to earn more
so I can give my parents more money

165
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,398
and buy a car and a house.

166
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,316
I still don't own a car.

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,859
That's nothing to boast about.

168
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,819
I don't either.

169
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,697
And I want to get married.

170
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,662
Why are you telling me this?

171
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
I need money to get married.

172
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,459
It won't happen with the money I have now.

173
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,589
Why must we witness his marriage proposal
first thing in the morning?

174
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,799
I have money.

175
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,387
You don't need to spend a penny.

176
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,060
-Is this how you say it?
-I don't know.

177
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,355
Well, I can't

178
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,899
get married empty-handed.

179
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,944
Then bring a spoon.

180
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,238
My gosh.

181
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,494
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

182
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,787
Sure.

183
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,754
Are we invisible to them?

184
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,464
I guess they can't see us.

185
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,357
One hot Americano
and one iced vanilla latte, please.

186
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,234
-The regular size?
-Well--

187
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,403
A regular hot Americano and a large IVL.

188
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,156
-Hi.
-Hi, Professor Lee. You're late today.

189
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,200
It happens, you know.

190
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,035
We're friends on social media.

191
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,828
What?

192
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,955
You don't need to know.

193
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,707
Fine. Here.

194
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,131
Shall we drink it here?

195
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,009
-Do you have time?
-Yes, I do. What about you?

196
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,845
I have about 30 minutes.
I have a quick conference.

197
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,807
Then let's drink it quickly.

198
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,438
Surgery is nothing new. I always do it.

199
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,982
I advise them on their theses.

200
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:36,278
Right, I'm on the committee
for the Brain Tumor Conference.

201
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,822
What else?

202
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,828
The communications team asked me
to give three lectures,

203
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,122
which will happen this month.

204
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,834
Also, Daddy-Long-Legs received
two surgery inquiries.

205
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,711
I'm doing one this week
and the other one next week.

206
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,005
That's all.

207
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,176
Oh, hello.

208
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,553
Hello.

209
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,971
Professor Chae.

210
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,474
-It's so nice to see you in Seoul.
-Yes.

211
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,644
I was actually going to call you.

212
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,021
Can you take care
of just one surgery for me?

213
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,774
Oh, sure.

214
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,487
Repeat after me.

215
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,825
"I'm sorry. I'm booked back to back."

216
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,411
No, take out "I'm sorry."

217
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,164
How can I turn it down? His mother is ill.

218
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,125
But it didn't sound like an urgent case.

219
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,961
Or say you'll do it next month
because you're too busy now.

220
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,839
I can't believe you told him
you have some time next week.

221
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,926
Of course,
you'll have time on the weekend.

222
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,306
Hey, what's up? I'm here now.

223
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,017
Professor,
a patient just came into the ER.

224
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,561
An 18-year-old female
injured in a motorcycle accident.

225
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,272
The CT scan shows
an acute SDH on the left,

226
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,691
and there's a midline shift
of about 1.5cm.

227
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,775
Mental status, stupor.

228
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,778
And her left pupil
has dilated to about 0.4 or 0.5.

229
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,449
Her left-side motor function is intact,
but the right side's is Grade 2.

230
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,867
What's her BP now?

231
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,452
It's 160 over 90.

232
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,765
Interns only need to do

233
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,059
what the professors tell them to do.

234
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,603
Pull and let go when you're told to.

235
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,359
You know what a Richardson is?

236
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,777
RICHARDSON: RICHARDSON RETRACTOR

237
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,821
You need to hold it down

238
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,699
and remove it
right before the baby comes out.

239
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,493
Otherwise, it could hurt the baby.

240
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,203
That's correct.

241
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,457
Professor Yang will say,
"Richardson, out."

242
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,377
When you hear that,
go ahead and remove it. Okay?

243
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,003
Yes, got it.

244
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,381
Just remember that.

245
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,550
I won't ask you for anything else.

246
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,969
"Richardson, out."

247
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,721
Just do that one thing right,
and you'll get an A+. Okay?

248
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,723
Okay.

249
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,477
Is everything okay in the ward?

250
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,523
Professor Lee, Baek Hui-do's
daily L-tube drainage is usually 500cc,

251
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,857
but it's only 100cc today.

252
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,360
-How's the patient?
-No improvement.

253
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,987
The same as yesterday.

254
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,447
Oh, boy. Then let's do an abdominal X-ray.

255
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,074
We'll try to unclog it if needed.

256
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,617
If that fails, we'll change it.

257
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,702
-Okay.
-Thank you.

258
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,703
No problem.

259
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,001
Is this the intern? About Baek Hui-do
who got a liver resection.

260
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,589
The L-tube seems to be clogged.
There's a request to change it.

261
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,341
"L-tube"? The nasogastric tube?

262
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,260
Yes, it should be changed.

263
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,721
-Okay, got it.
-Thank you.

264
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,795
Okay, thank you.

265
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,174
-Did you book an OR?
-Yes, I spoke with Anesthesiology.

266
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,134
But we don't have consent yet.

267
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,303
Her guardian isn't here yet.

268
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,763
Really? Do they live far?

269
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,473
Yes, they're coming from Chuncheon.

270
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,142
They won't be here for another hour.

271
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,353
I'm from there,
so I know how long it takes.

272
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,604
Can we call anyone else?

273
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
-There's no one else we can contact.
-Gosh.

274
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,609
We have to save her though.

275
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,028
Get started. Have the guardian
sign the consent upon arriving.

276
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,323
Okay, I've already explained the situation
over the phone.

277
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,991
Hold on. What about her boyfriend?

278
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,787
The paramedic said her boyfriend drove.

279
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,622
She was riding pillion.

280
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,290
Where is her boyfriend?

281
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,418
-He went home.
-Sorry?

282
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,464
He only has a small cut on his forehead,
so he went home after getting it dressed.

283
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,009
Only he was wearing a helmet.

284
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,762
His girlfriend rode pillion
without a helmet.

285
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,347
He sped and violated the signal,

286
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,807
then crashed on a speed bump.

287
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,850
Jeez.

288
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,777
Hello.

289
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,072
Hello.

290
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,533
I have to check your tube.

291
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,410
-It'll be a bit uncomfortable.
-Okay.

292
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,453
All right.

293
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,916
Can you swallow?

294
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
Swallow.

295
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,838
Good, one more time.

296
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,841
-Wait…
-Try again. Swallow.

297
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,136
Yes, that's it. Swallow.

298
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,220
Good.

299
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,306
A little more. Swallow.

300
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,934
All right, it's done.

301
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,103
You did well.

302
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
Thank you.

303
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,197
The arcuate vessels are very active.

304
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,868
-She's bleeding. Suction.
-Yes, sir.

305
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,209
The baby is coming out.

306
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,018
That little…

307
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,186
Where's he going?

308
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,606
-I'm sorry, Professor.
-Didn't you do a proper handover?

309
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,025
I did. I'll train him again.

310
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,031
They're both contaminated now,
so we'll do without them.

311
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,950
-The baby is coming out.
-Yes.

312
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,080
You're so dead.

313
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,334
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

314
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,591
Where is Ms. Song Su-bin?

315
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,052
In the treatment room.
She'll be back shortly.

316
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,721
I took care of it.

317
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,848
-Please do an X-ray and check.
-Okay.

318
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,308
I'll take a look.

319
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,102
Hello.

320
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,521
My gosh.

321
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,403
Doctor, this is a bit uncomfortable.

322
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,157
I'm sorry. I'll remove one right away.

323
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,419
That must have been
very uncomfortable. I'm sorry.

324
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,088
Our intern hasn't done it before,

325
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,549
so she only remembered
to put in a new one.

326
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,051
I should have trained her better.

327
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,220
I apologize.

328
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,475
No worries.
My eldest kid also just started working.

329
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,728
My kid must make lots of mistakes too.
It's okay.

330
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,064
I feel much better now.

331
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,819
It's really okay,
so please don't scold her.

332
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,029
Okay, I won't.

333
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,157
I'm really sorry, sir.

334
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,534
No, don't be. It's okay.

335
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,587
The brain edema is quite severe.
She may not regain her consciousness.

336
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,048
There's some pulsation though.

337
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,052
Her boyfriend who drove has already left.

338
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,222
Really? Was he wearing a helmet?

339
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,891
Yes.

340
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,311
His girlfriend is on the verge of death.

341
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,438
Is the patient's guardian here?

342
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,731
Is her mother here?

343
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,108
Yes, she's in the waiting room.

344
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,956
SURGERY PATIENT FAMILY
WAITING ROOM

345
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,958
What happened, honey?

346
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,879
My gosh, what happened?

347
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,722
Can the anesthesiologist check her BP?

348
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,724
It's 150 over 80.

349
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,893
Is the bleeding still severe?

350
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,519
The brain hemorrhage is severe.

351
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,439
Blood keeps seeping from the skull base.

352
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,899
I'm struggling to control it.

353
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,324
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

354
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,333
Doctor, how's my daughter?

355
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,754
She's okay, right? She'll live, right?

356
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,548
The surgery went well.

357
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,595
She suffered a skull fracture
when her head hit the ground.

358
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,723
There was severe bleeding
within the meninges,

359
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,017
so we operated on her as fast as we could.

360
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,354
We opened her skull
and got rid of the blood.

361
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,565
It was difficult to stop the bleeding,

362
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,901
so it took us a while
to get it under control,

363
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,569
but the surgery went well.

364
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,368
A subdural hemorrhage refers to
bleeding that occurs under the dura mater.

365
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,747
The thing is, this type of bleeding
often results in complications.

366
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,044
Her brain is quite swollen at the moment,
so we couldn't close up the skull.

367
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,548
We could only stitch up the skin
without the bone.

368
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,427
We'll perform another surgery
to put back the bone.

369
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,976
She'll regain consciousness, right?

370
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,061
Du-na…

371
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,482
will wake up, right?

372
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,989
I can't guarantee that she will.

373
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,872
To tell you the truth,
that wasn't our priority.

374
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,333
Our goal was to save her life

375
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,376
because she was in critical condition.

376
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,503
All I can tell you now

377
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,008
is that we'll keep monitoring her
in the ICU and see how it goes.

378
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,933
The cerebral edema is still pretty severe,

379
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,102
but the brain is pulsating.

380
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,231
Her brain isn't dead,

381
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,735
so let's wait and hope
that she will wake up.

382
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,914
MY EVERYTHING

383
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,291
I miss you too, son.

384
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,502
Dad, we should go camping too.

385
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,004
Mo-ne's family is taking
their camper van this week.

386
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,632
They're going all the way to Donghae
to eat snow crab.

387
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,676
I want to go camping too, Dad.

388
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,137
Mo-ne's family is going camping again?

389
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,973
I wonder what
Mo-ne's dad does for a living.

390
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,935
Dad, let's go camping too. Please?

391
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,853
I want to sit by a campfire and relax.

392
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,982
I'm surprised you know these things.
Okay, we'll go. I promise.

393
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,901
Hey.

394
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,073
Seriously, you have my word.

395
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,908
When? When are we going, then?

396
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,829
Well, before cicadas start singing.

397
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,375
Yes, I promise you we'll go camping
before cicadas start singing.

398
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,585
But cicadas won't
start singing for a while.

399
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,714
Really? Then…

400
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,508
How about when cicadas molt?

401
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,386
Hey, he won't know what "molt" means.

402
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,222
Sounds good.
We'll go when cicadas start molting,

403
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,684
when the nymphs reach the imago phase.
We'll go camping then, okay?

404
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,689
What's he saying? What is an imago?

405
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,858
It's the same as molting.

406
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,694
Okay. We'll do that, U-ju.

407
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,822
You have my word.
When the cicadas start molting,

408
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,575
we'll go camping together.

409
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,743
Yes, I love you too.

410
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,957
He hasn't joined Mensa yet.
Can it be done online?

411
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,626
I'll find out.

412
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,630
Let's go eat something. I'm hungry.

413
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,340
Where's everyone?

414
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,092
They went home.
We're the only ones on duty.

415
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,428
What shall we eat? Any ideas?

416
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,723
Well…

417
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,267
Naengmyeon?

418
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,269
Let's order naengmyeon.

419
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,771
Two plain, one spicy, and dumplings.

420
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,023
What do you say?

421
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:48,486
My, I'm surprised you can always
think of something you want to eat.

422
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,738
Does it just come to you?

423
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,407
Yes. It does, like a musical motif.

424
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,534
I never have to try.

425
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,162
It's like an epiphany.
They suddenly pop into my head.

426
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,997
If you could write songs like this--

427
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,665
-I'd be like Beethoven.
-Or Mozart.

428
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,417
My goodness.

429
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,422
It'll be delicious.

430
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,392
Professor Ahn.

431
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,063
You're not on duty.

432
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,691
Do you still have stuff to do?

433
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,946
Let me see. What is this?

434
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,034
Well…

435
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,955
This part is redundant,
so I think you can take it out.

436
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,997
Okay.

437
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,707
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

438
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,584
Yes, hello.

439
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,879
Choi Se-hoon in first year.
Nam Yu-ri, also in first year.

440
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,258
Kim Geon in second year.
And you're Hwang Ji-woo in second year.

441
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,093
-Did I get it right?
-You did.

442
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,680
You're the only professor
who remembers all of our names.

443
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,266
That's because we're only in March now.

444
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,810
By the way,
how come you guys are still here?

445
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,063
I'm taking them out for dinner and drinks.

446
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,232
I see. That's awesome.

447
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,150
I'll see you around.

448
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,568
-Yes--
-Wait.

449
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,862
Use this.

450
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you.

451
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,493
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

452
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,203
-Have fun.
-Good night.

453
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,455
I'll go get changed quickly.

454
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,874
Get changed and meet me in the lobby.

455
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,584
-Sure.
-Okay.

456
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,424
Hey. Professor Ahn is not married, right?

457
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,467
No, he's not. Why do you ask?

458
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,635
He's totally my type.

459
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,069
You hungry bums!

460
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,658
They know I was referring to them.

461
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,452
What? What is it?

462
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,413
Slow down, will you?

463
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,622
I'm done.

464
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,671
Shall we have pork belly
from that place tomorrow?

465
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,631
Sure, sounds good.

466
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,385
Hey, Jun-wan.

467
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,722
You're not on duty. Go home.

468
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,682
Are you like a ghost that lives here?

469
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,019
-I'm not going home to an empty house.
-Jeez.

470
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,022
Jeong-won rarely comes home these days,

471
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,566
and Jae-hak said
he has to have dinner with his wife.

472
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,860
Those jerks.

473
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,945
Gosh, they're so selfish.

474
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,781
You should date too.

475
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,282
I don't want to.

476
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,329
It's been a while
since you and your lovely dove broke up.

477
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,541
How about I set you up with someone?
A good friend of mine.

478
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,460
No, thanks. I'm not interested.

479
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,421
I'm still not over my ex.

480
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,760
I still think about her every day.

481
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,429
I think about her before I fall asleep,

482
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,764
when I'm walking,

483
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,933
and when I'm eating
something good like now.

484
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,602
Why can't I forget her?

485
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,648
Why are you asking me?
You figure it out yourself.

486
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,317
I'm stepping out for this.

487
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,461
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

488
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,474
Well, ma'am.

489
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,061
I think you should speak
with Professor Yang.

490
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,108
The ultrasound shows

491
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,777
some potential abnormalities
that make us suspect

492
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,904
your baby may have esophageal atresia.

493
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,407
Sorry?

494
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,909
My gosh.

495
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,703
You mean,

496
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,665
the esophagus is blocked?

497
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,377
Yes. An esophageal stricture or blockage

498
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,630
can be detected with an ultrasound
before birth,

499
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,507
but not always.

500
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,800
At the moment though,

501
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,512
I'd say it's very likely that
your baby has esophageal atresia.

502
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,432
But we won't know for sure

503
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,059
until we take an X-ray
after the baby is born.

504
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,189
We'll have our pediatric surgeons
take a look at your case.

505
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,941
It'll be helpful for you
to get their opinion.

506
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,985
Okay.

507
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,654
We'll talk later.

508
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,493
Professor Yang, would you like me
to call Pediatric Surgery?

509
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,579
No, I'll talk to Professor Ahn directly.

510
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,217
Seong-yeong.

511
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,804
It's nice that you're checking in
on Hwang Du-na often,

512
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,097
but make sure
you don't neglect other patients.

513
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,016
Hey, we have a lot to do.

514
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,935
Go organize the charts if you have time.

515
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,354
You can sleep one more hour
if you do it now.

516
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,064
Okay.

517
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,630
HWANG DU-NA
FEMALE, AGE 18

518
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,591
Is she a college student?

519
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,802
Yes, a freshman. She's from Chuncheon.

520
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,683
I guess Seong-yeong is worried
because he's also from Chuncheon.

521
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,687
I think I used to be like that too.

522
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,439
You?

523
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,233
Yes, I used to be like that.

524
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,403
When I saw a patient
with the same name as mine,

525
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,238
I became all chatty.

526
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,575
And I felt a sense of kinship
with patients around my age.

527
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,995
So don't be harsh on Seong-yeong.

528
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,250
Later on, he won't even
feel those emotions anyway.

529
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,835
Okay.

530
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,173
But I feel like you were born a professor.

531
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,012
Were you ever a stupid intern?

532
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,475
I did a lot of stupid things.

533
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,740
Hello.

534
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,783
-Hello.
-Hello.

535
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,288
I'm glad I ran into you.

536
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,749
Well…

537
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,753
She's hospitalized at the moment
due to severe preeclampsia,

538
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,006
and we detected signs of EA
in her ultrasound today.

539
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,674
Can you take a look?

540
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,885
Sure. How many weeks?
What's the fetal weight?

541
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,887
At 30 weeks. The weight is 1.3kg.

542
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,308
But the mother's preeclampsia
is quite severe,

543
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,101
so a preterm birth is highly likely.

544
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,355
Oh, boy.

545
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,983
I get a feeling
that we'll have a big meeting soon.

546
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,450
We're suspecting it
based on the antepartum test results,

547
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,327
but we won't know for sure

548
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,246
until we run some tests
after the baby is born.

549
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,292
We can do an X-ray to confirm it.

550
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,044
And if it is confirmed,

551
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,798
we'll perform surgery
one or two days after the baby is born.

552
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:54,013
I looked it up on the Internet

553
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,934
and read that a thoracoscopy is usually
performed to repair esophageal atresia.

554
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,312
Will my baby undergo
that procedure as well?

555
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:06,442
In most cases, yes. We'd insert
a thoracoscope into the chest.

556
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,113
But if the baby is too small
or is in an unstable condition,

557
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,783
we'll have no choice
but to perform open-chest surgery.

558
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:19,330
We'll have a better idea
when the baby is born.

559
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,293
Professor, will my baby

560
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,840
be able to live normally as an adult?

561
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,802
Of course. The baby will be fine
if the surgery goes well.

562
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,683
If there are no other issues,

563
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,768
and if it heals well after the surgery,

564
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,437
your baby will have no problem

565
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,690
and grow up just like other kids
who never underwent such surgery.

566
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,275
Thank you, Professor Ahn.

567
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,279
You can thank me after the surgery.

568
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,074
The esophageal atresia surgery
is a difficult procedure.

569
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:59,245
The smaller the baby,
the more difficult it is.

570
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,164
But we're very experienced,

571
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,000
and all the babies we've operated on
recovered well,

572
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,835
so don't worry too much.

573
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,714
Then I'll see you again
after the baby is born,

574
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,341
if esophageal atresia is confirmed.

575
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,803
Okay, thank you.

576
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,142
I heard about a new gimbap place
in front of the county office,

577
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,227
-so I went there earlier.
-Where's your hat?

578
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,353
Right!

579
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,446
I just wanted to buy some gimbap,
but what's it called? A "Kisk" or "disk"?

580
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,490
You know, the machine that cashes you out.

581
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,658
A kiosk. What about your phone?

582
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,993
Oh, right.

583
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,623
Jeez. The sun will go down
before we can go for a walk.

584
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,083
My goodness.

585
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,168
What's it called again?

586
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,879
Anyway, I didn't know
how to use the machine,

587
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,798
so I got the owner to cash me out.

588
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,801
Even buying gimbap
is a struggle for me these days.

589
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,135
What's that in your hand?

590
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,139
Goodness.

591
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,558
Let me switch your brain on.

592
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,061
What's wrong with me?

593
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,979
I'm so forgetful these days.

594
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,898
Yesterday, I burned a pot.

595
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,067
Well, at our age,

596
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,194
that's nothing to be surprised about.

597
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,029
So did you manage to have some gimbap?

598
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,240
I sure did.

599
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,034
I did, but does it
have to be so difficult?

600
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,288
-Let's go.
-Okay.

601
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,167
With all these machines everywhere,

602
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,212
old people like us feel so left out.

603
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,089
Just lie around all day.

604
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,093
It's not funny.

605
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,803
I mean it.

606
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,100
Hey, I have osteoporosis.
Don't do that. It'll break.

607
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,978
You're not the only one
with osteoporosis. I have it too.

608
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,813
Let's see whose bone breaks first.

609
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,898
-You'll actually break my bone.
-Come here.

610
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,984
Stop it. Help!

611
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,153
Anybody there?

612
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,280
-Hey, get back here.
-No!

613

00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,498
Have you tried this?

617
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,750
-No.
-Try it.

618
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,970
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

619

-Are you in the same year?
-Yes.

620
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,017
Same year, same team.
We're interning in Pediatrics.

621
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,019
That I know. That's why she's here.

622
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,354
Right.

623
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,441
-Hello.
-Hello.

624
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,527
-Hello.
-Be punctual, will you?

625
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,030
I do everything alone, so I'm always busy.

626
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,907
Hello, I'm sorry I'm late.

627
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,075
You're alone as usual, Professor Ahn.

628
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,952
It's okay. I'm used to it.

629
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,538
Hey, pass me the cookie.
I haven't eaten anything today.

630
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,957
-Should I order some gimbap?
-No, it's okay.

631
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,753
It sure is nice
to work with a close friend.

632
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,421
I feel so left out now.

633
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,221
Here.

634
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,897
The mother is suffering
from severe preeclampsia at the moment.

635
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,068
So for the mother's sake,
it'd be better to get the baby out sooner.

636
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,820
Her kidney function
has already declined significantly.

637
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,282
If we let this drag out,
it'll only drop further.

638
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:31,123
But surgery-wise, I want to wait
until the baby is at least 2kg.

639
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:36,379
Otherwise, the surgery won't be safe.
And we can't use a thoracoscope.

640
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,633
We'll wait as long as we can,
but I can't guarantee it.

641
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,343
The mother will be at risk.

642
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,138
We'll have to wait at least two
to three weeks for the baby to reach 2kg.

643
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,225
It'll be too much for the mother.

644
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,145
Because of her preeclampsia,

645
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,314
her kidney function keeps dropping.

646
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,609
Her platelet levels started dropping too.

647
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,071
We'll run a follow-up blood test tomorrow.

648
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,781
She may need surgery immediately.

649
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,993
Right. If you need to get the baby out,
you should.

650
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,453
That is up to OB-GYN,
and I'll follow your decision.

651
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,706
But what I'm saying is,

652
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,875
we should wait as long as we can,
if it's possible.

653
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,086
That would be better for the baby.

654
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,214
The lungs aren't fully developed yet,

655
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,758
so the baby may need
a ventilator in the NICU.

656
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,761
Yes, of course.
I told you that we will wait for now.

657
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,390
However, we'll have to go into surgery
if the mother is at risk.

658
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,517
I know that.

659
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,978
I'm just asking you
if you can try to delay it

660
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,148
for the baby's sake.
Only if it's safe, of course.

661
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,109
Let's go. They're saying
the same thing over and over.

662
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,319
I'll buy you a coffee.

663
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,612
Let's go. We have to organize the charts.

664
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,074
-See you later, Professor.
-See you.

665
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,247
The mother's kidneys aren't looking good.

666
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,458
It's worse than yesterday.

667
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,001
It won't be easy to delay it.

668
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,298
Does it mean
she may need surgery tomorrow?

669
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,632
I can't guarantee anything.

670
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,095
We may go into surgery tomorrow
if her condition gets worse.

671
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,100
All right. Just call me right away
if that happens.

672
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,268
Okay.

673
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,147
The mother is
fully aware of the situation,

674
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,234
so she wants to wait as long as she can…

675
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,029
She's doing her best to hold out.

676
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,450
She stays in bed all day and rarely moves.

677
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,913
Oh, dear. It must not be easy.

678
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,540
I'll work around your schedule.

679
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,087
It'd be good to book it on a day
when I have other surgeries,

680
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,089
but we have no control over it.

681
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,549
All right.

682
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,968
-Let's go for coffee.
-Shall we?

683
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,888
Let's go.

684
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,354
We gave Chang-min an IV
and also increased the dose,

685
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,897
but his BP keeps dropping.

686
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,900
We really don't have much time left now.

687
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,528
His mother is outside, right?

688
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,072
-I'll let her know.
-Okay.

689
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,576
Shall we talk to her together?

690
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,664
You've been losing sleep to look after
Chang-min for over three months.

691
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,000
And his mother feels
more comfortable talking to you.

692
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,379
Just come with me. I'll do the talking.

693
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,923
It'll comfort her.

694
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,677
No, it's okay.

695
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,558
I should get going, Professor.
I have to get ready for surgery.

696
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,893
Okay.

697
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:51,866
PEDIATRICS INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

698
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,256
What's this?

699
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,925
I don't want you to catch a cold.

700
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,427
Because you're my precious.

701
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,222
Jeez, seriously…

702
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,267
Do you want some bread?

703
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,144
No, I had dinner at the cafeteria.

704
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,979
Really? Good for you.

705
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,441
Is Chang-min's mother okay?

706
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,026
No, of course not.

707
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,278
How could she be okay?

708
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,656
I told her just now.

709
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,993
That Chang-min may not
make it through the week.

710
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,205
Gosh. Chang-min must be devastated too.

711
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,625
Chang-min, the resident?

712
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,294
Yes, he adores Chang-min

713
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,046
because they have the same name.

714
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,257
He feels as though
Chang-min is his little brother.

715
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,051
He checks in on him even on weekends.

716
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,095
Yes, I know. But he seemed okay.

717
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,389
He seemed calm about it.

718
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,516
Really?

719
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,352
My gosh.

720
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,898
I'm impressed.

721
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,400
When I was a junior resident,

722
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,612
I bawled my eyes out
whenever we lost such a young patient.

723
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,494
I suppose the youngsters
these days are different.

724
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,538
I guess so.

725
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,918
Do you want a beer?

726
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,379
I'm on duty tonight.

727
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,299
Are you on night duty every day?

728
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,011
Why are you yelling at me?

729
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,015
Seriously, nothing's going my way.

730
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,019
Then how about tomorrow?

731
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,272
I'm supposed to have dinner with my wife…

732
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,526
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,079
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

734
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,082
I wish I didn't have to write my thesis.

735
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,418
I'm not an academic by nature.

736
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,546
I was also stressed out
because of my thesis during my fellowship.

737
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,842
-Hello.
-Professor, this is Geon.

738
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,136
Patient Kim So-yeong went into surgery.

739
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,345
Okay.

740
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,974
Are they operating on Kim So-yeong?
The possible EA case.

741
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,310
Yes, they've just started. Let's go.

742
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,394
Okay.

743
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,442
You can remove it now.

744
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,372
The baby's coming out.

745
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,897
The baby is out. Current time, 14:40.

746
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,482
Excuse me.

747
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,677
Have a seat, Mother. It might be a while.

748
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,303
No, it's okay.

749
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,015
The doctor is here.

750
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,770
Hello. Why are you here?

751
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,980
I was going to come to the room
to talk to you.

752
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,900
My wife woke up,
but she's having a hard time.

753
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,027
So my mother-in-law and I thought

754
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,530
it'd be better if we told her
what's going on.

755
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,656
We're sorry.

756
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,949
No, it's okay.

757
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,618
This way, please.

758
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,663
We inserted a tube
through the baby's mouth

759
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,957
and took an X-ray.

760
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,418
As we were suspecting,

761
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,087
it is EA, which means
the esophagus is disconnected.

762
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,007
Pediatrics will run some tests

763
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,261
to check for other congenital disorders
just in case.

764
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:26,598
Our pediatrician
will go over the details with you.

765
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,852
My gosh.

766
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,313
We plan to perform
the esophageal atresia surgery tomorrow.

767
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,065
Okay.

768
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,735
The baby weighs 1.4kg,
which is quite small.

769
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,114
As I explained to you last time,

770
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:46,201
we can't perform a thoracoscopy
because the baby is too small.

771
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,912
We'll have to opt
for an open-chest surgery.

772
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,208
The surgery will be performed in the NICU.

773
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,589
Being moved to an OR
will be too much for the baby,

774
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,008
so we're just going to do it in the NICU.

775
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,509
Doctor.

776
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,512
Please save my grandchild.

777
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,099
It's their first baby.

778
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,978
They were the first ones to get married
in both families,

779
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,438
and it's my first grandchild.

780
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,736
My daughter thinks
it's her fault that the baby isn't well.

781
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,113
She cried for days

782
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,658
and couldn't even sleep.

783
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,455
Please help my daughter.

784
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,750
Save my grandchild, please.

785
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,628
Please, Doctor.

786
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,633
Yes, I'll do my very best.

787
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,677
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

788
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,067
How many peripheral IV lines?

789
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,611
Two. One in the arm
and the other one in the leg.

790
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,613
What about the central line?

791
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,740
-In the PCVC for the left arm.
-Sure.

792
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,367
Do we have the 6-0 thread?

793
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,202
-No, I'll go get some.
-Okay.

794
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,704
-What about the size 7 gloves?
-We have 2.

795
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,498
-Can you get me one more?
-Sure.

796
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,969
Professor, the patient's family is here.

797
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,137
Okay. Would you like to come with me?

798
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,222
Sure.

799
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:35,310
Well, the baby's esophagus
is disconnected at the moment.

800
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,981
And between the esophagus
and bronchial tubes,

801
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,941
there's a little by-passage.

802
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:45,279
It'll be sealed and removed
during the surgery today.

803
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,906
And we'll open up
both ends of the esophagus,

804
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,534
so it can be connected.

805
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,871
To be frank, the baby is
in unstable condition at the moment.

806
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,999
But we have a lot of experience with this,

807
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,835
so we'll do our best
to get it done swiftly and smoothly.

808
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:04,339
It'll take about two to three hours.

809
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,843
Please take good care of my grandchild.

810
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:09,970
Talk soon.

811
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,018
This has never happened before
in our family.

812
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,855
This is why I told her to get
a full checkup before you two got married.

813
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,450
Is that lady outside
the patient's mother-in-law?

814
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,162
Yes.

815
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,708
-Shall we begin?
-Yes.

816
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,937
-Anesthesiologist, we'll begin now.
-Okay.

817
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,564
Scalpel.

818
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,328
Forceps.

819
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,587
The baby is tiny.

820
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,923
I've seen smaller babies.

821
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,467
That tiny baby

822
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,762
is undergoing open-chest surgery.

823
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,306
It's impressive,
but I feel so bad for the baby.

824
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,726
The baby will live, right?

825
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,645
Yes, of course.

826
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,314
Even babies that are smaller

827
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,692
can grow up healthy just like other kids

828
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,944
after a successful surgery
and proper treatment.

829
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:55,367
My gosh, the Pediatrics fellow
really wants to help.

830
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,160
The space is too tight.

831
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,996
Yes, this is why
neonatal surgery is so hard.

832
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,590
I appreciate you trying to help,

833
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,511
but I know you can't really see,
so it's okay.

834
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,514
Oh, okay.

835
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,560
Neonatal surgery is difficult
because the surgical sites are tiny.

836
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,354
No matter how many assistants there are,

837
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,066
any neonatal surgery is practically
performed solo by the lead surgeon.

838
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,651
I see.

839
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,909
Metzenbaum scissors.

840
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,893
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

841
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,232
Hello.

842
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,530
Ms. Kim, how are you feeling?

843
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,825
Professor Ahn, my baby's surgery

844
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,328
went well, right?

845
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,163
Did everything go smoothly?

846
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,915
Yes.

847
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,584
Your husband probably told you already,

848
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,294
but the surgery went well.

849
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,131
Thank you, Professor Ahn.

850
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,428
The surgery itself was a bit difficult,

851
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,264
but your baby stayed strong and held out.

852
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,434
We didn't run into any problems
during the surgery,

853
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,605
and everything went well
according to our plan.

854
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,484
However, the baby was born prematurely,

855
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:57,239
so we have to keep the baby
in our NICU for quite a while.

856
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,409
The doctors and nurses in the NICU
will take good care of the baby.

857
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,079
Yes, thank you.

858
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,081
I'll be a good mother.

859
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,415
Of course.

860
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,837
You must be Ms. Kim's mother.

861
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,589
-No, I'm--
-This is

862
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,175
not your daughter's fault.

863
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,764
No one is at fault here.

864
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,267
It just happened.

865
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,232
If we must look for genetic factors,

866
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,609
I'd say both parents
are equally responsible.

867
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,778
We have no way of knowing
who contributed more.

868
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,739
Two to three percent of babies

869
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,118
are born with some type of birth defect.

870
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,161
Your grandchild happened to be born

871
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,290
with esophageal atresia,
which is one of the congenital disorders.

872
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,376
You probably don't know this,

873
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,629
but this is not
an uncommon condition to us.

874
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,134
The surgery went well,
so the baby will be fine.

875
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,053
I see.

876
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,931
Your daughter is such a strong woman.

877
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,727
She held out so her baby could stay
in the womb for a few more days.

878
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,022
Give her a pat on the back

879
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,985
and please help her out
so she can take good care of herself.

880
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,696
-I will.
-Great.

881
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,577
You must look after yourself

882
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,872
so you can take good care of your baby
once your baby recovers.

883
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,083
Tell your husband
to take care of everything for you.

884
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,045
Just focus on your recovery
for the time being, okay?

885
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,964
I will. Thank you.

886
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,927
Good night.

887
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,848
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

888
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,859
-Hey.
-Even with epinephrine every five minutes,

889
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,611
Chang-min's heart rate is dropping.

890
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,364
He won't last.

891
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,032
This will be difficult.

892
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,660
I'm coming now.

893
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,041
That was about Chang-min, right?
The kid with TOF.

894
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:17,253
Yes. The surgery was difficult
because of the severe adhesion.

895
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,840
He managed to survive the surgery
but ended up with sepsis.

896
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,550
My gosh.

897
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,638
One of our second-year residents
has the same name,

898
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,224
which is why everyone's gotten
more attached to him.

899
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:32,644
And he was the first kid
Chang-min ever opened up to.

900
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,105
We have a great relationship
with his mother too.

901
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,564
It's simple, you know.

902
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,441
"The doctor is so attentive to my kid."

903
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,360
"The kid's mother reminds me of my mom."

904
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,695
Then you have mutual trust.

905
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,614
Don't you have to go?

906
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,077
I do.

907
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,163
I'll go in a second.

908
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,166
I don't want to go.

909
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,545
I'm off.

910
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,256
I should go tell his mother.

911
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,718
See you.

912
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,684
Chang-min's heart is
barely beating at the moment.

913
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,270
It's practically stopped.

914
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,567
Chang-min doesn't have much time left.

915
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:25,488
He must have been so lonely in the PICU.

916
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,992
Please be by his side

917
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,120
in his final moments
so he won't be lonely.

918
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,308
I explained the situation
to Chang-min's parents.

919
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,769
I'd like you to make
the death pronouncement.

920
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,104
Okay, sure.

921
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:06,196
NAME: KIM CHANG-MIN

922
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,881
Dr. Im.

923
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,509
Dr. Im.

924
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,055
Kim Chang-min

925
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,808
has…

926
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,243
Chang-min, my baby.

927
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,497
My sweet angel.

928
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,874
I…

929
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,003
I love you very much.

930
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,601
Current time…

931
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:29,821
Current time…

932
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,888
Record it as 16:53.

933
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,764
Okay.

934
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,727
I'm sorry.

935
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:30,798
Yes, I have a little.

936
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:34,844
I see. Then why don't you take care
of the full liver mobilization today?

937
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,348
Okay, I'll do my best.

938
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,391
I'll come down when I have a moment.

939
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,809
Okay.

940
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,123
Come in.

941
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,423
I apologize.

942
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,388
You put me in charge of the pronouncement,

943
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,224
but I got too emotional

944
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,810
and couldn't say what I needed to say.

945
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,816
I'm sorry, Professor.
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.

946
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,568
Why are you sorry?

947
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,403
It happens.

948
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,238
Doctors are human too.

949
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,952
It's okay. You can cry.

950
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,622
Okay.

951
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,083
It's natural to want to cry
in situations like that.

952
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,336
It's okay to cry in front of
your patients or their guardians.

953
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,965
I don't want to tell you
to hide or hold back such emotions.

954
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,260
-Right.
-However,

955
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,096
you still need to do your job.

956
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,725
You need to do your job
no matter how sad you are.

957
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:07,145
And as a doctor,
it is your job to make that call.

958
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,564
Right.

959
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,068
You may leave. Good job today.

960
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,362
Thank you.

961
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,545
Pull it carefully so I can see it.

962
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,713
Okay.

963
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,840
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

964
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,678
I can't see because of the blood,
so drain it using suction.

965
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,971
Okay.

966
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,977
Can you call Professor Lee Ik-jun?

967
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,437
Sure.

968
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,983
What's the matter?

969
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,695
Professor, I'm struggling
because of a bleed.

970
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,906
It's harder than I thought.

971
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,158
Did you remove the adrenal gland?

972
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,160
No, I'm not there yet.

973
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,542
What about the seeding?

974
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,503
I'm sorry. I haven't checked it yet.

975
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,089
That's the first thing
you need to do for cancer.

976
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,341
My apologies.

977
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,390
Can I have a Richardson?

978
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,191
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

979
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:55,461
Do you want some coffee?

980
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,065
Here.

981
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,610
I put in two spoons of my love.

982
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,654
With Jeong-won's permission, of course.

983
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,698
Thank you.

984
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,788
Are you upset because of that surgery?

985
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,374
Yes.

986
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,669
I don't seem to have improved at all.

987
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,591
I'm a fellow, yet I still make mistakes.

988
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,348
I don't think I can ever
perform a liver transplant.

989
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,476
I don't have the talent for it.

990
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,686
You were a resident until last month.

991
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,688
You became a fellow
less than two weeks ago.

992
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,735
March is a difficult month.

993
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,236
You're just starting out.

994
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,571
It's a difficult procedure,

995
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,865
so just watch and learn. It's okay.

996
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,202
You started your fellowship

997
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,996
to be trained in more surgeries
and build experience.

998
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,207
You'll improve
as you garner more experience.

999
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,293
EMGS. Don't you know?

1000
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,421
No.

1001
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,673
Of course you don't. I coined it just now.

1002
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,470
Experience makes a great surgeon.

1003
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,847
You need to build experience,
no matter what.

1004
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:34,811
I assisted in 500 liver transplants
before I performed one.

1005
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,646
I watched my professors

1006
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,232
perform the procedure countless times

1007
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,151
before I performed one
as the lead surgeon,

1008
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,945
so be patient.

1009
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,074
You're eager to learn,

1010
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,035
and you have more experience
with surgeries

1011
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,371
than your peers or other fellows do,
so it's okay.

1012
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,500
You're doing fine and you'll do better.

1013
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,586
You just need more time. That's all.

1014
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,845
Does this not cheer you up at all?

1015
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:09,929
No.

1016
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:16,102
You have the talent. I see it.

1017
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,272
Professor.

1018
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,733
Tell me about a mistake you made.

1019
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,737
That will make me feel better.

1020
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,324
A mistake?

1021
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,204
I've never made a single mistake.

1022
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,249
Just kidding.

1023
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:42,169
I've made plenty,
and so have Jun-wan and Seok-hyeong.

1024
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,173
But it'd be more comforting
to hear about the mistakes

1025
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,926
those purehearted souls
like Song-hwa and Jeong-won made.

1026
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,558
I bet Jeong-won has never told you
about the mistakes he made in the past.

1027
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,731
No, he's advised me on my thesis
and surgical procedures.

1028
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,316
But his mistakes, no.

1029
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,534
You know that he's a perfectionist, right?

1030
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,785
You must know.

1031
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,331
He's not a perfectionist.
He's just perfect.

1032
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,916
Hey.

1033
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,919
Yes, he's a total perfectionist.

1034
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:26,756
He's a perfectionist,
and he knows everything.

1035
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:28,633
Right.

1036
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,510
From stock investments
to camping and skiing.

1037
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,847
My gosh, he's such a smarty-pants.

1038
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,935
One day, back when Jeong-won
and I were interning in Surgery…

1039
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,854
You know what a seolapja is.

1040
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,858
It's over there. A tongue depressor.

1041
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,863
It happens to be right there.
What a coincidence.

1042
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,116
Anyway, we interned
in Surgery together in our first month.

1043
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,453
One day, one of the patients
suddenly had a seizure.

1044
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,997
The two of us made rounds
before anyone else did,

1045
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,415
hoping to win some points.

1046
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,000
But that suddenly happened.

1047
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:07,129
Our professor came running,
and the nurse literally flew over.

1048
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:10,675
It was crazy. That moment, the professor
told him to bring a seolapja.

1049
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,843
"Get me a seolapja. Now!"

1050
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,305
Don't tell me…

1051
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,808
Get me a seolapja. Now!

1052
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,352
Sorry? Okay!

1053
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,447
What the heck?

1054
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,041
What?

1055
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,226
Did that actually happen?

1056
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,439
-I had no idea.
-Jeong-won, that's hilarious.

1057
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,736
-This is spicy. It's good though.
-Right? Try this too.

1058
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,950
-Shouldn't we order more?
-This won't be enough, right?

1059
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,245
What are you talking about?

1060
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,414
We ordered four chickens.

1061
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:25,041
Do we want one chicken per person?

1062
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,043
Yes, that's a given.

1063
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,837
You're rich. Don't be such a cheapskate.

1064
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,006
Rich people are so stingy.

1065
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,010
Jeong-won,
are you seriously sulking right now?

1066
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,888
Ik-jun only brought it up
to cheer up Dr. Jang.

1067
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,639
It's all in the past.

1068
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,391
It wasn't me.

1069
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,810
Okay, we believe you.

1070
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:50,357
The seolapja incident. It was Ik-jun.

1071
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,195
-What?
-What?

1072
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:55,404
You prick.

1073
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,324
Hey, open wide.

1074
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:00,868
Here, come on.

1075
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,370
I put in two spoons of my love.

1076
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,540
-Come on.
-Jerk. I can't stand you!

1077
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,919
You jerk!

1078
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,796
Hey, wait. Hold on!

1079
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,468
What the heck?

1080
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:32,650
Hold on. Then were you asking
for this ruler by any chance?

1081
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:33,692
What?

1082
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:42,868
If I told her it was me,

1083
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,539
then it's no fun, you know?

1084
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,293
It's no fun to hear about the mistakes

1085
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,379
that Jun-wan, Seok-hyeong, or I made.

1086
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,631
It's called dramatization.

1087
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,466
I figured it would cheer her up more

1088
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,970
if she heard that it was Song-hwa
or Jeong-won who did something like that.

1089
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,555
Why you little…

1090
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,315
-Did you tell her about my mistake too?
-Yes.

1091
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,318
Song-hwa made a mistake?

1092
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,195
She made many blunders.

1093
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,697
-The pillow incident?
-Yes.

1094
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,073
What's that?

1095
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,451
During the training on patient positions,

1096
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,246
the professor said, "The pillow first!"

1097
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,956
But she misheard it as "the wall."

1098
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,541
So she stood against the wall.

1099
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,921
My goodness.
Song-hwa was such a model student.

1100
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,007
She could have misheard him,

1101
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,885
but how could she when we have to
worry about contamination?

1102
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,430
Her back was glued to the wall like this.

1103
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,558
That was when I was an intern.

1104
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,643
All right. Fine.

1105
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,230
Who's he talking to?

1106
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,399
Dr. Jang, probably.

1107
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,611
I'm telling you. It wasn't me.

1108
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,779
It was Ik-jun.

1109
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,949
Ik-jun did that.

1110
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,993
No!

1111
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,288
You'll believe me? Don't say that.

1112
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,791
I'm telling you. Ik-jun did that, not me.

1113
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,628
Why wouldn't I know what a seolapja is?

1114
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,173
I can't think of anything you did.

1115
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:22,134
Me? Of course, you can't.

1116
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,553
I'm perfect.

1117
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,055
Can I tell them?

1118
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,187
When Seok-hyeong
was a first-year resident…

1119
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:37,107
I have a similar experience,
so I totally get it.

1120
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:40,069
His patient's condition
suddenly got worse,

1121
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,655
so he had to pronounce death
for the first time.

1122
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,698
But he couldn't, so he tried four times.

1123
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,536
The nurse who was with him
ended up calling his professor,

1124
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,539
and the professor took care of it.
Remember? You told me this.

1125
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,292
I remember, of course.

1126
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:59,046
Her name, age, and what she looked like.

1127
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,715
I still remember everything vividly.

1128
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,095
She was an expectant mother
and my first patient.

1129
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:11,475
I said to her
that everything would be okay.

1130
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:14,270
I told her not to worry.

1131
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,524
But she suddenly died…

1132
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,361
from an amniotic fluid embolism.

1133
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:29,576
Her husband flopped down
onto the floor and started bawling.

1134
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,623
But we were taught
to hold it in, you know.

1135
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,584
Our seniors and professors always told us

1136
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:41,588
to never show
our emotions in front of the patients.

1137
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,132
But I just couldn't.

1138
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,010
I couldn't hold it in.

1139
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,057
So I bawled with them.

1140
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,144
I couldn't hold back the tears.

1141
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,859
Then I got scolded
by my professor, big-time.

1142
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,029
He said I embarrassed
all my fellow doctors.

1143
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,408
Hey, coldhearted jerk.

1144
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,369
I bet you have no memories like that.

1145
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,999
That's right.
Unlike you, I am very rational.

1146
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,542
Bullshit.

1147
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:23,547
Why do you remember
all these things? What for?

1148
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,466
To call you out on your lies.

1149
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,384
"I saw it. I witnessed it."

1150
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,595
When Jun-wan was in his first year,

1151
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,638
he pronounced death for the first time.

1152
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:36,101
He kept his composure
in front of the patient's family but…

1153
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,063
I bawled my eyes out in the restroom.

1154
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,944
That was the day
I cried the most in my life.

1155
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,281
The patient who passed away
was the same age as my father.

1156
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,326
And his son was around my age.

1157
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,829
The son told him he loved him

1158
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:59,375
and that he wanted to be born
as his son again in his next life.

1159
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:04,546
That moment with the two of them
is still engraved in my heart.

1160
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,924
I'll never forget it.

1161
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,511
Gosh, I'm getting teary-eyed again.

1162
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,597
But you regretted it.

1163
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,849
What did he regret? Crying?

1164
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,726
It's okay to cry.

1165
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,896
No. Crying secretly
hiding in the restroom.

1166
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,482
I regretted it so much.

1167
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:28,487
I could have cried in front of his family.

1168
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,198
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

1169
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:33,325
But I wept
squatting on the restroom floor.

1170
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,495
Looking back now,
that embarrasses me more.

1171
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:42,501
I tell my students
that it's okay to show some emotion

1172
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,254
as long as they don't cross the line.

1173
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,465
We're not robots, you know.

1174
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,826
On a whim, without a plan

1175
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:19,913
You moved to Seoul

1176
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:25,419
That bewildered look on your face

1177
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:28,505
Reminds me of myself years ago

1178
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:32,593
You look like an athlete with a nice tan

1179
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:36,972
Whose single focus has been training hard

1180
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:42,227
It's scary but exciting

1181
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,731
Because it's your new beginning

1182
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,359
It's okay, you'll be fine

1183
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:53,947
You have a bright future ahead of you

1184
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:58,243
It's okay, you'll be fine

1185
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:02,456
We believe in you

1186
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:06,752
Your reason to live

1187
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:10,339
No matter what that may be

1188
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,303
Just live a life with no regrets

1189
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,515
And you're a superstar

1190
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:23,560
It's okay, you'll be fine

1191
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,981
You have a bright future ahead of you

1192
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:32,194
It's okay, you'll be fine

1193
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:36,365
We believe in you

1194
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:42,287
All the things that stressed you out

1195
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,375
And all the sweat and tears you have shed

1196
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:51,463
Let's have a drink
And forget all about them

1197
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:57,678
-It's okay, you'll be fine
-It's okay, you'll be fine

1198
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:01,932
-You have a bright future ahead of you
-You have a bright future ahead of you

1199
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:06,353
-It's okay, you'll be fine
-It's okay, you'll be fine

1200
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:09,940
-We believe in you
-We believe in you

1201
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,440
Hello.

1202
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,322
Thank you so much, Doctor.

1203
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,574
No, it's fine.

1204
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,799
RICHARDSON, OUT!
AND PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER!

1205
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,565
JANG HONG-DO

1206
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,908
I MADE WORSE MISTAKES WHEN I WAS AN INTERN
CHEER UP, FROM CHUCHU

1207
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,537
It's okay, you'll be fine

1208
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,833
We believe in you

1209
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:57,547
All the things that stressed you out

1210
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,760
And all the sweat and tears you have shed

1211
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:06,723
Let's have a drink
And forget all about them

1212
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:13,063
-It's okay, you'll be fine
-It's okay, you'll be fine

1213
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:17,234
-You have a bright future ahead of you
-You have a bright future ahead of you

1214
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:21,571
-It's okay, you'll be fine
-It's okay, you'll be fine

1215
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,534
-We believe in you
-We believe in you

1216
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:47,097
You're your superstar

1217
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,532
It's already been two weeks.

1218
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:08,034
Wake up already. Please?

1219
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,247
Your friends are having fun
at frosh parties and retreats.

1220
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,541
They're all so busy.

1221
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,795
It's March.

1222
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,007
Don't waste the whole month in bed.

1223
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,313
Can you try lifting your left hand?

1224
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,241
Professor!

1225
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,586
I'm sorry, my baby.

1226
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,589
Mommy is sorry.

1227
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,351
Hello.

1228
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,395
-Hello.
-Hello, Professor Ahn.

1229
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,689
We didn't expect to see you here today.

1230
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,692
I come here every day.

1231
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:25,737
You seem much better.

1232
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:27,614
Thank you.

1233
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,953
Your baby is doing much better too.

1234
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,665
Thank you so much, Professor Ahn.

1235
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,876
Professor Ahn, we named our baby.

1236
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:44,923
Right. I just realized
we don't have his name yet.

1237
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:45,841
What is it?

1238
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,347
NAME: SONG JEONG-WON

1239
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,518
We just named him after you

1240
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:59,563
because we want him

1241
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,023
to be a doctor when he grows up.

1242
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,067
That's all.

1243
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,947
I see. It's a nice name.

1244
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,658
See you later.

1245
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:19,809
Hello, Professor.

1246
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,228
How is it that you know
everyone at this hospital?

1247
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,106
It's because they like me so much.

1248
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,525
What do you mean?

1249
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,527
Isn't there a doctor here?

1250
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,279
How much longer do I have to wait?

1251
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:33,782
He had this scary look on his face…

1252
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,409
He's so harsh.

1253
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,119
He doesn't know what it's like for us.

1254
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,704
Are you sure the surgery didn't go wrong?

1255
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,749
How can I trust this hospital
if something like this keeps happening?

1256
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,418
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your call?

1257
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,462
How can you not see her at least once?

1258
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:48,755
Aren't you curious?

1259
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:52,258
I am. But I don't want to
since it will make her uncomfortable.

1260
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,971
When will my son
bring home a new girlfriend?

1261
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,181
I don't care who it is. Anyone will do.

1262
01:22:58,264 --> 01:22:59,265
Except for her.

1263
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:01,601
How did you know I'm on duty tonight?

1264
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,687
Are you going to hang out
with me this Sunday?

1265
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,522
No, I have prior engagements.

1266
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:07,691
You didn't forget about
next Sunday, right?

1267
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,858
That sounds good.

1268
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,360
I'm fine with anything.

1269
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:11,695
Is this what you'll be wearing?

1270
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,738
Clothes don't matter. Your heart does.

1271
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,073
What are you doing this weekend?

1272
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,742
I'm going camping tomorrow
and was wondering if you wanted to come.

1273
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:28,503
