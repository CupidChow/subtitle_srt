1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,254
I think I'll be late,
so I changed my bus ticket to 12 a.m.

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,673
I'll take a taxi, so don't worry about me.

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,634
And don't be so shocked
to see a beauty in the dining room

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,180
the next morning because that'll be me.

5
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,664
-Hey.
-Can you buy my bus ticket?

6
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,249
Sure.

7
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,836
-Didn't you want to take the train?
-Something came up.

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
-There will be a seat, right?
-Let me check.

9
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,940
Let's see.

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,151
Hold on.

11
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,779
The earliest one.

12
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,072
The earliest one?

13
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,782
Hold on.

14
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,536
Is there a seat left?
No, not for the earlier ones.

15
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,871
-Then it doesn't matter.
-Sure.

16
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,126
Hey, who did you drink with
that you missed the last train?

17
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,086
Gosh, those drunkards.

18
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,672
Both of my parents
and even my sister can drink a lot.

19
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,800
I see. You drank at home?

20
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,262
Your mom got to see
both of her children on her birthday.

21
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,305
She must have been so happy.

22
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,390
Yes.

23
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,892
I booked it. I'll text you the details.

24
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,727
Thanks.

25
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,355
You're thanking me? You must be drunk.

26
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,539
STILL BEAUTIFUL LADY, MS. JEONG

27
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,173
"STILL BEAUTIFUL" BY TOY

28
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:56,444
CHANGWON, SEOUL

29
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,307
How have you been?

30
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,144
Good. You?

31
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,231
Not too bad.

32
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,654
Are you staying in Changwon now?

33
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,241
Or Seoul?

34
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,995
I'm staying in Changwon.

35
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,754
Will you be in Seoul over the weekend?

36
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,633
If that's the case,

37
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,429
I want to see you on the weekend.

38
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,851
You can say no if you're uncomfortable.

39
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,729
I was hoping…

40
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,025
we could meet up and just talk.

41
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,132
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

42
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,138
There's no clear border between
the tumor and the normal brain tissues,

43
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,265
so it's tricky.

44
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,239
The micro scissors don't work well.

45
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,325
Can we get a new one?

46
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,326
Sure, no problem.

47
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,405
How much cardioplegic solution?

48
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,533
The patient has received the full dose.

49
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,743
Okay.

50
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,834
It keeps getting in the way.
Hold it upright.

51
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,127
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,509
The patient's BP is a little low.

53
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,593
Okay.

54
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,389
Professor Lee, the BP is dropping.

55
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,309
There's pressure pushing against the IVC.

56
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,481
When you're pulling the liver,
pull it up. Don't press it down.

57
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,566
Got it.

58
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,319
This branch is open, hence the bleed.

59
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,821
Mixter forceps.

60
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,996
The 2-0 thread, please.

61
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,473
We got the major bleeding under control.
The BP will be okay now.

62
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,640
All right.

63
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,725
Two of this, please.

64
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,894
Mosquito forceps.

65
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,313
One more, please.

66
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,735
Peanut sponge.

67
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,451
Always double-check like this
before you perform a ligation.

68
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,954
And raise it as much as you can.

69
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,372
Got it, Professor.

70
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,169
I struggle the most
with identifying the hernia sac.

71
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,048
What you dissected earlier
was the vas deferens, right?

72
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:31,844
That's right.
It'll be easy once you get used to it.

73
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,722
The intern should see this too, up close.

74
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,098
Hong-do.

75
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,895
Hong-do.

76
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,564
I'm sorry, Professor.

77
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,155
It's okay. When you're an intern,
you're always tired.

78
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,491
Mosquito forceps.

79
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,493
One more, please.

80
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,620
Suture.

81
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,331
I'll show you the baby.

82
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:04,126
The anterior and posterior fontanels
are open, and there's no cleft palate.

83
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,962
And the ears look good too.

84
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,838
So does the anus.

85
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,926
Now, the toes. Five on both sides.

86
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,220
And one, two, three… Five fingers.

87
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,180
The fingers and toes separate correctly.

88
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,892
They'll thoroughly examine the baby again
in the newborn nursery.

89
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,522
All right. You can relax now.

90
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,149
You're going to
push out your placenta now.

91
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,986
It'll be uncomfortable,
but this is really it.

92
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,862
Okay.

93
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,407
It's not good to deliver so quickly.

94
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,869
Pardon?

95
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,163
Others might think
it was an easy delivery.

96
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,374
No, not at all.

97
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,959
No one will think that.

98
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,756
I know it was hard for you
to follow such a strict diet.

99
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,259
At your next appointment,

100
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:57,346
we'll do another glucose test
just to be sure.

101
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,973
Okay.

102
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,977
No pressure. Just focus on your serve.

103
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,812
Just do a good serve.

104
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,190
I heard everyone in Orthopedics
is really good.

105
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,901
We made it to the quarterfinals too.

106
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,528
We have a strong team as well.

107
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,614
-Hello.
-Hello.

108
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,823
-Hello.
-Hi.

109
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,660
Check on Heo Bo-gyeong
and make sure she can self-void.

110
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,870
Yes, Professor.

111
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,122
By the way,
the quarterfinal match is today.

112
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,457
What match?

113
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,835
Oh, that.

114
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,797
If she has trouble urinating,
call her doctor.

115
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,174
-Okay.
-Will do.

116
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,972
You can do this.

117
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,813
I call this a miracle.

118
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,233
He couldn't even make
eye contact with us at the beginning.

119
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,361
I can't believe he just said that.

120
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,990
Professor Yang must know
that I'm a new fellow in OB-GYN, right?

121
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,118
Come on. You did rounds
with him in the morning.

122
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,122
But every time, he treats me
as if he's never seen me before.

123
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,333
In our case, it took half a year.

124
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,751
Sorry?

125
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,420
It took us half a year
to eat with him in the cafeteria.

126
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,384
It's my partner, Ms. Song Su-bin.

127
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:18,928
Yes, Ms. Song.

128
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,680
Come down. Let's win the game
and get back to work quickly.

129
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,891
Okay, I'm coming now.

130
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,271
I'll be back.

131
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,857
-Good luck.
-You can do this!

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,237
Don't drop out! I can come.

133
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,697
Okay, take your time.
The other match isn't over yet.

134
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,574
Hey, Orthopedics is very good.

135
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,951
Let me wash my face quickly.

136
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,101
Is something up?

137
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,399
No, not anymore.

138
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm just gathering my thoughts.

139
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,947
It's nothing bad, is it?

140
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,577
All right, then.

141
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,789
Wait, why aren't you there?

142
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,084
-Where?
-The quarterfinals.

143
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,628
Oh, that.
How's my department going to do it

144
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,589
when there's only me?

145
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,883
But you have the fellows
and the residents.

146
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,968
Everyone's busy.

147
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,054
You can just go down
for your match and come back.

148
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,017
Some people have time,
but no one knows how to play it.

149
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,602
So you've asked them.

150
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,897
Gosh, Lee Ik-jun. I can beat him easily.

151
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,064
I'm so annoyed.

152
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,358
He'll make such a big deal out of it.

153
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,778
What's the first prize?

154
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,240
Two million won for team dinners.

155
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,452
That's huge.

156
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,538
It's going to be fierce.

157
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,504

Professor.

166
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,961
Professor Lee Ik-jun was
in a table tennis club in college.

167
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,921
I heard he's really good.

168
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,008
Sounds like he was in every club
back in college.

169
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,009
Even a magic club.

170
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,638
Come on. He made it to the quarterfinals.

171
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,598
He must be good.

172
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,018
Don't you know how they made it this far?

173
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,229
They're just like us.

174
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:25,406
THE 10TH YULJE TABLE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP

175
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,707
ROUND OF 32

176
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,126
HPB SURGERY, EMERGENCY MEDICINE

177
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,341
Hey, Ik-jun. You know my parents
ran a table tennis court, right?

178
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,803
I sure do. Gwang-hyeon,
you know you work in the ER, right?

179
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,514
-Yes.
-It's quite gutsy of you to do this

180
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,892
when new emergency patients
can come in anytime.

181
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,310
You're clueless, aren't you?

182
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,353
Everything's an emergency
in my department.

183
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,772
Besides, we have many fellows
and residents.

184
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,108
I can totally spare a few minutes
and do this.

185
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,903
All right. We will begin now.

186
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,698
Have you been doing push-ups?

187
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,450
-Gosh, you little… Let's go.
-Jeez.

188
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,493
You're going to kiss me at this rate.

189
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,037
Calm down. Easy, all right?

190
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,758
-Hey.
-Professor.

191
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,678
The DI patient we moved to the ward
is suddenly experiencing hematemesis

192
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,931
and cold sweats. The BP is dropping too.

193
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,391
Looks like we need the patient
back in the ICU.

194
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,476
I'm coming now.

195
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,661
ROUND OF 16

196
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,704
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, HPB SURGERY

197
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,841
Gosh, I can't tell
whether Jae-hak is good or not.

198
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,011
His posture sucks,
but I feel like he's faking it.

199
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,764
Is Professor Kim Jun-wan good?

200
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,516
He's not bad.

201
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,059
We used to play every weekend.

202
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,686
But he looks like he hates it.

203
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,604
He always looks grumpy.

204
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,399
Hey, Dr. Do. I guess
you used to be pretty good at this.

205
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,403
Professor.

206
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,240
I got into college on the fourth try
and failed the bar six times

207
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,703
because I spent so much time and money
at this table tennis court in Noryangjin.

208
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,038
Don't say too much, Jae-hak.

209
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,291
Let's go.

210
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,595
THE 10TH YULJE TABLE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP

211
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,879
Code Blue in Cardiothoracic Surgery.

212
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,922
Sixth floor of the main building,
Room 6205.

213
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,177
Code Blue in Cardiothoracic Surgery.

214
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,013
Sixth floor of the main building,
Room 6205.

215
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,108
Professor Lee.

216
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,611
You're busy with surgeries and patients.

217
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,446
What are you doing here?

218
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,615
I'll help you get back to work quickly.

219
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,743
What about you, sir?

220
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,828
I didn't know you played table tennis.

221
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,915
Come on. I've been doing marathons

222
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,501
and have been playing soccer
and badminton for 20 years.

223
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,002
But a beginner in table tennis.

224
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,630
All right.

225
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,673
Let's have a good game.

226
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,676
Okay.

227
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,598
We'll begin in a minute.

228
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,019
You know Professor Shin's nickname, right?

229
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,773
Human Endoscope.
Your partner in liver transplants

230
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,150
and the best abdominal imaging expert
at Yulje.

231
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,193
"Bluffer."

232
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,445
What?

233
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,115
He's called that
because he hardly tells the truth.

234
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,536
He bluffs like there's no tomorrow.

235
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,372
I think the fellow is pretty good,

236
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,415
but Professor Shin is a total beginner.

237
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,128
-He's our target.
-All right.

238
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,059
We'll now begin.

239
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,529
-Nice.
-Move. I got this!

240
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,781
I got this!

241
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,117
I got this, here.

242
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,704
Okay, bring it on. Yes!

243
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,417
Did you see that? That was me!

244
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,006
All right. Let's keep going.

245
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,924
Come on.

246
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,385
Let's go.

247
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,056
Radiology is disqualified.

248
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,142
HPB Surgery is the winner!

249
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,561
What…

250
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,650
Why?

251
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,240
SEMIFINALS

252
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,285
HEMATO-ONCOLOGY, NUCLEAR MEDICINE

253

ORTHOPEDICS, HPB SURGERY

254
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,969
-Oh, right.
-What's up?

255
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,347
Ms. Song Su-bin called just now and said

256
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,432
you hurt her feelings
in the quarterfinals.

257
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,725
What? Why?

258
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,852
We all know that your husband is in OS,

259
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,021
but she's upset that you rooted for OS

260
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,149
instead of the Nursing Department.
She was so hurt.

261
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,736
What? I cheered for the Nursing Department
in the quarterfinals.

262
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,614
Spreading false info!

263
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,742
Warning!

264
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,285
Okay, all right.

265
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,996
Honey.

266
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,373
-Good job.
-Nice one, right?

267
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:05,597
THE 10TH YULJE TABLE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP

268
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,112
-Nice.
-That's it.

269
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,875
Goodness!

270
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,949
Coming straight from the OR?

271
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,327
Yes. I probably reek of sweat.

272
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,164
No. Why did you come straight here?
This match isn't even important.

273
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,833
I was curious. What's the score now?

274
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,876
-Gosh.
-Nice.

275
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,464
Let's score just one more point.
We got this.

276
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,216
All right.

277
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,968
Did they lose?

278
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,303
They're about to lose.

279
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,641
-Hey, Song-hwa.
-Hey.

280
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,731
Let's aim for a deuce, no matter what.

281
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,274
There's something I want to do.

282
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,118
-Yes!
-Darn it.

283
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,790
It's okay.

284
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,293
Go for it!

285
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:02,672
THE 10TH YULJE TABLE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP

286
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,848
-Gosh!
-Darn it.

287
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,391
Jeez.

288
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,771
Hey, come on!

289
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,946
All right!

290
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,367
-Nice!
-Nice!

291
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,591
-Gosh.
-Hey, don't do that!

292
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,927
Why would you waste your energy like that?

293
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,804
What's he doing? Is that Deux?

294
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,684
We just need one more point, okay?

295
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,311
Score just one more point, and we'll win.

296
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,689
Hey, what's wrong?

297
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,358
Give me a massage.

298
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,402
-What?
-The kitty massage!

299
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,822
I have a leg cramp. My gosh, it hurts!

300
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,617
I see. Can we take a quick break?
Just for a minute.

301
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,037
Gosh, my leg…

302
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,584
My goodness.

303
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,588
Professor, if we win the prize,

304
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,590
we should go for a beef barbecue.

305
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,008
Yes, sounds good.

306
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,467
Your wife's gone into labor.

307
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,428
My gosh.

308
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,513
-Honey.
-It hurts so much.

309
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,639
Take a deep breath.

310
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,557
Professor Yang.

311
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,684
Yes.

312
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm in so much pain!

313
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,568
Keep breathing as you've learned.

GAME RULES

317
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,794
Hey. Did you hear?

318
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,797
Nuclear Medicine has made it
this far without losing a point.

319
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,841
Their opponents
never got more than five points.

320
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,384
Thanks a lot, buddy,

321
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,678
for totally discouraging me.

322
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,059
Hey, stop chugging down the ice cubes.

323
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:22,145
Don't say you need to run
to the restroom after this.

324
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,106
If you do, you're so dead.

325
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,484
Okay, fine.

326
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,528
Do you want some hot tea?

327
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,530
-Yes.
-No, just hold onto it.

328

I'll have it after I win.

329
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,080
Goodness.

330
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,082
Before the tea gets cold,

331
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,044
I'll come back victorious.

332
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,428
Let's go.

333
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,141
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

334
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,478
Hey, I'm off.

335
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,397
Okay.

336
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,907
The game ends at two to zero.

337
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,576
Nuclear Medicine is the winner.

338
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,912
Congratulations, Team Nuclear Medicine.

339
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,088
Jeez, seriously.

340
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,425
Gosh, it's hot.

341
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,136
-Hey.
-What?

342
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,221
The fellow can probably
make the national team.

343
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,931
And that professor is…

344
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,059
She's like an Olympic gold medalist.

345
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,686
-That was a good game.
-Yes, that was great.

346
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,938
-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you.

347
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,609
But I'm curious about something.

348
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,571
Are you really a doctor?

349
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,740
You're unbelievably good.

350
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,284
I'm flattered. This is just my hobby.

351
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,452
Have a good day.

352
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,208
Professor, we don't even need
to take a shower.

353
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,047
-She looks so much like her.
-What?

354
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,256
She looks just like her.

355
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,634
-Gosh, I…
-What's wrong?

356
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,885
Another leg cramp.

357
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,055
-Do something.
-You're such a baby.

358
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,141
-Do something!
-Come here, baby.

359
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,768
-Be gentle.
-I got you.

360
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,229
-Give me a massage.
-Then lie down.

361
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,606
-Hold on.
-Lie down.

362
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,358
It hurts.

363
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,610
Do you need help?

364
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,528
No, it's okay.

365
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,243
Take it easy.

366
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,704
Bye.

367
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,586
Hello?

368
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,673
I want to see you even for just a moment.
Where are you?

369
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,051
I'm in the Medical Office now,
but I have to go home.

370
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,429
I'm supposed to have dinner with my mom.

371
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,182
I see. Okay, then I'll see you
at the hospital tomorrow.

372
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,435
All right. I'm sorry.

373
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,186
Why are you sorry?

374
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,273
I'm totally fine, so don't worry about me.
I'll see you tomorrow.

375
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,983
Okay.

376
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,210
Dr. Jang, do you want
to have dinner with me?

377
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,795
I need your advice on something.

378
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,925
I'm sorry, Min-ha. I have to go home.

379
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,179
Didn't you say you had
to work on your paper all night?

380
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,055
I'm going to come back later at night.

381
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,307
What?

382
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,393
I want to go home
to fix dinner for my mom.

383
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,855
I'll come back after she falls asleep.

384
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,566
That way, I'll be less worried.

385
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,651
Is she badly hurt?

386
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,069
Why don't you check her in?

387
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,405
What happened though?

388
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,240
What kind of injury?

389
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,828
I'll tell you everything later.

390
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,832
Right now, my head is all over the place.

391
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,001
I'm sorry, Min-ha.

392
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,589
Cheer up, Gyeo-ul.

393
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,549
Okay?

394
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,635
You're doing so well.

395
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,765
I'm not sure what's going on,

396
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,600
but everything will be okay.

397
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,813
I'm sure this is the last hurdle
you have to overcome.

398
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,776
If you need my help with anything

399
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,529
or need someone to talk to,
just let me know.

400
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,198
You know I'm here most of the time.

401
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,201
Just call me, and I'll be there.

402
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,787
-Okay.
-Good.

403
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,122
All right, then. Get going.

404
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,499
Your mother must be waiting.

405
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,668
Bye.

406
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,553
-It's just us two again?
-Yes.

407
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,679
What about Jeong-won?

408
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,639
He just left. He's probably got a date.

409
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,766
Where's Seok-hyeong?

410
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,351
He's got a date with his mom.

411
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,729
Isn't Song-hwa staying late
to work on the exam questions?

412
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,274
Done and done. She left too.

413
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,527
She has so much energy.

414
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,988
Hey, you should tell her
to cut down on work.

415
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,114
She listens to you.

416
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,450
Actually, is she working
a bit less these days?

417
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,832
Do you do this to your girlfriend?

418
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,710
What?

419
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,588
You're eating when I'm opening
and setting everything up!

420
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,886
Ahn Jeong-won.

421
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,263
I thought you left.

422
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,604
Get out. I said, get out.

423
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,522
Go enjoy your date!

424
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,649
Get out!

425
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,401
I'm Jang Gyeo-ul.

426
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,903
Why must he do all the work

427
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,155
when you're not even lifting a finger?

428
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,365
Why? Why are you doing this to him?

429
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,076
Hey! Get out, you prick.

430
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,953
-Get out!
-"Prick"? I'm Jang Gyeo-ul.

431
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,955
-Yes, get out.
-What kind of prick are you?

432
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,373
Get out!

433
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,626
Hey! You jerk!

434
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,761
Hey, Bong. I got it for you.

435
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,515
I couldn't just take off
because I felt bad for you, friend.

436
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,601
I got it before the café closed.

437
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,020
I'm used to working night shifts.

438
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,271
Thanks anyway.

439
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,274
Hold on. You're leaving now?

440
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,194
Gosh, this is early.

441
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,490
I have to say, today seems…

442
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,492
Just go home.

443
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,286
-I'll be off, then.
-Bye.

444
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,746
Bye.

445
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,002
Professor.

446
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,713
About Um Hye-yun,
the benzodiazepine DI patient.

447
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,173
Should we use flumazenil?

448
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,634
-Did you check her brain?
-No, not yet.

449
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,095
Then give her flumazenil
and see if she wakes up.

450
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,139
If she doesn't,
proceed with a brain imaging test.

451
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,474
Got it.

452
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,893
Yulje Emergency Center.

453
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,770
This is Jung Tae-yeong, a paramedic.

454
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,648
We have a male TA patient.
Age 39. Mental status, drowsy.

455
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,608
BP is 80 over 50.

456
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,112
Heart rate, 120.
Respiratory rate, over 30.

457
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,699
Current temperature, 37.6 degrees Celsius.
And has severe chest pain.

458
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,951
His BP keeps dropping.
He needs to be seen now.

459
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,369
Can we take him to Yulje?

460
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,038
When will you get here?

461
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,290
In about five minutes.

462
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,334
Send him right away. We'll get ready.

463
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,554
A TA patient is coming in.
His mental status and vitals are unstable.

464
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,514
He has chest pain. Let's do an ultrasound

465
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,182
and get ready for intubation too.

466
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,434
Got it.

467
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,408
His BP has dropped to 60.

468
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,827
Get two pints of Type-O blood
for an emergency transfusion.

469
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,953
Okay.

470
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,759
He has cardiac tamponade.

471
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,063
And a buildup of fluid
in the abdominal cavity.

472
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,898
Linear probe.

473
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,864
And a pneumothorax too. Gosh…

474
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,533
Let's take a portable chest X-ray.

475
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,994
Get ready for a chest tube
and a pericardiocentesis.

476
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,162
Okay.

477
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,123
-Call CS and Surgery. Now.
-Yes, sir.

478
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,425
I have nothing to do at home anyway.

479
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,260
Shall I stay?

480
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,347
I'm busy. I have to finish my thesis,

481
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,557
and Professor Min is on call tonight,

482
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,559
so I'll have to take care of most calls.

483
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,603
I can't hang out with you.

484
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,814
Then give me a kiss.

485
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,409
I'm sorry! Gosh…

486
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,745
What should I do?

487
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,498
Well, can you just be on your way?

488
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,916
Okay.

489
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,836
Hey, I thought you were going up.

490
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,380
Aren't you on your way to see Yun-bok?

491
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,632
Goodness.

492
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,846
You should get going too. Bye.

493
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,036
Why are you ignoring my text?

494
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,706
I don't even have time to sleep,

495
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,082
let alone check my phone.

496
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
When am I going to finish all this?

497
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,547
Just come and help me
with the ABG analysis.

498
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,757
Figure it out yourself.

499
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,051
I'm busy right now.

500
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,387
I'll get back at you for this.

501
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,813
Obviously, I'd help you
if I knew how to do it.

502
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,693
He's asking the wrong person for help.

503
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,405
That fool.

504
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,785
Hey, I don't know.

505
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,289
I don't know how to do it either!

506
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,250
Hello.

507
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,752
What don't you know?

508
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,712
It's nothing.

509
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,634
Don't mind me. I just came
to make myself a cup of coffee.

510
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,593
Okay.

511
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,142
You have a lot of homework, right?

512
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,645
Yes.

513
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,565
The professors often forget
about the homework they assigned,

514
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,525
so just do your best.

515
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,777
If you can't finish them…

516
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,699
just apologize and let them yell at you.

517
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,452
You're an intern,
so they won't be so harsh on you.

518
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,330
Okay, thank you.

519
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,249
You're just an intern,

520
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,752
so they won't kill you.

521
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,836
Take it easy.

522
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,340
Thank you for the coffee.

523
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,928
Keep your eyes open, Seong-yeong.

524
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,891
Dr. Heo.

525
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:54,981
Dr. Choi Seong-yeong made me coffee.

526
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,735
I'm so touched.

527
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,823
Yun-bok.

528
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,118
Wake up.

529
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,620
When you're an intern,

530
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,665
you fall for any senior
who does anything remotely nice.

531
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,751
It's because you're exhausted now.

532
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,256
I bet you think Seong-yeong
looks very handsome and dashing.

533
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,468
You're not in your right mind now.

534
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,595
I see.

535
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm swamped with homework,

536
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,394
but he said
I don't have to finish everything

537
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:37,273
and even made this hot, delicious coffee.

538
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,609
He cheered me up
and told me to take it easy…

539
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,279
Snap out of it, Jang Yun-bok!

540
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,241
Yun-bok! You must stay focused, okay?

541
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,368
Okay!

542
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,631
-Hey.
-We have a male TA patient. Age 39.

543
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,134
There's a fluid collection
in the perisplenic space.

544
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,594
We're suspecting a hematoma.

545
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,221
Go ahead.

546
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,806
A male TA patient, age 39.

547
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,476
We did PCC due to tamponade,
but it's all blood.

548
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,562
The BP rose to 90
after putting in a chest tube

549
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,899
and performing pericardiocentesis,
but he needs to undergo surgery fast.

550
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,026
And the CT scan shows
bleeding in the spleen.

551
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,403
What about hemoglobin
and blood transfusion?

552
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,947
The initial level was 15
and two pints of Type-O blood

553
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,533
have been transfused because
the blood test results are not out yet.

554
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,660
I performed a transfusion,
but the vitals are dropping.

555
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,206
And there was a surgical scar
in the abdomen.

556
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,750
We need to open his chest first
if there is bleeding

557
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,002
even after the pericardiocentesis.

558
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,255
I’ll control the bleeding
in the chest first.

559
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,299
Come inside when it’s done. I’ll call you.

560
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,761
We need to perform the surgery together
if the vital is weak and there is

561
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,347
heavy bleeding in the abdomen.
And drape from chest to the abdomen.

562
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,433
Okay. Call Anesthesiology
to prepare the operating unit.

563
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,602
-Also, prepare blood and CPB too.
-Yes, sir.

564
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,520
Thanks.

565
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,163
The patient may lose a lot of blood.
Keep an eye on the volume.

566
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,623
Okay, will do.

567
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,250
Are his vitals okay?

568
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,961
I'll go in right away if they're unstable.

569
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,295
They're okay at the moment.

570
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,881
Scalpel.

571
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,450
Be thorough with the suction.

572
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:53,909
Yes, sir.

573
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,465
No more bleeding, right?

574
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,010
Yes.

575
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,557
What's his BP now?

576
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,310
It'll keep dropping
without another transfusion.

577
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,728
Are you almost done?

578
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,105
For the chest, yes.

579
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,108
We need to open the abdomen soon,
so I'll keep the chest open.

580
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,818
Okay, good job.

581
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,669
Expect heavy bleeding.

582
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,339
Can we have
the barr retractors first? Ready?

583
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,276
The hematoma is severe.
Get the bowl ready.

584
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,962
I was worried about adhesions,

585
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,839
but the spleen is okay.

586
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,844
Pipette.

587
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,059
Suction.

588
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,060
Okay.

589
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,146
I see where the bleed is.

590
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,741
Press it down.

591
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,201
Okay.

592
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,998
ANESTHESIA DURATION

593
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,416
CURRENT TIME

594
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,751
ELAPSED TIME

595
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,380
Can I have the clamp?

596
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,318
We located the vessel
and got the bleeding under control.

597
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,485
Okay.

598
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,237
Are his vitals okay?

599
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,239
Yes, so far.

600
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,743
I'm monitoring them,
so just focus on the surgery.

601
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,869
Thank you.

602
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,333
When severe bleeding is expected,

603
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,419
make sure you have your retractors ready
before you open them up.

604
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,671
Otherwise,
blood could gush out right away.

605
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,506
Okay, got it.

606
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,052
Jun-wan, who should be in charge
of this patient? You or me?

607
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,223
He had heart surgery too,
so maybe you should take him on.

608
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,558
I'll monitor him too.

609
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,770
Sure. He has a pneumothorax
and a sternal fracture,

610
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,563
so I should take him on.

611
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,649
I'll talk to his guardian.

612
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,819
Give Dr. Do Jae-hak a call
when you're done.

613
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,071
Okay, will do.

614
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,207
We'll remove the specimen now.

615
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,760
The surgery is almost done

616
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,220
and everything went well.

617
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,847
There was a tear in his heart

618
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,975
but we managed to fix it
and stop the bleeding.

619
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,603
The surgeons got the bleeding
under control,

620
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,606
so I believe he'll recover well.

621
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,359
Thank you. Thank you so much, Doctor.

622
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,694
We'll move him to the ICU right away.

623
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,906
We'll check how he's doing
before we give you further updates.

624
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,324
Okay, thank you.

625
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,201
Thank you so much.

626
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,203
Thank you.

627
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,749
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

628
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,525
Sir, are you in pain?

629
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,611
You suffered a hematoma,
but you're okay now.

630
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,576
Get some sleep. We'll fill you in later.

631
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,001
Focus on pain control.

632
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,379
He has a rib fracture, so be careful
when weaning him off the ventilator.

633
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,422
Yes, sir.

634
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,386
Ba-reum has passed gas.
Can Ba-reum eat now?

635
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,263
Sure, order some porridge.

636
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,265
I'll double-check.

637
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,475
Thank you.

638
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,186
It's your first week in Pediatrics,

639
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,855
so Professor Ahn will ask you
a bunch of questions.

640
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,023
Did you study Si-on's chart?

641
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,067
Lee Si-on. Born prematurely,
and birth weight was 750g.

642
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,737
Si-on has been in the NICU
for over three months now.

643
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,238
Received an ileostomy

644
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,074
two weeks after birth due to NEC,
necrotizing enterocolitis.

645
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,495
Underwent another surgery to fix
the stoma when the weight reached 3kg.

646
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,330
Look at you. That's pretty good.

647
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,832
-Shall we?
-Yes.

648
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,628
Right, yes.

649
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,964
Ye-eun's in a good mood today.

650
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,133
She didn't cry and slept well today…

651
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,011
…and has regular bowel movements.

652
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,847
STAFF ONLY

653
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,015
-Hello.
-Hello.

654
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,690
What was the G-tube drainage today?

655
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,401
It was 140 yesterday,
and it's gone down to 70.

656
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,570
I see. That's great.

657
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,992
My gosh, I see you holding Min-sol

658
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,786
every time I come here.

659
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,997
Otherwise, Min-sol will cry.
She smiles the moment I pick her up.

660
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:16,917
My gosh.

661
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,794
-Take it easy.
-Thank you.

662
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,511
Oh, I see that
Si-on isn't pushing it away anymore.

663
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,888
No, Si-on even had a few sips today.

664
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,892
I'm going to try it one more time
this evening.

665
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,229
I think we can aim for 30cc today.

666
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,649
How adorable.

667
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,111
Hong-do.

668
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,030
Si-on underwent surgery for NEC

669
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,616
and had another surgery to fix the stoma.

670
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,580
What should you pay attention to
in neonatal cases like this?

671
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,249
Well…

672
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,881
I'm sorry, Professor.

673
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,267
The baby had abdominal surgery,
so you must observe the abdomen

674
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,893
for stomach inflation

675
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:21,023
and make sure the baby's eating well,
having regular bowel movements

676
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,609
while monitoring the baby's weight.

677
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,486
Those are the four most important things.

678
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,905
Yes, Professor. I'm sorry.

679
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,617
Tomorrow, it'll be something else.

680
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,120
-Take it easy.
-Thank you.

681
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,053
My goodness.

682
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,140
Oh, gosh.

683
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:13,575
Min-sol, Mommy's here. Why are you crying?

684
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,580
Min-sol. It's me, your mom.
Are you hungry?

685
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,462
Can you hold my baby too?
Min-sol keeps crying.

686
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,547
I was holding Min-sol until just now.

687
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,509
I can't hold just one baby the whole day.

688
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,178
I know. I know that too.

689
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,014
But still…

690
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:41,937
Min-sol, why are you crying?

691
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,816
Min-sol. Yes, my sweetie.

692
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,320
Has Song-hwa picked a song yet?

693
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,447
Yes, don't even get me started.

694
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,702
It's a biennial event,
so let her have her way.

695
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,994
What's the song called?

696
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,082
Why didn't you stop her?

697
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,126
I bet she can't even sing the first line.

698
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,585
I tried to talk her out of it!

699
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,422
I threatened her
and treated her to a meal. I did my best.

700
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,673
And?

701
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,217
She's saying it has to be this song.
You talk to her.

702
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,886
She's not listening to you,
so she'll just ignore me.

703
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,557
She's stressed. Let's suck it up
for just 3 minutes and 40 seconds.

704
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,977
We should've made it coincide
with the Summer Olympics.

705
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,104
Who knew two years would fly by this fast?

706
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,570
Hey, Min-ha.

707
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,739
What?

708
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,659
I'm in the center garden. What's up?

709
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,371
Okay.

710
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,710
Hey, are you not going
to reciprocate Chuchu's feelings?

711
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,629
That's our Cupid's next project.

712
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:54,301
Hey! If you lose Chuchu,
you're the biggest idiot ever.

713
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,471
Hey.

714
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,600
Hello, Professor.

715
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,352
Hello.

716
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,480
I thought you were alone.

717
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,190
Well, shall we get lost?

718
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,275
No, please stay.

719
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,320
-Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!
-Rock-paper-scissors!

720
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,405
-Rock-paper-scissors!
-Rock-paper-scissors!

721
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,573
-Yes!
-Darn it!

722
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,159
Thanks.

723
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,077
Chu.

724
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,288
I never said I'd give it to the winner.

725
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,165
The loser gets the ice cream.

726
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,958
Let's do it again. The loser gets it.

727
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,710
Ready or not…

728
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,755
Stop. She'll never give it to us.

729
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,048
Thanks for the ice cream.

730
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,217
No problem. See you later.

731
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,845
-Dr. Chu.
-Yes?

732
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,556
Did I give you this last time?

733
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,141
This.

734
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,649
Professor.

735
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,501
Was Seok-hyeong always that expressive?

736
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,962
-You saw that, right?
-I sure did.

737
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,507
I've never even seen
such a joyful smile on a baby.

738
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,761
Seok-hyeong must know
how he feels about her, right?

739
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,640
You and Gyeo-ul at least knew
you had feelings for each other.

740
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,393
But what if that bear has no idea?

741
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,811
It makes me so anxious.

742
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,437
He knows.

743
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,484
I'm sure he knows
exactly how he feels about her.

744
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:40,282
He's probably racking his brain now,
trying to figure out what to do.

745
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,995
He's slow at everything
and tends to mull over things for a while.

746
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,621
My gosh.

747
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:51,459
It may take a while, but I'm sure
he's even thinking about the consequences

748
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,628
and will want to get it sorted out first.

749
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,298
And they'll have to overcome
a number of hurdles.

750
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,887
How long do you think it'll take?

751
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,807
Not long.

752
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,104
You saw that look on his face.
It's already game over.

753
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,734
My goodness.

754
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,562
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

755
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,815
ICU
STAFF ONLY

756
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,275
Keep an eye on Bae Jun-seong.

757
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,570
Call me if the heart failure worsens.
We'll expedite the surgery.

758
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,322
Okay, I'll call you right away.

759
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,531
-Thanks.
-No problem.

760
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,247
-Professor Kim!
-My gosh!

761
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,750
Tomorrow's Saturday.
Do you have your band practice?

762
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,627
Where were you hiding?

763
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,754
I follow you around wherever you go.

764
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,798
That's so creepy.

765
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,763
-We're not practicing this week.
-Do you want to go hiking tomorrow?

766
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,889
Hiking?

767
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,349
I joined a hiking club.

768
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,642
It's amazing.

769
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,353
They give you food, clothes,
and even a backpack.

770
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,022
And hiking is fun.

771
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,693
If you're just going to veg out at home,
let's go hiking.

772
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,735
If what?

773
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,782
Did I say "veg out"?

774
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,117
Yes, you did.

775
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,663
And I have important plans tomorrow.

776
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,789
-What time?
-At 6 p.m.

777
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,249
-Where?
-Garosu-gil.

778
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,712
Why am I telling you these things?

779
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,173
-You're lonely. That's why.
-No, I'm not.

780
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,013
If it's at 6 p.m.,
we can go hiking before that.

781
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,264
We'll go in the morning.

782
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,683
We'll go hiking early
so you can be there by 6 p.m.

783
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,810
Hey, I'm 42.

784
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,687
I'm 41.

785
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,026
I'm old. I can't do
two different things on the same day.

786
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,153
Just go by yourself, okay?

787
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,448
And bye.
I don't want to see you again today.

788
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,145
-Is it good?
-Yes.

789
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,403
U-ju, you're using
those chopsticks like a pro.

790
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,197
What's going on? You're so good.

791
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,206
You don't have to be good
At using chopsticks to be able to eat

792
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,626
I'm not good at it but I can eat just fine

793
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:26,591
But everyone around me says this
When I'm eating

794
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,842
What's your problem?

795
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,844
Hey, enough. Let's eat.

796
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,430
Okay.

797
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,892
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-Why?

798
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,228
I want to go ride a bike with U-ju.
Come with us.

799
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,146
-I've got plans.
-What time?

800
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,731
-At 6 p.m.
-Where?

801
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,399
Garosu-gil. Gosh, seriously!

802
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,986
You're worse than Mom.
Don't pry into my private life.

803
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,657
-You know what to do, right?
-What?

804
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,033
-For a fever.
-Take the meds.

805
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,910
-If it doesn't come down?
-Go to the ER.

806
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,082
I'm more of an expert than you are.
I've been taking good care of myself.

807
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,544
But how can I not worry?
Mom called again today.

808
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,380
She told me to keep an eye on you
as you're not feeling well.

809
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:09,259
Gosh, I'm not a kid. I know my condition
better than anyone else does.

810
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,637
Ik-jun, I'm okay.

811
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,182
I'm taking good care of myself,
so don't worry.

812
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:30,155
I had dinner with my next-door neighbor

813
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:35,493
He picked on me for not knowing
How to use chopsticks properly

814
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:39,080
But I'm comfortable with this
And I can eat just fine

815
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,834
I'm just the way I am
So mind your own business

816
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,462
-Even if I wear jeans
-Hey!

817
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,422
To work

818
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:52,302
It will be fine as long as I look neat
And presentable

819
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,847
If the summer school uniform, hey!
Had shorts

820
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,267
It would look nice
And help us beat the heat

821
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,854
Stop worrying about what others think

822
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,232
It'll make your life more enjoyable

823
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,736
-Just be yourself
-Yourself

824
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,822
Discover yourself

825
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,783
When you want to dance, just do it

826
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,745
Grandpa, Grandma
Dance with me

827
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,829
Come on, Auntie!

828
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,416
-Who cares how old you are?
-How old you are?

829
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,475
I'm just texting to confirm.

830
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,811
We're meeting at 6 p.m., on Garosu-gil.
No need to rush.

831
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,407
Gosh, it's so hot today.

832
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,786
Come on, U-ju.

833
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,412
Push this for me, Dad.

834
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,748
Goodness. Here.

835
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,088
Auntie! Could you run a bath for us?

836
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,343
-Hey, your helmet.
-Professor Lee.

837
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,763
-Yes?
-U-ju's aunt is not feeling well.

838
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,056
It looks serious.

839
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,859
-Did you take the medication?
-Yes, I took two.

840
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,572
It used to work right away,
but not this time.

841
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,906
I'll take you to the ER.

842
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,158
Cancel your plans.

843
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,329
Yes, I should.

844
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,084
Let's just go to the hospital nearby.
It's a big hospital.

845
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,594
Jun-wan knows you're in Korea.

846
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:05,435
Did Jun-wan tell you that he ran into me?

847
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,523
Yes, he told me
that he ran into you on the bus.

848
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,154
So let's go to Yulje.

849
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,656
It's the weekend,
and he's not on duty today.

850
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,782
You won't run into him.

851
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,100
I don't think I can make it.

852
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,811
I'm not feeling well.

853
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,481
I'm sorry, Jun-wan.

854
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:10,792
I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT.
I'M NOT FEELING WELL. I'M SORRY, JUN-WAN.

855
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,655
I hope her temperature goes down.

856
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,700
We gave her a fever reducer
and antibiotics.

857
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,369
It'll go down soon.
It's only been an hour.

858
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,499
Wait in your office.
I'll call you when it goes down.

859
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,542
Okay.

860
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,253
I'm going to step out for some air.

861
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,260
AMBULANCE ENTRY ONLY

862
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,891
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

863
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,561
-Take care!
-You too.

864
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,687
My gosh.

865
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,938
Hello, Professor Lee.

866
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,567
-Did you go hiking today?
-Yes.

867
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,320
My patient who has surgery next Tuesday
isn't doing well, so I came to check.

868
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,990
What are you doing here on a Saturday?

869
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:27,118
I thought you were meeting
Professor Kim today.

870
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,328
Why would I see him on the weekend?

871
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,789
Oh, he told me he had dinner plans.

872
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,791
I thought it was with you and the others.

873
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,712
We don't love each other that much.

874
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,381
-Go on in.
-Okay.

875
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,633
Hey, wait.

876
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,430
Did he say
he was meeting someone at 6 p.m.?

877
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,723
Yes, that's what I heard.

878
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,892
Do you know where?

879
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,437
Garosu-gil.

880
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,621
It's finally going down.

881
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,873
-Stay until the IV bag runs dry.
-Sure thing.

882
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,626
We should do a CT scan too.
I'll give her some antibiotics.

883
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,504
Thanks. Oh, dear.

884
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,597
You're still here?

885
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,516
Of course. I have to take you home.

886
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,393
Come on, seriously. I can just take a cab.

887
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,479
I'll figure it out,
so just get some sleep.

888
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,942
Then wait in your office.
They said this will take a while.

889
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,195
Jeez, okay. I'll be in my office.

890
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,096
Hey, what's up?

891
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,305
Where are you?

892
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,558
Home. What's going on?

893
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,227
-Where are you?
-In the ER.

894
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,270
The ER?

895
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,607
My sister was running a fever,
so I brought her to the ER.

896
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,533
She's getting an IV now.
Thankfully, her temperature has gone down.

897
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,660
We'll wait until the IV is done.

898
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:36,247
I think it'll take about an hour.

899
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:42,086
I came to my office
because she didn't want me there.

900
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:45,256
I'll go down when Gwang-hyeon calls me.

901
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,342
Just saying.

902
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,597
Are you there?

903
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,099
Yes, I'm here.

904
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:56,976
I have to go.

905
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,659
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

906
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,248
Hello, Professor.

907
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,462
It hasn't even been 30 minutes.

908
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:31,218
Professor, I'm totally fine…

909
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,663
Are you all right?

910
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,916
Yes. I must have eaten something bad.

911
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,836
I had indigestion accompanied by a fever.

912
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,633
I read your chart.

913
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,431
Why didn't you tell me?

914
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,268
It happened after we broke up.

915
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,523
And it has nothing to do with you.

916
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,857
It was in March last year.

917
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,903
You got the CT scan and MRI done here
in March last year.

918
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,533
You lied to me, didn't you?

919
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,372
Your friend, Se-gyeong.

920
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,835
That was a lie, wasn't it?

921
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,223
Just making sure you're okay.
No need to text me back.

922
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,212
Can you explain this?

923
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,644
Oh, I totally forgot.

924
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,522
I'll go give U-ju a goodnight kiss.

925
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,610
She's going to drop this.

926
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,428
Did you open the app?

927
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:23,015
I'm talking to you on the phone.
I'm using my laptop.

928
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,183
I see.

929
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,352
EXPRESS BUS TICKETING

930
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,146
23:30 20 SEATS AVAILABLE
24:00 25 SEATS AVAILABLE

931
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,816
Let's see.

932
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,570
Hold on.

933
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,577
The earliest one.

934
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,912
The earliest one?

935
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,497
Hold on.

936
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:50,376
Is there a seat left?
No, not for the earlier ones.

937
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,752
Then it doesn't matter.

938
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:52,753
Sure.

939
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:08,310
-Hey, go ahead.
-Bae Jun-seong's pulmonary edema is severe

940
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,479
and he can't urinate.
He's on a ventilator now.

941
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,857
Really? What's his urine output?

942
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,942
The last time we checked,
it was only 10cc.

943
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,738
-I'm coming.
-When do you think you'll get here?

944
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,699
Sorry to rush you, but we need you.

945
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,617
See you in a minute.

946
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,214
We'll talk another time.

947
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,341
Okay?

948
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,941
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

949
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,043
Did you check in on Kim Pil-seong?

950
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,128
How's his drainage and jaundice?

951
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:19,506
Yes, the drainage was 150cc.

952
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,592
Bilirubin level was 3.2.
It's dropped a bit.

953
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:22,843
I see.

954
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,722
I checked too. It doesn't look good.

955
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,059
-Dr. Kim Geon.
-Yes.

956
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,519
He received a liver transplant
three years ago,

957
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,355
and the surgery went well.

958
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:37,733
Then a year later, he received PTBD
due to biliary complications.

959
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,905
We removed it after six months,
and he was doing fine

960
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,783
until the bile duct problem recurred
two weeks ago.

961
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:49,995
Radiology tried doing PTBD three times
with a four-day interval in between,

962
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,164
but even their third attempt
yesterday failed

963
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,042
because they couldn't pass
the guide wire through.

964
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,838
Even the ERCP last week failed.

965
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,882
Then what option do we have left now?

966
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,010
Well…

967
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:06,929
Surgery.

968
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,806
Correct.

969
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,225
-It wasn't even a difficult question.
-Right.

970
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,645
All medical interventions failed,
so the patient needs surgery.

971
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,481
If we go ahead with it,
what's the name of the surgery?

972
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,362
Right.

973
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,657
Professor might ask you about it.
I'm helping you prepare for it.

974
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,785
Yes, thank you.

975
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,665
Hi, guys.

976
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:36,667
-Hello.
-Hello.

977
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,960
Let's go.

978
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,672
The PTBD we tried yesterday also failed.

979
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,425
We can keep on trying,

980
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,427
but it could cause infections or bleeding.

981
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,971
Another thing we can try is surgery.

982
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,973
I happen to have no surgery booked today,

983
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:54,059
and I think we should get it done soon.
Let's just do it today.

984
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,854
So we're finally resorting to surgery?

985
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:00,691
Yes. I know
you've heard this numerous times,

986
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:03,944
but the bile ducts
keep getting obstructed.

987
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,990
We used to be able to make do
with non-surgical procedures.

988
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,742
But not anymore, I'm afraid.

989
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:13,537
We'll perform surgery to connect
the ducts to the intestine.

990
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,664
You can think of it
as creating a new path.

991
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,249
Are we going to do it right away?

992
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,501
When did you have your last meal?

993
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,837
He's eaten nothing
since his dinner last night.

994
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,214
That's great.

995
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,385
As I have explained before,

996
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:33,182
twenty percent
of liver transplant patients experience

997
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:35,768
biliary complications
even if their surgery went well.

998
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,146
We can usually treat them
with non-surgical procedures,

999
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,397
but not in your case.

1000
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,068
The sooner we treat this, the better.

1001
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,862
We'll begin the surgery
as soon as you're ready.

1002
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:51,742
Your doctor will go over everything with
you when you're signing the consent form.

1003
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,286
-Let's do it in the morning.
-Okay.

1004
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,748
Call Anesthesiology and let me know
when you finalize the time.

1005
01:12:57,831 --> 01:12:59,416
-Got it.
-Good.

1006
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,752
What's the name of this surgery?

1007
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,629
Hepaticojejunostomy.

1008
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,838
Nice.

1009
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:10,969
Professor Shin Hui-seong in Radiology
said he was going to Busan today.

1010
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,597
Should I ask someone else
to do the intraoperative ultrasound?

1011
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:17,393
Right, they have a conference
in Busan this week.

1012
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,686
Yes, they're taking turns to go there.

1013
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,481
Someone else is here,
but he's not an abdominal radiologist.

1014
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,527
Gosh, Professor Shin and I
have been treating this patient together.

1015
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,987
Has he already left?

1016
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,489
Anyway, all right.

1017
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:36,912
Chang-min!

1018
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,126
Look who's here. My high school buddy

1019
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:46,004
and first-year ER resident, Yeon Jae-min.
What brings you here?

1020
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,092
I'm impressed.
You came to check in on the patient?

1021
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,428
Yes. I really want to know how he's doing.

1022
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,847
We struggled
to stabilize his vitals in the ER

1023
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,016
-but managed to send him in for surgery.
-Just check his chart.

1024
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,060
I wanted to check in person.

1025
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,687
My gosh.

1026
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,492
Hello.

1027
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,744
Hello, Doctor.

1028
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:19,746
Have you eaten yet?

1029
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,081
Yes, I have.

1030
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,625
Mr. Ko Ju-hyeong, how are you feeling?

1031
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,085
I feel great.

1032
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:28,088
I slept very well last night.

1033
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:32,092
I owe it all to you
and Professor Kim Jun-wan.

1034
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,802
You saved my husband's life.

1035
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,472
I didn't even do much.

1036
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,558
Professor Kim is an amazing surgeon.

1037
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,643
All I did was assist him.

1038
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,396
My husband told me something.

1039
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,482
When he was waking up from anesthesia,

1040
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,276
he saw two blurry faces.

1041
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:52,529
He doesn't remember anything else,

1042
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:56,700
but he vividly remembers
the two faces looking at him like this.

1043
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,747
He said he felt like
the prince in The Little Mermaid.

1044
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,877
He thought to himself,
"I'm alive. These men saved my life."

1045
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,962
Just as he was thinking that,

1046
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,131
he fell asleep again.

1047
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,468
The other professor of surgery

1048
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,054
who was on duty that day
is also very famous.

1049
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,597
Professor Lee Ik-jun, right?

1050
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,599
He stopped by this morning.

1051
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:25,145
I see. It's incredible that they happened
to be on duty together that day.

1052
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,315
It's so awful that your husband was hit

1053
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,108
by a drunk driver,

1054
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,612
but he got very lucky with the surgery.

1055
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:37,199
It's all thanks to you.
We'll never forget what you did for us.

1056
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,704
And this is…

1057
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,752
Have you left already?

1058
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,671
Yes, I'm on the express bus now.

1059
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,548
We just got on the highway. What's up?

1060
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,966
Oh, boy.

1061
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,133
What's going on?

1062
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:59,555
Professor Shin,
Kim Pil-seong needs surgery.

1063
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,557
Really?

1064
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:05,394
We're going to perform
a hepaticojejunostomy in two hours.

1065
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:08,188
I was wondering if you'd be able
to monitor the ultrasound.

1066
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,731
I see. I'll come now.

1067
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,985
My goodness. How?
You're already on the highway.

1068
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,528
I'll make the bus turn around.

1069
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,446
My goodness.

1070
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:20,367
Anyway, all right. I'll figure it out.

1071
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,328
I have no choice. Have a safe trip.

1072
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,122
-All right.
-Bye.

1073
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,091
Look at you eating so well.

1074
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,512
You're a good eater now, Si-on.

1075
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,768
I heard Si-on already had 300cc today.

1076
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:50,147
Yes. After this, it'll be 350cc.

1077
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,777
We should tell Si-on's mother
this amazing news right away.

1078
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,070
Yes.

1079
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,419
Patient Ko Ju-hyeong?
The one who had emergency surgery?

1080
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:15,672
Yes. I had no idea
until Hyo-ju told me yesterday.

1081
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:18,425
Turns out,
he's her close friend's husband.

1082
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:21,053
It's a friend that I had never met before.

1083
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:24,056
I only heard about it yesterday.
She was so flustered

1084
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,100
that she couldn't call me
until her husband moved to a regular ward.

1085
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,602
She only thought of me then.

1086
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,564
But she's curious about something, honey.

1087
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,607
What is it?

1088
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:38,111
She's realized that her husband
underwent two surgeries at the same time.

1089
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,572
The ICU and the ER…

1090
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,241
The past few days flashed before her eyes.

1091
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,661
And she asked me to ask you something.

1092
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:48,580
Out of all the challenging situations
in the past few days,

1093
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,041
when was the most critical moment?

1094
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:52,459
Well…

1095
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:56,046
The abdominal surgery?
Or the heart surgery?

1096
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:57,964
When was the most critical moment?

1097
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:02,594
His case was a serious emergency,
so every moment was critical.

1098
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:05,764
But if I were to pick
the most critical moment…

1099
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,686
When do you think it was, Professor?

1100
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,526
Really, Professor Ahn?

1101
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,780
Yes. Si-on can eat
and swallow now, no problem.

1102
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,616
Looks like it's almost time to go home.

1103
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:30,372
If she's still eating
at this pace tomorrow,

1104
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:33,333
you can take Si-on home
the day after tomorrow.

1105
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,586
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Professor Ahn.

1106
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,840
Si-on is

1107
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:43,301
going home for the very first time.

1108
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,721
My gosh.

1109
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:49,182
We owe it all to you.

1110
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:54,354
You saved Si-on's life.

1111
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,482
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Professor Ahn.

1112
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,195
To tell you the truth,
I've only been checking in

1113
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,365
for five minutes twice a day
since the surgery.

1114
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,620
Except for that five minutes,
Si-on received care

1115
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,999
from the nurses in the NICU,
for 23 hours and 55 minutes each day.

1116
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:18,378
I'm so glad Si-on is recovering
and can swallow now,

1117
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,840
but 90 percent of the credit
should go to the nurses.

1118
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:26,636
You should thank them, not me.

1119
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,598
-Okay, we will.
-Okay.

1120
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,100
Talk soon.

1121
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,977
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1122
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:39,608
Irrigation.

1123
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:51,119
No bile leak, right? Everything good?

1124
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,163
Yes, the connection looks good.

1125
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,834
Let's check the ultrasound.
Please have it ready.

1126
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,127
Okay.

1127
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:23,193
Professor, we should check the ultrasound.

1128
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,779
Professor Shin.

1129
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:38,250
The artery looks good.

1130
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,753
And the vessels…

1131
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,422
They all look good. I'm relieved.

1132
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,384
Yes. The vessels are okay,
so he'll recover soon.

1133
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:49,469
Yes, he should recover.

1134
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,686
The ER.

1135
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:03,191
He might not have made it

1136
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,527
had he not received
proper emergency treatment in the ER.

1137
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:08,864
-I see.
-Our ER staff did a great job,

1138
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,407
so he made it to the OR.

1139
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:13,827
And that's why we were able to operate
on his heart and intestines.

1140
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,539
So if I were to pick
the most critical moment,

1141
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,708
my answer is the ER.

1142
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,172
-Call CS and Surgery. Now.
-Yes, sir.

1143
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,583
We drained some blood,
but his BP is still 70.

1144
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,418
Is the chest tube ready?

1145
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:46,586
Yes, sir.

1146
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,839
I'll handle this patient.
Go take care of other ER patients.

1147
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,424
Let me know if you need a hand.

1148
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:52,509
Okay.

1149
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,612
Professor Lee Ik-jun
and Professor Kim Jun-wan are here.

1150
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:36,654
Okay.

1151
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,329
How did you manage to come back?

1152
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,956
I nearly jumped out of my skin
when you walked in.

1153
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,376
Of course, I should be here
for my longtime patient.

1154
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,795
And who'd do it if not me?

1155
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:53,713
How did you get back?

1156
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,134
I explained the situation
and got off at the nearest rest area,

1157
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,552
then called a taxi.

1158
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:00,970
My gosh.

1159
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:04,516
Seriously!

1160
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:07,769
Thank you so much.

1161
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,688
I didn't want to come because of you

1162
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,398
but I did it for the patient.

1163
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:15,443
We've been treating him for two years,
so I wanted to be here.

1164
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:18,947
All the failed PTBD attempts
had me worried.

1165
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,242
My goodness.

1166
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:24,452
Gosh, you!

1167
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:29,165
Wait, I should do something. Stay put.

1168
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:30,208
-Okay.
-My goodness.

1169
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,628
I'll give you a neck massage.
Like this. Now, a scalp massage.

1170
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:36,214
-The scalp.
-No! This hair cost me three million won.

1171
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,966
-Come on! Liar.
-Hey.

1172
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:40,051
-Hey, come and stand here.
-Why?

1173
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,221
You served the ball,
and I hit it like this.

1174
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,764
Right? So what was the problem?

1175
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,475
You're bringing it up again?

1176
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:51,354
I told you. In table tennis,
you have to take turns.

1177
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:54,607
Yes! You and I kept taking turns.
That's exactly what we did!

1178
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:06,703
Professor, it looks like
Jae-min has gone AWOL.

1179
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,998
I saw him in the smoking room.

1180
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:12,083
What? He's there now?

1181
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:14,252
This little…

1182
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,671
Hey! Just leave him be.

1183
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:19,174
He looks like an overthinker to me.

1184
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:20,717
I'll go talk to him.

1185
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,760
You should go home.

1186
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:24,929
Okay.

1187
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:33,980
What is this?

1188
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:37,942
Did you bring food from home?
Amazing! I was starving.

1189
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,654
Let's have it together later.
Dr. Choi is almost here too.

1190
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:42,739
Okay.

1191
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,409
Wait, when did you have time to cook?

1192
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:49,204
You were here all day with me.

1193
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,042
Well…

1194
01:26:57,503 --> 01:27:01,174
I understand why
that hurt your feelings. I get it.

1195
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,677
Do you never feel that way?

1196
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,930
I was really upset.

1197
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:09,974
I felt like the Little Mermaid.

1198
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,314
"I've been there too. I know you're upset,
but try to understand."

1199
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:20,526
I should probably be telling you
something like this to comfort you.

1200
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:23,947
But frankly, I've never thought that way.

1201
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,201
I'm happy when we get good results.

1202
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:30,828
It doesn't matter who gets the credit.

1203
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,917
If we manage to give
effective emergency treatment

1204
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,419
and save the patient, that's enough.

1205
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,963
That's rewarding enough for me.

1206
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,802
We don't help patients
expecting something in return.

1207
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:49,264
Besides, do the patients need
to know things like that?

1208
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,852
We just need to do our best.

1209
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,188
And if the patients recover well
because of that,

1210
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,524
we've done our job.

1211
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,278
Right.

1212
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,115
Jae-min.

1213
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:11,494
If you're still hurt…

1214
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:15,915
I know you did a great job.

1215
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,753
I know,

1216
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:25,633
and so do Dr. Kang So-ye,
the chief, and Hui-su.

1217
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,219
So shake it off

1218
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,889
and get back to work, you brat.

1219
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,018
Sebastian and your other friends
are swamped right now.

1220
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:37,812
Yes, sir.

1221
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,583
-You must be hungry.
-Yes.

1222
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:00,460
-What is it?
-My gosh!

1223
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:02,211
-It's gimbap.
-It looks so good.

1224
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,339
-What's that?
-Fruit.

1225
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:06,257
Oh, what is this?

1226
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,217
-Yubu chobap?
-It looks amazing.

1227
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:10,136
-It looks delicious.
-My gosh.

1228
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:14,807
To all the nurses in the NICU
who always work so hard.

1229
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:20,063
Thanks to you, who looked after Si-on
like your own child,

1230
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:24,108
Si-on can now eat and swallow
and has gained weight too.

1231
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,402
We can finally take Si-on home.

1232
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,280
It must not have been easy.

1233
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:33,117
-Thank you for your warm love and care
-Eat up.

1234
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,120
and for being Si-on's best friend
for such a long time.

1235
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,038
What is that?

1236
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:39,332
Thank you so much again for all your help.

1237
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:41,292
-What's that?
-We'll remember you forever.

1238
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,669
We love you.

1239
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:53,012
Jong-su.

1240
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,642
I realized something
after this health scare.

1241
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,185
What?

1242
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,145
The things I said to you

1243
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:05,108
when you were ill
probably didn't comfort you at all.

1244
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:07,777
What did you say back then?

1245
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,654
See? You don't even remember.

1246
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,785
"You have no regrets left in life?

1247
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:18,579
Don't be like that. You're only 70."

1248
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,916
Right, it's coming back to me now.

1249
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,585
When I was sick,

1250
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,213
I refused to listen
to what others were saying.

1251
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:29,757
Everyone gets like that.

1252
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:34,512
All I could think was
how futile and boring life was.

1253
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,181
I couldn't listen
to what anyone was saying.

1254
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:39,267
So, Rosa,

1255
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:43,020
stop nagging the people around you.

1256
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,355
Think only about your life

1257
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:46,816
and just have fun every day.

1258
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:48,109
Yes, I will.

1259
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,697
I'm so happy I got back into piano.
I should've done it sooner.

1260
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,740
I want to start something too.

1261
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:55,992
What?

1262
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:00,329
You inspired me. I want to

1263
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,874
learn to cook.

1264
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,335
That said,
let me make dinner this evening.

1265
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:10,381
Did you take the day off again?

1266
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:11,841
Yes.

1267
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:13,467
You'll get fired at this rate.

1268
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:17,305
What is wrong with you?

1269
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:20,099
You're a lazy bum. Do you know that?

1270
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:26,480
Hey, you took a day off last week too.

1271
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:29,525
And yesterday, you complained
about your knee pain and left early.

1272
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:33,029
Diligence is the only thing
we can count on at this age.

1273
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:36,157
Do you arrive at work on time?

1274
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:41,913
If you can't even keep
such small promises,

1275
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:45,583
the youngsters won't want
to work with you.

1276
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:51,088
And don't tell me you demand that
everyone join team dinners on Fridays.

1277
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,883
-Watch your step.
-That's bad manners.

1278
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:57,303
Everyone goes away on weekends.
They leave on Friday nights.

1279
01:31:57,386 --> 01:32:00,514
Gosh, look at those dark clouds.
It'll pour down again.

1280
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,475
They said to expect showers all day.

1281
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:06,145
Let's hurry home.
Actually, no. Let's walk slowly.

1282
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:07,897
Hey, I can walk well now.

1283
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,482
Hey, wait!

1284
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:12,068
Wait up, traitor!

1285
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:13,486
-Whatever!
-What?

1286
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,029
Gosh, seriously.

1287
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:16,822
Careful.

1288
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,491
What? Oh, gosh.

1289
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:23,079
Good things can indeed come out
of bad situations.

1290
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:24,872
What do you mean?

1291
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:27,124
Because of my mom's condition,

1292
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,002
all three of my brothers
have been calling her every morning.

1293
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:35,466
My brothers and I
aren't that affectionate.

1294
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,678
We always tell our parents,
"No news is good news."

1295
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:41,722
But we're gathering
for a family meal this weekend too.

1296
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,015
That's only natural.

1297
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,268
How's your mom?

1298
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,271
She's okay. She's come to accept it.

1299
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:52,858
She's taking her meds and has been
coming in for her appointments.

1300
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:55,611
Oh, it's raining.

1301
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,446
Again?

1302
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,490
No, it's not.

1303
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,242
It is.

1304
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:15,756
Come on.

1305
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,009
My gosh.

1306
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,761
-Hey, be careful here.
-Hey!

1307
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:35,860
It's like a hurdle.
Think of this as a hurdle race.

1308
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,404
I see about three more.

1309
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:40,406
Well, you can do it.

1310
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:42,533
Just jump over them.

1311
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:30,206
Song-hwa.

1312
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,833
We can pick something else now.

1313
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,836
We can play any song right away.

1314
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,340
No.

1315
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,884
I'm going to sing this song.

1316
01:34:41,967 --> 01:34:43,260
It's my birthday today.

1317
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:47,098
Okay, do it.

1318
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:49,183
Go for it, Song-hwa!

1319
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,810
You've fallen for me

1320
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,648
In the dazzling spotlight

1321
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:39,275
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1322
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:43,737
Don't just smile and answer me

1323
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,823
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1324
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:50,244
On this exciting Saturday night

1325
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:52,329
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1326
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:56,000
Just tell me honestly

1327
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:03,674
You're playing hard to get
To grab my attention

1328
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:10,389
But I won't fall for it

1329
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:23,903
You've fallen for me

1330
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:28,324
What are those eyes trying to tell me?

1331
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:29,825
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1332
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:32,411
Dance for me

1333
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:41,462
The moment our eyes met

1334
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:46,717
I felt the passionate spark

1335
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,935
If you want me to

1336
01:36:57,478 --> 01:37:00,105
I'll go take the stars
Out of the sky for you

1337
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:09,114
Kiss me on the cheek

1338
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:38,686
Introduce me to someone nice

1339
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:57,246
Can we meet? I have something to give you.

1340
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,501
Yes!

1341
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:16,807
You want to meet up?

1342
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:19,310
Sure.

1343
01:38:20,519 --> 01:38:21,562
Where are we meeting?

1344
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:27,252
If you want me to

1345
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:31,548
I'll go take the stars
Out of the sky for you

1346
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:40,307
Kiss me on the cheek

1347
01:39:53,028 --> 01:39:59,535
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1348
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:05,666
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1349
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:12,089
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1350
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:15,342
-You've fallen for me
-You've fallen for me

1351
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,344
You have fallen

1352
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:23,517
For me

1353
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:28,248
Sorry, something's come up.
I'll see you another time.

1354
01:43:08,473 --> 01:43:09,808
They're amazing.

1355
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:13,520
They must be busy with work,
but they still have band practice.

1356
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,397
I'll choose the song
because it's my birthday.

1357
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,024
-Practice hard, okay?
-Hey!

1358
01:43:17,107 --> 01:43:19,735
Tomorrow's dress code
is "black and chain."

1359
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:21,653
But why did they name their band
Gongnyong Ridge?

1360
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,322
They started as a hiking club.

1361
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:26,241
I said I'm not going to go there.
Don't even think about it.

1362
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:28,368
-Min-ha.
-Yes?

1363
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:30,746
So you still have one more chance?

1364
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:33,332
But I think you'll succeed this time.

1365
01:43:33,415 --> 01:43:36,710
It's the last chance I have.
I really need to succeed this time.

1366
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:38,921
I knew it, bear.

1367
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,006
Hey.

1368
01:43:41,089 --> 01:43:43,926
How is your mother doing?

1369
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:45,302
You're the only person. Do you know that?

1370
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:49,056
You're the only person who didn't ask me
why we don't have children.

1371
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:53,769
DOVE

1372
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:09,159
