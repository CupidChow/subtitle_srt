1
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,442
-Did you check Oh Yeong-in's vitals again?
-Yes, I did.

2
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,068
I'm going to go make my rounds.

3
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,488
Hong-do, come join the meeting.

4
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,198
Professor Yang wants you to sit in.

5
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,533
Okay.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,454
Hong-do, when did you last wash your hair?

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,373
I don't know.

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,167
All right, let's go.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,419
As long as it's not itchy.
You're okay, right?

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,464
-Yes.
-All right.

11
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,100
Patient Jang Seon-guk in Room 6008
had surgery 3 days ago,

12
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,061
but his hemoglobin level is too low.

13
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,147
-The vitals looked okay though.
-Yes, the vitals are fine.

14
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,900
I see that everyone
beat the Friday traffic

15
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,610
and managed to get here on time.

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,028
Good morning.

17
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,154
Good morning.

18
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,363
-Good morning.
-Morning.

19
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,657
It'll be a while
before Professor Lee gets here.

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,117
Shall we go have some coffee?

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,828
No, we only have 10 to 15 minutes.

22
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,914
That's enough time for a meal and dessert.

23
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,290
I can even brush my teeth.

24
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,416
I'll go get it.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,793
-I'll do it.
-I got it.

26
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,253
We'll go.

27
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,422
Have some coffee.

28
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,216
My gosh!

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,261
-Nice! Good morning.
-Perfect timing. How did you know?

30
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,388
My gosh, thank you.

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,405
Thank you. No one wants this, right?

32
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,406
Yes.

33
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,417
Hi, Mom. What's up? It's so early.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,502
Can I only call you when something's up?

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,462
-Are you at work?
-I just got here.

36
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,174
Hey, my friend's daughter
is joining Internal Medicine…

37
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,012
No, I think it's Cardiology.
She's joining that department at Yulje.

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:03,141
She was going to work at the Jongno branch
after becoming board-certified,

39
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,852
but she'll actually work at your branch
for a few months.

40
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,854
Will you see her often at work?

41
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,856
No, I rarely work with cardiologists.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,151
By the way, I read another article
that mentioned your name.

43
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,280
Yoo Gyeong-jin thanked you again
during her interview.

44
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,157
She said she's doing great

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,286
without any postoperative complications
even though it was a difficult surgery.

46
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,956
Was her surgery that difficult?

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,875
Did it take long? How many hours?

48
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,044
No, it didn't take long.

49
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,796
I have to go do rounds, Mom.
I'll call you later.

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,882
All right, okay.

51
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,768
Hello, Professor.

52
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,729
Hi. Are you that excited to see me?

53
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,398
I know I see you every day,
but I get excited every time.

54
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,150
I think I love you.

55
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,527
Don't. Please don't love me, okay?

56
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,696
No.

57
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,283
I must follow my heart.

58
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,618
You little…

59
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,082
Is your first appointment
really at 7:50 a.m.?

60
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,793
-Yes, it is.
-Is this what you'll be wearing?

61
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,503
My coat!

62
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,340
Whatever, it's okay. I don't have time.

63
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,845
Director Ju hates it when doctors see
their patients without their lab coats.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,722
Clothes don't matter. Your heart does.

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,892
Gosh. Take it off.

66
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,769
-What?
-Come on. I don't have time.

67
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,485
Let's have lunch together.

68
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,778
Sure thing!

69
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,785
Professor, I just got a call.

70
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,830
Professor Gu Hye-yeong from the NICU
will be 20 minutes late.

71
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,249
She has to meet with Director Ju urgently.

72
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,875
Really?

73
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,921
Then I shouldn't have rushed.
I didn't even have breakfast.

74
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,259
Then why don't we go
have breakfast quickly?

75
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,223
Something quick and easy. Let's go.

76
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,601
Okay, let's go.

77
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,186
Okay.

78
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,861
Bonjour.

79
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,446
Buon giorno.

80
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,281
Buenos días.

81
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,699
Good morning, everyone.

82
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,079
Are we all going together?

83
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,206
It's Se-hoon's patient.

84
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,292
Yun-bok is our intern and…

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,461
-I should be there too.
-Right, let's go.

86
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,549
The liver resection was performed
seven days ago.

87
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,010
The CT scan looked good,
so we removed the JP drain.

88
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,511
And the patient is eating well.

89
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,055
Great. And the lab results?

90
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,891
Everything looks good.
The liver index is at 20.

91
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,934
Good enough to be discharged.

92
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,395
Hello.

93
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,440
Next is Han-jun.

94
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,737
Is he here with his mom again?

95
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,197
Yes.

96
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,993
Hi, Han-jun. How have you been?

97
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,870
-Good.
-He's been well.

98
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,873
But he didn't exercise,
so he's gained quite a bit of weight.

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,461
Well, but everything looks pretty good.

100
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,090
Han-jun, does your stomach
ever feel tight?

101
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,674
Do you ever feel dizzy?

102
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,135
-Well…
-No, never.

103
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,763
No dizziness,
but he occasionally gets headaches.

104
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,724
But it goes away
as soon as he takes his medication.

105
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,684
I see.

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,439
The ultrasound results look good too.

107
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,276
Han-jun, you need to lose
a bit of weight though.

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,946
You don't like to exercise?
Do you play any sports?

109
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,948
He likes baseball.

110
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,908
Watching baseball, not playing it.

111
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,202
Ma'am.

112
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,748
Han-jun can answer
these questions too, you know.

113
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,378
You're in sixth grade now, right?

114
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,462
Yes.

115
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,923
Ma'am, he's certainly old enough

116
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,010
to tell me how he's been doing
and describe his condition.

117
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,348
Gosh, no. He may look like a big boy,
but he's still a kid.

118
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm not a kid.

119
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,977
What?

120
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,980
Professor Ahn,
my stomach doesn't feel tight,

121
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,941
but I've felt dizzy once in a while.

122
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,068
It was nothing serious though.

123
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,322
I'd say it was like
what my anemic friends get.

124
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,617
And as for sports,
I'd rather watch than play.

125
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,163
I like baseball.
Can I bike while watching baseball games?

126
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,623
We have an indoor cycling bike at home.

127
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,375
I'll do it while watching baseball.

128
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,670
Sounds good.
As long as you get some exercise.

129
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,672
Here, pinky swear.

130
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,590
Yes.

131
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,345
All right. Then I'll see you again

132
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,890
in three months. How does that sound?

133
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,393
I hope you slim down a little
before your next appointment.

134
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,146
-Okay.
-Isn't that too late though?

135
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,440
I want to bring him in every month.

136
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,067
Seeing me often is not a good thing.

137
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,529
You're okay with seeing me again
in three months, right?

138
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:13,201
Of course. Not having to
come in often is a good sign

139
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,120
because it means
that I'm recovering optimally.

140
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,748
Don't get me wrong. I like you very much,

141
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,501
but I'm happy that
I don't have to come in so often.

142
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,048
All right. Let's make sure
we don't have to see each other so often.

143
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,299
Okay.

144
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,972
My gosh. Hello, Professor Chae.

145
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,224
Yes, hello.

146
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,726
Hi, Du-na.

147
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,648
She can now obey commands,
and the lab results look good too.

148
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,732
Great.

149
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,694
Du-na, do you know where you are now?

150
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,197
Can you tell where you are?

151
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,700
My head.

152
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,578
My head…

153
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,083
Yes, you're in the hospital now.

154
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,295
We'll begin the rehabilitation tomorrow.
Let the others know.

155
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,255
Got it.

156
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,800
As I've explained before,

157
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,927
her Broca's area is damaged,

158
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,012
so she'll have trouble speaking fluently.

159
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,431
This condition is called Broca's aphasia.

160
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,726
She understands everything
but can't really form words and sentences.

161
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,355
She will recover gradually,
but it may take a while.

162
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,195
We'll begin her rehabilitation therapy
tomorrow along with speech therapy.

163
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,242
We've hit another hurdle
just as we were beginning to rejoice

164
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,452
in her miraculous recovery.

165
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,831
Rehabilitation is like a long battle.

166
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,126
It'll be hard for Du-na,

167
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,963
and it won't be easy for you
to see her go through it.

168
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,882
But she must go through it
to return to her normal daily life.

169
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,678
Doctor, I'm just so grateful

170
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,932
that my daughter is alive.

171
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,560
I'll do as you say.

172
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,355
It's okay even if it takes time
for her to fully recover.

173
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,525
I'm so thankful,
and I think this is a blessing.

174
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,863
I'll make sure she sticks through it,
so put your worries to rest.

175
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,408
Okay, we'll come up with
the schedule and go from there.

176
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:18,993
We'll talk soon.

177
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,837
Her fever is not coming down,
and her blood pressure is low.

178
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,465
To perform the transplant,
we need her BP and temperature

179
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,508
to be within the normal range.

180
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,344
We've given her antibiotics

181
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,305
as well as other medications
to raise her blood pressure,

182
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,183
so we'll see improvements soon.

183
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,895
I'm not sure exactly how long it'll take.

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,022
I'm expecting four to five days.

185
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,274
We'll monitor her
carefully over the weekend

186
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,027
and do our best
to perform the surgery next week.

187
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,487
Okay, Professor Lee.

188
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,072
Thank you.

189
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,450
Then I guess I can check in

190
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,494
when the surgery date is confirmed, right?

191
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,331
Yes, donors usually check in
the day before the surgery.

192
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,751
You can check in the day before,
once everything is confirmed.

193
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,004
The doctor here will go over
the details with you again.

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,925
Doctor. I heard this procedure
gets more complicated

195
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,970
if the patient has undergone
surgery in the past

196
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,556
because of a condition called "adhesion."

197
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,184
Will my daughter's surgery
be a difficult one?

198
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,520
Will it be on the complicated side?

199
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,729
Professor Lee.

200
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,773
Have you done it many times?

201
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,693
Every transplant surgery

202
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,196
is difficult.

203
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,827
Since your sister underwent
a big intestinal surgery in the past

204
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,246
because of a car accident,

205
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,123
the adhesion will be severe,

206
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,250
so her surgery will be quite complicated.

207
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,877
It won't be easy
to keep the bleeding under control.

208
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,132
However,
the end-stage cirrhosis has resulted

209
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,592
in a significant deterioration
in her liver function,

210
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,928
so a liver transplant
is the only solution now.

211
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,142
Thankfully, your father is a match
and has agreed to be her donor,

212
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,644
so we can perform the transplant.

213
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,440
It won't be an easy case,

214
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,817
but we'll do our very best.

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,280
I know you must be worried
because two of your family members

216
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,449
have to undergo surgery.

217
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,868
But let us do the worrying.

218
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,746
Ms. An, take good care of yourself
and get ready for the surgery.

219
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,251
Please stay by her side and pray for her.

220
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,128
I'm not worried.

221
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,297
I trust Professor Lee.

222
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,507
Please take good care of her.

223
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,134
I'll do my best.

224
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,069
Come in.

225
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,712
Dry eye syndrome?

226
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,382
It can be very annoying. Since when?

227
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,593
This year. It started this year.

228
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,222
Gosh. Jun-wan has developed presbyopia,
and Jeong-won keeps getting headaches.

229
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,432
Seok-hyeong says
he's been getting back pain.

230
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,600
How's your prostate--

231
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,144
What? Your son is getting married already?

232
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,146
He graduated from college this year.

233
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,775
My point exactly. But he wants
to get married as soon as possible,

234
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,068
-so I told him to go ahead.
-My gosh.

235
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,696
I'd rather get it done sooner
so I can relax and start enjoying my life.

236
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,241
-Are you on your way to lunch?
-Yes.

237
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,451
I won't keep you then. Go have your lunch.

238
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,162
All right, I will.
Send me the wedding invitation.

239
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,122
Of course. Enjoy your lunch.

240
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,457
Will do.

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,542
Have a good day.

242
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,419
You know her, right?

243
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,504
Who is she?

244
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,049
She owns the hair salon
in the lower lobby.

245
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,510
-I see.
-She's my hairstylist.

246
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,929
Hello! How have you been?

247
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,432
-He owns the optician's shop.
-I see.

248
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,018
-This is another new model.
-This too?

249
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,521
-That's right.
-It looks very light.

250
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,481
My gosh, it's practically weightless.

251
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,484
I love the shape. Aren't there
different colors for the bridge?

252
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,823
-Professor Lee Ik-jun!
-My gosh.

253
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,659
What? Have you fully recovered
from your disc surgery?

254
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,411
Why are you already back at work?

255
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,789
I need to earn a living.
My goodness. Anyway, bye.

256
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,292
No, don't say bye.

257
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,960
Take good care of yourself.

258
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,169
Will do.

259
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,963
Gosh, she should take it easy.

260
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,967
It's true that a side kick
can take a toll on the hamstrings.

261
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,677
Always make sure you stretch.

262
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,804
Sir!

263
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
Hey, you.

264
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,393
-Have you eaten yet?
-Yes, just now.

265
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,354
What are you planting now?

266
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,982
It's a secret.

267
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,990
-Is this for me?
-Yes.

268
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,787
What's the name of this plant?
I've seen it before.

269
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,624
I think I know what it's called.

270
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,043
We should have dinner together soon.

271
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,587
My gosh, it's been too long.

272
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,590
You're the busy one. I have lots of time.

273
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,010
My goodness. I'll call you soon.
Let's have dinner together.

274
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,637
-Sounds good.
-Have a good day.

275
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,805
Who is he?

276
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,809
The helicopter pilot.
He's our EMS helicopter pilot.

277
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,102
Right.

278
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,605
Jun-wan uses the chopper
for procurement sometimes.

279
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,898
He and Jun-wan are close,

280
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,900
and I've had dinner with them a few times.

281
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,946
How is it that you know
everyone at this hospital?

282
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,032
I've worked here longer than you have,
but you know more people.

283
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,617
Do you want to know why?

284
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,370
It's because they like me so much.

285
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,625
They think I'm so adorable.

286
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,303
Say your mantra.

287
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,182
This is all mine.

288
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,894
No one will steal my food.

289
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,024
I'm an intellectual.

290
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,572
Wait, let's add one more line to that.

291
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,410
"I can chew."

292
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,965
Enjoy your lunch, Professor.

293
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,092
Hi, Seok-min. You too.

294
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,093
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

295
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,386
Eat up.

296
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,517
Enjoy your lunch, Professor Lee.

297
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,061
You too, Yong-hyeon. Oh, you're done.

298
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,564
Yes.

299
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,565
-Later.
-See you.

300
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,320
Of course, you're friends
with the security guards too.

301
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,657
Isn't he usually at the front gate?

302
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,869
I've never seen him smile like that.

303
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,621
Right? I've never
seen him like that either.

304
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,665
What do you mean? Did something happen?

305
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,459
He always looks so serious.

306
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,919
He's the scariest
out of all the security guards.

307
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
He's so scary.

308
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,758
Yong-hyeon's not that scary.

309
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,429
A friend of mine
stopped by to see me one night.

310
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,266
My friend's car was parked
by the front gate for like five minutes.

311
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,559
No, not even five minutes.

312
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,438
But my gosh.
He had this scary look on his face.

313
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,856
He told us to move the car

314
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,900
and that we're not allowed to park there.

315
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,526
He's professional.

316
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,905
It was late at night, on a Sunday.

317
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,531
There wasn't a single car around.

318
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,327
No matter the hour or the day,
you should always follow the rules.

319
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,162
You were clearly in the wrong.

320
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,164
Okay.

321
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,042
I'll go have a word with him
for making you get an earful.

322
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,336
Hello, Auntie.

323
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,464
Yes, I can talk now.

324
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,885
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

325
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,429
I look nice and buff

326
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,933
In my red outfit

327
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,520
I smell deliciously sweet and tangy

328
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,024
-I'm a cool tomato. Tomato!
-Tomato!

329
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,277
I will become tomato juice

330
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,489
-I will become ketchup
-Is that U-ju?

331
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,868
-Yes.
-I will dance, hey!

332
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,746
-I'm a boastful tomato. Tomato!
-Auntie just sent it to me.

333
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,290
He skipped kindergarten today
because of a stomachache.

334
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,459
But he's fine now.
He's singing and dancing.

335
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,420
Hold on. Was it a lie?

336
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,631
Kids don't lie.

337
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,008
Sick or not,
they always tell it like it is.

338
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,718
I lied a lot when I was his age.

339
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,766
I really hope he only got my good traits.

340
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,019
What are you doing this weekend?

341
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,772
No plans, but I'm studying
for a conference.

342
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,732
Too bad. Forget it, then.

343
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,984
What is it?

344
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,570
I'm going camping tomorrow
and was wondering if you wanted to come.

345
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,324
My favorite campsite
is always fully booked.

346
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,952
But I checked
their website earlier just in case

347
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,704
and saw that they had a cancelation.

348
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,415
I totally lucked out.
I booked it right away.

349
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,043
We're going camping tomorrow, U-ju!

350
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,506
Really?
Auntie, I'm going camping tomorrow.

351
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,050
Are you serious, Dad?
Are we really going camping?

352
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,720
Hold on, the cicadas
haven't started molting yet.

353
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
There was an
impatient cicada who couldn't wait.

354
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,849
I got a text from the cicada just now.

355
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,562
But we have no campfire tools
or camping dishes, let alone a tent.

356
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,189
What should we do?

357
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,565
Right, we have nothing.

358
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,151
I have everything.

359
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,820
Don't worry, U-ju.
My friend has everything.

360
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,698
She's a camping expert.
She has everything.

361
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,117
What do you want to do
the most when we go camping?

362
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,996
-What did he say?
-A campfire.

363
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,999
Sit by the fire and relax.

364
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,796
-He sure is your son.
-I know.

365
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,805
MOUNT YEONIN CAMPGROUND
B-104

366
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,307
This is harder than I thought.

367
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,985
Move aside, will you?

368
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,634
Jeez. You don't understand
the beauty of analog tools.

369
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,177
We don't have time for that.

370
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,471
Let's get this going so we can relax.

371
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,849
Don't you know that
weekends always go by so quickly?

372
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,964
All right.

373
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,764
Hey.

374
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,809
-Your mantra.
-Don't even bring it up!

375
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,936
I can do whatever I want on the weekend.

376
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,399
You seem to get angry easily these days.

377
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,699
U-ju, are you sure
you don't want any noodles?

378
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,410
Just leave him be.
He has a lot on his mind right now.

379
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,954
Did something happen?

380
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,415
He and Mo-ne had a fight last night.

381
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,586
They might break up.

382
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,048
Oh, boy.

383
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,851
Are you taking your vitamins?

384
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,936
You're probably running low.

385
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,897
I'll order yours when I'm ordering mine.

386
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,190
Don't bother.

387
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,818
You can take all the vitamins
and live a long life.

388
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,695
That's not why I take them.

389
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,822
I just want to stay healthy
and not fall ill.

390
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,409
That way, I can avoid
being a burden to my kids.

391
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,913
I'm just going to move
into a retirement home.

392
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,040
They won't accept you
if you're not healthy.

393
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,626
Can't you walk faster?

394
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,170
Slow walking doesn't count as exercise.

395
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,089
I'm not doing this for exercise.

396
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,632
Then why are you doing it?

397
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,550
Because you wanted to go out for a walk.

398
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,722
By the way, why do you walk
with such short, quick steps these days?

399
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,725
Me? When?

400
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,979
I've been noticing it as of late.
You wobble like this.

401
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,607
I'm worried you'd trip and fall.

402
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,445
I'm being lectured on how to walk properly
when I'm over 70?

403
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,031
Worry about yourself, not me.

404
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,584
Is this Ms. Jeong Rosa's youngest son?

405
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,420
Aren't you busy with your girlfriend?

406
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,382
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your call?

407
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:49,427
Mom, what are you talking about?
So-yun's wedding is today.

408
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,307
Where are you? We were supposed
to meet at the venue, in the lobby.

409
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,810
Don't tell me you forgot.

410
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,813
I even texted you yesterday
to remind you. My gosh.

411
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,898
Oh, no. I totally forgot.

412
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,276
I'll leave now. When does it start?

413
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,569
What time does it start?

414
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,738
You won't make it on time
if you leave Yangpyeong now.

415
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,032
Don't stress yourself out. Just stay home.

416
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,368
I'll explain the situation
to Auntie, okay?

417
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,414
I can't believe you completely forgot
about the wedding, Mom.

418
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,124
Gosh.

419
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,042
What is wrong with me?

420
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,921
I wrote it down on my calendar
and even talked to your aunt.

421
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,090
I can't believe
I completely forgot about it.

422
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,634
Seriously, what is wrong with me?

423
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,054
Don't worry. It's okay, Mom.

424
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,056
I forget things too, you know.

425
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,852
It's not a big deal, Mom.

426
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,438
Don't overthink.
It's nothing to worry about, okay?

427
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,900
Are you with Mr. Ju now? Are you outside?

428
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,485
Yes, we're taking a walk.

429
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,070
I see. That's good.

430
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,615
Have a good walk and enjoy your dinner.

431
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,699
Thanks.

432
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,954
My gosh,
it's really nothing to worry about.

433
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,332
Who isn't forgetful at your age?

434
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,666
Everyone's like that.

435
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,045
Don't worry. Just enjoy your walk, okay?

436
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,379
Bye.

437
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,135
What is wrong with me?
I'm so absentminded these days.

438
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,647
Did you have a wedding to attend?

439
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,484
Yes, my youngest niece's wedding.

440
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,736
She's my favorite niece.

441
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,158
She wanted a small wedding
with only her family and close relatives.

442
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,494
She even bought me a dress.

443
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,746
I can't believe I let it slip my mind.

444
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,251
Should I go see a doctor?

445
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:52,425
I had dinner twice yesterday.

446
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,470
When I was having coffee with Mr. Kettle

447
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,014
after our dinner at the cafeteria,

448
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,934
I got a call from our legal advisor.

449
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,853
He said, "I'm in the cafeteria.
Where are you?"

450
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,985
We grew up together in the same town,

451
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,946
so we meet up for meals often.
And turns out,

452
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,907
I ran into him on my way to work yesterday

453
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,077
and told him we'd have
dinner together that evening.

454
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,165
But I forgot all about it
in less than 12 hours.

455
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,047
Here.

456
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,968
It's okay.

457
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,013
It happens to everyone,
so don't worry too much.

458
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:39,931
All right.

459
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,560
Six, three.

460
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,646
Six, three.

461
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,731
Eighteen.

462
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,858
I meant the 63 Building.

463
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,821
I tricked you. Do you realize
that "18" sounds like a swear word?

464
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,824
What's with you, seriously?

465
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,660
-Hey!
-My goodness, everyone will hear you.

466
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,121
-Gosh, seriously.
-I can't believe you swore at me.

467
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,378
MOM

468
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,382
Hi, Mom.

469
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,134
I'm at the hospital.

470
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,721
I have a complicated operation
booked next week,

471
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,264
so I'm here to study.

472
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,688
Yes, I'm having lunch now.

473
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,818
Right, I'm on my second bowl.

474
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,946
You have a good lunch too, Mom.

475
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,866
Well…

476
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,662
I can only say one thing?

477
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,122
Yes, just one thing.

478
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,167
What's the one thing
you'd choose for your last supper?

479
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,926
Is that so difficult?

480
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,809
Grilled tripe.

481
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,352
Oh, tripe.

482
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,478
Sirloin steak.

483
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,483
Ox knee bone soup.

484
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,944
Actually, no. Grilled sliced brisket?

485
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,491
Grilled skirt steak!

486
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,661
Why don't you just eat a whole cow?

487
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,747
Does that count as "one thing"?

488
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,918
Does it?

489
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,881
Then I want a whole cow.

490
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,475
Professor Yang!

491
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,977
Hello, Professor.

492
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,603
-Hello.
-Hi.

493
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,648
I guess you're on duty today.

494
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,984
Yes, the three of us are on duty today.

495
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,945
Hold on.

496
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,657
How did you know I'm on duty tonight?

497
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,827
You told me, just now.

498
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,288
Right.

499
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,541
-Dr. Chu is the funniest person I know.
-What?

500
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,793
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,713
Why are you sorry? It's a compliment.

502
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,966
Professor, have you eaten yet?
Please join us for lunch.

503
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,760
Sure, let's go.

504
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,844
Okay.

505
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,056
I wonder what's on the menu today.

506
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,933
-Dumpling soup, probably.
-What?

507
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:29,934
I want seaweed soup.

508
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,645
They probably have dumpling soup
and kimchi fried rice.

509
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,440
I mean, that's what I saw
in my dream last night.

510
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,649
I see.

511
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,151
Yes.

512
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,153
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

513
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,989
PROFESSOR AHN JEONG-WON

514
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
Is the wedding over?

515
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,746
Yes, it ended just now.

516
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,582
I'm going to grab a drink
with my cousins and catch up.

517
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,666
Did you have dinner?

518
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,669
I feel like you're always
working the night shift.

519
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,924
I know. I feel the same way.

520
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,717
I haven't had dinner yet.

521
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,261
I wonder if the cafeteria is still open.

522
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,596
No, of course not.

523
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,101
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

524
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,148
But I'm on duty.

525
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,695
Here.

526
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,405
You should have some too.

527
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,491
I ate at the wedding. You go ahead.

528
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,327
-Thank you.
-No problem.

529
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,378
Eat slowly.

530
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,839
Don't worry
if you can't finish everything.

531
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,965
I totally can.

532
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,181
You didn't forget about
next Sunday, right?

533
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,101
Five o'clock at the cathedral.

534
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,310
Yes.

535
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,192
But you know,
I can't keep lying to everyone.

536
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,112
All the professors keep grilling me.

537
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,948
"How's your boyfriend?

538
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,576
What does he do?
When are you guys getting married?"

539
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,830
I'm not a good liar.

540
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,874
Maybe…

541
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,003
I should just tell them we broke up.

542
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,549
That'd be easier.

543
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,135
They'll at least
stop grilling me, you know?

544
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,137
Well…

545
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,848
I don't know how I feel about that.

546
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,061
I mean, that's also lying.

547
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,730
It's a white lie.

548
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,194
Well…

549
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,742
Why don't we talk about it
when I see you next Sunday?

550
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,995
That sounds good. I'm fine with anything.

551
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,454
-Eat up.
-Okay.

552
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,586
Do you like it?

553
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,671
Yes, it's good.

554
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,215
Clearly.

555
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,346
Sorry. I'm boring.

556
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,765
What? You're the funniest person I know.

557
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,266
-Really?
-Yes.

558
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,064
I forgot to get groceries.

559
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,485
I'm hungry.

560
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,999
My mom suddenly developed insomnia.

561
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,253
She's been taking sleeping pills,
which she never used to do.

562
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,049
But she still dislikes
going to the hospital.

563
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,384
I keep telling her to go,
but she just won't.

564
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,969
My mom's the opposite.

565
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,305
She's a bit of a hypochondriac.

566
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,768
She currently goes to
ten different clinics in her area.

567
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,396
The other day, she complained
about her frequent headaches

568
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,732
and said she wanted
to get a brain CT scan done.

569
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,901
You can do that for her.

570
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,404
She's also worried about her leg cramps
and the heaviness in her calves.

571
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,074
And she thinks her heart
is beating faster than normal.

572
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,034
Her vision's blurry and she can't digest.

573
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,203
Then she can't be alive now.

574
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,332
Right? My point exactly.

575
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,254
What can I do though?

576
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,299
I booked an appointment
for her with a neurologist.

577
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:59,889
I think what she needs now
is reassurance, not a diagnosis.

578
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,317
What? You're working on another paper?

579
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,113
Yes. This one
will be published in the SCI, for sure.

580
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,697
What's it about?

581
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,494
"Why do I get so irritated
whenever my mom asks me about work?"

582
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,622
What? My goodness.

583
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,502
Do you get like that too? So do I.

584
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,003
Isn't it fascinating?

585
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,215
Whenever my mom asks me about work,

586
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,593
I get all annoyed
and don't even want to answer.

587
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,929
So I try to get off the phone quickly.

588
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,473
But when I get off the phone,

589
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,893
-I'm overwhelmed with guilt and regret.
-Right.

590
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,979
So I'd call her again,

591
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,772
then she'd ask me about work again.

592
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,024
Then I get annoyed again…

593
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,157
Cho Jung-hyun.

594
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,451
Right, Cho Jung-hyun.

595
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,745
It was my nickname back in school.

596
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:12,336
You practiced "Sad Sea" with your guitar
all through our freshman year.

597
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,341
Why did you want to play
a piano song with the guitar?

598
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,345
You have such a good memory.
How do you remember that?

599
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,894
Shall we listen to "Sad Sea"?
I brought my Bluetooth speaker.

600
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,937
-No.
-Why not?

601
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,857
It's bad manners to play music
on a campground.

602
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,194
Then what do we do?

603
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,070
We'll listen to it another time.

604
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,072
And it's time.

605
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,490
Time for what?

606
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,786
Sleep. I'm about to fall asleep.

607
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,164
Hey, it's still early.
Why are you already sleepy?

608
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,249
My gosh, it's past 1 a.m.

609
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,293
Mr. Cho Jung-hyun.

610
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:56,923
All right.

611
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,228
Good night, Ms. Chae Song-hwa.

612
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,286
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

613
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:23,134
What's that white stuff under your eyes?
It looks like a pile of snow.

614
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,845
I accentuated my under-eye fat
with makeup to look younger.

615
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,265
Min-ha, you already look so young.

616
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,434
You don't look like
you're in your mid-thirties.

617
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,727
Really?

618
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,354
You know that I can't lie.

619
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,606
Right, I sure do.

620
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,609
You always tell the truth.

621
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,572
Hey, are you here?

622
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,574
I see. There's a café on the second floor.

623
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,951
Wait there.
I'll be there in a minute. All right.

624
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,748
My brother came to see me because
we haven't seen each other in a while.

625
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,291
I'll go buy him a coffee.

626
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,631
Come on.
How can you not see her at least once?

627
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,216
Aren't you curious?

628
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,844
I am.

629
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,805
But I don't want to
since it will make her uncomfortable.

630
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,557
So I didn't even bring it up.

631
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,850
Did you see her face?

632
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,770
Of course, we even had a quick chat.

633
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,813
She's pretty, very pretty.

634
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:23,277
When will my son
bring home a new girlfriend?

635
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,656
Like you said, I'm going to
completely stay out of it this time.

636
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,159
I'll be okay whoever he brings.

637
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,039
My gosh, sorry. I'm sorry.

638
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,749
Excuse me.

639
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,876
Hey, don't.

640
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,545
You hit me, so you owe me an apology.

641
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,964
How can you be so rude?

642
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,217
My apologies, ma'am.

643
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,429
But I did apologize earlier.

644
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,181
You call that an apology?

645
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,475
Just saying "sorry" doesn't cut it.

646
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,645
It's too easy to say
you're sorry, isn't it?

647
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,692
Granny, do I know you?

648
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,072
Why are you talking so casually to me?

649
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,909
Go. Your coffee will get cold.

650
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,495
Go to the restroom and wipe it off.

651
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,205
It's all over your face.

652
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,041
Why can't I drop the honorifics

653
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,168
when you're probably younger than my son?

654
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,212
And how dare you call me "Granny"?

655
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,589
-Hey, let's go.
-My goodness.

656
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,049
Let's go to the restroom.

657
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,344
Just get going. I'll calm her down.

658
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,682
Where do you think you're going?

659
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,309
I'm not done talking. Goodness gracious.

660
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,229
Must you do this
knowing your son works here?

661
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,605
Everyone's staring at you.

662
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,403
Let's just go to the restroom quietly.
Come with me.

663
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,654
Okay, fine.

664
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,830
Rosa. What if Seok-hyeong
brings home a girl like her?

665
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,915
This is why I can't help but get involved.

666
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,126
What if my son ends up
with a brat like her?

667
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,253
You said you'd be okay
with whoever he dates.

668
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,630
I don't care who it is. Anyone will do.

669
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,840
Except for her.

670
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,928
Rosa, did you see her eye makeup?

671
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,889
What's with the white stuff
under her eyes?

672
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,185
My gosh, what kind
of makeup is that… What?

673
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,687
Quit that habit of talking casually
to anyone you see.

674
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,606
Is that important now?

675
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,733
If that's not important, what is?

676
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,110
It wasn't intentional,

677
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,363
and she apologized right away.
Why must you be so mean?

678
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,658
Does she have to get on her knees
for ruining your lipstick?

679
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,246
Yeong-hye. Stop making
so much fuss about it. Okay?

680
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,499
Okay?

681
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,250
Fine.

682
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,379
You know that I always listen to you.

683
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,590
Let's go. We'll get caught in traffic.

684
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,219
We're going to have
noodles at your place, right?

685
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,888
With the anchovy broth and the sauce.

686
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,849
Are Mr. Kettle and Mr. Ju joining us?

687
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,976
Yes, Mr. Kettle will join us later.

688
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,145
Jong-su went to bring his car. Let's go.

689
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,525
-Gosh.
-You troublemaker.

690
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,615
Ms. Song, Choi Myeong-hui's
abdominal X-ray doesn't look good.

691
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,492
Did we not ambulate the patient?

692
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,245
It's still too painful.

693
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,997
I kept explaining
the importance of moving around,

694
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,916
but the patient won't even budge.

695
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,084
Excuse me.

696
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,878
Who was the nurse earlier?

697
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,549
Who drew blood from my sister?

698
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,133
What's the matter, sir?

699
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,844
My sister now has
another bruise on her arm.

700
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:40,224
Do you know how many bruises she has now?
It happens every time you draw blood.

701
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,144
And why haven't you changed
the IV bags yet? I asked you a while ago.

702
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,438
How can I trust this hospital

703
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,567
if something like this keeps happening?

704
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,153
Her body is swollen
due to the reduced liver function.

705
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,448
We can barely see her veins,

706
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,993
so it's not easy to draw blood from her.

707
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,788
And we've been checking on her
as often as we can.

708
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,833
The IV bag wasn't empty
when we checked in on her just now.

709
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,294
It was less than three minutes ago.

710
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,214
My father has a bruise too.

711
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,010
But I guess you'll give the same excuse
and say his veins were to blame.

712
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,013
Look.

713
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,724
It's fine.

714
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,434
I understand,

715
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:28,939
but can you please send
an experienced nurse to draw blood?

716
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,107
Please.

717
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,901
Sir, all the nurses here
are experienced enough to--

718
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,947
Okay, we'll make sure.

719
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,533
-Thank you.
-No problem.

720
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,496
He's so harsh.

721
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,669
How are you feeling, Ms. An?

722
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,755
I feel good.

723
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,217
I'll be fine for the surgery.

724
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,429
-I got this.
-Yes, you can do it.

725
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,891
I just saw your father as well.

726
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,269
Everything looks good,
and he's doing great.

727
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,562
So it's just on me now.

728
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,982
Please take good care of them, Doctor.

729
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,695
Two of my family members
will undergo surgery at the same time.

730
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,990
I still can't believe this is happening.

731
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,409
If anything bad happens to them…

732
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,578
I won't be able to live.

733
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:30,376
Please take good care of
my daughter and my husband.

734
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,671
I'm counting on you, Doctor.

735
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,672
Yes.

736
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,091
I'll do my very best.

737
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,221
Professor Lee.

738
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,935
Why are you here? You weren't in the room.

739
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,437
I stepped out to get some fresh air.

740
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,647
I see.

741
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:53,899
Professor Lee.

742
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,610
You know that we went to every hospital

743
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,823
before coming to you
and even canceled the surgery at Kangwoon.

744
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,533
Right, I'm aware.

745
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,620
My friend recommended
a specialist at Jae-an Medical Center,

746
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,789
but we chose Yulje because of you.

747
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,669
This surgery must go well, no matter what.

748
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,297
Make sure you go to bed
early today, and don't drink.

749
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,466
Okay, I'll make sure.

750
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,845
Two people's lives depend on this.

751
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,597
The surgery must go well,

752
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,433
and I trust that it will.

753
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,687
Professor Lee.

754
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,024
You got this.

755
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,864
Thank you. You should go back to
the room so your mother can get some rest.

756
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,491
Okay, I will.

757
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,545
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

758
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,638
-Is the stapler ready?
-Yes.

759
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,057
Forceps.

760
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,741
Metzenbaum scissors.

761
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,576
METZENBAUM SCISSORS: SURGICAL SCISSORS

762
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,256
We'll remove the liver now.

763
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,975
How's it going with the recipient?

764
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,393
I'll go check.

765
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,327
We'll remove the specimen now.

766
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,120
SPECIMEN: SAMPLE OR ORGAN
FOR TESTING BEFORE TRANSPLANT

767
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,843
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

768
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,434
ELAPSED TIME

769
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,984
Can I have Floseal?

770
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,402
FLOSEAL: AN HEMOSTATIC AGENT

771
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,370
The liver is swollen,
so we can't close up the abdomen.

772
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,289
Should we do a delayed closure?

773
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,541
Transplant patients
are vulnerable to infection,

774
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,961
-so I want to close it up now if possible.
-Yes, that would be better.

775
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,131
But the liver looks good,
and I think the surgery went well.

776
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,675
How's the urine output?

777
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,843
It looks good.

778
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,720
Let's try to avoid another transfusion.

779
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,763
Keep the fluid to a minimum.

780
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,849
We should drain it with some diuretics.

781
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:14,975
Got it.

782
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,771
The swelling usually goes down
after reperfusion,

783
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,857
so let's try again in an hour or two.

784
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,858
Sure.

785
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:27,738
OPERATING UNIT

786
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,740
The adhesion was as severe as expected,

787
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,491
so the surgery was quite difficult.

788
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,578
It's all done though.
We just have to close her up now.

789
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,788
We can't do it right now
because the liver is quite big

790
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,458
and her organs are swollen at the moment.

791
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,586
But the risk of infection
will be higher if we leave it open.

792
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:46,506
It'd be safer to close it up, so we're
waiting for the swelling to go down.

793
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,801
In any case, we have to wait
to close up her abdomen.

794
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,430
If the swelling doesn't seem to go down,

795
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,058
we may have to wait
until tomorrow to close her up.

796
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,810
The surgery went well though, right?

797
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,188
Will my daughter live?

798
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,231
Yes, the surgery went well.

799
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:07,861
We did an ultrasound to check the vessels,
and the connections seemed fine.

800
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,032
Thank you, Doctor.

801
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,037
But if you can't close her up…
Isn't it a big deal?

802
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,247
Are you sure the surgery didn't go wrong?

803
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,792
Nothing went wrong with the surgery.

804
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,294
But intraoperative blood loss, IV fluids,

805
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,547
and blood transfusions
can cause swelling in the organs.

806
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,925
Most patients
who receive a liver transplant

807
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,135
have more space
in the abdomen due to ascites.

808
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,055
But in Ms. An's case,
the liver is pretty big for her,

809
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,849
and her condition declined
before fluid could even build up,

810
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,851
so there isn't much space.

811
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,396
We gave her some diuretics,

812
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,357
so I think we should be able
to close her up in about two hours.

813
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,778
We can use the surgical mesh
to move her to the ICU

814
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,865
and move her back to the OR once
the swelling goes down to close her up.

815
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,825
But I think…

816
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,495
It'll take some time,

817
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,207
but it'd be better to keep her in the OR
until we can close her up.

818
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,962
Because of the immunosuppressants,
there's a higher risk of infection.

819
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,923
I see, okay.

820
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,967
All right, then.

821
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,679
OPERATING UNIT

822
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,191
-More warm saline, please.
-Sure.

823
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,475
Will it work?

824
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,145
We're not quite there yet,
but the urine output is good.

825
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,689
Can we give her more diuretics?

826
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,357
Sure.

827
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,986
Pushing ahead with it now
could result in compartment syndrome,

828
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,197
so we should wait.

829
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,782
Let's wait another two hours.

830
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,116
-Okay.
-Sure.

831
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,801
Much better.

832
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,928
Let's close it up now.

833
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,179
Okay.

834
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,557
Kelly forceps.

835
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,394
The urine output looks great,
and her vitals are stable.

836
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,729
Great, thank you.

837
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:52,484
You've been here for hours.
You must be exhausted now.

838
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,110
Thank you for waiting.

839
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,946
No problem.

840
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,330
Suture.

841
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,797
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

842
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,846
119 RESCUE SERVICES

843
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,112
Abrupt change in mental status.
Stupor, when discovered.

844
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,489
BP is 160 over 90,
and her heart rate is 60.

845
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,700
BS is 112,
which is within the normal range.

846
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,160
Her mental status
declined further on our way here,

847
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,204
so we secured an airway
and gave her oxygen.

848
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,666
Did she have a seizure?

849
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,042
As soon as we arrived here.

850
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,419
I see, thank you. Let's go.

851
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,545
Okay.

852
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,142
-Get the defibrillator ready.
-Okay.

853
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,067
Give Gu Se-hyeon an IV
and collect a blood sample.

854
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,402
Okay, got it.

855
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,115
How does the CT scan look?

856
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,826
Not good. It'll be a brain death case.

857
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,579
Call Neurosurgery now.

858
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,663
Okay.

859
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,041
Is the guardian outside?

860
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,418
Yes, a co-worker.

861
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,170
What about her family?

862
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,923
No, the co-worker doesn't know
her family's contact info.

863
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,174
Goodness.

864
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,054
Professor, we have an SAH patient.

865
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,640
But she's in a coma now
with no spontaneous breathing.

866
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,018
The pupils are fully dilated,
and she's exhibiting zero motor function.

867
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,103
She's also had a momentary cardiac arrest.

868
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,689
-What should we do?
-I'll come and have a look.

869
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,650
Okay.

870
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,991
As for surgical indications…
I don't think it'll work.

871
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,078
She wants to donate her organs?

872
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,538
Yes, I saw the sticker on her ID card.

873
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,752
How did you explain the situation
to her guardian? Where is her guardian?

874
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,297
Her co-worker is here,
but that person isn't her family.

875
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,132
Where's her family?

876
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,886
We're looking through her phone
to find her family's contact info.

877
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,642
Let's call the coordinator first.

878
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,726
Okay.

879
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,730
One of our patients
in the ER seems to be brain-dead.

880
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,692
We found the organ donation sticker
on her ID card.

881
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,026
Can you please look her up?

882
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,155
Sure, no problem. What's her name
and resident registration number?

883
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,449
Her name is…

884
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,204
-Yes.
-We found the patient in our system.

885
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:55,959
I've confirmed on KONOS
that she wants to donate all her organs.

886
00:54:56,042 --> 00:55:00,171
We're trying to find her family
with the help of KODA and the police.

887
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,464
We'll hear from them soon.

888
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,674
Okay, thank you.

889
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,932
I have to go check in on Sun Du-ho.

890
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,310
Isn't he Dr. Jong Se-hyeok's patient?

891
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,647
He was hospitalized this morning
because of a ruptured disc.

892
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,359
I'm going to
take care of his patients for a month.

893
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,194
Professor Kwon's patients.

894
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,281
My gosh. Then you'll be swamped.

895
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,657
It's all right.

896
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,620
She's full of energy.

897
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,788
I know, right?

898
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,958
We have the results
from the PET scan you did yesterday.

899
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,964
The cancer hasn't spread.

900
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,675
Thank goodness.

901
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,718
Thank you.

902
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,390
Just like the CT and the bone scans,
the PET scan shows

903
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,975
that the cancer hasn't spread.

904
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,854
If it's very small,
it may not show up on the PET scan,

905
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,066
but based on the test results,
I don't think it's likely.

906
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,984
And the tumor isn't big,

907
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,237
so if you undergo surgery as planned
and follow up with the treatment,

908
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,989
the results will be good.

909
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,240
I see.

910
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,743
It must have been stressful
to get all those tests done.

911
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:16,956
One more thing.
Dr. Jong Se-hyeok has a ruptured disc,

912
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,250
so I'll be looking
after you from today on.

913
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,545
But your surgery will be performed
by Professor Kwon as planned.

914
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,048
You're like our lucky charm.

915
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:30,053
You're a lucky charm to our family.

916
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,889
-Dad.
-Yes.

917
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,766
This is a good sign.

918
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,020
Don't you think
she exudes positive energy?

919
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,648
She's right, honey.
Now that we've met this doctor,

920
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,234
I know your surgery will go well for sure.

921
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,653
So don't worry about a thing.

922
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,987
-Okay?
-All right.

923
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,365
I'll see you later.

924
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,575
Wait, Doctor.

925
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,912
You'll be assisting in the surgery, right?

926
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,248
You have to.

927
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,668
We need you there
for my dad's surgery to go well.

928
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,754
Yes, I'll be there. Don't worry.

929
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,923
Thank you.

930
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,179
Dr. Jang, aren't you hungry?
Shall we go to the convenience store?

931
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,264
Hold on…

932
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,394
He's the patient's brother, right?

933
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,315
What does he want now?

934
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,734
I'm scared.

935
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,283
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

936
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,078
We had no idea
her family member was so close by.

937
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,789
It took a while for us to find you.

938
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,002
She had a type of stroke called SAH.

939
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,797
There's a bleed in the space between
the brain and its surrounding membrane.

940
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,260
She arrived at our ER unconscious.

941
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,597
Then she had a cardiac arrest
when the bleeding started again,

942
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,099
so our ER staff performed CPR.

943
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,810
We took a CT scan after that,

944
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,146
and her brain is severely damaged.

945
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,773
She's in a coma at the moment.

946
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,152
Our assessment detected

947
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,530
no spontaneous breathing,
and her pupils are not responsive,

948
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,450
so we are suspecting brain death.

949
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,332
Once diagnosed, most brain-dead patients
pass away within two weeks.

950
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,758
We're making sure
her vitals are maintained,

951
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,470
so take some time to think about it

952
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,639
and let us know your decision.

953
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:42,477
Our coordinator here
will go over the details with you.

954
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,290
You must be devastated and shocked.

955
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,710
I'm really sorry
to have to bring this up to you now.

956
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,339
We've confirmed
her wishes to donate her organs,

957
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:16,469
but without
the consent of her next of kin,

958
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,513
it can't be done.

959
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,182
Medically speaking,

960
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,060
her condition isn't treatable at all.

961
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,312
I'm sorry.

962
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,607
I'm really sorry,

963
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,735
but if you decide to donate her organs,

964
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:37,740
the lives of many people suffering
from various diseases will be saved.

965
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,577
This must be a difficult decision,

966
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,496
but please consider it.

967
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,251
I need some time

968
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,461
to think.

969
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,256
Is that okay?

970
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,009
Yes, of course.

971
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,186
What's the song for this week?

972
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,566
Darn it. It's a love song.

973
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,986
What are you doing this Sunday?

974
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,073
Why? Are you going
to hang out with me this Sunday?

975
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,494
No, I have prior engagements.

976
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,789
If you're staying home again--

977
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,957
Then what?

978
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,792
Can you get some groceries?

979
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,714
I'll do it if you don't want to.

980
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,592
I've got plans. A school reunion.

981
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,970
What's the song for this week?

982
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,973
Nice, a love song.

983
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,224
Damn it.

984
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,518
Is the reunion this Sunday?

985
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,437
Yes, let's take your car. Pick me up.

986
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,355
Sure.

987
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,731
FORMERLY MICKY, NOW IK-SUN

988
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,734
Hey.

989
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:59,280
Who called him
that he burst out of the room like that?

990
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,700
I took a quick glance.

991
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,453
It looked like a Japanese name.

992
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,038
What?

993
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,040
Something like "Fumiko-san."

994
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,837
What?

995
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,798
Have you arrived?

996
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,300
Yes, earlier. I'm having ramyeon
with U-ju now.

997
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,760
When does the training start?

998
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,137
Next week. Monday to Wednesday
in Yangjae-dong.

999
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,723
I can't hang out with you.

1000
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,809
I have my band practice
and a school reunion.

1001
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:31,354
What? Why would I hang out
with you? Don't be ridiculous.

1002
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,858
You'd better not
teach U-ju anything weird.

1003
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,696
What are you talking about?
We're reading a book together now.

1004
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,574
Auntie Ik-sun, I did it!
I touched my nose with my tongue just now.

1005
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,746
Hello? Hey. This little…

1006
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,458
Jeez, how did he do it?

1007
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:14,272
It looks like Choi Jeong-bae
needs a tracheostomy.

1008
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,023
Call PM for help, Seong-yeong.

1009
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,901
Okay. Professor, by the way…

1010
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,237
He still hasn't made his decision yet.

1011
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,740
The security guard?

1012
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,659
Yes, he's still undecided.

1013
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,955
But her vitals keep dropping.

1014
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:35,209
Gosh, I had a feeling
he'd mull over it for a while.

1015
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,669
Keep it to yourself.

1016
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,046
I'm sorry.

1017
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,841
I'm sure he has his reasons.

1018
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,135
What do we even know?

1019
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,304
I'm sorry.

1020
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,182
He actually asked
to meet with me just now.

1021
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,934
I'll try to talk to him again.

1022
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:57,231
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

1023
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,401
but her vitals keep dropping.

1024
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,237
If they continue to drop,

1025
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,616
you may not be able to
donate her organs even if you want to

1026
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,327
because her organs will be damaged.

1027
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,788
I'm really sorry,

1028
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,583
but if you can decide soon,

1029
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:19,754
it'll be tremendously helpful
for the recipients.

1030
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,132
I've…

1031
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,761
made my decision.

1032
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,519
Hey.

1033
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,897
Professor, he's decided
to donate her organs.

1034
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,816
I'm glad.

1035
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,861
There's a bit of a story though.
I was wrong about him.

1036
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,280
"Story"?

1037
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,807
I met her again after 30 years.

1038
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,355
I heard she's lived alone
since divorcing my father

1039
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,483
when I was four.

1040
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:26,988
My distant relative told me.

1041
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,785
I didn't even remember my mother's face,

1042
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,955
and I had

1043
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,458
no memories of calling her "Mom."

1044
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,254
But suddenly, I became her guardian

1045
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:48,676
and was told to decide whether or not
I wanted to donate her organs.

1046
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,554
This situation itself…

1047
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,516
I was confused.

1048
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,437
And it's not easy for me to accept

1049
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,231
that I have such a right.

1050
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,319
That's why it took me
a while to make up my mind.

1051
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:14,285
But I've decided to think
that it's my mother's final gift to me.

1052
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:22,251
She probably wanted to
give me a chance to do good deeds

1053
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:28,257
and play my role
as her son for one last time.

1054
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,761
That's what I believe.

1055
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,475
Professor Lee.

1056
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,021
I made the right decision, right?

1057
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,608
Her organs

1058
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,903
will save many lives, right?

1059
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,404
Yes.

1060
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,784
She'll save many lives.

1061
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,995
You're giving them the gift of life.

1062
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,538
You made the right decision.

1063
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,319
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1064
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:37,368
So she wants her baby
to get a VAD at our hospital?

1065
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,245
Yes, I think so.

1066
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,080
The baby is at Jae-an Medical Center.

1067
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,000
It was a preterm birth at Week 33.
The baby's weight was 1.8kg.

1068
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,085
But the baby underwent
the arterial switch operation

1069
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,670
for TGA three weeks after birth.

1070
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,296
Did you see the chart?

1071
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,174
Yes, but the baby is still dependent
on heart-lung support,

1072
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,551
so they're using the ECMO.

1073
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:56,762
Both ventricles aren't functioning well.
The baby also has Grade 3 IVH.

1074
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,889
Yes, that's right.

1075
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:04,145
And the doctors
at Jae-an Medical Center suggested a VAD?

1076
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,066
The baby weighs 2.5kg.

1077
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,657
-Let her in.
-Okay.

1078
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,870
I'm aware that
this is a discourteous thing to do,

1079
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,290
but I can't afford
to worry about that right now.

1080
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,833
I apologize, Professor Kim.

1081
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,087
It's okay. I understand
that you want a second opinion.

1082
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,215
My baby underwent
the arterial switch operation

1083
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,260
for a condition called TGA,
transposition of the great arteries,

1084
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,304
and also has
an intraventricular hemorrhage.

1085
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,724
The doctors at
Jae-an Medical Center suggested the VAD

1086
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,809
after long, careful consideration,

1087
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,728
and I want to do it too.

1088
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:55,863
-Hello.
-Hello.

1089
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:56,781
Hi!

1090
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,574
Rice cakes?

1091
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,409
Is it someone's birthday?

1092
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,620
Who brought these?

1093
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,747
Patient An Seong-ju's brother.

1094
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:06,707
Really?

1095
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:10,836
Yes, he stopped by with rice cakes
and beverages for everyone.

1096
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,046
I see.

1097
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:16,050
He apologized and said
he must have been out of his mind.

1098
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,760
He apologized to all of us.

1099
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:20,179
He even brought
a handwritten letter for Ms. Song.

1100
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,473
My gosh, he didn't have to.

1101
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:25,559
I have to say, I resented him.

1102
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,896
He doesn't know what it's like for us.

1103
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,398
I thought he was so unreasonable.

1104
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:36,946
Yun-bok.

1105
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,030
Yes?

1106
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,243
This was their third hospital.

1107
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:47,331
The fact that they brought her here
shows how desperate they were.

1108
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,459
Right.

1109
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,629
It's something we see every day,

1110
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:58,384
but it's one of the most important
and dramatic moments in their lives.

1111
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,928
And that's when they cross paths with us.

1112
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,847
I'd be the same way.

1113
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,559
My sister is ill, but I can't be
her donor because I have hepatitis B.

1114
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:10,187
So my father, who's over 60,
has to undergo surgery now.

1115
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,106
I'd be on edge too.

1116
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,110
And I'm sure he knows

1117
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:18,529
how he came across.

1118
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,284
But I bet
it's not important to him at all.

1119
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,704
His family's lives
depended on the surgery.

1120
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:30,249
Why would he care
about what others think of him?

1121
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:35,045
Don't ever assume
that the patients and their families

1122
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,632
would be unaware of such things.
They know everything.

1123
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,844
And if we were ever
in a situation like that,

1124
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,388
we'd be the same way.

1125
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,141
So try to understand them.

1126
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,643
Do your best to understand them, okay?

1127
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,105
That's it for today's lecture.

1128
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,820
Gosh, why am I
so chatty these days? I go on and on.

1129
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,488
Me and my mouth.

1130
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,620
I'm sorry,

1131
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,331
Professor.

1132
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,500
What?

1133
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,056
I've been in the same situation.

1134
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,938
I went to see the doctors
every day to yell at them.

1135
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:39,443
Then I begged them in tears
to please save my mom.

1136
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,114
But now that I get to wear scrubs…

1137
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,707
I can't believe I forgot all about it.

1138
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,054
I'm sorry.

1139
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,851
I'm really sorry.

1140
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,496
What do you think?

1141
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,750
The VAD procedure
will be safe for my baby, right?

1142
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:38,877
Right, Professor Kim?

1143
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,424
If you want my opinion…

1144
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,759
My answer is no.

1145
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:53,892
Well…

1146
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,484
Ma'am.

1147
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,946
I don't want to disappoint you,

1148
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:11,410
but your baby isn't
an ideal candidate for a heart transplant.

1149
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:17,583
The VAD is a device that works as a bridge
while you wait for a heart transplant.

1150
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:21,920
But your baby only weighs 2.5kg.
It's not impossible,

1151
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,131
but your baby is too small for the VAD.

1152
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:28,927
That also means it'll take a long time
for your baby to find the right donor.

1153
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,682
And with the intraventricular hemorrhage,
it'll be too much for the baby.

1154
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,602
On top of that,
hypoxic encephalopathy is also suspected,

1155
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:40,773
so putting the baby through all this
just to try for a transplant…

1156
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:42,691
I'm skeptical.

1157
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,070
As you probably know already,

1158
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,655
strong anticoagulants are used
after the VAD procedure.

1159
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,240
But with grade 3 IVH,

1160
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,619
it's practically impossible
to use any anticoagulants.

1161
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,497
It'd be considered a contraindication.

1162
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:02,086
And it says that
hypoxic encephalopathy is suspected,

1163
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:05,464
and that's also
not ideal for a heart transplant.

1164
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,343
Even if we give up on the transplant,

1165
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,888
can we at least try the VAD?

1166
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,643
The VAD is pointless

1167
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,687
if a heart transplant isn't possible.

1168
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,566
Ma'am.

1169
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,780
You've done a lot for the baby.

1170
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,282
You really did your best.

1171
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,453
I'm not sure what more…

1172
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:39,456
It may be possible theoretically,

1173
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:43,335
but I'm not sure
if it's the right thing to do

1174
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,380
for the sake of your baby.

1175
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,924
Frankly, I don't think it is.

1176
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,016
Professor Kim.

1177
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,778
Thank you
for your honest, objective opinion.

1178
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,122
We've been so torn.

1179
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,959
My husband is against it too.

1180
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,633
Thank you.

1181
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,178
Thank you.

1182
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,689
So she didn't come here to ask you
to accept her baby as a patient.

1183
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:31,944
Right.

1184
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,412
-Hello?
-Dr. Jang, we have a new ER patient.

1185
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,665
A female, age 60.
Traffic accident injuries.

1186
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:48,168
There's no external bleeding,
but the CT scan shows a liver laceration.

1187
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,586
I'm coming now.

1188
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:58,679
The liver is lacerated,
but there's no hematoma around the liver.

1189
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,847
The vitals and the lab results aren't bad.

1190
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,599
Let's see how it goes.

1191
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,851
Let's list her as NPO
and move her to the ward.

1192
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,604
She's a trauma patient,
so let's check for other injuries.

1193
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:10,566
Check for orthopedic
and neurosurgical issues

1194
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,858
and let me know.

1195
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,026
Will do.

1196
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,404
Excuse me!

1197
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,824
Isn't there a doctor here?

1198
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,535
My child had a seizure!

1199
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:23,787
How come no one will help us?

1200
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,748
Are there no doctors here?

1201
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,417
Ma'am.

1202
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:32,087
Sorry. Please calm down.

1203
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:38,468
We just checked,
so please wait just a bit longer--

1204
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,762
How much longer do I have to wait?

1205
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:46,727
Doctor, please examine my baby first.

1206
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,814
I think it was a febrile seizure.
The temperature was 40 degrees Celsius.

1207
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,192
What if something bad happens to my child?

1208
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,653
Please examine my baby now.

1209
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:00,115
Okay, we'll have a look
as soon as we can, so please--

1210
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,327
When? I want it done right now!

1211
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,710
Dr. Kim, right?

1212
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,519
I'm sorry? Which department?

1213
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,605
Pediatrics.

1214
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:34,107
Kim Ha-eun.
I went to high school with her.

1215
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,485
She's a second-year
Pediatrics fellow at Jae-an.

1216
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,738
I heard she was on
maternity leave after her second baby.

1217
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,449
I guess she lives right by Yulje.

1218
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,202
My gosh.

1219
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,372
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1220
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,395
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1221
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:26,720
Here.

1222
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,389
There you go.

1223
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,235
Let's go.

1224
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:55,081
Have you seen my garden?

1225
01:19:56,583 --> 01:20:02,297
It's filled with chrysanthemums, roses

1226
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:09,888
And beautiful salvias in full bloom

1227
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:15,227
The door to my garden is always open

1228
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:20,941
And the beautiful scents
Are calling your name

1229
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:25,946
Do you know that?

1230
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:31,660
My childhood dreams

1231
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:39,292
And the beautiful autumn sky
That resembles my dreams

1232
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:47,968
When you come to me

1233
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:52,222
Hand in hand with all my dreams

1234
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:56,434
Through the serene moonlight

1235
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:04,276
I will give you the flower of my love

1236
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:12,158
That I grew with my tender heart

1237
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:27,883
CHOGANGDONG CATHEDRAL

1238
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:37,350
My childhood dreams

1239
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:44,858
And the beautiful autumn sky
That resembles my dreams

1240
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:53,909
When you come to me

1241
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:57,412
Hand in hand with all my dreams

1242
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:02,500
Through the serene moonlight

1243
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:06,087
I will give you

1244
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:10,508
The flower of my love

1245
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:15,263
That I grew

1246
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:20,435
With my tender heart

1247
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,010
Hello?

1248
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,637
Is this Ms. Jang Gyeo-ul?

1249
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:59,057
-Yes, speaking.
-Ms. Cho Sun-yeong is your mother, right?

1250
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:01,977
Yes.

1251
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,940
This is Suhan Medical Center in Gwangju.
Your mother is hurt. Please come now.

1252
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:11,736
We have to go into surgery now.
Can we obtain your verbal consent?

1253
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,821
Surgery?

1254
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,802
What was it? What was my door code?

1255
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,976
What is wrong with me?

1256
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:06,499
This is my first time calling it
a night without a single drink

1257
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,043
at a school reunion.

1258
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:10,211
I know.
It's nice to go home not feeling tired.

1259
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,632
MY EVERYTHING

1260
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,302
Hi, U-ju. I'm on my way home now.

1261
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,137
I know you miss me, but hang in there.

1262
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,223
Dad, fried chicken! I want fried chicken.

1263
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,685
Yes, sir. I'll order some right away.

1264
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,437
U-ju, can I talk to him?

1265
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,440
Hey, are you on your way home now?

1266
01:24:30,523 --> 01:24:32,442
There's a tent bar
right across the street.

1267
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:34,819
Can you pick up
spicy jjajangmyeon from that place?

1268
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,821
Too bad they don't deliver.

1269
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,699
Ik-jun, don't forget. Okay?

1270
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,868
All right,
I'll pick it up on the way. Bye.

1271
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,787
It's me, Gyeo-ul.

1272
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,998
Something's come up,
so I have to go to Gwangju.

1273
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,085
I'll tell you more later.

1274
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,546
I can't talk on the phone now.

1275
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:36,923
I'll tell you later…

1276
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,385
I'll tell you everything later.

1277
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,720
I'm really sorry.

1278
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:59,339
-Did you eat?
-I may not be able to call you often.

1279
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:02,300
I probably won't be able to
text you back right away too.

1280
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,551
I'm sorry.

1281
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:06,179
Turn the car around.
We're going to Yangpyeong.

1282
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:08,890
I've been forgetful for a while now.

1283
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:10,433
What's wrong with me?

1284
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:12,852
It's getting worse. What should I do?

1285
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,688
How could I not know? I'm her son!

1286
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:19,651
Song-hwa. It's pretty bad, right?

1287
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,404
I like it because
it helps me escape reality.

1288
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,908
So live everyday to the fullest.

1289
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:31,913
I do want to go to Mount Seorak. It's been
over 20 years since we last went.

1290
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:34,332
We're not going to climb
the dinosaur ridge, right?

1291
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,210
-You're taking next Tuesday off?
-Yes. It's my mom's birthday.

1292
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,338
Min-ha, you still have

1293
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,882
one more chance.

1294
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:51,766
